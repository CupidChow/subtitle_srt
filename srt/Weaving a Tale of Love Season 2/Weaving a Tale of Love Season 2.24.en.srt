<i>[Episode 24]</i>

3
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:38,272
Look at this,

4
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:39,360
I'll take these beads,

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,240
Okay…

6
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,700
Ni, did you bring the money?

7
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,712
Yes,

8
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,744
Madam, madam,

9
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,620
Keep these beads for me, I'll be right back,

10
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,800
Okay…

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,920
I will be right back,

12
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,860
My lady,

13
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,700
Take a look…

14
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,620
My lady,
if you want to know Minister's whereabouts,

15
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,180
wouldn't it be easier

16
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,380
to put one or two trusted confidants
in Minister's mansion?

17
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,940
Why only send people to probe
from a distance outside his mansion?

18
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,800
Just like today, we suddenly knew
that Minister had come to the workshop,

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,220
We were in such a rush to hurry over,

20
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,160
I had some informants in Minister's mansion,

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,580
In the recent month,
they have been sent away for various reasons,

22
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,420
I fear that Minister might have known the truth
and has become wary of me,

23
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,460
I dare not take risks randomly,

24
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,400
Come, take a look,
This is a fine piece of agate, Have a look,

25
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,600
Where are the beads?

26
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,060
I'm really sorry,
I've already sold that string of agate,

27
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,620
Sold? But I said I wanted to buy it,

28
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,940
How could you sell it?

29
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,340
You were gone for so long,

30
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,620
I thought you had changed your mind,

31
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,300
It just so happened someone wanted it,
so I sold it,

32
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,000
To whom did you sell it? I'll offer double,
Triple,

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,820
No, I'll offer ten times the price,
Find it for me,

34
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,560
My lady, you are really humorous,

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,660
Xizhou is so big, He bought it and left,

36
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,420
Where on earth should I go
to look for it for you?

37
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,220
Yunyi, Yunyi, open the door, Yunyi,

38
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,656
Yunyi,

39
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,740
open the door first, Yunyi,

40
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,540
My lady, what shall we do?

41
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,820
Tan, keep an eye on Yunyi for me,

42
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,660
Please take a moment to recall,

43
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,320
Who was it that bought the beads?

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,220
Was it a man or a woman, and how old was he?

45
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,220
Was he a Han or a foreigner,
and what was his accent?

46
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,440
This person was about twenty years old,
a Han, man,

47
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,340
I can't quite tell his accent,

48
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,920
but he was dressed brightly,

49
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,740
He bought quite a lot of jewelry
from me in one go,

50
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,480
He really bought a lot,

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,620
So I even gave him a considerable discount,

52
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:01,500
Na, is my makeup appropriate?

53
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,780
Even in a hurry to go out,
you are extremely beautiful,

54
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,240
Now I even have to go after him to the workshop

55
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,100
to meet Minister,

56
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,000
Minister Minister is busy with official duties,

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Fortunately, both Protector-General
and Madam Qi treat you well,

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,860
hoping to get you two together,

59
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,020
<i>[Qu's Residence]</i>

60
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,080
Be careful,

61
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,020
My lady, Minister Minister has instructed
that you cannot go in,

62
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,460
How dare you! What relation does my lady have
with the Protector-General?

63
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,060
How could you stop her from visiting
Minister Minister at the workshop?

64
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,700
Please calm down, my lady,

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,500
This workshop is full of laborers
doing heavy work,

66
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,460
I'm afraid that if you go in

67
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,140
and meet with an accident,
it will be hard for us to explain,

68
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,600
So we can't let you in,

69
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,220
Please forgive me, my lady,

70
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,300
Please don't make it difficult for me,

71
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,560
Lady Zhang, Lady Zhang,
Minister really instructed

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,900
not to let you in,

73
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,560
Lady Zhang, Lady Zhang, please listen to me,

74
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Minister really won't let you
enter the workshop,

75
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,920
Lady Zhang, Lady Zhang,
please don't make it difficult for me,

76
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,260
Please don't go any further,

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,752
Lady Zhang, Lady Zhang, Minister,

78
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,100
Greetings, Minister,

79
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,896
Say it,

80
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,060
What do you want for me?

81
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,440
I…

82
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,620
If there's nothing else, you may leave,

83
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,700
A few days ago, I went to visit
Protector-General and Aunt,

84
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,380
They both praised

85
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,040
that the white fabric from Minister's workshop
is both fine and soft,

86
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,280
I'm very interested,
so I came without an invitation,

87
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,020
How did you get this white fabric of mine?

88
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,220
It was me,

89
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,020
My lady wished to make some socks and shoes
to pay respect to Protector-General and Madam Qi,

90
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,400
I heard

91
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,620
the new white fabric from Minister's workshop
is thin and soft,

92
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,700
so I took the initiative to take some
and give them to my lady,

93
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,260
You took the initiative,

94
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,700
If there is a next time, I won't let you live,

95
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,120
Minister, I heard that in the near future

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,140
the method of white fabric weaving
is to be promoted to the people of Xizhou,

97
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,900
I also want to offer some help,

98
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,500
Okay, then come to the workshop
to learn from tomorrow,

99
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,740
Assisting in promotion in the future
is also considered a merit,

100
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,000
I will surely study hard and not disgrace you,

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,140
From tomorrow, you will pick her up
and ensure her safety,

102
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,232
Yes,

103
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,140
Thank you, Minister, for your concern,

104
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,220
<i>[Zen Hall]</i>

105
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,460
Your concubine mother has arrived,

106
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,824
Here,

107
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,820
It's this again?

108
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,460
You did not drink yesterday,

109
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,760
The doctors said that you need to drink this
every day for your own good,

110
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,140
Take it away,

111
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,060
Chongyu, keep an eye on your father
and make sure he takes this medicine,

112
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,460
My wife

113
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,960
takes everything seriously,

114
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,860
How could you fully believe
what those doctors say?

115
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,340
Concubine mother is indeed a careful person,

116
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,860
Chongyu, it's about time for you
to get married too,

117
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,020
Minniang is about the age--

118
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,952
It's hard to support a woman,

119
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,740
I don't want to deal with them every day
when I come home,

120
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,500
Not to mention, things are not going well now,

121
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,780
Take the medicine,

122
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,540
It tastes so bad,

123
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
Then let me feed you,

124
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,860
I'll drink it myself,

125
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,660
You are a careful person too,

126
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,700
You also take everything seriously,

127
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,240
How could you go on without eating or drinking?

128
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,660
Since yesterday, my lady has not
had a moment's rest

129
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,780
to find that string of agate beads
for you, You are…

130
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,872
It's okay,

131
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,288
Tan, where is my lady?

132
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:52,576
My lord, my lady…

133
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,160
What happened?

134
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,780
It's all because of Lady Ashina,

135
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,380
Yesterday, my lady kindly asked Ni
to accompany her for a walk to clear her mind,

136
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,060
Who knew she seemed to be under some spell

137
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,000
and took a liking to a string of agate beads,

138
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,500
but when she went back to buy them,
she was delayed by getting the money,

139
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,860
and it was sold to someone else,

140
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,100
After coming back, she cried and made a fuss
for two days, not eating or drinking,

141
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,020
It was my lady who suffered,

142
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,700
She went to find the string of beads for her,

143
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,300
What kind of beads is it?
Why does she have to have it?

144
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,260
I don't know, She won't say,

145
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,704
Shouyue,

146
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,700
My lady, I heard about Madam Ashina's affair
from Tan,

147
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,740
It's just a string of beads,
Why have you been running around for two days?

148
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,780
Don't spoil her too much,

149
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,660
Where can you find this string of beads
in such a big Xizhou?

150
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,500
I have found the person who bought the beads,

151
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,980
You really found the person
who bought the beads?

152
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,820
Don't be anxious,
Let my lady take a sip of water,

153
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,540
I asked the stall owner in detail,

154
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,340
He said that the one who bought the beads
was a young Han man,

155
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,780
He bought a lot of jewelry from him,

156
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,740
That Hu merchant was selling

157
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,560
jewelry with a strong western characteristic,

158
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,080
He was a Han, and he bought a lot,

159
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,540
It was most likely that he was a businessman,

160
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,180
He buys the characteristic jewelry here
and takes them to Chang'an

161
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,500
to sell them at a high price to those

162
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,240
noble households who enjoy exotic things
to play with,

163
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,820
So I asked Sister for help

164
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,800
to investigate one by one at the inn
where Chang'an merchants often stay,

165
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,340
Indeed I found it,

166
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,880
Where are the beads then?
Did you see the beads?

167
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,420
He bought a lot of those things,

168
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,660
How would I know which one
you are interested in?

169
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,140
But rest assured, He is a businessman,

170
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,700
As long as you can afford the price,
he will sell it to you,

171
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,240
I came back to take you to identify the beads,

172
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,860
Okay, let's go now,

173
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,100
Why are those beads so important to you,
Lady Ashina?

174
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,100
It was a personal item
that my father wore for decades,

175
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Every time he wore it into battles,
he would win,

176
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,740
Our tribe regarded it as a holy relic,

177
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,020
But I secretly took it to go hunting

178
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,260
and accidentally lost it,

179
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,900
Not long after, my father lost a battle,

180
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,900
The Nishu Tribe was annihilated by Ashina Helu,

181
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,460
Clansmen were killed or sold,

182
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,260
I also got separated
from my father and my clansmen,

183
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,860
I often wonder
if I didn't lose the sacred object,

184
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,180
maybe the Nishu Tribe would not
have been destroyed by those thieves

185
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,340
and the clansmen would not have been
displaced and homeless,

186
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,460
Madam, if you can help me find the beads,

187
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,460
I will listen to you in all matters
in the future,

188
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,700
I will never be willful again,

189
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,020
Yunyi, I will help you find the bead string,

190
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,220
The beads can be found again,

191
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,360
and you, your father, and your tribe

192
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,020
will definitely reunion one day,

193
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,700
Don't be anxious, Keep looking,

194
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,904
No,

195
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,688
No,

196
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,900
None of these are the beads,

197
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,100
Is there anything left out?

198
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,420
There is something that is not here,

199
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,140
But we don't sell it,

200
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,880
Please let us have a look,

201
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,360
Maybe it's what my sister is looking for,

202
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,440
This,

203
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,728
It's it,

204
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,140
It's it, How much will you sell this bead?

205
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,208
Whatever you ask for, I'll take it,

206
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,300
I'm really sorry,

207
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,660
My wife took a liking to this bead
as soon as I brought it back,

208
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,800
We are newlyweds,

209
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
I promised to give her a piece of jewelry
she likes as a token of our commitment,

210
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,980
But this is my--

211
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,064
Yunyi,

212
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,880
since it's a token of commitment
to your beloved one,

213
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,420
it is naturally priceless,

214
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,220
As a husband, you must not take back a gift
for money,

215
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,780
Nor is it proper for a wife to

216
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,300
transfer the token of commitment
given by her husband to another woman,

217
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,140
It is rare to see you two living in harmony,
with a relationship stronger than gold,

218
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,880
I should not have any more improper requests,

219
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,980
It's just that this string of beads
was her father's beloved treasure,

220
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,200
She got separated from her father
and lost this object,

221
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,940
That's why she is so anxious,

222
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,540
If you could give us this string of beads,

223
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,020
it would be counted as a good deed,

224
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,760
After all is said and done,
you still want to get these beads back,

225
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,060
Even though I am a businessman,

226
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,500
I cannot disappoint my lady for money,

227
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,100
You've misunderstood,
This item is so meaningful,

228
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,700
How could it be bought with money?

229
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,400
Since this item cannot be sold,

230
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,580
I will exchange it with something else,
What do you think?

231
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,768
- Exchange?
- Exchange?

232
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,780
Wait for a moment, I'll be right back,

233
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
Wait for a moment,

234
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,800
Shouyue, I want to discuss something with you,

235
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,780
Liuli, why are you back?

236
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,700
Don't rush, Take it slow,

237
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,140
The pair of jade pendants that Empress Wu
gave us,

238
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,380
I want to exchange them for something,

239
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,940
We have worn this pair of jade pendants
for many years,

240
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,340
When you're not by my side, having it with me

241
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,020
is as comforting as if you were here,

242
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,940
These jade pendants are indeed very precious,

243
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,100
but after all, they are just objects,

244
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,780
Even if we don't have this jade,

245
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,860
my love for you will never fade away,

246
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,940
But now, to give it to someone else,

247
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,660
I'm hesitating,

248
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,580
Foolish Liuli, in the past, gentlemen
likened virtue to jade,

249
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,180
Now the love between you and me
is even greater,

250
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,700
Even if I no longer wear this jade at my waist,

251
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,020
being able to use it to fulfill someone else's
wishes is also a fine tale,

252
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,216
Then I'll go,

253
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,984
Slow down,

254
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,176
This pair of jade pendants

255
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,220
is the wedding gift from the current Empress
to me and the Senior Official,

256
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,800
We each wear one, never parting with them,

257
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,100
If you like them,

258
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,500
we will gift this pair of jade pendants to you,

259
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,380
Wish you a harmonious union
and a happy marriage forever,

260
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,660
Such valuable jade pendants,

261
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,060
Congratulations on your wedding,

262
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,220
Use this pair of jade pendants
as tokens of commitment,

263
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
is the most auspicious and fitting,

264
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,460
Thanks for your kind thoughts,

265
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,620
If we refuse again,
it would be too stingy of us,

266
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,312
Thank you,

267
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,064
Here,

268
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,220
Now, the item
has returned to its rightful owner,

269
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,260
Wish you will reunite with your father soon,

270
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,300
Enjoy parental love and share family bliss,

271
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,180
Thank you for your help,

272
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:52,900
<i>[Superb Craftsmanship]</i>

273
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,984
Slow down,

274
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,940
These threads are spun very well,
They are even and fine,

275
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,680
You actually tried it out, How did you do it?

276
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,180
I dare not hide it from you, Madam,

277
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,340
We… We also don't know how it was made,

278
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,420
Since the arrival of summer,

279
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,460
spinning thread
has become more and more difficult,

280
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,320
But sometimes it is easier than usual,

281
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,480
Last night, it was exceptionally easy to spin,

282
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,820
It continued to be so until this morning,

283
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,620
The threads are even and white,

284
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,260
The fabrics woven
are also uniformly fine and smooth,

285
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,260
But after just over an hour,

286
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,580
it was gradually the same as before,

287
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,620
We thought about it for half a day
and still did not understand the reason,

288
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,900
We had no choice but to trouble you
to come here,

289
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,120
Did you use the same white fabrics
as those of the past?

290
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,940
Has there been any changes
to the weaving machine?

291
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,780
I've certainly thought about that,

292
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,300
I've also carefully checked again,

293
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,180
Where is there half a difference from usual?

294
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,540
<i>Indeed, it's about the thread,</i>

295
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,660
<i>But why is it sometimes good and sometimes bad?</i>

296
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,660
Have any of you thought about
what the reason might be?

297
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,060
Even random thoughts don't matter,

298
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,000
One man's thoughts are limited,

299
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,380
If you still can't think of anything,

300
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,300
you can ask everybody in this yard,

301
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,260
Let's take note of any ideas

302
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,340
and take a look at them one by one,
Maybe we can get inspired,

303
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,280
We have already discussed and of course,
there are various opinions,

304
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,460
A few days ago, there was one day
that was slightly better than others,

305
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,740
Someone said it was because
a Bodhisattva was worshipped that day,

306
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,840
But the next day, despite more worship,
nothing changed,

307
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,980
Some said it was because of the hot weather,

308
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,180
But upon closer inspection,

309
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,100
the brighter the sun,
it seemed the harder it was to weave,

310
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,900
If you say it's better to weave on rainy days,

311
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,940
yet last night's rain didn't last very long,

312
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,800
and it dried up in the blink of an eye,

313
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,820
but it was still easy to spin,

314
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,160
Today, there was not even a drop of rain,

315
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,100
and the first half of the day was still good,

316
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,260
<i>That's right, it's just like that,</i>

317
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,040
<i>It's easy to spin on rainy days,
It remains humid after the rain stops,</i>

318
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,060
<i>so it can</i>

319
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,460
<i>continue for a while,</i>

320
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,900
These were my wild thoughts,
I must have made a fool of myself,

321
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,660
I wonder, after half a day,
if my lady has any valuable insights,

322
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,680
I wouldn't say valuable,

323
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,080
There's just one thing I'd like to ask you,

324
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,260
What is it?

325
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,460
There's really nothing much,

326
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,900
This coarse white fabric weaving method
is now quite easy,

327
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,840
But if this fine white fabric
becomes easy to weave,

328
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,920
I wonder what you plan to do,

329
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,100
I certainly hope that everyone in Xizhou knows

330
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,660
the weaving method of coarse white fabric,

331
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,360
But even if ordinary people knew

332
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,900
the weaving method of fine white fabric,
it wouldn't be of much use,

333
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,080
If one day, fine white fabric is easy to weave

334
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,880
I will open a bigger workshop

335
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,340
specializing in weaving fine white fabrics,

336
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,860
If so, I have a method to make
this fine white fabric

337
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,200
easy to weave every day as yesterday,

338
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,920
The production can be
several times higher than the present,

339
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,820
I wonder if you are interested,

340
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,900
Please teach me, Madam,

341
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,620
I wouldn't say teach,

342
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,140
It's just that I suddenly realized something,

343
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,540
The reason it is not easy to weave
fine white fabric in this workshop

344
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,580
is because of the poor Feng Shui,

345
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,100
Therefore, if a place with suitable Feng Shui
can be found,

346
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,100
weaving fine white fabric
will be a piece of cake,

347
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,220
Madam Kudi even understands Feng Shui?

348
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,380
That's really something,

349
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,780
Could there really be a problem
with this workshop?

350
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,460
I wonder what's wrong with it,

351
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,740
I only have a cursory knowledge of Feng Shui,

352
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,060
It's just that no one had thought about it
this way before,

353
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,100
There's nothing wrong with the workshop
and your methods are not wrong,

354
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,000
It's just unsuitable for weaving white fabrics,

355
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,640
You have to move to another location,

356
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,940
May I ask, Madam,
where would be a suitable place?

357
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,300
If it concerns the affairs
of Protector-General, so be it,

358
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,680
Since you wish to open another workshop
on your own,

359
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,980
choosing a location is of great importance,

360
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,860
Please allow me to think it over,

361
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,220
Madam, feel free to speak,
I am willing to present a fortune as a gift,

362
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,500
We can discuss this later,

363
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,900
Indeed, I have a matter at hand
that requires your assistance,

364
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,620
I hope you could make an exception,

365
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,820
Madam, what do you need me for?

366
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,100
There's no need to worry about
this minor matter,

367
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,940
It's just a small favor for you,

368
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,820
I would like to borrow Grandmaster Li

369
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,260
and a few craftsmen in this courtyard
for a few days,

370
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,340
You go first,

371
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,320
Yes,

372
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,440
Please,

373
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,420
May I ask, Madam,
do you want to open another workshop?

374
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,420
Why would I, a woman, open a workshop?

375
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,300
It's just my cousin of the An family,

376
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,780
She is interested in some small items I made,

377
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,640
I would like to ask Grandmaster Li
and his craftsmen to help me make them,

378
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,660
If they are busy, I can find someone else,

379
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,820
It's my fault,

380
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,360
This fine white fabric is so successful today,

381
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,380
More than half of the credit goes to you,

382
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,760
If you want to have your kin open a workshop,

383
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,660
it naturally all right,

384
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,740
It's just that, I hope you know

385
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,140
that the greatest taboo is
to let it be known to others,

386
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,300
Even if Sanniang of the An family is very calm,

387
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,740
there might still be intermediaries
with other motives,

388
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,540
Therefore, I'm afraid this news will run viral,

389
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,000
Madam, please consider thoroughly,

390
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,220
When did I say I wanted to open any workshop?

391
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,580
Excuse my boldness, Madam, I dare to ask again

392
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,380
where exactly is the land
with suitable Feng Shui?

393
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,260
If the workshop is set up, I am willing
to give 30% to you,

394
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,140
Forty percent is also okay,

395
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,220
I'm really embarrassed that you are so polite,

396
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,620
Then I'll thank you for this,

397
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,260
So would you now tell me

398
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,380
where exactly is this place?

399
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,520
The valley,

400
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,848
The valley?

401
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,180
Feng Shui tells us only when there is
wind and water can everything go smoothly,

402
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,220
The workshop must be built
near the water in the valley,

403
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,700
It's rather easy
to build a house in the valley,

404
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,180
You might as well give it a try,

405
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,480
If it doesn't work,

406
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,900
how could I brazenly take your 40% profit?

407
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,940
You are making fun of me, Well then, I'll try

408
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,420
building two wooden huts between the valley,

409
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,780
I've said everything,

410
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,700
I wonder when Grandmaster Li has time?

411
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,616
Now that the matter is settled, Madam,
will you still have Grandmaster Li

412
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:34,840
make a reel or a loom for the An family?

413
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,660
What do you mean by that?

414
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,500
I simply agreed to my sister

415
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,620
to make two high stools with backs for her,

416
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,380
That object is not ordinary

417
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,620
so I have to bother Grandmaster Li,

418
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,740
It's only for the high stools with backs?

419
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,040
No wonder you first mentioned a fortune

420
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,576
and then changed to something like 30% or 40%,

421
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,820
You always worry so much,

422
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,660
How dare I not be careful speaking with you?

423
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,380
Otherwise, who knows if one day my business

424
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,620
would be yours,

425
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,300
Alright, since you need Grandmaster Li,

426
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,440
just summon him at any time,

427
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,700
Then I'll thank you on behalf of my sister,

428
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,224
No need,

429
00:30:31,044 --> 00:30:34,624
<i>[Rising Sun and Forever Moon]</i>

430
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,780
<i>[Diligent in the Morning, Cautious at Dusk]</i>
Shouyue, since you returned from the battle,

431
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,020
you always have a serious look on your face,
Was it very dangerous?

432
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,420
Now mentor is in charge of
escorting supplies in the Western Army,

433
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,980
I suppose there shouldn't be any danger,

434
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,860
Even if the Western Army is led by Su Haizheng,

435
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,060
Mentor should not be responsible for
escorting supplies,

436
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,120
The Western Army has gathered forces from
Yizhou, Tingzhou, and Xizhou,

437
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,180
There are a total of 30,000 elites
from these three states,

438
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,540
But even though mentor is in charge of
the vanguard,

439
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,660
apart from the few hundred elite soldiers
brought from Chang'an,

440
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,820
there is no one he can use,

441
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,740
Su Haizheng claimed that
supplies are the foundation of victory,

442
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,660
And he hoped that mentor would be responsible
for the escort,

443
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,620
But in fact,

444
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,620
He doesn't want to give mentor any chance
to fight in the battle,

445
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,060
The battlefield changes in an instant,

446
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,500
Not everything can be arranged by others,

447
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,100
Whether it's you or mentor,
you always have to prepare more,

448
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,520
Gold is bound to shine, Mentor will

449
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,820
reveal his talents
once he enters the battlefield,

450
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,136
That's right,

451
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,780
The supplies are generally well managed now,

452
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,980
Tomorrow, I will go out
to deliver some supplies to mentor,

453
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,460
Aren't you in charge of
managing the supplies in the rear?

454
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,740
Why do you need to escort the supplies there
personally?

455
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,860
You need not worry, Everything has gone
very smoothly this time

456
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,100
I just want to take a look,

457
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,420
Is there anything I should prepare for you?

458
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,500
Rest assured, Liuli,

459
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,100
With mentor,
there will certainly be no problems this time,

460
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,220
The Naxilu army is up against the Helu,

461
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,180
I actually want to see

462
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,180
what exactly is the northern cavalry like,

463
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,700
This time, Cheng will come along,

464
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,220
Gu will still stay at home,

465
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,060
Don't go out of the city these days,

466
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,260
If there's anything, just leave it to Gu,

467
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,600
Are you escorting the supplies alone?

468
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,540
Or with other colleagues?

469
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,780
I invited Minister Qu to go together,

470
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,180
<i>[One month later]</i>
<i>Su Dingfang escorted supplies with Pei and Qu</i>

471
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,940
<i>They reached Yingsuochuan Valley and
encountered a forty-thousand army of the north</i>

472
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,320
<i>Pei went ahead with the soldiers
to lure the enemy</i>

473
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,180
<i>Su led the soldiers to ambush</i>

474
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,260
<i>That night, they met the enemy, Pei set fire
to the supplies and carts to pretend to retreat</i>

475
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,320
<i>Afterwards, the Tang troops formed a formation
and attacked the enemy in surprise</i>

476
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,500
<i>The northern army fled in disarray</i>

477
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,660
<i>Su and Pei not only conserved most of
the supplies at the smallest cost</i>

478
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,860
<i>but also delayed the enemy's reinforcement</i>

479
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,180
<i>providing the greatest support for
the Tang Army's main force</i>

480
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,104
Father has merit,

481
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,180
But now, the three armies are lined up
and can't defeat the enemy to obtain supplies,

482
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,760
And as the weather gets colder, it's more
difficult to replenish the horses' fodder,

483
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,820
<i>[Pine and Cloud Mansion]</i> We can't afford
any more mistakes in terms of supplies,

484
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,900
Therefore, I want to stay and assist you,

485
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,820
<i>[Settled in Taishan]</i>
I plan to return to Xizhou before December,

486
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,460
If there are any problems,
call for Minister Qu for help,

487
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,340
I think I'm on the verge of death,
uncertain of how to make this better,

488
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,344
Deep autumn is upon us, you need to
take care of yourself and be thrifty,

489
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,500
This letter is given to me
by the Senior Official to pass on to you,

490
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,780
He is still assisting in coordinating
military supplies at the army warehouse,

491
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,960
So I returned first,

492
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,180
Thank you,

493
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,760
I wonder if General Su
and Shouyue are doing well now,

494
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,980
Everything is still in order
at the military camp,

495
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,020
General Su and Shouyue are doing well,

496
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,380
Madam, Senior Official has intentions,

497
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,100
From next year, the fabric that the people
of Xizhou use to pay their tribute

498
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,700
can be replaced by white fabric,

499
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,060
Protector-General will
issue a proclamation afterwards,

500
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,300
Now the workshop

501
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,380
will hurry to make hundreds of sets of
padders and slingshots,

502
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,920
I will later send someone with the decree
to distribute these items

503
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,020
to the village head's home
of each township in Xizhou,

504
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,880
Your invention

505
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,380
is truly a great deed for the people of Xizhou,

506
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,560
The padder and slingshot
are both new inventions,

507
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,440
I want to go myself

508
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,500
to teach these villagers how to use it,

509
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,060
You want to do it personally?

510
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,820
This indeed has done me a great favor,

511
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,380
To tell you the truth,

512
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,500
although Xizhou had this white fabric early on,

513
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,060
it was mostly made by the officials,

514
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,820
It is rarely done by the common people,

515
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,340
Currently, the taxation of Xizhou

516
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,220
will use white fabric to replace silk,

517
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,580
For these farmers in Xizhou

518
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,240
this is a major issue
concerning their livelihood,

519
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,740
There will mostly be some doubts,

520
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,180
But now Senior Official's prestige is high

521
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,740
and you will demonstrate personally,

522
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,140
I'm sure the people of Xizhou will soon
dispel these doubts,

523
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,660
Feel free to make the arrangements,

524
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,020
On behalf of the people of Xizhou,
I'll thank you,

525
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,300
I do not deserve such a grand gesture,

526
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,420
Once I've made proper arrangements,
I will send someone to pick you up,

528
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,080
Sister,

529
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,820
Minister, this is my younger sister, Yunyi,

530
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,180
Yunyi, this is the Minister
of Protector-General of Xizhou,

531
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,584
Greetings, Minister,

532
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,100
Sister, Minister has come over to our house
as a guest,

533
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,220
Shouldn't we invite him to stay for a meal?

534
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,968
Minister brought messages and letters

535
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:58,060
from Mr, Pei from the military camp,

536
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,500
We can invite Minister for a meal

537
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,860
when he comes home, There's no rush,

538
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,440
Did you just come back from the military camp?

539
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,820
How's the situation there?

540
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,660
Did the Tang army kill that villain Helu?

541
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,900
The situation on the front lines
is rather smooth,

542
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,740
General Su and Shouyue have also
achieved quite a bit,

543
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,180
But we still need to wait for the right time
to capture the enemy leader,

544
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,560
So,

545
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,220
did we win or lose?

546
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,100
Yunyi, Minister just returned from
the military camp and he is exhausted,

547
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,420
We should not disturb him further,

548
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,740
How about asking him in detail later on?

549
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,580
I will take my leave first,

550
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,200
This person is quite handsome,

551
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,260
It's just that his speech is similar to that

552
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,060
of the aunt selling silk across the way

553
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,620
<i>[Pei's Mansion]</i>
There were no straight answers,

554
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,180
What on earth did he mean?

555
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,060
Madam Senior Official has already agreed to
assist us with all her might

556
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,020
with the matter of
promoting the white fabric weaving method,

557
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,460
Okay, I'll take care of it,

558
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,580
Do you still remember the first time
we met Pei Xingjian?

559
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,820
The woman in red
who was humiliated by Mi Dalang,

560
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,180
The clothes were red, right?

561
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,340
I saw her again today at
Senior Official's residence,

562
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,660
Kudi claimed that this was her younger sister,

563
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,580
She must have forgotten
that we had met once before,

564
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,440
But why did she deceive me?

565
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,860
Junmeng, help me look into this woman,

566
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,620
Go quickly,

567
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,224
Chongyu,

568
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,600
The days you were away,

569
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,980
I thought of you night after night,

570
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,620
Especially that day

571
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,100
I heard that you encountered the northern army,

572
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,800
- Father
- I almost, I…

573
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,300
Haven't I come back?

574
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,860
Yes, it's good that you came back,
It's good that you came back,

575
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,180
Tell me quickly,

576
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,420
Why did I hear

577
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,900
that you encountered more than ten thousand
troops from the north?

578
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,100
Not ten thousand, It was twenty thousand,

579
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,020
The soldiers you brought
were less than two thousand,

580
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,820
And you need to protect the grain carts,

581
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
What exactly was the method you used

582
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,260
to defeat these twenty thousand wolf soldiers?

583
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,980
Was it the reinforcements sent by Governor Su?

584
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,780
Governor Su and his son
would probably prefer us to die there,

585
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,340
How could they send reinforcements?

586
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,740
Two thousand against twenty thousand,
This is impossible!

587
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,180
The disparity in military strength was huge,

588
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,500
We could not overpower the enemy,
We must outsmart them,

589
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,980
<i>[Zen Hall]</i>
I don't know what strategy you used--

590
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,140
It wasn't my strategy,

591
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,580
It was Shouyue and General Su Dingfang,

592
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,540
During this military expedition,
in times of crisis,

593
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,140
all I thought about was the present,
about self-preservation,

594
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,080
whereas Shouyue saw that
these twenty thousand northern soldiers

595
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,980
were surely a severe problem for the Tang army,

596
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,700
Therefore, he chose to burn down supplies

597
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,100
and design a trap to use two thousand
against twenty thousand,

598
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,340
Break the cauldrons and sink the boats
and fight a do-or-die battle,

599
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,392
I admire,

600
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,820
I am not as good as him,

601
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,120
Huh?

602
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,248
What?

603
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,900
Chongyu, although this time

604
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,900
you failed to establish fame and merit,

605
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,900
you have already seen where the gap lies,

606
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,700
A gentleman should constantly strike to become
strong just like the evolution of the universe,

607
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,100
and cultivate to become tolerant
just like the earth bears everything on it,

608
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,928
I firmly believe in you,

609
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,580
You will surely lead Xizhou
to its former glory in the future,
