00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,955
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,471
Besides, if it wasn't for sister,

4
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,811
how could we've met,

5
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,211
and how would you have treated me well?

6
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:45,011
These words are indeed true.

7
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,951
I just don't like the way she talks.

8
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:49,771
I can't be bothered to talk more with her.

9
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,131
Am I…

10
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,851
made a mistake again?

11
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,531
It was my mistake.

12
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:04,096
You always

13
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:07,771
do right things.

14
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,731
Then how did you know

15
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,451
what Lady Zhang told me?

16
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:18,371
If I don't even know this,

17
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,811
I'd be afraid that

18
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,891
even more people would consider me
as a sitting duck.

19
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:26,811
If you don't eat now, it will get cold.

20
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,152
Is it tasty?

21
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,251
This portrait

22
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:48,091
doesn't look like Chongyu either.

23
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,531
Sister, how about you

24
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:06,051
draw me another Kitchen God portrait
that resembles Chongyu?

25
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,871
Why?

26
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:11,091
Do you want to put up a Kitchen God portrait

27
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:12,211
like Chongyu over your own stove?

28
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,711
I want to hang it in the study room.

29
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,451
Now, there's only one painting
on the wall of the study.

30
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:21,091
It looks a bit lonely.

31
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:24,471
The portrait that you drew of the Kitchen God
that looks like Chongyu,

32
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,051
I indeed kept it in good care.

33
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,251
But it was not framed,

34
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,491
now, it has become old.

35
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:37,851
What are you laughing at?

36
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,031
Nothing, I just imagined,

37
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,351
in your study,

38
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:43,931
next to that fine brushwork painting of a lady,

39
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,651
there's a Kitchen God painting being posted.

40
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,871
Chief Administrator,
there's an imperial edict from Chang'an.

41
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:08,896
Present it.

42
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:09,984
Yes.

43
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:33,131
The imperial edict from His Majesty says

44
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:35,931
the military sources in the east are strained.

45
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:39,631
In Western Regions,
if there are uprisings of evildoers,

46
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,491
the focus should be on pacification.

47
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:43,531
Rash use of military force is not permitted.

48
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:46,631
Even if you have to,

49
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,511
it's better
to let barbarians fight against each other.

50
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,051
Cherish the people's strength.

51
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:53,371
Do not let the border residents be discontent.

52
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,491
Without military force

53
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,651
and military provisions,

54
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:01,431
how to seize Pei Xingjian

55
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,571
and Qu family?

56
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:09,411
Besides,

57
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,291
the scout

58
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:13,891
had a secret report today,

59
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,131
saying that the Qiuci rebels

60
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,491
have already fled away.

61
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:21,376
There is no enemy

62
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,871
to fight.

63
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,331
But how can it simply offset

64
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:29,411
the death of my six hundred private soldiers?

65
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:34,011
Yesterday,

66
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,491
an envoy from Khan Jiwangjue came to report,

67
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:40,051
In the past six months,

68
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:43,771
Khan Xingxiwang has close contacts with Turpan.

69
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,411
The troops under his command

70
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,131
have shown considerable movements recently.

71
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm afraid,

72
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,691
it might be disadvantageous to our army.

73
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,144
Chief Administrator,

74
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:00,571
if it were someone else

75
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,911
saying that Khan Xingxiwang has rebelled,
it would be fine.

76
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,251
But the words of Khan Jiwangjue

77
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,811
must never be trusted.

78
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:08,651
Everyone in the Western Regions knows,

79
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:11,871
he and Khan Xingxiwang
are of the same bribe, but they are hostile.

80
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,891
He has shot and killed dozens of
Khan Xingxiwang's kinsfolk.

81
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:16,771
There is a blood feud between them.

82
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:20,051
I was the Prefectural Governor of Shazhou
twenty years ago.

83
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:23,171
I've been stationed at the frontier
for over twenty years.

84
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:25,131
So you were saying,

85
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,271
my judgement of the situation
is not as good as yours?

86
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:32,448
I wouldn't dare.

87
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:36,491
Pass my order.

88
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,392
His Majesty

89
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:41,691
sent an imperial edict to the camp.

90
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:45,691
Khan Xingxiwang

91
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:48,431
and Kunling Protector-General's Mansion

92
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:51,171
are loyal to the country,
and performed outstanding military exploits.

93
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,231
Therefore,

94
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:55,011
there are 20,000 rolls of cloth

95
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,211
granted to all of you.

96
00:07:57,571 --> 00:07:59,591
Please ask them to come early
the day after tomorrow,

97
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:02,496
to pick up the rewards at the camp gate.

98
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:03,680
At your command.

99
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,768
- Yes.
- Yes.

100
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:12,711
After I catch them off guard,

101
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:15,231
killing the Khan Xingxiwang

102
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,731
and Ashina Mishe,

103
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,491
then I will let Nanjin catch Pei Xingjian
and others.

104
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:21,991
Once the situation gets chaotic,

105
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:25,091
even if His Majesty wants to cease the war,

106
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:27,971
he will have to follow my arrangement.

107
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:33,611
Over these years

108
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:35,971
Lady Jing has always been helping Minister
manage Qu Family business.

109
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,371
Now this business is growing ever larger.

110
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:40,351
You are so busy every day,

111
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:41,771
and yet today you've still come to help.

112
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,931
We will have decent food.

113
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:46,851
Why are you still being so polite with me?

114
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,691
Today is the December twenty-third,
the day to make offerings to the Kitchen God.

115
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,451
We need to prepare gifts
for exchanges among the various households.

116
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,451
Brother and the Senior Official
will come over for lunch at noon.

117
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,251
Brother worries that Madam can't manage alone,

118
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,931
asked me to come over and help.

119
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,371
Minister is still the more thoughtful one.

120
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:11,911
Why Chongyu and brother-in-law

121
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,411
have not back yet?

122
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:18,211
Half a day without seeing Chongyu,

123
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,651
you're eagerly awaiting his return.

124
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,731
I've already sent a servant to inform them

125
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,171
that the meal is ready.

126
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,931
Your Chongyu will be here soon.

127
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:40,800
What are you going to do?

128
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,951
We follow the military orders of Chief Administrator Su
to arrest the accomplices of the rebel.

129
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:50,131
Listen, soldiers of the Xizhou garrison,
lay down your weapons,

130
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,331
Hand over the Senior Official and Minister.

131
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,891
Or else, no mercy shall be shown.

132
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,371
Don't listen to their nonsense.

133
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:55,411
Who are the accomplices of the rebels?

134
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,291
All we need to do
is to protect the Senior Official and Minister.

135
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,871
You bastards, don't be presumptuous.

136
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:00,011
Sanlang is right.

137
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:01,471
Protecting Minister and the Senior Official

138
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,611
is our duty.

139
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,744
Away!

140
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:31,904
Ziyu,

141
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:34,048
please make it clear,

142
00:10:34,931 --> 00:10:36,091
who is the traitor,

143
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,571
and who are the accomplice of the traitor.

144
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:49,971
This is a military secret.

145
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:51,211
I regret that I have nothing to say/

146
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:55,131
I'm acting on the military orders
from the Chief Administrator

147
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:56,331
to take both of you to him.

148
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,651
Please don't resist any further.

149
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:00,411
When seeing the Chief Administrator,

150
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,571
there will be justice.

151
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,251
Well, are you intending to frame me
with unfounded charges

152
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,331
to capture me and the Senior Official
all in one go?

153
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,931
Fine, I would like to see,

154
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:16,051
can you do as you please
in this Governor's Mansion?

155
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:21,771
Since you two
dare to defy the Chief Administrator's order,

156
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,371
then don't blame me for being heartless.

157
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:29,536
Take them down.

158
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,136
Who dares to move?

159
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,611
Lady, something has happened
at the Governor's Mansion.

160
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,051
Madam, the Governor's Mansion…

161
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:50,811
the Governor's Mansion has been surrounded
by soldiers

162
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,731
Those soldiers are not from Xizhou.

163
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:54,951
What on earth happened?

164
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:56,291
How are Chongyu and brother-in-law?

165
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,391
Did you see them?

166
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:58,432
No.

167
00:11:58,432 --> 00:11:59,488
The gates and walls of the Governor's Mansion

168
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,011
are completely sealed off.

169
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,931
Those hundreds of soldiers
in armor and carrying big swords

170
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,911
look as fierce as demons.

171
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:07,391
They say they are from the border army,

172
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,191
ordered to clean up the remnants of the rebels.

173
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,431
No mercy for the resistors.

174
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:11,971
I dare not approach,

175
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,171
then hurried back to report.

176
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,211
The frontier forces of the Tang Dynasty
have surrounded the Governor's Mansion.

177
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,331
There must be something wrong with Su Haizheng.

178
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,271
He is merciless,

179
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:22,051
he will use any nasty tricks.

180
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,371
Let's go and take a look.

181
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:26,400
Okay.

182
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:32,491
Troops of Xizhou garrison, listen.

183
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:34,091
Lay down your bows and swords,

184
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,811
and follow the orders
of Chief Administrator Su Haizheng.

185
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:39,771
I only know to obey orders and guard Xizhou.

186
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,431
If you want me to lay down my bow and sword,

187
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:43,931
only if Governor Qu gives the command.

188
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,491
Do you dare to defy
the Chief Administrator's military orders?

189
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,251
What, do you think
you are the only one with a knife?

190
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,971
You want me to lay down my bow and knife
to be a sitting duck,

191
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,611
then ask
if the knife in my hand is willing to agree.

192
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:01,440
Stop.

193
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:06,528
Everyone stops.

194
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:10,971
Advisor Su is having a pleasant conversation
with the Senior Official and Minister inside.

195
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,351
- Advisor Su.
- What are you doing here?

196
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,011
These soldiers from Xizhou garrison
are audaciously bold,

197
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:17,051
daring to defy the military orders
of Chief Administrator Su.

198
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,211
Captain Zhou, please be patient and calm.

199
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,064
Captain,

200
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:28,091
I wonder if you have any objections
to Chief Administrator's military order.

201
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:31,751
Chief Administrator Su sent people to Xizhou,

202
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,211
they should enter aboveboard.

203
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:36,211
Why send a squad first,

204
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,931
with the excuse of reporting military affairs
to enter the city

205
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,311
and detain the city's defenders,

206
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,371
then let the main force enter the city?

207
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:42,611
You are acting so surreptitiously.

208
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:44,091
and assaulted someone.

209
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,051
And now you want us
to lay down our bows and swords,

210
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,471
to let you slaughter at will?

211
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,544
Bah!

212
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:50,971
Captain, you have misunderstood.

213
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,071
Our coming here to Xizhou,

214
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:55,011
is by orders
to investigate the rebels' accomplices.

215
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:57,571
We couldn't reveal any information in advance.

216
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,851
Thus, we had no choice
but to act in this manner.

217
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:04,251
A military order is inviolable.

218
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,291
If there is any presumptuousness,

219
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,331
please understand.

220
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:11,291
It's just that
Chief Administrator does have a military order.

221
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,091
The soldiers of Xizhou garrison,

222
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,771
they should obey Captain Zhou.

223
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:17,651
If you insist on disobeying the order,

224
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:20,451
you must know that military law is ruthless.

225
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,771
If it is prosecuted in the future,

226
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:26,491
I'm afraid
Governor Qu may not be able to protect you.

227
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,571
Master Su.

228
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:47,691
I am an official appointed by the court.

229
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,351
Although subject to Chief Administrator,

230
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,091
but my life and death,
appointment and dismissal,

231
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,211
it's not up to him.

232
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,811
You want to arrest me today,

233
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:00,051
unless you have a decree from His Majesty.

234
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:01,811
Otherwise,

235
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:03,011
without any reason,

236
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:04,831
you want Qu to follow you

237
00:15:04,831 --> 00:15:06,091
and leave Xizhou,

238
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:09,171
excuse me for not being able to comply.

239
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:17,371
And for these prefectural soldiers
and officers,

240
00:15:18,011 --> 00:15:19,851
how about you ask them,

241
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:21,371
are they willing to let me go with you,

242
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,171
or not.

243
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,051
We'll deal with future matters in the future.

244
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,211
Not seeing the Governor,

245
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,611
you want us to lay down our weapons,

246
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:35,616
no way.

247
00:15:42,011 --> 00:15:44,491
Halt! Who goes there? Stand back!

248
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:51,680
Madam.

249
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,331
They are the personal guards of Chief Administrator
and the frontier soldiers of Yizhou

250
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,311
Just now,
they wounded the soldiers guarding the city,

251
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:58,336
and seized control of the city gates.

252
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:00,171
And now,
they have surrounded the governor's residence

253
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:02,211
saying to catch the rebellious accomplices.

254
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,051
So, it's the wife of Senior Official.

255
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:08,191
Madam, your identity is precious.

256
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,451
This place is not suitable for Madam
to stay for long.

257
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:13,691
I hope Madam will take good care of yourself.

258
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:14,771
Leave quickly.

259
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:16,851
Thank you for the guidance, Advisor.

260
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:19,051
I just want to ask a question,

261
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:20,551
who is the rebel?

262
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:22,371
And who is in league with the rebels?

263
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:24,331
Why has the investigation reached Xizhou?

264
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,071
This is a military secret.

265
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,411
Allow me not to disclose that.

266
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,331
All in all, there are rebels causing chaos
in the Western Regions now.

267
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:36,331
The rebel leader has been executed
on the spot by the Chief Administrator.

268
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,331
To avoid any affiliates causing chaos
in various states,

269
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:43,131
Chief Administrator has specially ordered us
to take over the troops in Xizhou.

270
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:45,504
Hope Madam

271
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:48,771
persuade these soldiers
to put down weapons in their hands.

272
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:50,891
At this critical moment,

273
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,171
they resist military orders,

274
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:55,031
doesn't it make the Governor

275
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,291
hard to defend himself?

276
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,664
Father-in-law,

277
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,451
don't stoop to his level.

278
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,411
Your health is important,

279
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:06,871
You should hurry back and rest.

280
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:08,451
Leave this to me to handle.

281
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:12,051
Now is not the time to rest.

282
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,131
These bastards have already here.

283
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,251
I definitely cannot let them get
what they want.

284
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,511
Father-in-law.

285
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,031
Such things have happened,

286
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,291
both Senior Official and Minister

287
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,791
must have arrangements.

288
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,211
At this moment, it is most important for you
to take care of your health.

289
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,531
Never, never act on impulse.

290
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:35,751
You are the pillar of Xizhou.

291
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:37,271
If you were to fall,

292
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:38,971
what would happen to Xizhou?

293
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:44,051
I'm begging you, my father-in-law, please go.

294
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:49,632
Let's go.

295
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,411
Let's go, father-in-law.

296
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:01,291
Please forgive me,
there's still something I don't understand.

297
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:04,111
I wonder what the intentions are
with this inspection.

298
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:06,651
Is it to conduct an inspection
of all the states in the Western Regions,

299
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,651
or is it just Xizhou to be inspected?

300
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:11,331
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,251
I regret that I cannot divulge any information
on this matter.

302
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:15,411
If Adviser is unwilling to tell, it's fine.

303
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:18,131
Think about that,

304
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,891
the Chief Administrator commands
hundreds of government offices of Western Regions.

305
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,111
If every government office

306
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,411
were to dispatch so many soldiers
to investigate the rebels,

307
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:27,251
there's no energy
to go on a military campaign then.

308
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:29,851
Moreover, Advisor come to Xizhou this time,

309
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:31,731
you first seized the city gate,

310
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,851
and then immediately surrounded
the government office,

311
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:37,151
obviously you believe that,
inside the Xizhou Governor's residence,

312
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:38,771
there were accomplices of the rebels.

313
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,811
Given that,

314
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:43,091
the Governor had long been unable
to defend himself.

315
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,851
Whether the Xizhou garrison soldiers
lay down the weapons or not,

316
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:47,571
it's meaningless now.

317
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,451
What does the rebel accomplices

318
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:55,831
have to do with Xizhou?

319
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:58,131
You want to detain
the Senior Official and Minister,

320
00:18:58,131 --> 00:18:59,211
what exactly are you going to do?

321
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,216
Dare to ask,

322
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:02,784
Miss,

323
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,731
are you Lady Ashina?

324
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:06,560
What if it is?

325
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:10,651
May I ask which part of the north are you from?

326
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,451
I am from the Nishu Tribe, what about it?

327
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:17,291
I see, my apologies.

328
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,976
Advisor Feng,

329
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:22,011
she has not seen her elder brother
for a long time.

330
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:24,931
I wonder if Advisor Feng,
prior to arriving here,

331
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,491
had the chance to meet the generals
from the Nishu Tribe?

332
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:29,952
I have not seen them.

333
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:34,171
I wonder if you have seen Khan Xingxiwang.

334
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,551
Madam,

335
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,091
do you know Khan Xingxiwang?

336
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,971
Khan Xingxiwang,

337
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,211
of course, I am quite familiar with him.

338
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:49,311
Speaking of which, six years ago
when Khan Jiwangjue came to Xizhou,

339
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,531
he sent Senior Official several tiger skins.

340
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,891
Khan Xingxiwang might have some trouble.

341
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,611
Just now, Advisor Feng mentioned that,

342
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:10,691
the rebel leader has been brought to justice.

343
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:12,791
Could it be that Su Haizheng

344
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,711
madly killed

345
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,171
a Khan who's well-known in Western Regions?

346
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:08,611
I believe that

347
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:11,331
something is happening outside.

348
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,611
Who are the rebels

349
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:16,691
that they are talking about?

350
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:19,371
Probably, it's the Qiuci rebels

351
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:20,531
or the Turpan spies

352
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:22,651
knowing that you and your father
were planning a rebellion,

353
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:24,651
so they intended to bring you
to the military to confront

354
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,251
Of course, you wished to defect and escape.

355
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,331
So they were executed on the spot.

356
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,011
As for me, the Senior Official

357
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:34,831
was either negligent and not inspecting,

358
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:35,971
or knowing the truth but not reporting it.

359
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,171
In the end, most likely, I'd suicide myself
out of fear of punishment.

360
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,211
In summary, it's what Minister says,

361
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,392
giving a dog a bad name, then hang him.

362
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:54,251
Then they are so underestimating Qu's family

363
00:21:55,971 --> 00:21:57,211
and you too.

364
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:05,632
Captain,

365
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,971
you know what charge it is

366
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:10,016
to disobey military orders.

367
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:12,871
It's all right
if you are fearless and don't fear death.

368
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:14,171
But don't you care about

369
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:16,651
the life and death of your soldiers?

370
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,491
Advisor Feng,

371
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:26,771
Is Chief Administrator Su Haizheng

372
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,891
intending to fabricate crimes

373
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,811
and indiscriminately
to kill government officials,

374
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:32,351
and urging soldiers to rebel?

375
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,611
You have such a lot of nerve,

376
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,431
without any evidence,

377
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:36,971
you dare to defame the Chief Administrator
by saying he is plotting a rebellion?

378
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:39,071
You think my knife

379
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:40,691
truly never killed a traitor?

380
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:44,651
I'd like to see,

381
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:45,651
what do you got,

382
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,151
dare to commit murder in front of me?

383
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:49,531
Okay, so everyone is really turning rebellious.

384
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:29,971
You are funny.

385
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:31,811
What do you mean by
'everyone is turning rebellious'?

386
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,491
What is meant by 'without any evidence',

387
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:35,091
and 'defame the Chief Administrator
by saying he is plotting a rebellion'?

388
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,051
I would like to ask,

389
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:39,591
you take over the city with your troops,

390
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:40,731
and surround the government's building,

391
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,304
do you have any evidence of crime,

392
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:43,904
or any imperial edict?

393
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:48,131
If not,

394
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,251
aren't you also

395
00:23:50,251 --> 00:23:53,131
accusing Xizhou officials
of rebellion with no proof?

396
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,491
You can do it.

397
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,211
Why can I not say?

398
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,551
You must know, this is Xizhou,

399
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:00,131
it is the Xizhou of the Tang Dynasty,

400
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:01,611
not Xizhou of the Su's family.

401
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:04,651
The people of Xizhou are all subjects
of the Tang Dynasty.

402
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,571
not slaves of the Su's family.

403
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:09,611
Not laying down our weapons,

404
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:11,296
we're considered rebellion.

405
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:13,291
Laying down our weapons,

406
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,371
then we're up to you to slaughter.

407
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,131
Either way, it's a death.

408
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,011
On what grounds

409
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:20,091
should we let you
slaughter us like killing pigs and sheep?

410
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:24,331
Precisely, you people have no basis or evidence

411
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:26,571
to say that
the people of Xizhou are traitor's accomplices.

412
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:28,111
What do you think you are?

413
00:24:28,111 --> 00:24:29,931
You want to slander people the rebels

414
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:31,331
and kill them as your will,

415
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:33,091
do you think people of Xizhou

416
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:35,151
are all just livestock to be butchered at will?

417
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:36,531
Let's quickly go back and get our weapons,

418
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,371
teach these bastards a lesson,

419
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,691
let them know
what's the spirit of Xizhou people.

420
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,651
- Go go go.
- Grab weapons.

421
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:43,971
Do they even consider us as human beings?

422
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:45,088
This is too much.

423
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:47,451
- Grab weapons.
- Go quickly.

424
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,584
Advisor Feng,

425
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,491
what's going on
at the gate of the governor's mansion?

426
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:06,784
Madam,

427
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:09,371
you are also a lady of the official.

428
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:12,851
You know what kind of crime it is
to slander the superior.

429
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:14,931
If you dare to talk nonsense again,

430
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:17,731
don't blame me for offending.

431
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,371
May I ask Advisor Feng,

432
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,131
how did I slander the superior?

433
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:26,451
Xizhou is not your military camp.

434
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:29,951
Who granted so much power
to Chief Administrator Su

435
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:31,471
that he can
let his soldiers besiege government offices

436
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:33,171
without reporting to the court

437
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:34,691
to arrest senior officials of the third rank.

438
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:37,231
Everyone in Western Regions knows

439
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:40,051
Governor Qu entirely dedicated
in this military operation

440
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:42,571
to prepare food and military resources.

441
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,411
Minister Qu and Senior Official Pei
in order to protect the military resources

442
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,131
have just killed more than six hundred bandits.

443
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,371
Their merit is outstanding.

444
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:51,831
You accuse them of rebellion,

445
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,331
how absurd is that?

446
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:55,611
If they are also to rebel,

447
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:58,091
who in Western Regions can remain innocent?

448
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,451
If it weren't for your official robes and armor
of the Tang Dynasty,

449
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:05,771
who in the world could believe

450
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:07,551
you were to capture the rebels?

451
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:08,671
I'm afraid,

452
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:12,251
it seems more like you're here
to take revenge on those bandits.

453
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,571
What a nonsense.

454
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,651
If you think I'm speaking nonsense,

455
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:22,731
that's easy to say.

456
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,911
Why not ask Chief Administrator Su

457
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:26,011
to submit a detailed report to His Majesty,

458
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,571
and let the court have a look,

459
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:29,691
is he framing his subordinates,

460
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:31,171
or am I slandering the superior?

461
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:34,411
The court must surely be interested

462
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:37,531
in those hundreds of bandits
that suddenly appeared in Western Regions.

463
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,891
They might even more interested

464
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,651
that the bandits were coincidentally

465
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,971
from Khan Xingxiwang.

466
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,091
Do you agree?

467
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,571
I am just a woman.

468
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:56,931
And I have no interest in the bandits.

469
00:26:58,131 --> 00:26:59,851
As long as my family is safe, all is well.

470
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,011
But if someone insists on pressing us,

471
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,771
I'm not afraid of the deadly duel.

472
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:06,651
Anyway, today if I'm going to die in Xizhou,

473
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:10,451
there will be a noble person to avenge me
in the future.

474
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:13,851
If you're willing to risk your families' lives,

475
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:16,531
you can have a try.

476
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:25,571
Lady Kudi

477
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:27,591
once served the current empress

478
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:29,091
and deeply favored by her.

479
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:40,192
Madam Kudi,

480
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:42,611
I don't know what nonsense you're spouting.

481
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:48,071
How can you accuse such rebellious crime

482
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:50,691
on a Tang Dynasty official recklessly?

483
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:55,291
Please stop talking about such foolish notions
of raising troops and rebelling.

484
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:58,851
Senior Official Pei is well and good
in the governor's residence,

485
00:27:58,851 --> 00:27:59,931
no one dares to hurt him.

486
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,571
Now you are rambling here,

487
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:04,731
if causes any trouble in the future,

488
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,931
I fear
we won't be able to help Senior Official Pei.

489
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:13,691
Well said, Advisor.

490
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:16,971
How grave a crime it is
to be a rebel and traitor,

491
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:19,231
how can we tolerate those with ulterior motives

492
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,451
recklessly implicate important officials
of the court?

493
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:23,211
Advisor Feng surely won't,

494
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:25,531
I won't neither.

495
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,051
Madam Kudi indeed understands the situation.

496
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,491
Speaking of which,

497
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:33,696
Senior Official Pei

498
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,731
was a pillar of the Tang Dynasty in the past,

499
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:38,291
so naturally, he would not have any relations
with the rebels.

500
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,091
But as for Governor Qu and Minister,

501
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:44,531
there are something that needs them

502
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:46,611
to go to Chief Administrators tent with us

503
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:48,271
to explain.

504
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:49,331
You don't even think about it.

505
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:52,256
Exactly.

506
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,091
You can't even think about it.

507
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:58,171
- Let's go.
- Go. Go. Give it all out!

508
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,296
Put it all out!

509
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,352
Put it all out!

510
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:01,611
- Go.
- Hurry!

511
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:04,091
- Go.
- What are you going to do?

512
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:05,696
Go.

513
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,051
Advisor Feng is well-versed
in classics and history.

514
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:18,771
You should know
that everything has its own order.

515
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:20,171
The will of the people must not be defied.

516
00:29:20,171 --> 00:29:22,331
Whosoever understands the signs of the times
is a great man.

517
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:24,171
For some matters,

518
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:26,591
the truth will come out eventually.

519
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:27,771
Taking a risk out of desperation,

520
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:30,051
it might well lead to self-destruction.

521
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:31,691
How about stepping back

522
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:33,771
and giving ground?

523
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:35,931
Most importantly,

524
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:38,571
if you get used to

525
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,891
murder and silence someone,

526
00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:41,891
who knows

527
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:44,211
who will be the next in the future.

528
00:29:45,504 --> 00:29:46,531
In this world,

529
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:50,131
what is more important than one's own life?

530
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:54,208
Advisor Feng,

531
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:57,131
you'd better think it carefully,

532
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:58,411
and take care of yourself.

533
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,344
Advisor,

534
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,451
what should we do now?

535
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:16,411
I'm going to report to the young master first.

536
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,551
You guard the gates of Xizhou

537
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:19,971
and the front and back doors
of the governor's mansion.

538
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,131
Don't let anyone come out.

539
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
Yes.

540
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:33,911
Advisor Feng

541
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:35,251
is indeed a smart person.

542
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,651
Young master.

543
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:58,531
Advisor Feng just came to report.

544
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:00,631
On the wall outside the mansion,

545
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:03,171
there are Xizhou soldiers
holding bows and arrows.

546
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,711
If a melee really breaks out,

547
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:07,411
we may not necessarily gain any advantages.

548
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:10,491
Also, Lady Kudi has already figured out

549
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:12,731
both the matter of the banditry
and Xingxiwang's death.

550
00:31:13,611 --> 00:31:14,951
If we killed her,

551
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:16,291
I'm afraid,

552
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,331
the empress will…

553
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:19,851
So, what do you say?

554
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,011
Young master,

555
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:24,451
right now, every city gate in Xizhou
and the government office

556
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,871
are already under control.

557
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:27,291
In my opinion,

558
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,671
we should first control the Qu's family

559
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:30,371
and Pei Xingjian.

560
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,032
Master, don't forget,

561
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,851
Khan Xingxiwang had sent troops
to help the Qu's family.

562
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:36,711
The remnants of Xingxiwang

563
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,011
are either rebelling or fleeing.

564
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:40,051
Perhaps

565
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:41,671
they will come to Xizhou to report.

566
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:43,971
All we need to do
is to cast the net and catch them.

567
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:46,151
Then the Qu's family

568
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:47,491
would then be considered a conviction.

569
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:49,824
This is the first thing.

570
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,911
Furthermore,

571
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:52,411
those eminent families of Xizhou

572
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,131
are mostly quite astute
in understanding the times.

573
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:57,291
You only need to show them power
and entice them with benefits,

574
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,731
persuade them to surrender,

575
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:00,091
then this case will be airtight.

576
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:01,792
As long as there is evidence,

577
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:03,931
even if we cannot act now,

578
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:06,891
after Chief Administrator
suppressed the rebels,

579
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,491
and returned,

580
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:11,611
how could the small city Xizhou

581
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:13,091
resist to the end?

582
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,171
So be it.

583
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,211
Just let them live a few more days.

584
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:30,691
Madam, please go back to rest.

585
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:32,411
Leave this place to me.

586
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:33,984
Madam, you can rest assured.

587
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:35,811
We will not let the bastards prevail.

588
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:44,291
Thank you for your hard work, Captain.

589
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:47,051
It's just that
the current situation is uncertain,

590
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:49,451
Captain must keep your men in check,

591
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:50,811
don't cause conflict.

592
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,800
I understand.

593
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:55,931
Now, the Governor, Minister and Senior Official
are all trapped in the residence.

594
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:57,611
Unless it's absolutely necessary,

595
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:58,891
I certainly won't act rashly.

596
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,611
I wonder if you have any way

597
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,851
to send a message inside.

598
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:12,032
I have tried.

599
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,691
Now, there are people guarding along the wall
of the Governor's residence.

600
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,131
I'm afraid not even a mosquito can fly in.

601
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:23,360
Let's go back.

602
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:25,691
No, I won't go back.

603
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:27,591
I will wait here.

604
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,611
If Chongyu doesn't come out, I will not leave.

605
00:33:30,451 --> 00:33:31,971
What use is there if you stay here?

606
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:33,911
Let's send more people to guard here,

607
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,451
let them relay the message
as soon as there is any.

608
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:37,071
Why must you guard this place yourself?

609
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,144
Yunyi,

610
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:39,911
do you want to know

611
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:41,731
what exactly has happened,

612
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:43,491
and why Su's family

613
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:44,971
sent people here?

614
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:48,704
Sister,

615
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:50,451
what else do you know?

616
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,531
This is not a place to talk.

617
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:55,651
I'll tell you when we get back.

618
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:27,731
I have investigated clearly.

619
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,811
Now there are two hundred people
guarding the city gate.

620
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:31,491
There are about more than a hundred people
in the Governor's Residence.

621
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:32,811
There are about six hundred soldiers outside.

622
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:34,131
Besides, at the front doors
of Minister's Mansion,

623
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:35,531
the Governor's Mansion and the Su's Mansion,

624
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,608
there are dozens of people of each.

625
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:42,451
News of changes within the city
has spread to the outside.

626
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,131
Our people have sent urgent messages
to various places outside the city.

627
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:47,171
If nothing else,

628
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:48,731
the troops can arrive today.

629
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:51,451
After tomorrow, the government soldiers
from various cities and counties

630
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:52,491
will also arrive one after another.

631
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:01,971
Sister, what exactly happened today?

632
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:03,771
If my guess is correct,

633
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:06,811
Su Haizheng has already killed Khan Xingxiwang.

634
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:12,651
Now he wants to frame the Qu's family
for conspiring with Khan to rebel.

635
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:15,771
It's impossible,

636
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:18,371
how prestigious Khan Xingxiwang
is in Western Regions,

637
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:20,051
how could Su Haizheng have killed him?

638
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,391
And how dare he kill him?

639
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:24,011
No wonder that advisor has been asking
which tribe Yunyi belongs to.

640
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:25,731
So that's how it is.

641
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:38,691
These people, they even dare to kill the Khan

642
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:41,184
Then Chongyu…

643
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:43,791
What's the use if you go?

644
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,451
Yunyi, time like this,
you're still making a fuss.

645
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,711
With so many people guarding outside,

646
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,551
if Su Nanjin doesn't want to stake his life
in Xizhou,

647
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:53,671
then he wouldn't dare
to harm Minister in any way.

648
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:55,291
What's most important now is,

649
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,211
how to pass the message to them,

650
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:59,091
and also to understand the situation inside.

651
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:01,171
If you have time to stand guard
outside the door,

652
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:03,331
it's better to think of a solution with us.

653
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:05,731
But what kind of solution can I come up with?

654
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:10,336
There is a person,

655
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:13,851
perhaps he can go in.

656
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,400
Whoa.

657
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,091
Whoa.

658
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:33,472
[Su's Mansion]

659
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,491
What a rare visit.

660
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:56,411
Na, entertain them.

661
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:58,251
Ladies, please take a seat.

662
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,971
Speaking of which,

663
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:18,151
this is the first time that sister-in-law

664
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,571
that sister-in-law comes to our place.

665
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,331
I wonder what brings you here.

666
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:24,851
I wonder if Minniang knows,

667
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:26,791
your husband

668
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,251
brought people
to surround the Governor's Residence today.

669
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:30,571
The governor and your sworn brother

670
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:31,951
as well as Minister

671
00:37:31,951 --> 00:37:33,211
are still in the mansion.

672
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:35,011
We don't know how the situation is.

673
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,511
I'd like to ask you to consider the affection
of being siblings,

674
00:37:38,511 --> 00:37:40,431
to ask a question to Master Su,

675
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:42,051
what exactly is going on,

676
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,371
and when will they be able to return.

677
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:57,191
You really don't understand.

678
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,291
How would I know something like this?

679
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,131
I just vaguely heard the team outside
saying something.

680
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:05,891
This time, they aim to catch the companions
of the rebels.

681
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:08,211
Rebels.

682
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:09,851
This is a deadly crime.

683
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,371
Maybe someone's head will fall,

684
00:38:12,371 --> 00:38:13,411
it's still unknown.

685
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:16,791
Who is the rebel? Who will be beheaded?

686
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:18,331
What nonsense are you talking about?

687
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:20,951
Right, you're right.

688
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:22,051
I am indeed speaking nonsense.

689
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:23,971
Anyway, they are all insurgents.

690
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:25,531
What do them have to do with me?

691
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,371
If you don't want to hear these words,

692
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:30,651
I'll have the maid escort you out.

693
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:32,811
If you were late,

694
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,591
there's no time to collect the body,

695
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:36,091
then what should be done?

696
00:38:37,891 --> 00:38:39,411
Listen to what nonsense she was saying.

697
00:38:44,371 --> 00:38:45,691
What nonsense have I spoken?

698
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:47,296
You tell me then.

699
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:52,288
Minniang,

700
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,611
you just said

701
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:56,288
'Collect the body',

702
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,171
this is not something to be said recklessly.

703
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,971
I suppose I misspoke, right?

704
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,691
Just, why are you all so tense?

705
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:07,851
Can it be that in Xizhou,

706
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:10,071
there are really someone
colluding with the rebels,

707
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:12,371
and would be immediately executed
by the Chief Administrator?

708
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:18,091
After all,
Senior Official Pei is your sworn brother.

709
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,651
If you continue to speak nonsense,

710
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,411
don't blame me for getting annoyed.

711
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,288
Is that so?

712
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:33,051
Sister-in-law,

713
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:34,251
it doesn't matter if you're annoyed with me.

714
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:37,691
But now the life and death of him is uncertain,

715
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:41,131
you should save your energy,

716
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,731
in case anything happens to the sworn brother.

717
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:46,464
My lady,

718
00:39:52,251 --> 00:39:54,331
you keep calling Liuli 'Sister-in-law',

719
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:55,971
but what you've done is indeed despicable.

720
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:58,871
Father took you in
because he saw you were alone and pitiable.

721
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:01,011
But you are wholly focused on
being a social climber.

722
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:05,291
All these years, our family has raised you
as a proper lady.

723
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,931
Your treatments were no different from mine.

724
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,011
I thought you were a good person,

725
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:11,531
but now you turn around and bite us.

726
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:15,291
What a noble lady of Xizhou you are,
Lady Zhangmin.

727
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:18,411
You are nothing but just an ungrateful wretch
who burns bridges after crossing.

728
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:20,411
All the kindness over the years

729
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,371
cannot compete with the wealth and prospects
in your eyes.

730
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:27,488
Minniang,

731
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:29,531
do you realize your mistake?

732
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:41,011
Sister-in-law, your lesson,

733
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:44,091
Minniang will never forget this
in her lifetime.

734
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:47,171
One day, I will repay it twofold.

735
00:40:48,891 --> 00:40:49,984
You can't repay it.

736
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:52,491
You won't be able to repay it in this lifetime.

737
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:55,231
If you realize your mistake,

738
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:56,811
you should sincerely apologize.

739
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:59,731
Otherwise, you know too,

740
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:02,131
when teaching a lesson to someone,

741
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:04,731
your hand will be quite painful.

742
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,968
Shouyue,

743
00:41:44,971 --> 00:41:46,016
Chongyu,

744
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:48,011
can you step out for a meeting?

745
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,051
In this chilly wintertime,

746
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:53,571
why do you have such a refined taste?

747
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:56,096
Never mind.

748
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:59,371
Let us be with you.

749
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:12,371
Ziyu, have you had lunch yet?

750
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:16,128
I have eaten.

751
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,464
Good.

752
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:20,211
I wonder what did you eat

753
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:22,016
this afternoon?

754
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:26,371
Nothing but some ordinary soup and buns.

755
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:29,891
Xizhou government office is rudimentary.

756
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:31,531
We really neglected you,

757
00:42:32,371 --> 00:42:33,440
please accept my apologies.

758
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:41,472
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

759
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:48,000
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

760
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:52,320
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

761
00:42:52,896 --> 00:42:56,000
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

762
00:42:56,512 --> 00:43:01,248
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

763
00:43:03,136 --> 00:43:07,648
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

764
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,208
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

765
00:43:15,648 --> 00:43:19,040
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

766
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,528
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

767
00:43:22,528 --> 00:43:29,024
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

768
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:32,416
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

769
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:35,424
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

770
00:43:35,424 --> 00:43:38,976
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

771
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:42,080
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

772
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,312
♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫

773
00:43:45,312 --> 00:43:48,576
♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

774
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:51,936
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

775
00:43:51,936 --> 00:43:56,832
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫

776
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:15,040
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

777
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:22,592
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

778
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:26,159
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

779
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,455
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

780
00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:35,951
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

781
00:44:35,951 --> 00:44:39,343
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

782
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,639
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

783
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,063
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

784
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:49,295
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

785
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:52,527
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

786
00:44:52,527 --> 00:44:55,887
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

787
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:59,119
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

788
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,111
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫

789
00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:07,488
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

790
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:10,496
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

791
00:45:10,496 --> 00:45:13,935
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

792
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:16,896
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

793
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:20,719
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

794
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,567
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

795
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:26,944
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

796
00:45:26,944 --> 00:45:32,495
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫
