[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]

2
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,955
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:39,040
They all agreed.

4
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:43,872
Those people, originally,
take note of the situation.

5
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:45,412
Things have reached this point.

6
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:46,732
Presumably, even in their minds,

7
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,972
they still speak guilefully on both sides.

8
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:51,692
How dare they reveal this in front of me!

9
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:52,992
Not to mention,

10
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:54,852
this matter was originally not significant.

11
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:57,012
At this moment,
they are not recovered from their shock.

12
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,372
What can they do if they realize it?

13
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,812
This matter is only halfway done.

14
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:07,412
New hatred piled on old.

15
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:11,732
Even making Qu father and son and Pei Xingjian
lose their positions

16
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,092
is hardly enough to dispel the hatred
in my heart.

17
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:16,132
My lord, please calm your anger.

18
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,392
Gentlemen's revenge will not be late

19
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:20,772
after ten years.

20
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:22,652
About this matter,

21
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,412
we need to plan it step by step.

22
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,972
As the saying goes, haste makes waste.

23
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,012
But Senior Official Pei is very vigilant.

24
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,372
If he notices something amiss,

25
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:38,132
it would actually be bad.

26
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:43,292
Sir,
there's no need to boost someone else's morale.

27
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:45,992
If this Pei Xingjian is really alert,

28
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:48,092
he'll not just care about the immediate matters
at hand.

29
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:52,312
Once the grain collection is successful,
he gets dizzy with success,

30
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:54,512
ignoring these rich families in Xizhou,

31
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:56,052
and driving them into a dead end.

32
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:59,012
If it were not for this,
today's matter between you and me

33
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,612
would not have been so smooth.

34
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:03,312
But this Senior Official Pei

35
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:04,892
still has some skills.

36
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:08,132
But ultimately,
he is still a bit inexperienced.

37
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:11,332
He only saw our swords flashing,

38
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:14,372
but he doesn't know
that the focus of the sword is not here.

39
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:17,568
Therefore, my lord,

40
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,052
the better he takes this step,

41
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:23,012
the next step will leave him nowhere to go.

42
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:27,412
Why should you worry
that your plans will not succeed?

43
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:38,452
I invite you here today

44
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,092
to discuss

45
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:42,292
the matter of transporting supplies.

46
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,692
In various places of the Western Regions,

47
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:49,012
several thieves appeared causing trouble.

48
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:51,572
It is heard that the grain convoys

49
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:54,152
of Tingzhou and Yizhou

50
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,572
have suffered some losses.

51
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:58,572
There are currently 120000 dans
of grain in Xizhou,

52
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,072
20,000 pieces of cloth and silk,

53
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:01,612
and 10,000 pieces of winter clothing.

54
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:03,332
If they need to be transported
to the military warehouse,

55
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:06,212
how should they be transported?

56
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:10,412
I hope you all can discuss a foolproof plan.

57
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:21,972
Governor,

58
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:23,212
I remember

59
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:24,732
the military rations of Xizhou
in previous years

60
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,252
were all transported by merchants themselves,
and there was no problem.

61
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,532
We can still follow the old rules this year.

62
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,172
By the way,

63
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,612
Just, I heard recently

64
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:37,612
that Mr. Su has five hundred elite soldiers.

65
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:41,012
All are elite troops capable of
defeating a hundred enemies alone.

66
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:44,212
Recently, another five hundred robust recruits
have been enlisted,

67
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:45,452
training day and night.

68
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,892
If these thousand men were divided
among the various grain transport teams

69
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:52,132
with Mr. Su coordinating
and commanding overall.

70
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:55,772
The task of
transporting the grain would be very secure.

71
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:00,492
Mr. Su, what do you think?

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,132
Governor,

73
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:09,712
since I have come to the Xizhou,

74
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:11,072
of course I'll follow military orders,

75
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:12,332
and abide by the arrangements of the governor.

76
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,332
My lord, if you think

77
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,172
it's a good idea to
let the itinerant traders lead the troops

78
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:19,252
to the barracks?

79
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,892
I, as a subordinate,
naturally have no objections.

80
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,172
However, I've recently heard
that these thieves are very fierce.

81
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,672
The army just received an order
a few days ago from the Chief Administrator

82
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:29,772
when using troops in the depth of winter,

83
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:30,932
other matters could be dismissed.

84
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,772
These ten thousand winter coats
and twenty thousand pieces of cloth

85
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:34,852
are of utmost importance.

86
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,492
There must not be any mistakes.

87
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:38,932
If a detachment goes to the Xizhou,

88
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:41,132
most of the soldiers under my command must

89
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,012
follow the convoy of winter coats and cloth.

90
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,532
As for those five hundred strong soldiers,

91
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:48,632
they're originally the troops of all households
in Xizhou.

92
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:50,972
I have merely made slight training.

93
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,972
They should be dispatched by the governor.

94
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:04,372
Governor,

95
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:07,332
the matter of this centralized scheduling
is of great importance.

96
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,772
Mr. Su is not familiar with
the itinerant traders.

97
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:12,872
He is also not very familiar with
the topography of Xizhou.

98
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,052
Therefore, I'm afraid
he will find it difficult to take on this task.

99
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:17,892
I hope the governor can assign someone else
who is competent.

100
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:25,600
I understand.

101
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:28,012
So,

102
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,532
Mr. Su just transports the military supplies
to the arsenal,

103
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:32,812
and he doesn't take care of anything else.

104
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:36,212
Such a coincidence.

105
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:37,772
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

106
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,212
You make us happy for nothing half the day,

107
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:43,212
thinking that
we wouldn't worry about the transportation.

108
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:45,752
If we had known this earlier,

109
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,172
at your feast back then,

110
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:48,732
I should have let you drink more.

111
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,292
Otherwise,

112
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,292
you have taken all the good luck
since you came to the Xizhou.

113
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:53,732
It would be a pity

114
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,488
not to get drunk.

115
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:58,852
Chongyu,

116
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,492
stop joking.

117
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:02,612
We should focus on discussing serious matters.

118
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:06,932
The Chief Administrator's military orders
are clearly written

119
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,172
Mr. Su's visit

120
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:10,612
is to assist the Governor.

121
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:12,852
The so-called assistant

122
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:15,092
is to cooperate and support him.

123
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:18,212
The raising and escorting of
military provisions

124
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:19,892
should be the responsibility of the Governor.

125
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:21,812
What virtues and abilities does the Mr. Su have

126
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:23,852
to bear the word, 'responsible'?

127
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,652
We would like to ask the Governor
to appoint someone,

128
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,572
so that we can arrange for soldiers
to assist with the escort.

129
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,772
Governor, Chongyu believes

130
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:36,932
since Mr. Su is unwilling to divide his troops,

131
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:39,052
given the additional threat of bandits
around the area,

132
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,412
then there's no need to split up the team
for transporting grain.

133
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:43,992
As for who should handle it.

134
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:47,612
Let's entrust it to Advisor. Zhang…

135
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:51,008
What is your name again?

136
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,012
Report to the governor.

137
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:57,232
I, as a low-ranking officer, am dull.

138
00:07:57,232 --> 00:07:59,592
I have never transported
grains and military supplies before.

139
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:00,692
I beg the governor

140
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,472
to choose someone more capable.

141
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:03,488
Advisor Zhang,

142
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:06,952
you have worked with Mr. Su in Xizhou

143
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,492
perfectly.

144
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,012
Do you know if transporting grains

145
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,932
is accomplished,
it will be a great achievement?

146
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,692
Such an opportunity is rare
in a thousand years!

147
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:16,372
It's more useful than any number of cousins.

148
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:18,912
I don't want to decline.

149
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:20,692
Because there're many carts
of foods and fodders,

150
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,652
about
how to arrange the travel and accommodations,

151
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,252
I feel uncertain.

152
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:28,572
I urge the governor to think again and again.

153
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:46,092
What are you all looking at
Senior Official Pei for?

154
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:49,824
Advisor Zhang,

155
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,372
how could there be in this world

156
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,492
things that one knows from birth?

157
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,972
There's always a first time for everything.

158
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:02,692
It can't be that
all the good things worldwide should be ours.

159
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:07,012
Let others do the hard and thankless jobs.

160
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:11,812
You are the descendant of a famous general,

161
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:14,072
born in Xizhou, and grew up in Xizhou.

162
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:15,752
Within the city of Xizhou,

163
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:17,452
when each family takes action,

164
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,412
they must listen to your words, Advisor Zhang.

165
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:23,732
In my opinion, this grain delivery matter

166
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:28,132
is still the most suitable to you.

167
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:34,692
I wonder what opinions you all have.

168
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:37,440
This…

169
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:46,012
Report to the governor.

170
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:48,152
The matter of guarding the grain
is of great importance.

171
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,152
I

172
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:52,052
wish to deliver the grain and fodder
to the army warehouse with Advisor Zhang.

173
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,012
Minister Qu, I'm not sure

174
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:02,052
whether you can,
under the smoke of battlefield,

175
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,652
have another heartily drink with me.

176
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,852
Over a thousand carts

177
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:49,132
requisitioned from merchants

178
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:52,252
carry grain, warm jackets and fabrics.

179
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:55,052
Once they get on the road
and the army begins moving.

180
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,232
I'm afraid it would be about 10 li long.

181
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,152
So many people! So much goods!

182
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:02,692
But there are only over a thousand guards
for the caravans.

183
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:03,732
How could that be enough?

184
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:06,656
You don't need to worry anymore.

185
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:08,544
The number of soldiers doesn't matter.

186
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:10,252
It's good to prepare for the rain
before it falls.

187
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,252
Among these more than a thousand guards,

188
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:16,232
there're five hundred elite soldiers
and five hundred troops.

189
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,972
They all follow the command of
Su Nanjin and Zhang Huaiji.

190
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:21,792
There're only wo to three hundred people

191
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,852
following your and Minister's commands.

192
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:25,652
How can you ask me to be at ease?

193
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,488
Chief Administrator.

194
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,292
The insurgent remnants have been dispersed
by our forces.

195
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:44,532
Our army, following
the Chief Administrator's plan,

196
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,052
is garrisoned to the northwest of Qiuci.

197
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,872
Now, we are just waiting for
the military provisions to arrive from Xizhou.

198
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:50,912
In another half month,

199
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:52,012
if the military rations don't arrive,

200
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:54,652
our division will withdraw from Tingzhou
on the grounds of lack of rations.

201
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:58,372
At that time, the officials who collected the grain
in Xizhou will be held accountable.

202
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:02,332
I will submit a report immediately

203
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,892
to take down that Pei Xingjian.

204
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:04,892
Slow down, Chief Administrator.

205
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,652
Chief Administrator,
Xizhou has sent a letter

206
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:11,252
that 200000 dans of military rations
have been dispatched and will arrive soon.

207
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:23,852
How could that be possible?

208
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,332
What does Ziyu have to say on this?

209
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:29,532
Advisor Su states that

210
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,172
he has already tricked Pei Xingjian and Qu Chongyu
to personally escort the provisions.

211
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:35,292
The two of them are accompanying the grain carts
with only five hundred followers.

212
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:38,452
Advisor Su has also dispatched
five hundred personal soldiers to accompany them.

213
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:40,172
They can provide support to
the Chief Administrator at any moment.

214
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,052
Pass on the order.

215
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,732
Tell Su Nanjin and Advisor Lu,

216
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,932
three days later,

217
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:58,172
cooperate with me inside and out.

218
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:01,032
Let the two of them go and never return.

219
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:02,048
Yes.

220
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:04,972
Mobilize my six hundred personal soldiers

221
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:06,832
and disguise them as horse thieves.

222
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:08,272
Once they see the grain convoy,

223
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:09,492
kill people and rob the grain.

224
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:10,592
Yes.

225
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,412
After it's done,

226
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,532
not a single one can be left alive.

227
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:23,232
Yes.

228
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,376
[The Great Hall]

229
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,292
What a coincidence.

230
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,172
Lady Min,
are you also here to pray for your husband?

231
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,612
Our husbands are on the battlefield.

232
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:30,452
Like Yunyi and Zhangmin, I'm naturally worried.

233
00:14:31,852 --> 00:14:33,252
Min,

234
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,212
two people from opposing families came to pray
before the Buddha.

235
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:39,212
Everyone is hoping for their own side to win
and the opposing side to lose.

236
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,772
Who do you think Buddha would help?

237
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,492
Why bring this up so abruptly out of nowhere?

238
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,452
The Buddha's heart is inclined
towards goodness.

239
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,172
Of course, he would help those
who are in the right.

240
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,952
If the wicked could understand this principle,

241
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,052
then Buddha would save a great deal of effort,

242
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:57,452
and could help
many truly deserving good people.

243
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,372
Lady Zhang, what do you think?

244
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:07,612
Min is going to pray and draw a fortune stick.
I'm leaving first.

245
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:17,252
Su Nanjin forced Chongyu and Xingjian
to deliver grains.

246
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:19,252
They must have set a trap for them
to fall into.

247
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,372
If she gets a good fortune stick,

248
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:23,852
wouldn't it be detrimental
to Chongyu and Xingjian?

249
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:26,932
Liuli, you must think of a solution quickly.

250
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:28,472
Let's see what fortune she's praying for.

251
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:29,672
If not,

252
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,812
I won't be able to sleep tonight again.

253
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,732
Please, master, interpret the fortune for me.

254
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,452
I do not know what you're asking for.

255
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:44,736
Myself.

256
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,532
Didn't you go to offer incense?

257
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:53,412
Are you deliberately following Min,

258
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,852
wishing to pry into Min's privacy?

259
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,852
This is indeed my fault.

260
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:00,872
Just now, you said it was for your husband
that you sought the fortune and blessings.

261
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,272
How could I suspect?

262
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:04,212
It's Yunyi who wants to draw lots for Minister.

263
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:08,012
If one lot is missing from the lot container,
the divination might be inaccurate.

264
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:09,472
That's why I hurried to come and get it.

265
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:10,612
Unexpectedly…

266
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,732
If there are any offenses,
please forgive me, Lady Min.

267
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:18,772
It's Min who's been abrupt.
Don't blame me, sister-in-law.

268
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:19,840
How could that be?

269
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:25,292
Seeing you so confident about Mr. Su
who is away on a campaign

270
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,652
actually makes me feel a lot at ease.

271
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:30,352
It is clear Mr. Su has a well-thought-out plan
for the grain delivery.

272
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:31,352
In that case,

273
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,332
Yunyi and I can also feel at ease.

274
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:39,772
Madam, aren't you here to draw lots?

275
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,280
Liuli.

276
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:48,372
Shouyue really has an accurate prediction.

277
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:50,292
Su Nanjin's intention is not in the wine,
as the saying goes.

278
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:52,012
Presumably, Lady Zhang Min

279
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,572
is also aware of the inside story.

280
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:56,452
Liuli, can you see what sign she's asking for?

281
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,172
She's asking for herself.

282
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:00,132
That is naturally a very bad sign.

283
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:08,712
Su Nanjin left on the way to deliver food
under a pretext.

284
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:12,052
Only Pei and Qu were left,
leading a small number of troops to continue on their way.

285
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:15,432
That night,
a large number of horse thieves invaded.

286
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:18,332
Fortunately, Pei Xingjian had anticipated this
and arranged defenses.

287
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,652
But the disparity in numbers was huge.

288
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:22,492
At the critical moment,

289
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:24,952
Fang Lie acts according to Pei Xingjian's
previous arrangement,

290
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:27,412
taking a thousand cavalry at the right time

291
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:29,172
to annihilate, with Pei and Qu together,

292
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:31,732
all the Su family elite soldiers
masquerading as horse thieves.

293
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:34,692
They secured the grain
and returned triumphantly.

294
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,132
Senior Official Pei, Minister Qu,

295
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:44,932
has the military food we are escorting

296
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:45,952
been stored in the warehouse?

297
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,512
Senior Official and Minister, rest assured.

298
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:49,692
The entire 200000 dans
of military rations have been transferred.

299
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,652
Su Nanjin saw that the matter was exposed.

300
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:53,252
He directly returned to Xizhou.

301
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:55,792
It was really too dangerous this time.

302
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,072
If it weren't for the two of you
with your ingenious calculations,

303
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,372
I'm afraid
we might have already been buried here.

304
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:03,992
Early the next morning,

305
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,072
the sky was still not bright,

306
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:06,252
but we could hear it from outside.

307
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:09,292
The sound of hooves was earth-shattering.

308
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,992
These aren't horse bandits.

309
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:12,692
At first glance, they are well-trained,

310
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,492
and veteran soldiers experienced in battle.

311
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:18,092
Each one of them
holding a crescent moon scimitar,

312
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,532
forming into a fan-shaped formation,

313
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:20,972
charged at us
like tigers pouncing on their prey.

314
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:23,052
They came killing with bared fangs.

315
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,072
Just then, the Chancellor pulled out a rocket.

316
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,392
He quickly drew his bow and shot,

317
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:28,992
hitting that grass wall right in the center.

318
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:31,892
All at once, it caught fire,

319
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:33,412
with flames lighting up the sky.

320
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:37,492
The great fire drove the band of thieves back,
not daring to come closer.

321
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,572
Just at this moment,

322
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,632
the military camp of eunuchs suddenly
fell into chaos again.

323
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:42,752
I turned around,

324
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:44,292
and saw that bastard Sui Lvshuai

325
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,612
and those soldiers under his command

326
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:47,132
riding horses, charged out.

327
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:49,492
They want to meet up with thieves,

328
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:50,892
breaking through our defensive formation.

329
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:56,232
At that time, the thieves charged into the camp
from three directions.

330
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:58,772
The fences that were set up were also breached
in several places.

331
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,532
But Su family's personal troops inside the camp

332
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,092
feigned confronting the enemy
and charged outward.

333
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,612
in reality, they were opening a passage
for the enemy to enter,

334
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:06,452
creating a pincer movement
from the inside and the outside.

335
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:10,572
At that time,

336
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:13,572
the Chancellor pulled out the third arrow,

337
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:16,852
drawing the bow to its full extent.

338
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:20,672
With a twang, he aimed at the clouds above.

339
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:22,892
Then we heard a sharp, piercing shriek.

340
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:26,152
I still haven't figured out
what the chancellor's

341
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:28,452
shooting at?

342
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:30,692
Then I saw the chancellor already charging out
on his horse.

343
00:19:31,852 --> 00:19:32,892
Just at this moment,

344
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:37,092
there was, far ahead,

345
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,532
a tremendous sound of horse hooves.

346
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:40,712
I looked up.

347
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,232
Behind the bandits,

348
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,632
there comes

349
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,972
thousands of war horses again.

350
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:47,072
Reinforcements.

351
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:49,312
However,

352
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,972
where did this reinforcement come from?

353
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,692
Among these more than a thousand guards,

354
00:19:57,452 --> 00:19:59,672
there're five hundred elite soldiers
and five hundred troops.

355
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:02,372
They all take orders from
Su Nanjin and Zhang Huaiji.

356
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:05,212
Only those who can follow
your and Minister's command,

357
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,252
are no more than two or three hundred people.

358
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:09,092
How can I be at ease with this?

359
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:13,932
Your husband is sharp-tongued
and hates being at a disadvantage.

360
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:17,332
You should just put your mind at ease,

361
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,292
waiting for my triumphant return with ease.

362
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,772
This is the letter I used to borrow troops
from Fang Lie.

363
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:36,572
I will dispatch someone overnight

364
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:37,652
to send this letter out.

365
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:40,412
You can rest assured now.

366
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:44,772
Only when you return safely

367
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,692
can my heart be at ease.

368
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:55,632
A cloud-piercing arrow.

369
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:58,292
Thousands of troops and horses come to meet.

370
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:01,252
About this group of reinforcements,
there are at least more than a thousand of them.

371
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:03,892
They are all not wearing any armor.

372
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:06,412
The color of their clothes
is also disorganized.

373
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:10,372
I originally thought
they were miscellaneous troops from somewhere.

374
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:12,092
But take a close look.

375
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,612
Their ranks are strictly organized.

376
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:14,892
They are as unstoppable as a bamboo shoot.

377
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:15,904
People from the north.

378
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:18,652
We all know the one who is leading.

379
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:20,612
Fang Lie.

380
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:26,972
Senior Official Pei,
you and I must co-sign on this matter,

381
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:28,132
report to the court as soon as possible.

382
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:29,952
There's no need for now.

383
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:33,132
As long as Su Haizheng insists firmly

384
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:34,872
that they're six hundred horse bandits.

385
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:36,732
Then you and I will be accused of
groundless criticism and defamation.

386
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:38,812
We cannot do anything about him.

387
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:41,092
We just need to return the heads of the bandits

388
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,096
to Su Haizheng,

389
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,332
seeing how he handles it.

390
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:49,452
You mean Chongyu and Xingjian

391
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:50,892
killed more than six hundred horse thieves?

392
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,932
But this is Xizhou.

393
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:54,532
Where did the more than
six hundred thieves come from?

394
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:59,012
Of course, Xizhou does not have
more than six hundred thieves.

395
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:02,932
But that Chief Administrator Su,
three days ago,

396
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:06,292
dispatched his three most capable
squads of personal troops

397
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,592
to eliminate the horse thieves,

398
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:10,052
but have not returned so far.

399
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:11,932
And,

400
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,892
these three groups of personal soldiers

401
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:16,132
seem to be more than 600 people.

402
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:18,812
You mean that

403
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:21,452
more than 600 people killed
by the Senior Official and Minister are

404
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,212
the elite troops of Chief Administrator Su.

405
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:35,012
About these 600 people,

406
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:39,052
it took me a full seven years,

407
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,732
with countless efforts,

408
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,692
to train.

409
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:47,012
They are the elite of the elite.

410
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:49,052
They're my men of honor.

411
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:53,452
But now, they become a pile of skulls.

412
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:03,572
Chief Administrator,

413
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:05,392
the Xizhou Governor's Office
has fortunately fulfilled its mission,

414
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:08,372
Also, Kunling Protector-General's Mansion
has also achieved remarkable results.

415
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:10,892
All thanks to
the great fortune of the Chief Administrator.

416
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:17,172
Minister, you have extraordinary
courage and strategy.

417
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,492
I am humbly inferior.

418
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,092
I heard that
you have annihilated the thieves all.

419
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:24,896
Could it be

420
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:27,852
not one left.

421
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:34,412
But there are

422
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,224
a few captives indeed.

423
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:39,812
Yet, these horse thieves are not rebels.

424
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:43,512
In addition, they were the captives
of the subordinates of the Khan Xingxiwang.

425
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:45,312
So they should be dealt with by them.

426
00:23:45,312 --> 00:23:46,552
I originally thought

427
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,372
they would take them back to their tribe
as slaves.

428
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:50,652
But that tribal leader said

429
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:52,132
these bandits from Xizhou

430
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:53,692
were originally extremely vicious and brutal

431
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,452
desperados who kill without batting an eye.

432
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:56,852
Even if they're given away as slaves,

433
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,132
they also afraid no one will dare to take.

434
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:00,032
So,

435
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:04,932
just keep a few.

436
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:06,272
Kill them all.

437
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:07,532
To prevent future troubles.

438
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:12,772
What about the few remaining people?

439
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,572
How did you deal with it?

440
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:19,252
I don't know about that.

441
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,052
But that commander

442
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:24,652
picked a few whose appearances seemed

443
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:26,312
honest and upright.

444
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:29,072
They said it was a gift for the generals
who had received them along the way.

445
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:30,112
The northern horses are fast.

446
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:32,172
They must be halfway there by now.

447
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,184
How come?

448
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,652
Are you interested in those prisoners?

449
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:42,688
Senior Official Pei,

450
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:44,672
Minister Qu,

451
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:47,292
you have had a tough journey.

452
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:49,932
Since the military funds have been delivered.

453
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,752
You two, rest first.

454
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,092
I will certainly

455
00:24:56,892 --> 00:24:58,692
commend the two of you.

456
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:00,612
Thank you, Chief Administrator.

457
00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:02,612
It's just that the end of the year is near.

458
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:05,732
We need to return immediately.

459
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:07,992
As for your friendship,

460
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:10,532
allow us to receive it on our next visit.

461
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,772
How dare they

462
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:39,812
bring the heads of my own soldiers

463
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:42,732
here to demonstrate to me.

464
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:46,652
They're too extreme.

465
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:52,704
Furthermore,

466
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,032
about this Khan Xingxiwang,

467
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:56,292
I have no idea.

468
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:59,172
When did he

469
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,092
get involved with the Qu family?

470
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:12,480
[Pei's Mansion]

471
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:21,092
ever since Minister and Shouyue
wiped out hundreds of horse bandits.

472
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:24,852
And the message came that the Chief Administrator
wanted to commend them for their achievements.

473
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:27,092
Letters from the noblewomen of Xizhou

474
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:28,792
flew over like snowflakes.

475
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:31,332
I guess the same scene is happening
at both of your mansions.

476
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:37,912
Dealing with these fence-sitters

477
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:39,732
is truly a waste of good time.

478
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:45,732
Tan sends someone to these mansions
to express apologies.

479
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:47,692
Just say that I am not feeling well,

480
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:49,752
unable to go out nor suitable to meet guests.

481
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:50,912
Please ask them for understanding.

482
00:26:50,912 --> 00:26:52,000
Yes.

483
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:58,512
I don't know when Chongyu
will be able to come back.

484
00:26:58,512 --> 00:27:00,612
I truly can't bear it anymore.

485
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:03,652
My lady,

486
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:06,212
Lady Zhang in the outer court
says she wants to come and visit the sick.

487
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:07,792
Lady Zhang said that

488
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,492
she hadn't seen Yunyi and Lady Jing
for a long time either.

489
00:27:12,812 --> 00:27:14,312
Then please invite her in.

490
00:27:14,312 --> 00:27:15,520
Yes.

491
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,212
There's something you don't know.

492
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:21,772
Lady Zhangmin has looked for Yunyi
three or four times in the past few days.

493
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:23,092
But she was turned away each time.

494
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:25,132
I didn't expect her to rush over here today.

495
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:43,152
Buddha bless,
sister-in-law's complexion is still quite good.

496
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:45,492
I heard earlier
that you were not feeling very well.

497
00:27:45,492 --> 00:27:47,252
I felt anxious
and wanted to come over immediately.

498
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:48,612
Later on, I also heard

499
00:27:48,612 --> 00:27:50,032
that Yunyi and Lady Jing were here too,

500
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:51,452
so I took the liberty of visiting
to avoid intrusion.

501
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:54,892
Thank you, Min, for your concern

502
00:27:57,132 --> 00:27:58,332
It is quite a coincidence today.

503
00:27:58,332 --> 00:27:59,452
I finally get to see you.

504
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:02,372
Do you have something to discuss with me?

505
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:04,492
There's nothing much.

506
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:06,672
It's just that painting
sister-in-law giving me earlier.

507
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:08,632
I've always been unsure about where to hang it.

508
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:10,132
So I thought to ask Yunyi about it.

509
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:12,532
I want to know how you've placed yours.

510
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,772
It's hanging on the wall
in the inner study room.

511
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:18,252
Is it appropriate to hang it there?

512
00:28:18,252 --> 00:28:19,292
Why would it be inappropriate?

513
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,252
I have also hung it in the study before.

514
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:24,192
But somehow it always feels not quite right.

515
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,812
I don't know how Yunyi hung it.

516
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:27,012
Could I take one last look?

517
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,892
Let's do it another day.

518
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:35,192
Any day is fine.

519
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:37,932
Either way, it's been quite some time
since I've seen Liuli.

520
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:39,972
I just want to bother her a little more today.

521
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:42,372
Later, I would like to
go back with you and Lady Jing.

522
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:48,892
These days, I hear everyone mentioning

523
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:50,132
your husband Prefect Wang.

524
00:28:50,132 --> 00:28:51,412
Everyone is saying they are really envious.

525
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:54,332
He is just a bit more down-to-earth.

526
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,452
He doesn't change his mind easily.

527
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:57,612
As a result, he is never in a dilemma.

528
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:00,692
That's right, Lady Jing is really fortunate.

529
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:08,812
Perhaps I should go back first.

530
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:12,952
Do you want to go with me?

531
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,492
Is Yunyi going home?

532
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,932
It's great to be able to watch it today.

533
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:20,252
Does Lady Jing want to go there too?

534
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:21,612
I want to sit for a while longer.

535
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:22,816
Let's go.

536
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,512
[Qu's Residence]

537
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,252
The painting is over there. Take a look.

538
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:09,212
I'm not afraid of your ridicule.

539
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,652
Ever since I was thirteen,

540
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:14,372
the elders in my family have been telling me
every day,

541
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:16,412
after I reach the age of maturity,

542
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:18,132
I was then expected to serve the Minister.

543
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:21,092
Little did I know,
Minister a had no such intentions.

544
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:23,812
Others blamed me for the faults.

545
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:27,332
I was uptight wanna let loose.

546
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:29,112
Inevitably, I've become more interested in

547
00:30:29,112 --> 00:30:30,552
Minister's affairs.

548
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:33,492
Therefore, I ended up doing those things.

549
00:30:35,732 --> 00:30:38,252
Now, I am married into the Su family.

550
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:41,172
The more I think of the past,
the more I regret it.

551
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:44,012
I've always wanted to find an opportunity
to speak openly with you.

552
00:30:44,932 --> 00:30:47,012
But it is only today
that this opportunity has arisen.

553
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,024
Yunyi,

554
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:55,132
what happened before was my mistake.

555
00:30:55,892 --> 00:30:57,332
I hope you don't take it to heart.

556
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,492
What formalities are there between you and me?

557
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:05,452
It's best not to mention those past incidents.

558
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:07,372
You're magnanimous.

559
00:31:08,212 --> 00:31:09,452
Either you look at the painting,

560
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:10,772
or you should hurry back.

561
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:32,732
That day, Liuli also made a painting for me.

562
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,472
This painting is vivid and lifelike.

563
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:35,812
Of course, it cannot be hung in the outer court

564
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,332
for unrelated people to see.

565
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:39,232
I have also thought about

566
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,652
hanging it in the inner study,

567
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:42,512
but my husband disagrees.

568
00:31:42,512 --> 00:31:44,272
He thinks this painting is too realistic.

569
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:47,392
If he is reading or dealing with
official documents inside the room,

570
00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:49,612
he always feels as if I am sitting beside him,

571
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:50,972
which makes him restless.

572
00:31:50,972 --> 00:31:52,612
Therefore, he doesn't allow it to be hung up.

573
00:31:53,852 --> 00:31:54,932
I have also thought about

574
00:31:54,932 --> 00:31:56,372
hanging it at the head of the bed
in the inner room,

575
00:31:56,972 --> 00:31:58,212
but let alone my husband,

576
00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:00,272
even I don't feel quite comfortable.

577
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:03,332
Therefore, we couldn't find a place
in the entire house to hang it.

578
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:04,384
I'm so tired of you.

579
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,672
So I came over to ask Yunyi,

580
00:32:06,672 --> 00:32:08,812
only to find out Yunyi has hung this painting

581
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:10,692
in the most conspicuous place
in the entire house.

582
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:13,692
The painting by Liuli is, of course, lifelike.

583
00:32:15,252 --> 00:32:16,432
Others say

584
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:18,092
Yunyi and Liuli look alike.

585
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:19,840
I don't see it so.

586
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:23,112
Perhaps because one of you are active
while the other is quiet.

587
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:24,812
But now, having seen this painting,

588
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,332
I feel there is truth in these words.

589
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:29,652
You are all beauties
with skin like snow and eyes like water.

590
00:32:29,652 --> 00:32:31,412
The smiling visage within this painting

591
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:32,512
resemble much.

592
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:37,852
In fact,

593
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:39,412
what I envy the most

594
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:40,612
is Liuli.

595
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:42,872
I have never seen

596
00:32:42,872 --> 00:32:44,932
a woman more intelligent and beautiful
than her.

597
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:45,932
Are you finished speaking?

598
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:48,412
This painting skill to others

599
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:49,992
is already an incredible talent.

600
00:32:49,992 --> 00:32:52,372
But to her it is just a minor skill.

601
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,972
Lady Jing, try this just right jujube tea.

602
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,416
it's really delicious.

603
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:26,400
I was thinking

604
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:30,252
Lady Zhangmin is definitely not the kind of person
who cares about where the portrait is hung.

605
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:32,532
She is not interested in such trivial matters.

606
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:35,372
These few days
she is so determined to see Yunyi

607
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:36,552
to see that portrait.

608
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:38,172
What on earth is she thinking?

609
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Oh no.

610
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:44,932
What's wrong? Is there anything improper?

611
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:50,432
Perhaps Yunyi doesn't know yet that

612
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:53,132
previously, Minister and Xingjian were not
on good terms.

613
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,112
It was Liuli who taught Minister
to print the Buddhist scriptures.

614
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:58,252
She helped Minister
to start Cotton Workshop again.

615
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:00,612
It was then that harmony was finally restored
between the two families.

616
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,892
Everyone says that Xingjian treats Liuli well.

617
00:34:04,532 --> 00:34:05,672
But they don't know

618
00:34:05,672 --> 00:34:06,932
Liuli is a woman

619
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:08,372
anyone knowing her

620
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:10,832
would respect and love her.

621
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:13,292
They're willing to do anything for her.

622
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,552
Liuli is intelligent and treats people kindly.

623
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:19,572
Knowing her,

624
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:20,732
naturally, they treat her well in return.

625
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:22,852
Yunyi, you're so fortunate

626
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,492
that you have such an elder sister.

627
00:34:24,492 --> 00:34:25,652
In the city of Xizhou,

628
00:34:25,652 --> 00:34:27,132
who wouldn't look at you differently?

629
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:29,652
If I had such an elder sister,

630
00:34:30,212 --> 00:34:31,892
what is there that I couldn't accomplish?

631
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:51,052
I have known Lady Zhangmin since she was young.

632
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:53,012
She definitely does not want me
to follow her today.

633
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:54,412
That's why she specifically asked me like this.

634
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,172
I ended up pleasing her again.

635
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:03,412
I think I will go and check.

636
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:04,852
Or else I will always feel uneasy.

637
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:07,572
I was about to say that I'm bored
during the illness.

638
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,252
I plan to go to Minister's place
to borrow some books.

639
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:11,812
Well,
I guess I'll have to bother Lady Jing then.

640
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,752
Could you please tell Yunyi again for me?

641
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:15,532
Ask her to come and have dinner with me.

642
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:17,692
I will bother you again tomorrow.

643
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:40,772
Looking this painting,

644
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,052
you've even watched Yunyi fall asleep.

645
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:44,392
I wanted to leave a long time ago.

646
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,052
But seeing Yunyi asleep,

647
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:48,212
I guess she is tired. I shouldn't disturb her.

648
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,332
So, I stayed a little longer.

649
00:35:51,972 --> 00:35:53,252
Is this painting okay?

650
00:35:53,972 --> 00:35:55,412
But did you perceive any hidden meanings?

651
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:57,572
What hidden meanings could there possibly be?

652
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,612
I am just marveling at the person
who painted this.

653
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:01,372
She is the most fortunate woman in Xizhou.

654
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:03,092
Let's not even mention Yunyi.

655
00:36:03,092 --> 00:36:05,732
Even I might have benefited
from her good fortune.

656
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,372
Lady Jing, why did you come here?

657
00:36:08,972 --> 00:36:10,492
Lady, Minister is back now.

658
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:12,732
Chongyu is back?

659
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:25,012
Today, I truly have come
at an inconvenient time.

660
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:43,692
Chongyu, you're back.

661
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:46,652
I'm hungry. Make me something to eat.

662
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:47,680
Okay.

663
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,624
Run slower.

664
00:36:51,332 --> 00:36:53,052
Brother, you've come back quickly.

665
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:55,012
How is it that
you seem to have lost quite a bit of weight?

666
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:57,812
Without following the grain cart,
naturally it's faster.

667
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,092
How have you been recently?

668
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:02,372
I'm fine.

669
00:37:02,372 --> 00:37:03,932
Congratulations on your great achievement,
brother.

670
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:09,392
You know the rules of this place.

671
00:37:09,392 --> 00:37:11,532
Don't let people like her in again
in the future.

672
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:19,272
Lady Min, please come this way.

673
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:21,092
Thank you for your hard work today,
you and Yunyi.

674
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:23,332
Could you thank her for me later?

675
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:03,612
My lady,

676
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,332
this is the Centenary Soup
that you love to eat.

677
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:07,932
Why not wait inside the house?

678
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:09,132
Be careful not to catch a chill at night.

679
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:11,252
Tonight, it is peaceful and comfortable.

680
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:14,512
Plus, there's the dazzling starlight.

681
00:38:14,512 --> 00:38:16,852
It's a bit of a pity not to chant to the moon.

682
00:38:18,372 --> 00:38:20,652
I wonder if there's any difference

683
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:23,972
between the night sky Shouyue's seeing
right now and the one I'm seeing.

684
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:33,112
The bright moon gleams;

685
00:38:33,112 --> 00:38:34,332
My dear lover beams.

686
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:51,652
How vast the night sky
beyond the Great Wall is.

687
00:38:52,932 --> 00:38:55,172
Yet it cannot compare to
the beauty of watching the moon with my lady.

688
00:39:00,732 --> 00:39:01,812
During the days when I am away.

689
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:03,616
How has my lady been?

690
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:10,932
You've lost weight, and even gotten darker.

691
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:16,372
I have missed my lady day and night.

692
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:19,492
With my heart torn to pieces,
I cannot swallow my food.

693
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:22,692
I just wonder how

694
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:24,092
do you know I would return today.

695
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:27,732
And you have specially prepared these dishes
that I love.

696
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:33,012
Strange to say,

697
00:39:33,932 --> 00:39:35,812
since yesterday afternoon, I suddenly

698
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:37,292
felt you would return

699
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:39,292
and was exceptionally sure.

700
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:41,812
As if you told me personally.

701
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:44,312
So I asked Tan and Ni

702
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:45,972
to prepare your favorite dishes.

703
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:49,452
Truly a heart-to-heart connection.

704
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:51,972
Speaking of last night,

705
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,132
I was also restless, eager to return home,

706
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:56,532
thinking of reuniting with my wife,

707
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:58,412
so I hurried on my horse.

708
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,132
I could not wait to rush back.

709
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:03,172
Come, sit down quickly.

710
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:06,532
Have a taste while it's hot.

711
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,372
These are all your favorite dishes.

712
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:11,852
I imagine you can't get this taste
inside the military tent.

713
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:13,536
Okay.

714
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:39,892
Why aren't you eating?

715
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:41,112
Didn't you say you were hungry?

716
00:40:41,112 --> 00:40:42,692
These are all things you love to eat.

717
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:43,808
I specially prepared for you.

718
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:45,664
I heard

719
00:40:46,212 --> 00:40:48,252
you overfed my Jiu to death.

720
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,532
I saw that it wasn't feeling well.

721
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:54,252
So, I fed a bit more.

722
00:40:54,972 --> 00:40:56,412
So, my colored glaze cups

723
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,852
don't seem to be 'in good spirits'.

724
00:40:57,852 --> 00:40:59,332
You just washed them into a pile

725
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,092
of very 'spirited' pieces.

726
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:05,052
I washed them with cold water
but didn't get them clean.

727
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:06,252
So, I used hot water to wash them.

728
00:41:06,252 --> 00:41:08,132
Who knew they were so delicate,

729
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,372
and they just cracked.

730
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:13,392
You're getting more and more impressive.

731
00:41:13,392 --> 00:41:15,112
Now you can feed hawks.

732
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:16,492
And clean glazed cups.

733
00:41:17,052 --> 00:41:19,172
And even bring guests home
to view calligraphy and paintings.

734
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:22,692
Isn't that what you said?

735
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:23,712
What did I say?

736
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:30,292
You said when you and Xingjian are not around,

737
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:31,972
I don't need to bother with those women.

738
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:33,812
But also not to offend them too harshly.

739
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,372
But if you're even slightly soft
on those people,

740
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,092
then you wouldn't be able to shake them off.

741
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:39,572
My older sister was so angered by them

742
00:41:39,572 --> 00:41:40,652
that she had no choice but to feign illness.

743
00:41:40,652 --> 00:41:43,012
That Lady Zhang still went after her,
babbling on and on.

744
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:44,412
I really couldn't take it anymore,

745
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:46,172
so I simply let her come in
and have her fill of looking.

746
00:41:46,692 --> 00:41:48,752
Actually, she was quite polite today.

747
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:50,512
Firstly, she apologized to me.

748
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,792
And then
she said a lot of good things about sister,

749
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:55,212
but the tone of his speech was a bit strange.

750
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:57,692
Could it be that she said

751
00:41:57,692 --> 00:42:00,132
the person in that painting
looks more like your sister?

752
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:01,352
And you two look alike.

753
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,972
Our group of people is good to you

754
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:04,252
just because of Liuli.

755
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:07,332
Yes, then what?

756
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:08,952
My sister is born so well.

757
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:10,652
What's wrong with me being like her?

758
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,232
Besides, if it weren't for my sister,

759
00:42:13,232 --> 00:42:14,572
where would I meet you?

760
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:15,972
How could you be nice to me?

761
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,772
These words are not wrong originally.

762
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:22,712
I just don't like the way she talks.

763
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:24,532
I couldn't bother to talk to her much.

764
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:33,892
Did I

765
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:35,612
make a mistake again?

766
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:43,584
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

767
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:50,112
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

768
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:54,432
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

769
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:58,112
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

770
00:42:58,624 --> 00:43:03,360
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

771
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:09,760
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

772
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:16,320
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

773
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,152
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

774
00:43:21,152 --> 00:43:24,640
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

775
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,136
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

776
00:43:31,136 --> 00:43:34,528
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

777
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,536
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

778
00:43:37,536 --> 00:43:41,088
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

779
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:44,192
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

780
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:47,424
♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫

781
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,688
♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

782
00:43:50,688 --> 00:43:54,048
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

783
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:58,944
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫

784
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:17,152
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

785
00:44:18,963 --> 00:44:24,704
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

786
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:28,271
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

787
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:31,567
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

788
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:38,063
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

789
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:41,455
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

790
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:44,751
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

791
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:48,175
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

792
00:44:48,175 --> 00:44:51,407
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

793
00:44:51,407 --> 00:44:54,639
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

794
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,999
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

795
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:01,231
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

796
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:06,223
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫

797
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:09,600
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

798
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,608
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

799
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:16,047
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

800
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,008
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

801
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:22,831
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

802
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:25,679
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

803
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,056
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

804
00:45:29,056 --> 00:45:34,607
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫
