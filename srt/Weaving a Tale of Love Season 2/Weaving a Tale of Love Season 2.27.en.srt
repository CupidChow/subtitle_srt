00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,955
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:39,427
It's not a big deal.

4
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:41,907
I just suffered some minor injuries.

5
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:43,667
It's all my maid's fault

6
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,627
to bother Minister and Madam Kudi.

7
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:47,427
I'm so sorry.

8
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:54,927
Minister is smart,

9
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:56,847
and Lady Zhang is tolerant.

10
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,787
It seems as if I failed to
teach my sister properly.

11
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:00,987
Madam Kudi, don't say so.

12
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,867
It's just a misunderstanding.

13
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:03,936
Hypocritical.

14
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:31,680
Whoa.

15
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:14,368
Shouyue.

16
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,747
How is the decree?

17
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,184
Are you okay?

18
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:58,272
The decree…

19
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,328
General Cheng

20
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,267
neglects in recovering
the thieves due to lingering,

21
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:02,307
is reduced sentence and
relieved of official positions.

22
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:06,507
Wang Wendu committed the crime of forging
imperial edicts, is sentenced death penalty,

23
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,227
and would return to Chang'an
to await the final decision.

24
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:11,507
The rest of the generals,
Zhou Zhidu and Su Haizheng,

25
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:13,536
return to their respective departments,

26
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,867
my mentor temporarily replaces
as the Chief Administrator

27
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:19,616
to control the armed forces.

28
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:24,992
Do you catch a cold?

29
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,467
Didn't His Majesty mention the slaughter
of the merchants in the city?

30
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:33,427
Why do Su Haizheng and his party
stay safe and sound?

31
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:38,987
About the slaughter
of the merchants in the city,

32
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:41,587
after all, it's bad for
Tang Dynasty's reputation,

33
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:45,027
so there's no mention of it in the decree.

34
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:47,104
The law does not punish the masses.

35
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,667
There's no way to convict everyone involved.

36
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:53,024
Therefore,

37
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:56,307
Cheng Zhijie and Wang Wendu
were severely punished,

38
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:58,208
the generals were dismissed,

39
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:00,787
and my mentor was assigned.

40
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:02,880
The implication

41
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:04,704
is clear.

42
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,667
Since your mentor stays to
act as the Chief Administrator,

43
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:13,847
does His Majesty intend
to prepare for war again

44
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:14,867
to fight Helu?

45
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:20,427
I have discussed this matter
with my mentor all night.

46
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,147
If we want to pacify the north
in one fell swoop,

47
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:26,307
it's not about the number of soldiers,
but their excellence.

48
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,024
Therefore,

49
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:31,307
the great army will return east as planned,

50
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:36,587
only the elite soldiers chosen
from the border troops for strict training.

51
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:39,967
No one can match my mentor

52
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,187
in training and preparing for war

53
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:42,387
and charging into battle.

54
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:46,587
But he is a little lax in managing soldiers

55
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:47,587
and food provision.

56
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:50,496
Liuli.

57
00:05:51,907 --> 00:05:54,187
I'm afraid I have to spend more time in camp

58
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,160
after that.

59
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:01,824
I have to

60
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:03,947
pack up and go to the military camp later.

61
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,807
You have a good rest at home.

62
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:09,147
There are many affairs this year,

63
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,787
and there will only be
more and more afterwards.

64
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:15,507
You don't have to go if you don't want to.

65
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,048
Anyway, in Xizhou,

66
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:20,467
no one dares to trouble you.

67
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:23,627
After this incident,

68
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:25,827
with you and your mentor,

69
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:28,587
Su Nanjin would not dare to
come and make trouble again.

70
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:32,027
And Qu Chongyu will not
find us trouble anymore.

71
00:06:32,587 --> 00:06:35,147
Am I bluffing by association?

72
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:39,227
Yes, you are.

73
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,587
That Qu Chongyu,

74
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,427
although he is somewhat narrow-minded,

75
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,547
he's also manly.

76
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:52,807
He thought I would
rob the Qu family of their power

77
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:53,987
and force them back to Chang'an,

78
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:55,947
now the knot is settled.

79
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,947
I think if anything happens
in Xizhou in the future,

80
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,907
given his character,
he will surely offer his help.

81
00:07:58,272 --> 00:07:59,360
Tan.

82
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:01,267
Look who he looks like.

83
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,587
He looks like the Kitchen God
painted by My lady.

84
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:17,427
Minister, you are here. I'll take you in.

85
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:20,224
Okay, thank you.

86
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:21,952
Here, take it.

87
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,128
Hurry up.

88
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,187
Wait for me.

89
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:30,587
Come here.

90
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,927
My lady, you have painted
so many Kitchen Gods these days.

91
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:34,507
All were given to the neighbors.

92
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,507
Today is the 23rd of the twelfth lunar month,
the day for offering sacrifices to Kitchen God.

93
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,107
We still have to do the painting ourselves.

94
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,027
Sister.

95
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:46,304
Look who's here.

96
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:49,600
Madam.

97
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,216
Please take a seat, Minister.

98
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,184
Madam.

99
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:31,387
Madam, this is
the cotton workshop's bonus for this year.

100
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,787
Thank you, Minister, for remembering this.

101
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:36,707
It's no big deal.

102
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:38,087
Without you,

103
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,527
there wouldn't be this cotton workshop.

104
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:40,667
I should do so.

105
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:49,147
Actually, I come here
to deal with a matter today.

106
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,607
The Senior Official Pei

107
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:53,827
always does good deeds
to the surrounding villages.

108
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:57,947
There are dozens of village junior officers
specially coming to Xizhou,

109
00:09:57,947 --> 00:09:59,136
wanting to…

110
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:02,307
But heard that the Senior Official is away,

111
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:07,067
then they want to pay respects to his wife.

112
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,267
There's no reason to bother you

113
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,707
with such a trivial matter.

114
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:12,667
But…

115
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,387
They came through a long trip
here in the cold winter,

116
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:17,887
I took it upon myself to leave them
at the Protector-General's Mansion.

117
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:18,944
Minister.

118
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,047
My sister is not feeling well these days,

119
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,147
she hasn't had a proper meal,

120
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:25,387
hasn't even stepped outside.

121
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,027
I'm not that delicate.

122
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,747
It's just a trip
to the Protector-General's Mansion.

123
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,427
I can't keep the village junior officers
waiting too long.

124
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,987
Ni, take fifty copies
of the Buddhist scriptures.

125
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:44,288
You come along with me.

126
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:45,347
Yes.

127
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:46,528
Then I'll go with you.

128
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:53,728
Madam, please.

129
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,827
Sister.

130
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,187
You're not feeling well,

131
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:05,367
don't force yourself.

132
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:06,528
I am okay.

133
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:20,704
Madam is here.

134
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:25,248
Madam is here.

135
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:29,387
Hello, Madam.

136
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:30,432
Hello Madam.

137
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:37,227
Madam, do you still remember me?

138
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,927
My several daughters-in-law
always think of you, Madam.

139
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,987
They deliberately made
some pairs of shoes and socks.

140
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,787
Hope you don't mind them crude.

141
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:47,327
My spouse is always thinking of you,

142
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,887
prepared some local products for you.

143
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:50,747
Hope you don't mind them.

144
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,327
Yes.

145
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:53,587
We have gifts too.

146
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,027
Please take them.

147
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,107
Thank you all for your kindness.

148
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:00,467
Then I and Shouyue would take them.

149
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:03,887
However, I have also prepared some small gifts.

150
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:06,507
I also hope that you do not refuse.

151
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,216
Thank you, Madam.

152
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:16,747
- Thank you, Madam.
- Yes.

153
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,147
Thank you, Madam.

154
00:12:18,147 --> 00:12:19,200
Thank you, Madam.

155
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:28,320
[Protector-General's Mansion]

156
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:30,547
Thank you for today, Madam.

157
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,127
With you personally show up,

158
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,987
village junior officers will
return home content.

159
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:37,056
Sister.

160
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,112
I'm fine.

161
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,727
Please stop, Minister.

162
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:40,987
We shall take our leave now.

163
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,347
I should take you back.

164
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:52,867
- My lady.
- Sister.

165
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,547
- Sister.
- Madam.

166
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:57,867
- My lady.
- Madam.

167
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,187
- Sister.
- Madam.

168
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,027
My lady began to tremble.

169
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:18,272
What should we do?

170
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:20,827
Sister's hands are so cold.

171
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:25,867
The doctors all have checked the pulse,

172
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,427
why hasn't a result been discussed yet?

173
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:30,067
What's the treatment? I'm really worried.

174
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:32,067
You guys stay here.

175
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,167
I'll go urge them.

176
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,208
Okay.

177
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,927
This symptom is very obvious.

178
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:44,327
Cold and heat are alternating.

179
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:46,147
It is the stagnation of qi.

180
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:47,947
It's also the disease of qi stagnation.

181
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:49,707
We should regulate the qi now.

182
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,307
Mr. Hua, I don't think so.

183
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:53,647
It is clear that the patient
has the internal heat.

184
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:55,667
We should let her sweat now.

185
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,672
You are right.

186
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:58,027
I have been a doctor for many years.

187
00:13:58,027 --> 00:13:59,427
We should regulate the qi now.

188
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:01,567
Mr. Hua, I think you're missing the point here.

189
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,207
It is clear that the patient
has the internal heat.

190
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:04,507
How can you do so?

191
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:06,747
Have you come up with any results?

192
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,487
My lady's getting cold again.

193
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:10,347
When can the right medicine be prescribed?

194
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:19,547
Can you really cure her or not?

195
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:20,587
Do you know how to treat her?

196
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,467
Minister, of course.

197
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:25,667
It is clear that the patient
has the internal heat.

198
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,387
Just let it out and she'll be okay.

199
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,187
Minister.

200
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:31,547
It is clear that qi should be regulated.

201
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,827
No need to let the heat out.

202
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,768
Physician Han.

203
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:38,976
What do you think?

204
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,467
Madam has symptoms of a cold.

205
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,747
Now is the time of heat and cold alternating.

206
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,187
I'm afraid

207
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,547
she'll faint by night.

208
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:00,727
So the urgent need

209
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:02,907
is to facilitate the flow of qi
and disperse the cold.

210
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:05,440
If it's too late,

211
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,488
it will be incurable.

212
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,987
Come on, hurry.

213
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:27,547
Unfortunately, my brother-in-law
has gone to General Su's camp,

214
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,587
and there's no one in the family
to make decisions.

215
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,167
With Sister being so ill,

216
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,707
what should we do?

217
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:33,792
When My lady fainted,

218
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,027
Minister Qu has already sent
someone to deliver a letter to Master.

219
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:38,467
Master should be on his way back by now.

220
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:51,927
How old are you?

221
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,267
How dare you make such a false statement!

222
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,587
Although Madam's symptoms
of cold are a bit serious,

223
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:58,107
they are not hard to treat.

224
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:01,267
It's improbable for a cold
to progress this rapidly.

225
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:05,147
Has Madam been weak and sensitive to cold?

226
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,227
Did she have a heavy headache
the last few days,

227
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:09,227
then lost her appetite,

228
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:11,147
and today has also caught a bit of cold?

229
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,827
Exactly, Physician Han.

230
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:16,347
Although My lady looks weak,

231
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:17,867
she has never been sick.

232
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:22,387
Could it be that you have misdiagnosed?

233
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:24,827
Her problem is that she never gets sick.

234
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:38,787
H-He is so arrogant.

235
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,027
Three qian of Angelica sinensis.

236
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,327
Three qian of Cassia twig.

237
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:58,007
Three qian of Peony.

238
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:59,827
Two qian of honey-fried licorice.

239
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,247
Two qian of Polyporus.

240
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:03,427
25 pieces of jujube.

241
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:07,507
Madam is suffering from high fever
and still using this hot medicine.

242
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:10,547
Truly, quack doctors are killing.

243
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,007
Yes.

244
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,387
Is it that you

245
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:17,227
have treated cattle and sheep often?

246
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:25,307
Senior Official Pei is like my father to me.

247
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:26,944
I am not knowledgeable.

248
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:28,987
Perhaps I cannot save Madam.

249
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,127
But if follow their treatment,

250
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:32,527
Madam will surely have no chance of survival.

251
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:34,667
You… Well…

252
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:39,627
Lady boss.

253
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,067
Please trust me this time.

254
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,847
Boil the prescription to one liter
with three liters of water

255
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,347
and hurry let Madam take it.

256
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:46,467
If it's wrong,

257
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,147
I will bear any punishment.

258
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,467
Okay, I will listen to you.

259
00:17:53,027 --> 00:17:54,067
But no matter what,

260
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,347
we must save Lady Liuli's life.

261
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:58,208
Ni.

262
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,067
Boil the medicine according to the recipe now.

263
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:02,720
Hurry up.

264
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,904
Yes.

265
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,747
I take my leave.

266
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,544
I take my leave.

267
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:29,760
Physician Han.

268
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:32,607
Are you sure

269
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:33,947
you can cure Madam?

270
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:39,136
I have seen

271
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:40,987
this condition twice.

272
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,147
How about those two times?

273
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:46,227
It took me three days to get one back,

274
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:48,064
another one…

275
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:55,904
Although Madam is seriously ill,

276
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,907
because she is young,

277
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:00,067
there is still a chance to cure.

278
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,507
Medicine is here.

279
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:16,327
The medicine is finally here.

280
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:17,376
Help her up.

281
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:31,648
She has vomited it.

282
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:35,367
What should we do?

283
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:36,607
Then I will continue to boil the medicine.

284
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:37,967
Let's try a few more times.

285
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,767
She has to take the medicine

286
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,067
to get better.

287
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,240
Okay.

288
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,392
Come on, I'll feed her.

289
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:40,327
Giddyap.

290
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:41,472
Giddyap.

291
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:42,560
Giddyap.

292
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:45,536
Giddyap.

293
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:48,768
Giddyap.

294
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:50,400
Giddyap.

295
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:15,387
How is Madam?

296
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:17,987
Did she feel better after taking the medicine?

297
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:24,187
I had a hard time feeding her some.

298
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:26,987
It will take an hour or two to know the result.

299
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:30,687
Minister, you might go back and rest.

300
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:32,067
If Sister shows any improvement,

301
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,787
we will send someone to tell you.

302
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:38,147
If I hadn't invited Madam

303
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,627
to meet those village junior officers,

304
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:41,347
Madam would not be like this.

305
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:44,407
Without seeing any improvement in Madam,

306
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:46,307
I really can't put my mind at ease.

307
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,827
That's what I wanted to tell you.

308
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:51,827
I have asked Physician Han,

309
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,227
the cold that Sister suffered today

310
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:55,487
is merely an introduction.

311
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:57,127
Sister is weak and sensitive to cold,

312
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,507
and her spirit is weakened
and harmed by fatigue.

313
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:00,747
The disease

314
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:02,407
would have come out

315
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:04,187
sooner or later.

316
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:06,267
You don't have to blame yourself.

317
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:13,747
Tonight, everyone at Pei's Mansion
are all busy with the Madam's illness,

318
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:15,827
only you noticed my mood.

319
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:17,984
Thank you.

320
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,067
Even so,

321
00:22:20,627 --> 00:22:22,127
I still feel guilty.

322
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:23,147
Let's wait a bit longer.

323
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:27,467
I'm not making up lies just to comfort you.

324
00:22:28,387 --> 00:22:30,647
Sister had a serious illness
in her early years.

325
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,947
She failed to be taken care and caught a chill.

326
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:36,587
Lady Yunyi is right.

327
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:43,867
Back when she was in the palace,

328
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:46,067
Prince Cao wanted to use Lady Liuli
to frame the Crown Prince,

329
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:47,232
so he poisoned her.

330
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,147
Lady Liuli once became
seriously ill for several months.

331
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:52,647
It was the miraculous medicine that
Shouyue found after enduring hardships,

332
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:53,987
to finally save Lady Liuli's life.

333
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,867
So Madam hasn't been

334
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:59,127
to a doctor since the illness,

335
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,147
and she hasn't had any care.

336
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,787
The current condition of Madam,

337
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:07,267
she'd be better if she occasionally falls ill.

338
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:09,507
Her problem is that she never falls ill.

339
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,707
She hangs on with her sheer willpower.

340
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,547
Once she is relieved,

341
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,907
then illness would strike her.

342
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:21,987
Not to mention Lady Liuli has spent
these years in the palace in constant anxiety,

343
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,147
even after marrying Shouyue,

344
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:25,667
she can't make any mistake,

345
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,307
nor dare to be careless
or negligent at any time.

346
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:29,827
It turns out that Lady Liuli
is not someone who won't get sick,

347
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:32,387
but that she can't get sick
and dare not get sick.

348
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,427
And now it's all settled,

349
00:23:36,227 --> 00:23:38,147
and she has to pay back everything she owed.

350
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:41,067
Physician Han.

351
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:42,907
Is there anything else we can do for my sister?

352
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,827
The current condition of Madam,

353
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:46,587
it's not the fever to fear, but the chills.

354
00:23:46,587 --> 00:23:48,427
The worst thing is
the exhaustion from sweating.

355
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,107
You should prepare
hot water bags to keep her warm.

356
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:54,427
Once the cold reaches the elbows and knees,

357
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:55,787
come to tell me immediately.

358
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:57,947
Okay, thank you, Physician Han.

359
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:03,947
I have sent messengers twice
to deliver letters to Senior Official Pei,

360
00:24:03,947 --> 00:24:05,187
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

361
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:06,947
I'll just wait here.

362
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:09,247
Keep me informed on anything.

363
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,336
Okay.

364
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:12,867
Thank you, Physician Han.

365
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:50,107
My sister's high fever has not recurred,

366
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,387
but her hands and feet have remained cold,

367
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:54,107
which reaches the elbows and knees.

368
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:55,347
What should we do now?

369
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:02,907
I'll get Physician Han right away.

370
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:06,267
I can't feed her.

371
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:09,107
My lady's hands and feet
are getting colder and colder.

372
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,707
What should we do?

373
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,947
Sister, can you hear me?

374
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:16,667
Can you take the medicine?

375
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:19,667
If you don't take it, you can't get better.

376
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:31,808
Physician Han.

377
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:55,947
Physician Han, how is my sister's condition?

378
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:00,448
Physician Han.

379
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:07,127
Is there anything we can do to save her?

380
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:09,347
Physician Han, I beg you.

381
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:11,987
Do something to save My lady.

382
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:49,267
Now Sister's face is paler.

383
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:50,667
Her limbs are all cold.

384
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:52,727
We've added up to three quilts

385
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,427
and put several hot water bags.

386
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:56,487
But she could not stop shivering,

387
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:58,247
and her body is slowly curling up.

388
00:26:58,247 --> 00:26:59,547
I wrote a new prescription.

389
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:04,047
It's just licorice, rhizoma zingiberis,
fresh ginger and aconite.

390
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:05,967
Hurry up to boil it.

391
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:07,107
Physician Han.

392
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:08,387
We can't feed her the medicine.

393
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:09,627
What's the use of changing the medicine?

394
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,367
You need to think of something else.

395
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:12,387
If it's a man,

396
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,667
moxibustion can be used to warm him up,

397
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:17,307
then massage him and give medicine.

398
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,107
Then use it. What are you waiting for?

399
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:29,547
Physician Han, is there any difficulty?

400
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:33,312
It requires…

401
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:39,067
It requires the clothes to be removed.

402
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:52,327
Why are you still hesitating?

403
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:53,787
Sister's life is at stake.

404
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:55,147
What worldly etiquette

405
00:27:55,147 --> 00:27:56,727
is more important than life.

406
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:58,247
You're right.

407
00:27:58,247 --> 00:28:00,087
But after all, Liuli married Shouyue.

408
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:02,227
H-How could I dare to decide on this?

409
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:06,147
Your stubbornness and
prejudice will hurt Sister.

410
00:28:14,387 --> 00:28:17,187
Minister, you care the least
about worldly etiquette.

411
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,627
Say something.

412
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:28,704
How is Liuli doing?

413
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:30,067
I am so incompetent,

414
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:32,147
failed to have Madam take the medicine.

415
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:49,536
Physician Han.

416
00:28:50,507 --> 00:28:51,648
Is there anything else you can do?

417
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:00,107
We can try moxibustion.

418
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:01,707
Physician Han, please give it a try.

419
00:29:07,027 --> 00:29:09,647
Moxibustion requires

420
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,027
the clothes removed.

421
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:15,627
And the acupoints are on the back
and lower abdomen.

422
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:29,587
Physician Han, please give it a try.

423
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,656
Okay.

424
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:36,847
You guys go get some ginger slices,

425
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:38,027
cut to the size of a coin.

426
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,287
And get two basins of charcoal fires.

427
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:40,416
Yes.

428
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:18,976
Physician Han.

442

Physician Han.

443
00:31:44,147 --> 00:31:45,947
Please tell me the acupoint location.

444
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:47,808
Lower abdomen.

445
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:49,792
Let me give it a try.

446
00:31:50,848 --> 00:31:51,936
Okay.

447
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:55,168
Shenque is in the navel.

448
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:58,307
Qihai is two fingers below the navel.

449
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:00,267
Guanyuan is four fingers below the navel.

450
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:02,147
It should be the same as before,

451
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:04,067
lasts for seven moxa sticks.

460

Physician Han.

461
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:53,984
Her hands and feet

462
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:55,627
don't seem as cold anymore.

463
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:57,600
That's great.

464
00:32:58,427 --> 00:32:59,467
Go and give Madam her medicine.

465
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,544
Okay.

466
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:17,856
She has taken it.

467
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:29,824
Go bring a cup of warm water.

468
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:31,744
She says it's spicy.

469
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:33,600
Okay.

470
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:36,800
Here.

471
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:39,584
Slow down.

472
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:48,707
Master is worried that
My lady's condition will recur,

473
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,467
so you might have to stay at the mansion

474
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:52,667
to treat My lady at any time.

475
00:33:54,627 --> 00:33:56,907
Sorry about any inconvenience, Physician Han.

476
00:33:57,427 --> 00:33:58,547
If you want anything,

477
00:33:58,547 --> 00:33:59,947
just tell me.

478
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:01,067
Lady Ni, you are welcome.

479
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,107
Then I won't disturb your rest.

480
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:14,927
You must be hungry after all this work.

481
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,107
Beef noodles, eat it while it's hot.

482
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,147
Eat before you rest.

483
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:23,107
Y-Your hand…

484
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:28,307
I-I'll apply medicine for you.

485
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:29,547
That's not a big deal.

486
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,947
It's so swelling.

487
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:41,152
Please take a seat.

488
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:02,907
I didn't even see you blush when
you were doing moxibustion to Lady Liuli.

489
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:07,947
Now you are applying medicine to my hand,

490
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:09,507
why are you so blushing?

491
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:12,387
T-That's different.

492
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:14,987
I am a doctor.

493
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,187
When I am treating,

494
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:18,827
I only think of the symptoms,
without any distractions.

495
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:21,907
To me, Madam is just a patient.

496
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
What about me?

497
00:35:31,227 --> 00:35:32,320
Am I not a patient?

498
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:33,987
Isn't this an injury?

499
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:38,187
I-I can't argue with you.

500
00:35:38,747 --> 00:35:40,947
Anyway…

501
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:43,667
you are not the same as Madam.

502
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:38,787
Thank you, Lady Zhang,
for coming to visit Madam.

503
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:41,407
But Madam is still asleep.

504
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,827
The Senior Official is accompanying her.

505
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:46,147
It is not convenient for us outsiders
to enter the house and disturb.

506
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,467
It would be better for me to talk to you.

507
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:51,387
Wait until Madam wakes up,

508
00:36:51,387 --> 00:36:52,747
we can visit together.

509
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:56,027
I'm afraid I'm the only one outsider

510
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:57,867
who is not convenient
to enter the house and disturb.

511
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:00,987
Even you can help
host guests at the mansion now.

512
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:02,227
Then Madam Kudi

513
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:03,447
has long considered you

514
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:05,147
and Lady Yunyi as sisters now.

515
00:37:06,227 --> 00:37:07,987
What are you talking about?

516
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:10,947
I am just living close
to the Senior Official's mansion,

517
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:13,387
so I am more convenient to visit Madam.

518
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:16,267
I was just kidding.

519
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,667
There's no need to take it seriously.

520
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:19,567
By the way,

521
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,667
I am indeed curious about something.

522
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:25,527
We all know Lady Yunyi is
the younger sister of Madam Kudi.

523
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:28,227
I wonder whether she is
a cousin or a paternal cousin.

524
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,947
Could it be that Yunyi's surname also is Kudi?

525
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:38,227
I wonder why you care about this.

526
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,007
Envy, of course.

527
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:43,227
Madam Kudi treats Lady Yunyi kindly.

528
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,107
I also want to be closer to Madam Kudi.

529
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:49,587
This is a family matter for Madam Kudi.

530
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:51,787
I can't talk about it.

531
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:54,067
Let's drink tea and eat the fruit.

532
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,507
Just casual chat.

533
00:37:57,227 --> 00:37:58,787
You are being so careful.

534
00:37:59,307 --> 00:38:00,867
No wonder Madam Kudi trusts you.

535
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:22,976
Sister Liu.

536
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,387
Yunyi.

537
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:26,427
Thanks to you going there for me,

538
00:38:26,427 --> 00:38:28,627
I am most impatient to talk
to that Zhang Minniang.

539
00:38:28,627 --> 00:38:30,067
I don't want her bothering my sister.

540
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:32,707
Yunyi, in my opinion,

541
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:35,207
she did not really come to visit Madame,

542
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:36,767
but she is very interested in you.

543
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:38,027
You need to be more careful,

544
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:39,467
try to meet her less.

545
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:41,067
The best is not to meet her.

546
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:43,427
Even if you don't say that to me,

547
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:44,587
I don't want to talk to her either.

548
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:46,707
That would be for the best.

549
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:48,967
You are pure, in order to
keep from falling into her trap,

550
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,187
it's better to have less contact with her.

551
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:51,328
Got it.

552
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:12,736
Liuli.

553
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:17,107
Don't you always look forward to

554
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:19,827
the gifts I bring you
when I come back from the yamen?

555
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:23,744
This time

556
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,760
I specifically asked someone

557
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:28,227
to bring back books from Chang'an.

558
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,027
Back then, the journey to go
serve in Xizhou was long and far,

559
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:36,307
I brought a large cart of traditional books.

560
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:40,027
So the only recreational reading book

561
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:41,187
had been read by you so many times.

562
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:46,347
I had someone write me a book list this time

563
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,187
and found some interesting books

564
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,520
that I wanted to give you.

565
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:01,632
Liuli.

566
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:05,867
Please wake up.

567
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:08,576
I read those interesting books to you

568
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:11,107
every night

569
00:40:11,107 --> 00:40:13,027
as bedtime stories,

570
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:19,520
okay?

571
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:51,987
Where am I?

572
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:53,747
Who am I?

573
00:41:54,427 --> 00:41:55,507
Where is home?

574
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:58,187
Which way should I go

575
00:41:58,907 --> 00:41:59,947
to take the next step?

576
00:42:25,147 --> 00:42:26,267
Make way. Make way.

577
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,232
Lady Yunyi.

578
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,467
Lady Yunyi.

579
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:56,387
Lady Zhang has come to visit My lady again.

580
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:57,547
She has already reached the front courtyard.

581
00:42:57,547 --> 00:43:00,027
Why don't you try to stop her?

582
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:08,191
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

583
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:14,719
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

584
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:19,039
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

585
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:22,719
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

586
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:27,967
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

587
00:43:29,855 --> 00:43:34,367
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

588
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:40,927
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

589
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:45,759
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

590
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:49,247
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

591
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:55,743
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

592
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:59,135
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

593
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:02,143
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

594
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:05,695
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

595
00:44:05,695 --> 00:44:08,799
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

596
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:12,031
♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫

597
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:15,295
♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

598
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:18,655
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

599
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:23,551
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫

600
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,759
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

601
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:49,311
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

602
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,878
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

603
00:44:52,878 --> 00:44:56,174
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

604
00:44:56,174 --> 00:45:02,670
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

605
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,062
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

606
00:45:06,062 --> 00:45:09,358
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

607
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,782
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

608
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:16,014
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

609
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:19,246
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

610
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:22,606
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

611
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:25,838
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

612
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,830
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫

613
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,207
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

614
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:37,215
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

615
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:40,654
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

616
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,615
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

617
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:47,438
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

618
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:50,286
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

619
00:45:50,286 --> 00:45:53,663
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

620
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:59,214
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫
