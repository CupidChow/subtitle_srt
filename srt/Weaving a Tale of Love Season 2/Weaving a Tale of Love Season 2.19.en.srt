<i>[Wu's Residence]</i>

4
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:43,268
I once heard that Xizhou is not suitable
for growing mulberry and raising silkworms,

5
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:45,736
I know this is hard for you,

6
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,628
But providing four dans of millet
from each hundred acres of farmland,

7
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:51,908
Why did you even fail that?

8
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:54,068
There are no hundred acres of farmland,
Are sand dunes also included?

9
00:01:54,068 --> 00:02:00,068
Yes, that's right,
It will be good if we have ten acres here,

10
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:03,068
Yeah, right, there's not even ten acres,
we don't have that much at all!

11
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:06,108
Senior Official, back in the days,
when Protector-General Qiao made distribution,

12
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,908
he even included wastelands and deserts,

13
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:10,988
The land that can be used,

14
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,988
There might be a bit more in other places,

15
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:15,148
But right here in Wu City,

16
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:18,468
There are less than ten acres for each man,

17
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:19,584
Exactly,

18
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:24,188
Advisor Zhang, if they are telling the truth,

19
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:27,468
how do you think this matter
should be dealt with?

20
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:32,428
There's no surplus grain!

21
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:36,348
Please, Senior Official, think twice,

22
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:40,048
What the village chief said is the truth,

23
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:41,908
This is also why Protector-General Qu

24
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:43,508
only collected thirty percent of the rent
in every year,

25
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:46,608
However, the situation has changed,
It is very vital to provide armies with grain,

26
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,908
If we continue to be in arrears with taxes,

27
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:50,568
then how should we feed the army?

28
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:52,308
When the army arrive,

29
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:53,888
and there are no grains in Xizhou granary,

30
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,528
So the military officials should

31
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,608
let soldiers to fight with empty stomachs?

32
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,588
When that time arrives,
Senior Official will be blamed,

33
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:02,268
And the taxes they owned will not become less,

34
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:20,068
Senior Official Pei has ordered,

35
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,588
today you should start to pay

36
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:24,308
<i>[Wu's Residence]</i>
all the taxes you owned over the years,

37
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:27,268
This is why I summoned everyone here,

38
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:28,988
So you will understand,

39
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,628
The order of Senior Official can't be violated,
as well as the system of Tang Dynasty,

40
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,348
What, what is this?

41
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:37,628
We can't live like this,

42
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:41,628
You are killing us,

43
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:43,268
We are going to die because of it,

44
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:47,468
Senior Official,
these notes include their debts,

45
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:49,308
And they also include their properties,

46
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,388
You can collect the taxes sooner or later,

47
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:53,968
But right now, you can't decide,

48
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,248
And this makes them think
that they can delay even more,

49
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,548
Our work will be much harder when you are gone,

50
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,028
The Advisor has made it clear enough,

51
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,348
If Senior Official Pei chooses not
to collect money and grains today,

52
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:06,128
He will suffer in the future,

53
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,048
Even if he let us go today,

54
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,508
The taxes will still be there,
And they won't hesitate to collect them,

55
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,096
That's right, yes,

56
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:16,288
Exactly, earlier when Senior Official Pei
asked around,

57
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,208
It is nothing but a show,

58
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,352
Those officials and armies of Tang,

59
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,548
Have they ever cared about the livelihood
of the people in Xizhou?

60
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:23,552
Yeah,

61
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:38,668
Everyone, don't be fooled by him,

62
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:41,228
No matter what, we have no way out,

63
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:46,068
We might as well make those notes…

64
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:49,548
Shut it! Senior Official has not yet spoken,
What are you planning to do!

65
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:57,888
Someone come here!

66
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,188
Burn those notes!

67
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:07,628
Burn? Burn? Burn!

68
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:08,672
Really?

69
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:11,648
Yes, really,

70
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:25,148
Senior Official Pei, what are you trying to do?

71
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,828
Advisor Zhang has a point,
If we keep those notes,

72
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:33,348
sooner or later, in Wu City, people will
live in a nightmare because of them,

73
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:36,948
Only by burning them,
they can have a prosperous life,

74
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:42,308
Not only those in Wu City must be burned,

75
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:45,828
I shall burn all of those in Xizhou,

76
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:49,628
Only by doing so can the people of Xizhou

77
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:52,188
be freed from the debt of unpaid taxes,

78
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,748
Good, very good,

79
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:10,268
Good, very good,

80
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:12,908
How can this be any good?

81
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:16,848
Advisor Zhang, didn't you just say

82
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:19,428
Senior Official can operate as he please,

83
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:27,468
Someone put out that fire, fast!

84
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,268
Hurry, go! Go! Go!

85
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:38,028
Yeah, yes, yes, nice!

86
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:39,908
That's good! Burn them all!

87
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:45,468
Senior Official Pei,
it's easy to start this fire today,

88
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:48,908
But when the enemy arrives,
how will you explain this to them?

89
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,232
This matter does not concern you,

90
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:54,028
Since I dare to do this today,

91
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:57,628
I shall take responsibility in the future,
no need for you to worry,

92
00:06:57,628 --> 00:06:58,688
What about them?

93
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:02,948
If the army is out of provisions,
they still need to provide grains,

94
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,828
Senior Official Pei, when the time comes,
can you guarantee

95
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:07,468
people in Xizhou don't have to
provide grains for them?

96
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,668
You are wrong,

97
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,068
The purpose of Tang army
going on an expedition,

98
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:12,888
It is for the protection of the people,
not to harm them,

99
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:15,348
The people of Xizhou are also
the subjects of Tang Dynasty,

100
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:18,068
If I were to collet grains
according to the notes today,

101
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,508
The result would certainly be that
when the army has not arrived,

102
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,428
half of the people in Xizhou will
lose all their properties,

103
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:27,068
This is hardly the intention of our army
to protect the homes and ensure safety,

104
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:31,908
The Tang Dynasty has implemented
the Equal-field System,

105
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,708
This is to ensure that
everyone who farms has lands,

106
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,788
Everyone can stay warm and have enough food
if they work hard,

107
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:39,928
This is not to let the common people suffer
for the sake of vanity,

108
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:42,028
To be hungry and have no properties,

109
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:44,508
Xizhou doesn't have hundred-acre farmlands,

110
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:47,708
Then only the land can be farmed
should be taxed,

111
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,188
Today, I have burned those notes,

112
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,368
That's because the people of Xizhou

113
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,468
have never defaulted on their tax debts,

114
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:58,108
The rent should be decided by the farmlands
and households long time ago,

115
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:02,068
Good, well said, well said, well said,

116
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,428
Yes, Yes, Yes,

117
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:07,668
I misunderstood you, Senior Official,
please forgive me,

118
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:10,588
Many thanks to Senior Official for saving us,

119
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:13,908
Thanks, Senior Official,

120
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,228
Thanks, Senior Official,

121
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,868
Thanks, Senior Official,

122
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:41,088
From now on, the taxation in Xizhou

123
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,428
will implement the real system
of the Great Tang dynasty,

124
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:46,868
The grain tribute will be according
to the land can be farmed,

125
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,988
<i>[Wu's Residence]</i>
Farming tax for each adult male is three dous,

126
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,548
Weaving tax for each adult female
is half zhangs,

127
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:58,508
Each male is granted four arcs of fine land
and six arcs of land with low-quality,

128
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:02,908
Desert and sand dunes will never be included
after today,

129
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:08,428
As for the land tax,
I suppose you are still unclear,

130
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,628
His majesty issued an edict
during the second year of Yonghui reign,

131
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:19,668
It is ordered that all taxable households
in all states should contribute grain equally,

132
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:23,388
Go, go, go, keep up,

133
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:31,948
Go, go, go,

134
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,148
Open the door quickly,
Open, open, open the door,

135
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:38,388
Guys, smash the door,

136
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,628
Bump into it, bump into it

137
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:45,856
My lady,

138
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:54,828
Madam, let's go,

139
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,832
Don't go,

140
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,228
Everyone, block them at the back door,

141
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:11,788
Go, move on, hurry up, chase them,

142
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,188
Quick, chase them, don't let them get away,

143
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:21,948
Everyone, calm down,

144
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,868
There they are, tie them up, catch her,

145
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:28,468
Hold, don't run, tie them up,

146
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:29,548
Catch her, catch her,

147
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,028
Take Madam and go first,

148
00:10:58,668 --> 00:10:59,680
Go,

149
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:02,508
Where are we going now?

150
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,468
Go to the Protector-General's Mansion,
there are soldiers guarding it,

151
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:06,188
Even these mobs, no matter how crazy they are,
wouldn't dare to break in recklessly,

152
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:07,200
Madam, come this way,

153
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:11,712
Madam,

154
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:13,696
Hold it!

155
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:16,568
Stop! Catch them!

156
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,088
Stop, catch them!
Where do you think you're running?

157
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:20,028
Where do you think you're running?

158
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,308
Catch them!

159
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,348
Someone's been killed, someone's been killed!

160
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:32,948
Someone's been killed, run!

161
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,352
Giddyap!

162
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,992
Audacious peasants!
Dare to commit crime on the streets!

163
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,348
Take them all down!

164
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:43,360
Yes!

165
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:45,108
- Lady,
- Stop!

166
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:46,868
- Lady,
- Liuli,

167
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:49,308
- You, go there, The rest follow me!
- Yes,

168
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,388
Liuli, how is it?

169
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,348
How is it, Lady? Don't scare me, Lady,

170
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:55,148
- Is there any physician?
- Liuli,

171
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,228
- There is an injured person here,
- Liuli,

172
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:57,828
- Lady,
- Quick, go find a physician,

173
00:11:57,828 --> 00:11:59,668
No, there's no time,
Hurry, take her to Han Si Medical Office,

174
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,032
My lady,

175
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:26,016
How's the Madam?

176
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,144
I'll go in and take a look,

177
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:37,408
You can't go in now,

178
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,088
My lady,

179
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:49,216
How is Madam now?

180
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,148
The wound has been treated,

181
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:54,628
But due to the depth of the wound,
what comes next,

182
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,148
we can only leave it to fate now,

183
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:02,028
Leave it to fate?
What are you even talking about?

184
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:10,028
I've done my best, I really have,

185
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:21,188
When Senior Official comes back,
how will we explain?

186
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:25,632
My Lady,

187
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:31,308
My Lady,

188
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:57,748
Kudi Liuli is critically injured,
and she may not make it,

189
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:58,988
She is already at Han Si's,

190
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:02,128
What about Pei Xingjian?
He burned the tax documents,

191
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:03,228
He is on the way back,

192
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,708
Get to the stronghold fast,

193
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:09,148
Order the commander of Xizhou stronghold
to enter the city with troops,

194
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:10,848
Yes

195
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:35,392
How is the lady?

196
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:39,296
Speak up,

197
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,148
My lord, my lord, my lord,

198
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:47,648
My lord,

199
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,432
Take good care of the lady,

200
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:53,908
Han Si, take good care of the lady,

201
00:14:56,548 --> 00:14:58,048
Although Han Si said "leave it to fate",

202
00:14:58,048 --> 00:14:59,348
He never said there is no hope,

203
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:00,888
Han Si didn't say there is no hope,

204
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,208
The lady is a person of good fortune,
surely has heaven's protection,

205
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,264
Senior Official,

206

207

You cannot go, Senior Official,
Please think it through,

209
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:19,104

214

Pei Xingjian, Senior Official of Xizhou,

215
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:27,668
Your taxation has provoked the public,

216
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:29,948
What does this have to do with Qu family?

217
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:33,668
Today, you barge in my home with a sword,

218
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:37,788
Are you trying to kill
both Protector-General and me?

219
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:47,508
Senior Official Pei has committed
such a ridiculous act today,

220
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:51,828
It is surely because of the sadness and anger,
they made you lost your mind,

221
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:55,788
Considering your honorable lady
is seriously injured at this moment,

222
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:58,508
I shall forgive you,

223
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:02,560
But if Senior Official Pei commits

224
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,868
such disobedient and rebellious act again,

225
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:11,428
I will surely punish you
according to the law and will never condone it,

Madam, madam, good news,

238
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:57,128
Rumors are saying that
there was a sudden uprising in the Xizhou,

239
00:21:57,128 --> 00:21:59,108
Kudi Liuli was stabbed in the street,

240

She's seriously injured,
and her fate is unknown,

Congratulations Madam, best wishes to Madam,

242
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:08,788
Don't be happy yet,

243
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:11,388
Have we not been deceived enough lately?

244
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:13,708
How come neither of you ever learns?

245
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:18,048
This time it should be correct,

246
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:21,908
Now all caravans coming from Xizhou
are spreading this news,

247
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:24,352
There are even rumors about Pei Xingjian,

248
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:27,428
He broke into the Protector-General's Mansion
and was beaten half to death,

249
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:29,888
The story is told with convincing details,

250
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,388
It doesn't seem to be made up,

251
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:34,188
Are there any letters from Qu Zhizhan?

252
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:36,068
None received yet,

253
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,988
Send someone to inquire around,

254
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:40,868
I want to know the exact news,

255
00:22:41,988 --> 00:22:43,040
Yes, yes,

256
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:49,148
If the news is true,
I would like to see for myself,

257
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:52,408
Kudi Liuli, near her demise,

258
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:54,708
Sickly lying on the bed,

259
00:22:56,868 --> 00:22:59,788

How are you feeling? Has your health improved?

263
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:50,108
It's the same,
I feel uncomfortable in my chest,

264
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:56,068
I wonder how that child, Liuli, is doing,

265
00:23:57,428 --> 00:23:59,828
Ever since I heard she got injured,

266
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:03,348
I haven't slept peaceful in one night,

267
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:09,108
Have you received any news from Shouyue?

268
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:14,748
With this kind of thing going on,

269
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:16,832
Why is there not even
a bit of news from Shouyue?

270
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:17,908
It's really driving me crazy,

271
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:20,468
Alright, alright, You shouldn't be too anxious,

272
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:24,188
I think the reason he didn't inform us,

273
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:27,468
Maybe it's he doesn't want us to worry,

274
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:32,988

Liuli,

280
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:21,888
Liuli,

281
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:38,948
It is Liuli's fault, I made you worry,

282
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:41,828
What nonsense are you talking about?

283
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:45,828
It's good that you're alright, it's good,

284
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:50,348
Come, come, come, please sit down,

285
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:56,148
Foster mother, are you alright?

286
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,168
Your foster mother, upon hearing the news
of you being stabbed,

287
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:03,348
She has been unable to eat or drink,
she has been extremely worried for days,

288
00:26:04,348 --> 00:26:07,908
Her distress became too much to bear,
and she fell ill after few days,

Tell me why did you pretend to be assassinated?

293
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,968
And why did you secretly return to Chang'an?

294
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:56,988
What exactly is going on here?

<i>[The Virtue of Mountains and Rivers]</i>
Lady Jing, Lady Jing, come back!

296
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:05,428
That day, with the help of Lady Jing,

297
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:07,268
I gained an audience
with Qu Zhizhan and his son,

298
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:08,628
An opportunity to sit down for discussion,

299
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:11,668
I also learned something from Qu Zhizhan,

300
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:12,988
The reason why he attempted to

301
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:14,508
kill us both,

302
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:16,308
Which is

303
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:18,068
Princess Linhai,

304
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:22,308
She threatens me with the lives
of Fuxian and Song'er,

305
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,468
She wanted me to eliminate
Pei Xingjian and his wife,

306
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:29,048
That evil princess again,

307
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,308
How can she be so cruel?

308
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:33,148
Insisting on killing you,

309
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:36,308
Calm down, let Liuli explain more,

310
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:39,072
What happened then?

311
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:41,568
After that,

312
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:45,648
I don't know where your confidence comes from,

313
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:47,508
What kind of method could it be?

314
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:51,548
To making that arrogant princess obey meekly,

315
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:53,948
I'm not saying that I doubt you, Madam,

316
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:58,228
But this is about the lives
of my daughter-in-law and grandson,

317
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,548
It's better to know the specifics,

318
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:04,668
You should know the relationship
between me and Empress Wu,

319
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:07,548
If the Empress Wu intervenes
and pressures Hedong Duke's Mansion,

320
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:11,328
Do you think the Princess
would dare to forcefully detain people?

321
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:13,668
The deep sisterhood between you and Empress Wu,

322
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:16,388
Of course, I know it,

323
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:25,948
But why Senior Official Pei was convicted
is also known by the world,

324
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:33,168
The wedge between Senior Official Pei
and Empress has been resolved for a long time,

325
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:37,148
Otherwise, how would Madam Yang be willing
to help me deal with the princess?

326
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:40,828
And how could Shouyue agree to donate

327
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:42,428
all the ancestral property to the court?

328
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:49,536
This is unexpected,
Senior Official Pei also understands

329
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,148
to preserve himself and flatter deliberately,

330
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,508
I truly do not agree
to make Lady Wu as the Empress,

331
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:03,268
When his Majesty asked that day,
I responded just like that,

332
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:09,908
Although my demotion was a sham,
my quarrels with Empress Wu was real,

333
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,908
Shouyue,

334
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:12,992
There's no need to hide this matter,

335
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:17,468
Shouyue, I said there's no wedge
between you and Sister Wu,

336
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:19,308
Actually, I'm not talking nonsense,

337
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:23,468
Before I left Chang'an, I had met Sister Wu,

338
00:29:24,188 --> 00:29:25,388
Besides saying goodbye to her,

339
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:29,228
I also delivered a pledge letter
that you wrote yourself to her,

340
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:36,108
This is something Pei Shouyue entrusted me
to give to you before he left,

341
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:39,188
You better think it through,

342
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,632
I have thought it through,

343
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:45,228
<i>[Shouyue]</i>
What are you talking about, a pledge?

344
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:47,744
I wrote it personally?

345
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:52,608
It was forged by me,

346
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:53,688
Liuli,

347
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:55,308
You promised her in the letter,

348
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:58,388
Although in the future,
you will not openly support Empress Wu,

349
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:00,868
You will also no longer be an enemy
of Wu family,

350
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:03,888
And after arriving Xizhou,

351
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:06,228
You will do your utmost
to subdue the Qu family for her,

352
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:09,708
Let the whole Xizhou look up to Empress Wu
as the leader,

353
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:12,868
Liuli, how could you make such a promise?

354
00:30:13,748 --> 00:30:16,068
Anyway, I have already solved it for Shouyue,

355
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:17,868
The wedge between him and Sister Wu,

356
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,708
It's something Protector-General
does not need to worry about,

357
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:26,508
Liuli, you didn't really make that letter,
did you?

358
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,188
Or did you just say it to deceive them?

359
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:31,928
In fact, when Shouyue returned home,

360
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,508
he asked me the same question,

361
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:35,788
So what was your answer?

362
00:30:35,788 --> 00:30:37,148
You didn't really make that, did you?

363
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,448
I know the character of Shouyue,

364
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:42,428
If you made this letter behind his back,

365
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,388
I'm really worried about him,

366
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:45,388
Please calm down,

367
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:53,788
Liuli, is that pledge letter a real thing?

368
00:30:57,668 --> 00:30:58,720
It's true,

369
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:01,988
I know you'll blame me,

370
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:05,908
I also know that by doing this,
I will tarnish your reputation,

371
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:10,428
But for the sake of keeping you alive,
I can't care about that,

372
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:13,984
Do you know?

373
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:18,708
I would rather die
than live in such a compromised way,

374
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:19,748
You must live,

375
00:31:21,108 --> 00:31:22,828
If you truly wish the best of Tang Dynasty,

376
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:25,508
Think about his Majesty, Think about me,

377
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:29,600
Then you won't cut off your own future,
sever your own path to life,

378
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,628
Liuli,

379
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:33,388
You and I are both aware
of Empress Wu's tactics and ambition,

380
00:31:34,108 --> 00:31:36,108
The headaches of his Majesty
are occurring more frequently,

381
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,228
And his health is deteriorating,

382
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:42,868
At this rate, it's only a matter of time
before Empress Wu takes power,

383
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:47,528
If you don't protect yourself
and preserve your valuable life now,

384
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:48,864
by that time,

385
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:51,628
who will be there to counter Empress Wu
and share his Majesty's worries?

386
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,548
If you wish for death,
it couldn't be any easier,

387
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:57,848
But all you could preserve
is that bit of integrity,

388
00:31:57,848 --> 00:31:59,788
You will leave nothing but
an empty name of a loyal Senior Official,

389
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:04,708
But in reality, you have disappointed the world
and his Majesty,

390
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:08,512
And you have disappointed me,

391
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:17,748
The lesson from my wife

392
00:32:19,468 --> 00:32:20,828
strikes me like a lightning,

393
00:32:22,788 --> 00:32:24,028
I suddenly understand now,

394
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:27,360
I have learned my lesson,

395
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:36,028
I took the initiative to do the thing
you least wanted to do,

396
00:32:37,268 --> 00:32:40,388
And I made you betray your nature
to bear insults and burdens, I…

397
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:43,108
I know that everything you do is for my good,

398
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:50,628
Liuli, at such a young age, have such insight,

399
00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:53,788
As your foster father, I am truly impressed,

400
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:59,188
Having a wife like you,
how fortunate Shouyue is,

401
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:02,408
Foster father, you are exaggerating,

402
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:04,908
What you say really flatters Liuli,

403
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:08,228
How am I exaggerating?
I am your foster father, what I said is truth,

404
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:10,108
Foster mother,

405
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:11,508
What's there to be embarrassed about?

406
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:14,548
My daughter is so good,
Why wouldn't you let me praise you?

407
00:33:17,308 --> 00:33:20,948
Father Qu and his son from Xizhou
are difficult to deal with,

408
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:24,988
If you are merely trying to persuade them
to support Empress Wu,

409
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:26,688
I'm afraid it's not enough,

410
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,628
That is a given,

411
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:29,748
What happened next?

412
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:33,188
We spent almost an entire night,

413
00:33:33,188 --> 00:33:36,268
explaining all the advantages
and disadvantages to them,

414
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,908
We were completely sincere,

415
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:42,828
Shouyue talked about the times and situations,
and the will of his Majesty,

416
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:44,628
And the governance of Xizhou,

417
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:47,748
Perhaps moved by our sincerity,

418
00:33:48,508 --> 00:33:51,688
Both of them finally agreed to believe that
we truly have no malicious intent,

419
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:54,708
This applies to Qu family,
and even more so to Xizhou,

420
00:33:56,908 --> 00:34:00,808
Madam Kudi truly has far-reaching insight,

421
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:03,148
Such remarks are thought-provoking,

422
00:34:03,148 --> 00:34:06,028
It indeed makes us men feel greatly ashamed,

423
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,948
I have clearly understood your words,

424
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:12,992
Qu family has always been loyal
to Tang Dynasty,

425
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,388
To his Majesty, to Empress Wu,

426
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,768
We have always been faithfully devoted,

427
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:23,136
I still have doubts, please do not hesitate
to enlighten me, Madam,

428
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:24,328
Chongyu,

429
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,588
It's no trouble, just speak freely, Minister,

430
00:34:27,428 --> 00:34:29,268
If we were to align with Empress Wu,

431
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:33,628
What benefits would there be for Qu family?

432
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:43,668
Qu Family in Chang'an will never be bullied,

433
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:46,468
Xizhou, however, will never change its master,

434
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:49,148
You, Qu Chongyu,
can demonstrate your capabilities,

435
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:50,868
Fulfil your wishes,

436
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:58,188
Madam Kudi, for all this time,

437
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:01,228
You have fooled me a lot,

438
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:03,708
You are joking, Minister,

439
00:35:04,788 --> 00:35:07,208
Liuli is savage and stupid,

440
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,628
I don't have those kinds of skills,

441
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:11,588
To deceive Chongyu of Qu Family,
who is renowned in Xizhou,

442
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:16,148
You consider me as a lady,

443
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,148
so you chose to let me win,

444
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:26,948
Then I entrust Chongyu's wife and children
to my lady

445
00:35:28,308 --> 00:35:30,268
Good, very good

446
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,388
If Madam Kudi has any requirements,

447
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:36,288
Qu family shall support with all efforts,

448
00:35:36,288 --> 00:35:40,028
But I don't know how much confidence
you have in this trip,

449
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:48,508
I will stay as a hostage,

450
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:52,348
If Liuli fails the trust
of Protector-General and Minister,

451
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:53,588
You can blame on me,

452
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:54,720
Shouyue,

453
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,948
Senior Official Pei, you've overstated,
overstated,

454
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:02,708
Of course, I have confidence in Madam Kudi,

455
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,548
Alright, we'll settle the matter this way,

456
00:36:06,112 --> 00:36:07,228
It's a deal,

457
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:08,868
Yes, it's a deal,

458
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:15,028
That's how things happened,

459
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,648
All the things that happened later,

460
00:36:17,648 --> 00:36:20,708
They were all agreed by us and them,

461
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:23,788
In the streets, when that knife stabbed at you,

462
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:24,948
How did you dodge it?

463
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:29,128
Audacious peasants!
Dare to commit crime on the streets!

464
00:36:29,128 --> 00:36:30,408
Take them all down!

465
00:36:30,408 --> 00:36:33,068
The soldiers are here, run! Run! Run!

466
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:36,068
In fact, it was Minister
who arranged a fake assassin,

467
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:39,348
I stabbed myself with a specially made dagger,

468
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:43,108
The dagger contained a blood bag,
enough to create a convincing illusion,

469
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:47,188
Lady,

470
00:36:48,788 --> 00:36:51,708
After that,
I took the medicine given to me by Lady Liu,

471
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:55,428
That medicine can simulate death
and deceive all the onlookers,

472
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:57,908
Plus the cover provided by Han Si,

473
00:36:58,428 --> 00:36:59,988
It has been even more flawless,

474
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:06,788
You two really have a lot of ideas,

475
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:10,788
We were forced to
resort to this last-ditch strategy,

476
00:37:11,428 --> 00:37:12,968
If we do not make the act convincing,

477
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:15,228
Then how could we deceive Princess,

478
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,908
It seems the current priority is

479
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:20,268
to rescue the wife and child of Qu Chongyu

480
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:21,988
from Princess Linhai,

481
00:37:22,988 --> 00:37:25,708
Liuli, what is your next move?

482
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:28,988
I want to go into the palace,
and meet sister Wu,

483
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:31,888
To see if I can beg her to issue an edict,

484
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:34,708
To make Princess release
Qu Chongyu's wife and child,

485
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,428
I'm afraid Empress Wu can't help you with this,

486
00:37:42,588 --> 00:37:43,648
Why is that?

487
00:37:44,148 --> 00:37:46,028
There is a mother and son in Qu Family,

488
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:48,508
Recently,
they have won the deep affection of Princess,

489
00:37:49,188 --> 00:37:51,988
Almost everyone in the court knows about this,

490
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:56,708
Princess Linhai has also announced that
she will adopt her as a daughter,

491
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:58,868
Now I think of this,

492
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:02,568
this mother and son should be
the wife and child of Qu Chongyu,

493
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:05,108
Do you know where they are now, foster mother?

494
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,548
They are in Hedong Duke's Mansion,

495
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:11,868
But they have not been put under house arrest,
nor have they been threatened,

496
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:15,068
Contrarily, Princess is extremely nice to them

497
00:38:15,908 --> 00:38:18,628
This mother and son also
cherish the kindness of Princess,

498
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:21,548
Such a mutually agreeable situation,

499
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:24,908
Even Empress Wu may be helpless against it,

500
00:38:27,228 --> 00:38:30,668
it seems I need to find a way
to meet this mother and son first,

501
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:33,188
But will they believe you?

502
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:36,328
I have a token from Protector-General Qu on me,

503
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:39,468
If she sees it,
she will definitely believe that what I say,

504
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:44,708
Foster father,
can you arrange a meeting with them for me?

505
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:52,128
Let me think,

506
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:03,828
Bring some more preserved fruits, hurry,

507
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:07,232
Hurry,

508
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:36,908
Is there any news?

509
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:42,188
Madam, I have thoroughly investigated,

510
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:44,888
This uprising in Xizhou,

511
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:47,428
It is due to Pei Xingjian's forceful collection
of taxes,

512
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:51,108
Those peasants were very angry,
they barged into Pei's Mansion,

513
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:53,588
Kudi Liuli made a hasty escape,

514
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:56,448
She was stabbed in the street by rioters after,

515
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:58,228
There were many witnesses to the incident,

516
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:02,788
I also verified the news from multiple sources
and confirmed it was true,

517
00:40:03,908 --> 00:40:05,428
She got what she deserved,

518
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:08,748
Good, very good,

519
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:13,068
What about Pei Xingjian?

520
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:16,948
Pei Xingjian,

521
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:21,388
Pei Xingjian caused a great disturbance
at Protector-General's Mansion,

522
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:25,908
But he quelled the public anger
by burning the tax records,

523
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:28,228
Madam, don't be angry

524
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:34,828
This cursed one, is so hard to kill,

525
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:37,068
Madam, please be calm,

526
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:40,108
We were able to eliminate Kudi Liuli this time,

527
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:41,628
That's a good thing,

528
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:43,708
Madam, you should be happy,

529
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,736
What do you know?

530
00:40:46,548 --> 00:40:48,548
Even though Kudi Liuli is hateful,

531
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:51,588
But in the end,
she was nothing more than a minor irritation,

532
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:54,068
But Pei Xingjian is not the case,

533
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:56,868
He is the real trouble for us,

534
00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:01,588
Until today, I finally understand,

535
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:06,868
His demotion to Xizhou is just a show
played by him and his Majesty,

536
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:12,068
The day he returns will be the day
he becomes a prime minister,

537
00:41:12,628 --> 00:41:14,508
But he opposed making Lady Wu as Empress,

538
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:17,508
How could the Wu family let him rise to power?

539
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:21,708
Fool, if he really opposed
making Lady Wu as Empress,

540
00:41:22,348 --> 00:41:24,908
How could the Wu family help that Kudi Liuli?

541
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,828
Forcing me to watch

542
00:41:27,828 --> 00:41:30,448
the farmland that belonged to me

543
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,988
being taken away by others relentlessly,

544
00:41:34,148 --> 00:41:36,588
Madam, Madam,

545
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:40,308
Donating the family estate,

546
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:44,988
That was the first step
of Pei Xingjian's revenge,

547
00:41:44,988 --> 00:41:47,948
If we let him return alive from Xizhou,

548
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,068
Our good days would be over,

549
00:41:59,988 --> 00:42:04,428
Do you think all these years
Pei Xingjian has been suffering

550
00:42:04,428 --> 00:42:07,068
is to watch us enjoy wealth and honor?

551
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:11,188
I didn't think of that,

552
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:13,920
Cui,

553
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:15,872
Madam,

554
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:19,628
For some reason,
I always feel something is not right,

555
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:23,168
That Qu Zhizhan has never reported to me,

556
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:24,748
It really defies common sense,

557
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:27,228
Prepare more people,

558
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:30,508
In a few days, they may be of great use,
