3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,100
Extraordinary times call for
extraordinary measures,

4
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,620
If the army arrives with a lack of grain,
it won't be child's play,

5
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,380
The Senior Official holds the post of
political leadership in Xizhou,

6
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,900
This will certainly lead to serious crimes,

7
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,940
Well, Advisor's words are very true,

8
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,700
In that case, this important task
is given to you,

9
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,220
I'm sure you will not disappoint me,

10
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,180
as well as Protector-General Qu,

11
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,520
Senior Official, your remarks are incorrect,

12
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,700
What virtues and abilities do humble me have
to undertake such a heavy responsibility?

13
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,060
Only with your intervention
can it be resolved easily,

14
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,460
Advisor Zhang, why be so modest?

15
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,340
You are from a famous family in Xizhou,

16
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,340
And the advisor of the army of Xizhou as well,

17
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,180
In terms of roots and connections,
you are not inferior to me,

18
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,700
You just spoke with such certainty,

19
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,500
You must be confident in your plan by now,

20
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,200
Are you deliberately devising this strategy

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,500
to trap me into injustice?

22
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,780
This subordinate wouldn't dare,

23
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,860
-If not, then good,
-It's just--

24
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,620
I now order you to go to Wucheng,

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,940
To be in charge of this tax collection affair,

26
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,500
Since you are to offset it
with your family property,

27
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,360
I give you a deadline in seven days

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,500
to investigate the assets of
five hundred households in Wucheng,

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,900
And start the collection seven days later,

30
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,776
All set,

31
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:10,580
Senior--

32
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,700
You should also go back early
and get prepared well,

33
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,700
I await the good news,

34
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:17,800
Senior Official,

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,100
Advisor Zhang, sorry to trouble you,

36
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,980
Take care, I won't see you out,

37
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,280
Take care,

38
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,620
I must take my leave now,

39
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,640
You guys, hold on,

40
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,620
You have been in charge of the tax affairs
these past few years,

41
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,392
Exactly,

42
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,024
You guys have truly worked hard,

43
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,760
In Xizhou, each family on average

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,580
has three years of regular and government rents
arrears, and five years of adjustment arrears,

45
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,540
While there are still surplus
grain and silk in warehouse,

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,300
That's all due to your merit,

47
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,900
But the large army will arrive
before this autumn,

48
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,120
I have to trouble you two,

49
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,580
Face this difficult situation with me,

50
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,180
After you go back, think it over carefully,

51
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,900
How exactly can we get through
this predicament?

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,584
Yes, yes,

53
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:36,100
<i>[Notice: Cooperate with Pei Xingjian
to straighten out tax payments in Xizhou]</i>

54
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,260
Come see, come see, come see,

55
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,060
What, what is this?

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,780
Look, look, look,

57
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,180
This, this rent adjustment…

58
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,720
Hu Da, where are you going?

59
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,140
Go wherever I can,

60
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,140
Being a fugitive is better than
not being able to pay this rent adjustment,

61
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,800
and being caught into jail,

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,980
Yes, yes,

63
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,260
It's hard to leave as well as stay now,

64
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,400
We've only had a few years of peace,

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,180
The officials of the government
are troubling us of Xizhou again,

66
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,260
Our Wucheng village is much poorer
than other places,

67
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,160
Nor do we have decent pastures or orchards,

68
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,420
Life is harder here than in other places,

69
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,500
How many families can at once

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,180
take out over ten dans of grain
and over ten pieces of silk,

71
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,980
to pay the rent and taxes owed
for several years?

72
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,960
This Senior Official Pei

73
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,420
<i>[Notice]</i>
seems determined to push us into a corner,

74
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,020
Exactly, those officials mercilessly
exploit people,

75
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,580
They only think about their own promotion
and wealth,

76
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,020
Not caring about our life or death at all,

77
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,600
Since they won't let us live,

78
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,840
then we will fight it out with them,

79
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,420
That's right, we can't pay the rent anyway,

80
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,780
Either way, it's a matter of life and death,
and we'll fight,

81
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,700
Let's just go and raid Senior Official's house,

82
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,820
Let them know how powerful we are!

83
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,860
- Fight with them!
- Fight Fight Fight!

84
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,100
Fight, fight, fight!

85
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,700
I have already seen the settlement results
of past years' accounts,

86
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,020
The amount of rent owed by each county
in Xizhou is quite astonishing,

87
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,980
If they are forced to pay off their debts,

88
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,060
I'm afraid six or seven out of every
ten households will have to migrate elsewhere,

89
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,860
But if I don't pursue the collection,

90
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,040
Once the army arrives this autumn,

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,420
Xizhou does not have enough money and grain
to supply the military,

92
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,300
I, as the Senior Official in charge of taxation,
am also unforgivable,

93
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,460
Therefore, about the matter of rent
and tax adjustment,

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,220
Whether I agree or not,
the result is the same - death,

95
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,336
This is called a dead-end,

96
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,900
Since the Senior Official
knows it's a dead-end,

97
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,500
Why would you still take on this matter?

98
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,780
Indeed, this situation is a dead-end,

99
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,940
But if this drags on,
things will only get worse,

100
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,180
If someone takes over, any improper handling
may lead to serious consequences,

101
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,180
The hard work of our government
in Xizhou for more than a decade,

102
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,260
would be destroyed in an instant,

103
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,060
This fall, we will inevitably
have a battle with the North,

104
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,060
The mighty army of ten thousand soldiers
led by Ashina Helu is embattled,

105
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,580
At that time, Xizhou will be the rear camp
of this country,

106
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,340
If there is a hidden danger in this rear camp
due to the imposition of taxes and levies,

107
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,260
and be instigated into turmoil
by those with ulterior motives,

108
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,260
How can the front line army
still win this battle then?

109
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,860
Senior Official's meaning is?

110
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,740
Since it's a dead-end that cannot be solved,

111
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,720
The only way is to break through it,

112
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,260
Senior Official intends to…

113
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,340
No, no, this move might just
break the stalemate,

114
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,940
but for you, it's all harm and no benefit,

115
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,820
What needs to be done must be done,
what ought to be shouldered must be shouldered,

116
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,940
How can it be entirely decided by benefits?

117
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,180
As the Senior Official of Xizhou,

118
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,300
if I don't do certain things, who will?

119
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,980
I appreciate your kindness,

120
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,020
There are things that shouldn't
be said by Cheng,

121
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,460
But right now, I really can't afford
to care about so much,

122
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,240
You must be aware of the Qu family's
ill intentions towards you,

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,880
They have asked you to manage the taxation,

124
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,060
Their malicious intentions are now
plainly revealed,

125
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,260
Indeed, you are someone who would
sacrifice life for righteousness,

126
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,700
Yet even if you do not
consider yourself, still…

127
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,120
For the sake of the family,

128
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,740
Please consider for the Madam,

129
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,860
As the Senior Official of Xizhou,

130
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,700
this is my responsibility,

131
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,460

he fell off the horse,

151
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,960

What are you doing?

161
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,860
Senior Official Pei is an official
of the government,

162
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,240
He is also the leading official of Xizhou,

163
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,500
He won't disregard the lives
of the people in Xizhou,

164
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,020
We should believe that the actions
of Senior Official Pei

165
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,320
are to improve the lives
of the people in Xizhou,

166
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,840
What would a woman like you understand!

167
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,860
I heard that in some villages,

168
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,420
there are already some officials from Xizhou,

169
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,740
They are led by the chief of the village,

170
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,900
going door-to-door to collect taxes,

171
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,460
They have intruded into every family's home,

172
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,120
And forced them to fingerprint
on the tax arrears note,

173
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,640
They even inspected our food and goods,

174
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,980
You are the wife of Senior Official Pei,

175
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,240
Naturally, you spoke in his favor,

176
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,140
We mustn't listen to her beguiling here,

177
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,980
Exactly, exactly, exactly!

178
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,740
<i>[Pei's Mansion]</i>
My lady, this is bad, you should go back now,

179
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,920
Since the Protector-General Qu
family returned to Xizhou,

180
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,100
It wasn't easy for us to get
enough to eat and wear,

181
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,240
When Senior Official Pei came,
we thought he was a good official,

182
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
Just a few days and he wants to
collect the taxes,

183
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,180
He seems not different from
the previous officials,

184
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,860
Those corrupt officials named Qiao and Guo,

185
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,020
He is going to drive us to death,

186
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,100
If you don't let us live, we will fight you!

187
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,136
Fight them!

188
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:25,900
Listen to me!

189
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,180
Fight, fight!

190
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,540
I assure you that Senior Official Pei

191
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,420
will surely never leave his people
in a dead-end,

192
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,840
Please have faith in the Senior Official,

193
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,296
Please give the Senior Official more time,

194
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:36,340
Enough is enough!

195
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,820
My lady, let's go back first,

196
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,900
My lady and Senior Official

197
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,860
are all good people who think
for the sake of the citizens,

198
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,680
Please don't be so impulsive,

199
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,020
They won't let us have it easy,

200
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,140
Let's not make it easy for them either,

201
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,780
Exactly, clear the way, clear the way!

202
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,540
My lady, my lady!

203
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:56,820
What are you doing?

204
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,888
Don't be impulsive now,

205
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:00,180
Senior Official Pei will surely resolve
the matter of the taxes,

206
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,740
But if you barge into the Senior Officials home
and commit violence,

207
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,620
Have you thought about the consequences
you'll have to face?

208
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,664
Move away!

209
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:06,688
Stop this nonsense!

210
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:07,776
Let go of your grip!

211
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:08,864
My lady!

212
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,200
My lady!

213
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,104
Giddyap!

214
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,940
- Giddyap!
- What's going on?

215
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,140
The officials are coming!
The officials are coming!

216
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,580
Run fast! Go, go, go!

217
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,700
- Giddyap!
- Run quickly!

218
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:43,296
Giddyap!

219
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,320
Move, move, move,

220
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,380
<i>[Pei's Mansion]</i>
Liuli, where are you hurt? Where?

221
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,540
I'm fine,

222
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,680
Bai San, call for Physician Han quickly,

223
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,704
Yes,

224
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,660
Tan, Tan,

225
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,260
Don't worry, I'm fine,

226
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,820
I think you are not well at all, Stop talking,

227
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,080
Madam's injuries are mostly
abrasions and sprains,

228
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
The wounds have been cleaned and bandaged,

229
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,140
You can change the medicine the day after,

230
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,260
This is our Han family's ancestral trauma wine,

231
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,000
Applying this to the wound can
reduce swelling and remove stasis,

232
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,380
It will be a bit painful,
Madam needs to endure,

233
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,180
Thank you for your trouble, Physician Han,

234
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,220
Tan is also injured,

235
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,860
Could Physician Han please give Tan
a treatment as well,

236
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,056
Alright,

237
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:56,576
- Ni, pay Physician Han more consultation fee,
- Yes,

238
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:58,300
Madam, what are you talking about,

239
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,580
How could I accept the consultation fee
from someone who did me a favor,

240
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,860
Physician Han, please don't decline anymore,

241
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,560
This is also a token of my lady's good will,

242
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,800
Right, Physician Han, just accept it,

243
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,760
Ni, see off Physician Han,

244
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,816
Yes,

245
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,860
It hurts, can you be gentler,

246
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,420
Endure it a bit,

247
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,340
It will hurt more tomorrow if we don't
remove stasis and make the blood circulate,

248
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,300
Look at you, with all these injuries,
it's so dangerous,

249
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,340
Consider yourself lucky today,

250
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,540
If I had arrived even later,

251
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,020
It won't be minor injuries
and ailments anymore,

252
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,380
You might even have lost your life,

253
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,060
Aren't you here to save me?

254
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,580
I didn't expect that Qu Zhizhan

255
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,220
would actually go so far as to
incite a rebellion,

256
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,740
He is so reckless, It's beyond my expectations,

257
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,140
Rest assured, I already have a solution,

258
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,300
I will surely not disappoint them,

259
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,820
Even if you solved this tax problem,

260
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,740
As long as the Grand Princess

261
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,940
still holds the wife and children
of Qu Chongyu,

262
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,940
Then Qu Zhizhan will not cease
his intention to kill us,

263
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,940
Shouyue, I want to return to Chang'an,

264
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,500
Although I am not completely sure that
I will succeed,

265
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,820
I think it's worth taking a gamble,

266
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,700
That is our only chance to turn the tables,

267
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,640
My foster father and Empress Wu
are in Chang'an,

268
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,060
I will not be in danger,

269
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:05,900
Today, Protector-General made the order to

270
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,580
withdraw all the guards outside the courtyard,

271
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,100
After that, the public went to make trouble,

272
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,360
Madam Kudi got hurt,

273
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,700
Also, I just saw many officers in the yard,

274
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,520
Minister,

275
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,840
What does this mean?

276
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,780
We are here to guard
under the command of Protector-General,

277
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,820
Minister, the people in the city
are rebelling right now,

278
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,780
It may be dangerous to go out at this time,

279
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,704
Please stay in the workshop for now,

280
00:16:40,704 --> 00:16:41,728
Stand aside,

281
00:16:41,728 --> 00:16:43,900
Protector-General
has strict orders not to let you leave,

282
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,740
Otherwise, our lives would be in danger,

283
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,220
Please understand, Minister,

284
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,100
Let go or I'm going to kill you now,

285
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,060
If Minister kills me, only one of us will die,

286
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,140
If I let you out today,

287
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,488
then my entire family will be dead,

288
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:00,580
Fine, then…

289
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,940
- Minister!
- I will kill you,

290
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,220
If I were to stop you,

291
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,100
would you also have to kill me then?

292
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,980
Chongyu, you'll have to endure a few days
in the workshop first,

293
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,820
Wait until things settle down outside,

294
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,260
Then you can go wherever you like,

295
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,180
I won't interfere with you at all,

296
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,820
Father, are you hiding something from me?

297
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,580
What could I possibly be hiding from you?

298
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,100
I won't let you go out,

299
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,240
I am truly concerned for your safety,

300
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,380
You are my only son,

301
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,520
If anything were to happen to you,

302
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,540
how could I go on living afterwards?

303
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,220
What if I insist on going out?

304
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,900
Father, Pei Xingjian's visit
to Xizhou this time

305
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,220
is definitely not as simple as it seems,

306
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,540
If you persist on killing him,

307
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,440
I'm afraid this will bring disaster
to the Qu family,

308
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,552
If I don't kill him, that will bring disaster
to the Qu family,

309
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:24,640
Father,

310
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,460
I know what you're worried about,

311
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,300
Although I'm old, I'm not senile yet,

312
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,300
Protector-General, something bad has happened

313
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,100
What happened?

314
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,800
For some reason, Madam Qu and Prefect Wang
started arguing,

315
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,580
Madam Qu is now threatening to hang herself,

316
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,620
Lady Jing, what are you
messing around with again?

317
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,312
Where is Lady Jing? Why are you here?

318
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,224
Protector-General, Minister,

319
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,260
I'm asking you, where is Lady Jing?

320
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:13,020
Someone come!

321
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,048
No need to shout,

322
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,860
Lady Jing has sent the guard away,

323
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,300
No one will come to disturb us in a short time,

324
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,700
Father, brother, Liuli and Senior Official Pei

325
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,140
are not here to harm our Qu family,

326
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,220
I reckon there must be misunderstandings
between you guys,

327
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,880
Let's have a deep discussion tonight,

328
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,620
Lady Jing, what are you trying to do?
Open the door!

329
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,660
Stop shouting, your loud voice is of no use,

330
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,700
I did this completely for our Qu family,

331
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,680
Stay calm and have a good chat
with Senior Official Pei,

332
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,020
Once you have settled your details,
I will open the door,

333
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,180
Stop messing around, open the door for me!

334
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,600
Madam, locking me up is one thing,

335
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,340
Isn't it inappropriate
to treat the Protector-General like this?

336
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,800
If I don't lock them inside,

337
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,020
can they have a proper conversation?

338
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,740
Have you forgotten that
you asked me to help them?

339
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,100
Wang Junmeng, I've heard your voice,

340
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,980
Hurry up and open the door for me,
did you hear that!

341
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,120
- I'm coming,
- Come over here,

342
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,740
Why explain when you've already done it?

343
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,380
Look at yourself,

344
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,020
But madam, madam, you…

345
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,420
- Protector-General…
- Will you leave or not?

346
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,740
Protector-General, I'll come and open
the door for you in a moment,

347
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,140
Lady Jing, Lady Jing, come back to me!

348
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,380
Hurry and open the door!

349
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,620
Don't think that just because
you've persuaded Lady Jing,

350
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,260
you can live in peace,

351
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,660
This is Xizhou,

352
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,940
Even if you have taken me hostage,
it doesn't change anything,

353
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,820
It still won't change anything,

354
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,300
Protector-General, you are mistaken,
We have no malicious intent in visiting,

355
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,140
No malicious intent?

356
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,700
Ever since you arrived in Xizhou,

357
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,500
I've tried to kill you several times,

358
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,080
Now, you're all aware of this
and still had the audacity to come,

359
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,100
And you dare to say you bear me no harm?

360
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,920
We are aware of what you've done

361
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,620
is not your true intention,

362
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,620
You are being threatened
and have no choice but to comply,

363
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
So, I think,

364
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
we can have an honest discussion,

365
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,140
Who exactly is threatening you?

366
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,500
Who exactly is forcing you?

367
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,660
And who is holding the leverage
over our Qu family?

368
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,660
Making you take desperate risks,
even instigating a rebellion,

369
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,540
And intending to put Pei Xingjian
in a deadly situation,

370
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,656
Father,

371
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,936
Father,

372
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,780
It's the eldest Princess Linhai,

373
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,736
She uses the lives of Fuxian and Song'er
to coerce me,

374
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:36,420
She wants me to eliminate the Pei family,

375
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,780
Lady Jing, Qu Jingtang, open the door!

376
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,260
Lady Jing, Wang Junmeng!

377
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,820
Believe it or not, if you don't open the door,
I'll kill you!

378
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,080
Chongyu!

379
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:07,660
What are you going to do?

380
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,100
Return to Chang'an,

381
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,940
What's the use of going back to Chang'an now?

382
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,880
Why didn't you tell me about this?

383
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,440
I knew you would do this,

384
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,620
How would I dare to tell you?

385
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,260
Do you think by not telling me,

386
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,120
this matter could be kept secret forever?

387
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,420
Even if I told you, what could you do?

388
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,580
Are you going to break into
the Hedong Duke's Mansion?

389
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,060
Or just kill Linhai?

390
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,500
She is the esteemed Eldest Princess,

391
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,380
She's the emperor's own aunt!

392
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,500
If she doesn't hand over the person to me,

393
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,920
I don't care who she is,

394
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,900
Rebel, do you intend to destroy
the entire Qu family?

395
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,860
If I have a way to save both mother and child,

396
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,980
Would the two of you be willing
to speak with us?

397
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,900
Don't know where the Madam's confidence
comes from?

398
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,700
What method will you use

399
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,300
to let that arrogant and stubborn princess
submit obediently?

400
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,740
I am not doubting you, Madam,

401
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,540
Just that it's about the life of
my daughter-in-law and grandchild,

402
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,660
It's better to ask clearly,

403
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,540
Protector-General should know
my relationship with Empress Wu,

404
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,600
If Empress Wu puts pressure on
Hedong Duke's Mansion,

405
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,180
Do you think the eldest princess still dares
to forcibly detain people?

406
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,180
The deep sisterly bond between
Empress Wu and Madam,

407
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,900
Of course, I am aware of it,

408
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,820
But why Senior Official Pei was punished
is known to everyone,

409
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,000
May I ask, on what grounds does Empress Wu

410
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,700
help someone who opposes her?

411
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,560
Being punished is nothing more than a play
Shouyue performed with His Majesty,

412
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,980
Isn't Protector-General aware of this?

413
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,660
But Senior Official Pei

414
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,340
opposed to making Wu as the Empress,

415
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,620
This is an indisputable fact,

416
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,912
Senior Official Pei,

417
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,380
'National calamities inevitably
begin from here',

418
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,900
Presumably, those were words
from Senior Official's heart,

419
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,180
Today, I am going to tell you the truth,

420
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,300
I can give you a few more days to live,

421
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,260
What you have said today cannot convince me,

422
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,520
For the honor and disgrace of my Qu family,
I can do anything,

423
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,460
The Senior Official will continue to collect
grain and taxes tomorrow,

424
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,100
We'll discuss further once you have
another good plan, alright?

425
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,544
<i>[Pei's Mansion]</i>

426
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,940
When you go to Wucheng tomorrow,
wear more clothes, and also--

427
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,060
No worries, I will take good care of myself,

428
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,820
As for you, without me by your side,

429
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:57,056
<i>[Yong'an Bridge]</i>

430
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,760
Third brother, about tomorrow's matter,
what do you suggest we do?

431
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,400
Let's not talk much about that Wucheng village,

432
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,300
The people of Shangxian village
are known to be quite fierce,

433
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,500
I'm worried about potential accidents,

434
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,340
I'm certain that the tax payment tomorrow
will cause public grievances,

435
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,840
Isn't that the truth?

436
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,100
Then I will protect the Senior Official,

437
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,660
Number Four and Five, both of you follow me,

438
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,640
Wucheng village is about half an hour
away from Xizhou,

439
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,540
Shangxian village is quite close to Xizhou,

440
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,420
Rest of you stay in Xizhou to protect Madam,

441
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,780
To prevent people from Shangxian village
from causing trouble,

442
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,824
What do you all think?

443
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,700
Right, wouldn't doing so be foolproof?

444
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:54,016
<i>[Wucheng Village]</i>

445
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,200
I heard that Zhang Huaiji, the Advisor,
were injured from a fall off their horse,

446
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,660
Today, Senior Official Pei will personally
come to take it over,

447
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:03,700
There's such a thing too?

448
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,768
Not so good,

449
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,020
There's a rumor that Zhang Advisor

450
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,380
fell from the horse on purpose,

451
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,620
Just want to avoid this trouble,

452
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,240
Isn't this cutting off our last bit of hope?

453
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,120
That Senior Official Pei is an official
sent by the government,

454
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,580
To keep his official hat,

455
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,620
he wouldn't care about our life or death,

456
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,220
The current situation is unexpectedly severe,

457
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,820
If this group of people really
quarrel intensively,

458
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,340
Senior Official Pei might have a hard time
getting away unscathed,

459
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,820
If you ask me, the law don't punish the masses,

460
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,700
At any rate, we are at the point of
smashing the pot to sell the iron

461
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,820
and still can't make up for the taxes owed,

462
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,220
Could it be that they want to put everyone

463
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,840
- into the jail?
- If it continues on this path,

464
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,180
the Senior Official's Madam…

465
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,200
You must protect Senior Official Pei now,

466
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,260
I'll return to Senior Official's mansion first,

467
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,340
Since no one will speak for us,

468
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,432
then we will fight it out with them,

469
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:47,520
Exactly, exactly,

470
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,248
Then we should also fight for our families,

471
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:50,460
Let's give it our all!

472
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,580
Right, right, fight, fight, fight!

473
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,300
Fight, fight, fight!

474
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,392
Fight, fight!

475
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,460
Let's go, let's wait for them in Wucheng,

476
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,960
If it comes to it, we'll fight them together,

477
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,220
Right, let's go, fight with them,

478
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Today, all homeowners should go to Wucheng
to obey orders,

479
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,000
Why have so many people come?

480
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,300
If your father and brothers
go to Wucheng today,

481
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,400
Facing the evil one, how can you not worry?

482
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
Can't you not come out and take a look?

483
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,320
Senior Official Pei is not some evil one,

484
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,540
We have been being his assistant
for some time now,

485
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,280
He treats people generously and is modest,

486
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,820
Today, if you talk to him nicely,

487
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,160
Make him understand everyone's hardship,

488
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,620
I think he will also be reasonable,

489
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,300
Senior Official Pei
has already left for Wucheng,

490
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,440
But before leaving, he went to
Zhang Huaiji's house,

491
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,980
He took Zhang Huaiji with him,

492
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,680
Sigh,

493
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:06,336
<i>[Wu's Residence]</i>

494
00:33:33,524 --> 00:33:37,984
<i>[Wu's Residence]</i>

495
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,700
How come the Senior Official
brings so few people?

496
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,860
Advisor Zhang made himself fall like that

497
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,400
just to get through today,

498
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,500
Yeah, this Senior Official Pei has a great
official presence,

499
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,420
I think this Senior Official Pei

500
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,380
doesn't seem to want us to live,

501
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,408
Yes,

502
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,940
Why were all the households in Wucheng
summoned today,

503
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,660
Presumably, you all must already know,

504
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,700
The land tax in our township is overdue
not just for one day,

505
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,620
The current situation is turbulent
and military provisions are tight,

506
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,260
It is precisely the time for Xizhou to unite
in overcoming the difficulties,

507
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,460
The Senior Official Pei is right here now,

508
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,560
It is hoped that everyone will recognize
the overall situation,

509
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,060
Do not think that you can
muddle through this time as well,

510
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,980
Senior Official,
we have followed your instructions,

511
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,860
The 382 households of Wucheng city have been

512
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,300
cleared of their overdue accounts,

513
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,500
And the registration of their properties
is complete,

514
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,088
Senior Official, please issue the order,

515
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,540
Senior Official,
the day has already grown late,

516
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,140
Shouldn't we start the clearing earlier,

517
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,780
According to Advisor Zhang's opinion,
how should we begin the clearing?

518
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,680
This subordinate has already become like this,

519
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,460
Senior Official, please don't make it
difficult for me,

520
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,340
Clear it however you wish to,

521
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,540
I can clear it however I wish to?

522
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,820
Just ensure not to arouse public anger,

523
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:13,540
Otherwise, your subordinate--

524
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,740
If I inadvertently arouse
public anger in a while,

525
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,664
In this state,

526
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,940
I'm afraid you can't run away,

527
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,620
<i>[Shangxian Village]</i>
Today, that Senior Official Pei

528
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,740
has gone to Wucheng Village
to collect overdue rent,

529
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,820
He even threatened that,

530
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,280
those who can't pay back the overdue rent
will offset the loan with their property,

531
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,820
What, the property?

532
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,180
Everyone, listen to me,

533
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,940
I believe everyone is the same as me,

534
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,340
We all are poor families from
Shangxian village,

535
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,540
From today onwards, we will lose our homes,

536
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,660
fields, and all our belongings,

537
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,800
We have no other choice but to become refugees,

538
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,500
My child has just been born,

539
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,180
How can he bear the hardships
of being a refugee?

540
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,300
Isn't this making me watch him die young?

541
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,500
My father is old with a serious leg illness,

542
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,740
How are we supposed to live like this?

543
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,400
Since Senior Official Pei
has seized our property,

544
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,520
we can also seize his property,

545
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,260
Right, let's go to his place,

546
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,800
If he robs us, we will rob him back,

547
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,540
Let's go, to Pei's Mansion!

548
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,920
Let's go, reclaim it,

549
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,380
Teach that Madam Kudi a lesson,

550
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,140
Go, take it back, take it back!

551
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,600
How is the situation outside?

552
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,820
Return to the mansion first,

553
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,864
- Go,
- Go,

554
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,328
Quick, hurry,

555
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,380
My lady, your injuries have not yet healed,

556
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,500
Hurry back to your room and rest,

557
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,168
My lady, you should go back quickly,
we got it here,

558
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,980
<i>[Wu's Residence]</i>
I bid all village leaders to step forward,

559
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,696
Yes,

560
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,920
Go,

561
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,064
No need for such courtesy,

562
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,900
I have something I don't understand,

563
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,020
I hope you all can answer it for me,

564
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,940
Today, half of the citizens
of Wucheng are here,

565
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,860
They all seem to be hardworking
and honest folk, not troublemakers,

566
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,780
But why are the arrears in taxes so severe?

567
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,300
Could it be that this Senior Official Pei
is really new here,

568
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,300
and knowing nothing?

569
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,560
Yes,

570
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,780
All village and community leaders

571
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,400
originally bear the responsibility of assisting
the government in collecting taxes and levies,

572
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,060
But why are the arrears in Wucheng so severe

573
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,740
compared to other places?

574
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,580
Could it be because you all have been derelict
in your duties?

575
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,740
My lord, how dare we fail in our duties?

576
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,240
It's just that the amount of taxes
is really too high,

577
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,620
If it is paid by number,

578
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,280
half of the people in the entire
Wucheng village,

579
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,940
all have to become escapees,

580
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,820
We also have no solution,

581
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,140
- Yes,
- It's like that?

582
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,620
Advisor Zhang, Wucheng is in arrears of tax

583
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,740
because of the tax is too heavy?

584
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,020
How come I have not heard
you mention it before?

585
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,820
Senior Official,

586
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,580
the levying of taxes in Wucheng started with
Protector-General Qiao,

587
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,900
It has been this way for many years,

588
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,860
On that day, you instructed me,

589
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,740
I thought you were already aware,

590
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,540
I am certainly aware that this tax
was decided by Protector-General Qiao,

591
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,320
But I did not know about this taxation

592
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,620
would cause half of Wucheng's residents to lose
all their possessions,

593
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,500
May I ask, Advisor Zhang,
was what the village leader just said true?

594
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,840
Whether it is true or not, I dare not
make a definite statement,

595
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,380
But when Protector-General Qiao is present,

596
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,980
the taxes of Wucheng have never been overdue,

597
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,740
What does he mean by that?

598
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,540
Advisor Zhang, are you saying

599
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,800
that Senior Official Pei
should act like Protector-General Qiao,

600
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,640
force people to provide money and grain
with violence?

601
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,020
Exactly, yes!

602
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,820
Take all their belongings!

603
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,860
Go, go!

604
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,920
Go, go!

605
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,080
Not leaving him a single piece,

606
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,144
Right, go,

607
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,820
My lady, all the maids have hidden
in the cellar,

608
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,960
Good, you and Tan should
hide in there as well,

609
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,160
I will call you out once the danger has passed,

610
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,660
My lady, if you do not leave,
Tan will not leave either,

611
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,580
Yes, wherever my lady is,
that's where we'll be,

612
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,140
Alright, then we stand right here,

613
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,300
Let's see what they really want to do,

614
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,272
May I ask the village leader,

615
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,820
As Advisor Zhang said, for the same taxes,

616
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,980
When Protector-General Qiao was here,
there had never been arrears,

617
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,840
As soon as the Protector-General Qiao left,

618
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,220
in less than six or seven years,
the arrears have reached more than half,

619
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,820
Is it because the previous two
Protector-Generals were kind-hearted,

620
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,656
and being deceived by tricksters?

621
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:19,740
We have become tricksters?

622
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,340
Yes, yes,

623
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,420
Indeed, when Protector-General Qiao was in charge,
no one dared to delay on taxes,

624
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,140
However, many households have become destitute
in just two years,

625
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,660
Some have become fugitive households,

626
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,720
Some have served in officials' houses
as slaves for meals,

627
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,380
After Protector-General Guo came, he also registered
the properties of each household,

628
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,860
It's really impossible to force collection,

629
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,500
We can do nothing but delay the taxes,

630
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,980
In these three or four years,
Protector-General Qu has been kind,

631
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,020
We have only managed to save
a little bit of money and property,

632
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,300
Since you have already registered,

633
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,580
why not go and see how many households

634
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,060
paid the taxes by selling cattle and sheep
and farm produce,

635
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,780
<i>[Wu's Residence]</i>
Yes, you're right,

636
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,300
I have also heard that Xizhou is not suitable
for silk farming,

637
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,980
Paying taxes is a bit difficult,

638
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,660
But a hundred acres of land with four dans
of millet each year,

639
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,940
Why can't it be paid?

640
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,100
Where are those hundred-acre fields?
Should sand dunes even count?

641
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,420
Yes, that's right,

642
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,100
Here, having ten acres is already quite good,

643
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,260
Right, right, not even ten acres,
