[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]

00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,955
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:48,843
How many left? Give them to me.

4
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,503
There were eight left
before the Lantern Festival.

5
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:54,863
Now there's not a single one.

6
00:01:54,863 --> 00:01:56,003
Qu Chongyu says

7
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,363
Su Nanjin has confiscated
all the communication tokens of Xizhou.

8
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:00,323
Even official documents can't be sent out
from Xizhou.

9
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:02,443
I had no choice
but to give him all the remaining ones.

10
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,663
The four pieces I gave you.

11
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:06,043
You haven't used them all up yet, have you?

12
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,243
Return them to me.

13
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:11,343
I've put much effort into it

14
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:13,243
just to make them identical to the real ones.

15
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:14,983
Now the mold is ruined.

16
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:16,603
I don't want to put in the effort
all over again.

17
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:20,256
You little rascal.

18
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:22,043
How bold you are.

19
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,043
I made them for fun myself.

20
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,123
Who is the audacious man using them?

21
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:27,183
Give them back to me.

22
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:28,443
I'm very timid.

23
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:29,723
I'll hide them

24
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:31,203
and never let you see them again.

25
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,200
This time,

26
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,003
I really must thank you.

27
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:51,168
[Pei's Mansion]

28
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:54,304
Liuli,

29
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:56,463
the war is now over.

30
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:58,803
Why hasn't master Fang come
to pick up Mrs. Liu yet?

31
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,563
Master Fang has been on watch
near the old city of Shule all day long.

32
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,323
I heard lady Liu said

33
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:06,363
Fang Lie swore revenge

34
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:08,243
on Su Haizheng

35
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:10,483
who had killed Khan Xingxiwang.

36
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,843
Presumably,

37
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,083
only after he finishes that matter,

38
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,603
will he come to pick up lady Liu and her child.

39
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,323
For this vexing issue,

40
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,963
Chongyu has been upset these days.

41
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:24,203
Those of Qu's men

42
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,403
who innocently died in battle
because of the Sus

43
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:28,283
had followed him for many years.

44
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,483
If he doesn't do something to repay them,

45
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:32,723
he won't be able to live with himself.

46
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:34,803
My lady,

47
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:37,763
someone from the court has arrived.

48
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:38,783
Who is the visitor?

49
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,303
It is the newly appointed Commander, Gao Xian.

50
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:42,683
He is the former Prefectural Governor
of Shazhou.

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,923
What is the imperial decree?

52
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,243
According to the imperial decree,

53
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:49,003
at the northern foot of the Tianshan Mountains,
originally the territory of Tingzhou,

54
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:50,323
the Jinshan Protector-General's Mansion
is established

55
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:53,643
to expand the frontier population
and agricultural garrisons.

56
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:56,763
The armies of various states and towns north
of the Tianshan Mountains are concentrated

57
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,923
as a defense against the Chumukun, Gongyue
and other tribes.

58
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:01,103
The former Prefectural Governor of Yizhou

59
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:02,523
is transferred to Xizhou.

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,763
Our master

61
00:04:04,763 --> 00:04:07,263
is now promoted to be the Deputy Protector-General
of Jingshan Protector-General's Mansion.

62
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:09,683
Minister Qu is transferred to serve
as the General of the Left Guards.

63
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:14,323
Shouyue and Minister Qu are promoted to
fourth-rank positions with power.

64
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:15,683
It can be considered
as an extraordinary promotion.

65
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,563
How is His Majesty going
to deal with Su Haizheng and his son?

66
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:21,303
My lady,

67
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,283
I came to report
as soon as I received the imperial edict.

68
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:25,503
I didn't hear the rest of it.

69
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:26,903
Go to Bai San now

70
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:28,323
and remind him about my orders.

71
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,240
Yes.

72
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:52,083
Commander Gao.

73
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:54,423
Don't be a stranger.

74
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:57,023
I will need your help

75
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:58,643
in my future work.

76
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:00,512
Anytime.

77
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:08,883
Deputy Protector-General Pei and General Qu

78
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:11,403
are promising young men.

79
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,203
In the future, I will rely on you two

80
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:15,683
for the affairs.

81
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,664
I'm flattered.

82
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:19,883
I'm at your service.

83
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,503
That's too kind of you to say.

84
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:24,683
Both of you have lifted the siege
of Tingzhou this time.

85
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:27,163
One can say it was a feat
of great wisdom and courage.

86
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:29,203
I admire you immensely.

87
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:31,523
I still remember

88
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:34,123
the ingenuity you showed in your residence

89
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,043
in Dunhuang, General Qu.

90
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,083
Once I settle down in Qiuci,

91
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,603
I still have much to learn from you.

92
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:42,603
You're flattering me.

93
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,203
Commander Gao,

94
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:46,863
may I ask a question?

95
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:49,303
Now that you have arrived,

96
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:50,323
I wonder

97
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:51,823
how the imperial court plans

98
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:53,723
to deal with Mr. Su and his son.

99
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:01,563
I almost forgot it.

100
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:05,363
Is Su Nanjin in Xizhou?

101
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:07,904
Yes.

102
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,183
That's good.

103
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,763
Please bring him out of the jail.

104
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:15,563
I need to go to Shule

105
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:17,363
to hand Mr. Su and his son over

106
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:21,163
to the censor sent by the court this time.

107
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:26,563
Here's His Majesty's decree.

108
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:33,683
Su Haizheng fled from the battlefield.

109
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:35,263
He deserves to be executed.

110
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,443
He's demoted to commoner.

111
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,683
The trial in the capital awaits him.

112
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:43,883
I will bring out the person immediately.

113
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:46,703
No need to trouble you.

114
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:50,643
Just let the officers
take my personal troops there.

115
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,203
Su Nanjing is a criminal by imperial order.

116
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,743
As for the matter of the escort,

117
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,803
there's no need to trouble you.

118
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:00,843
Thank you for your care.

119
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,763
- Commander Gao, please.
- Please.

120
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:22,923
Your Majesty and Commander Gao,

121
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,563
thank you for your grace.

122
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,163
Pei Xingjian,

123
00:07:36,363 --> 00:07:37,923
Qu Chongyu.

124
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,403
Take him away.

125
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:42,003
Clean him up before setting off.

126
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,043
- Yes.
- Yes.

127
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:45,923
Pei Xingjian,

128
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:48,603
Qu Chongyu,

129
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:52,123
your care over the past two months.

130
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:55,003
I will never forget it in my life.

131
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,203
When I return to Chang'an,

132
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:02,003
I will surely repay you both well.

133
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:32,423
I've delivered the message of the decree,

134
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,603
and I've got the convict.

135
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:35,803
I'm taking leave now.

136
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:37,643
Goodbye, Commander Gao.

137
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,203
Take care, Commander Gao.

138
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,200
Shouyue,

139
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,043
you didn't mean to.

140
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:19,243
Don't overthink it.

141
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:23,936
It's hard to have it all in life.

142
00:09:25,443 --> 00:09:26,496
His demotion is of little consequence,

143
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,096
but in other aspects,

144
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:30,203
I always feel like I am letting him down.

145
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,003
Just now, Bai San

146
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:37,643
chatted with the soldiers

147
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,883
escorting the censor.

148
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:40,763
This time,

149
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,923
they chose good horses with stamina

150
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:44,803
and didn't bring much luggage.

151
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:46,423
Judging from their tone,

152
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:48,163
right after they proclaim the decree

153
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:49,883
to Su Haizheng in Shule,

154
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,523
they will then take the Sus

155
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:52,683
back to Chang'an.

156
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,083
They look like

157
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:58,003
they will take Ohaido.

158
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:03,392
Very likely.

159
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:10,083
I have heard of Gao Xian before.

160
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:12,763
He is gentle and cautious,

161
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,923
and he has worked with Su Haizheng
in Shazhou for many years.

162
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:19,243
It's obvious that he sides with Su Haizheng.

163
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:25,024
This time,

164
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:27,023
Gao Xian

165
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:28,243
is hurrying to Shule

166
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:29,443
without even having dinner,

167
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:31,523
which is quite different from his usual self.

168
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:33,923
He obviously wants Mr. Su and his son

169
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:35,843
to leave the Western Regions
as soon as possible

170
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,923
to avoid complications.

171
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:40,163
Shule is close to Liuzhong.

172
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:42,063
Going on Ohaido

173
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:43,643
takes half the time than the other ways.

174
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:45,803
That's not right.

175
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:47,883
How could Liuli easily guess
they would go on Ohaido?

176
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:50,496
Liuli,

177
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:52,416
You…

178
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,503
These past two months,

179
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:56,723
Lady Liu has been
worried sick about master Fang.

180
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:58,883
Therefore,

181
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:01,243
just now I told her everything

182
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,323
Bai San had learned today.

183
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,744
Captain Linghu,

184
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:34,743
should we take a short break now

185
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:36,163
to have some food or water?

186
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:58,880
We should hurry on our journey.

187
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:00,503
According to the sentries,

188
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,703
some scouts have appeared outside the city
these days.

189
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:05,783
It shows the northerners are still intent
upon revenge for Khan Xingxiwang.

190
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:06,880
We must not be careless.

191
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:08,883
Only after we cross this Gobi desert

192
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:10,363
and the mountain ahead

193
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,443
can we truly be at ease.

194
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:09,403
Who is that?

195
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:10,523
Why do you block the way?

196
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:12,563
I'm here only for the Sus.

197
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:14,528
The rest of the people

198
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:16,403
can leave.

199
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:18,123
You sound like

200
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:19,323
you're a Tang person.

201
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,623
We're escorting the prisoners,
Mr. Su and his son, to the capital for trial

202
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:23,483
by the command of the Emperor

203
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:24,483
of the Great Tang.

204
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:26,903
You should leave immediately.

205
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:28,523
Do not hold back the court's affairs.

206
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,603
Leave behind the Sus.

207
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:33,248
I don't want

208
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:35,683
to start a killing spree.

209
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:41,243
It's up to the Emperor to judge them.

210
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:43,923
How dare you

211
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,643
offend our country

212
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:46,643
by kidnapping the criminals?

213
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:48,043
Aren't you afraid of provoking His Majesty

214
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,383
and making your tribe suffer a slaughter?

215
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:52,583
My tribe is already annihilated.

216
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,083
This is where the Sus die.

217
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,723
Their skulls are going to stay.

218
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:01,283
Today, anyone who obstructs me will perish.

219
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,043
The first to cut your hair.

220
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:09,403
The second to decapitate you.

221
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:11,443
Those death-seekers,

222
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:13,123
step up right!

223
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,136
Father.

224
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,223
Giddyap.

225
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:29,363
Giddyap.

226
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:30,463
Giddyap.

227
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:31,563
Giddyap.

228
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:33,184
Giddyap.

229
00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:35,520
Father.

230
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:37,344
Father.

231
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:45,824
You…

232
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,643
Who are you exactly?

233
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:58,683
I am a man of Khan Xingxiwang deceased.

234
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:02,363
I killed your 600 personal soldiers back then.

235
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:09,203
I really should have gone straight into Qiuci
that year

236
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:10,803
to kill you.

237
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:13,323
Now it is too late.

238
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:15,603
All I can do is take the heads of you two

239
00:15:15,603 --> 00:15:17,803
and use them as spittoons and chamber pots.

240
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,123
May you rot in infamy

241
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:23,723
and your soul suffer in damnation.

242
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:36,043
Don't.

243
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:41,888
Spare me.

244
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,043
Two years later,

245
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:51,843
Qu Zhizhan passed away due to illness.

246
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:54,603
Qu Chongyu was called back to Chang'an.

247
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:59,403
Pei Xingjian made the people
in Tingzhou live a life of well-being.

248
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:16,243
Please fulfill this.

249
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,043
Have you made up your mind?

250
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:22,763
Starting from today,

251
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,403
your name is Jing'an.

252
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:28,403
I am Jing'an.

253
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:30,483
Today, I don the robe

254
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:32,363
of a nun.

255
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:34,763
From today on,

256
00:16:35,403 --> 00:16:36,583
my vain thoughts are shed,

257
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,763
the right mind upheld,

258
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:39,488
the inner peace maintained.

259
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,696
I now enter

260
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:43,843
monkhood.

261
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:46,323
Have a look.

262
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:47,360
Please come in.

263
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:59,083
[Pei's Mansion]

264
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,323
Take a look.

265
00:17:01,984 --> 00:17:03,043
My lady.

266
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:04,256
Cheng,

267
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:08,383
has Shouyue returned from Tingzhou?

268
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:11,563
Yes, my lord rushed back from Tingzhou

269
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,443
as soon as he received the news
of Governor Qu's passing.

270
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,363
My lady, slow down.

271
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:51,443
Did Governor Qu pass away peacefully?

272
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:54,683
The funeral has been arranged

273
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:56,563
in a dignified way.

274
00:17:57,184 --> 00:17:58,240
It's most likely

275
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,283
that Chongyu will file an official leave
of mourning.

276
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:02,592
After the mourning period,

277
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,203
he will escort the coffin back to his hometown.

278
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:07,723
The Governor's remains

279
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:10,323
will be laid to rest
in the Qu family's ancestral tomb in Jincheng.

280
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,123
The court

281
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:14,883
has no intention of keeping Chongyu
in his position here.

282
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:17,883
Presumably, after his mourning period,

283
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:20,603
he will return to Chang'an.

284
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,643
Yunyi seems to have braced herself
for his departure.

285
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,243
She said when the time came, she'd see him off

286
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,363
and then return to her tribe.

287
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,603
Why are you looking at me like this?

288
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,923
Feeling sorry for me
because Chongyu is going back

289
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:33,723
to Chang'an soon?

290
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:39,123
Has my brother told you

291
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:42,923
half of the cotton workshop's annual income
will be left to you?

292
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,123
Even if you encounter difficulties
in the future,

293
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:47,003
it can secure your comfortable living.

294
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:50,523
Even after returning to my tribe,

295
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:52,083
I'll still be able

296
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:54,683
to live a good life.

297
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:02,976
My brother

298
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:05,043
has true feelings for you,

299
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:07,563
and you are devoted to him.

300
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:09,883
Then why don't you ask him

301
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,083
to take you back with him?

302
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:14,443
Back in the year, when Chongyu married me,

303
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,763
he clearly told me

304
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:19,123
that he had a wife in Chang'an.

305
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:21,163
If I insisted on being with him,

306
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,843
we could only be a couple
in the Western Regions.

307
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:26,883
Throughout these years,

308
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:29,883
Chongyu has treated me very well,

309
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,883
and in his heart, there's been only me.

310
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:35,552
That's enough for me.

311
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,543
Why should I be so troubled over this

312
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:41,883
and go back on my word

313
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:43,603
to be his concubine in Chang'an

314
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,923
and share him with others?

315
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:54,203
If this is what you think--

316
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,563
I want to be alone for a while.

317
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,720
[Qu's Residence]

318
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:11,328
Chongyu,

319
00:22:15,363 --> 00:22:16,663
when the obsequies are over

320
00:22:16,663 --> 00:22:18,603
and you take the coffin back to Jincheng,

321
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:20,256
I will see you off.

322
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:24,160
Okay.

323
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:25,803
After seeing you off there,

324
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:28,384
I will then leave.

325
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:44,363
Once the mourning period is over,

326
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,923
you will return from Jincheng to Chang'an.

327
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,643
I don't want to watch you leave.

328
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:06,752
Alright.

329
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:11,232
Chongyu,

330
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:17,283
this is the garment I made for you by hand.

331
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,763
In my life,

332
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:22,323
I have only made this one

333
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:25,283
and will not make another
for anyone else in the future.

334
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:31,683
Chongyu, keep it well.

335
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:43,712
Alright.

336
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,283
Even if I go with you

337
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:50,123
and spend a few passionate nights,

338
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,483
it would only sow woe

339
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,163
and bring unnecessary regrets.

340
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:58,483
What's the point of that?

341
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:02,272
Chongyu,

342
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:05,568
in the future,

343
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:07,723
when you think of me,

344
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:10,443
when I think of you,

345
00:24:12,723 --> 00:24:14,603
we are only allowed to be happy,

346
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:20,832
okay?

347
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:31,840
Chongyu,

348
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:33,963
I just want to know

349
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:38,003
in the years you have been with me,

350
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:41,163
if you're truly happy.

351
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,483
Yes, I am.

352
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:55,936
For the rest of my life,

353
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,043
the joy will never come again.

354
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:58,643
Once I depart today,

355
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:02,883
who knows when I will return here again?

356
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:06,603
Your deeds in Xizhou

357
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:09,403
have long brought wealth
and happiness to the people here.

358
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:12,403
Are you reluctant to leave?

359
00:26:13,443 --> 00:26:16,843
Even if I possess great ingenuity,

360
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,643
I still can't create

361
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:21,483
the tool

362
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,763
that can help me escape adversity

363
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:27,043
and guide my way forward.

364
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:29,443
You're referring to

365
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:31,616
a matter of the heart.

366
00:26:32,603 --> 00:26:33,923
It's not about the design skills.

367
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:37,283
The worries

368
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,203
that have trapped you

369
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:42,723
are not external, but internal.

370
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:49,563
You were born because of Xizhou.

371
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,803
Xizhou thrives because of you.

372
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,323
No matter where you are in the future,

373
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,223
who you accompany

374
00:26:58,223 --> 00:26:59,703
and who you serve,

375
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:00,923
I believe these years

376
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:03,363
you have fulfilled your parents' long-held wish

377
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,923
of revitalizing Xizhou.

378
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:12,003
As the saying goes,

379
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:16,123
when it's hard,
think flexible to find solutions.

380
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:18,283
With your abilities,

381
00:27:19,963 --> 00:27:21,643
why bother to fear the distress?

382
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,803
When I first arrived in Xizhou,

383
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:38,963
I didn't expect

384
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:41,363
that our relationship would end up like this.

385
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:53,363
Aren't you curious who I am, Chancellor?

386
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:54,723
If my guess is not wrong,

387
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:59,072
you're Qu Chongyu, the son of Qu Zhizhan
who's the Protector-General of Xizhou.

388
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:02,643
Thank you for all this, Minister.

389
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:03,723
Call me Chongyu.

390
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:07,483
It's still warm like this.

391
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,443
With you by my side, it won't be boring.

392
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:11,392
As long as you're happy.

393
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,943
There are important matters to attend to
in my courtyard.

394
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,263
I shall take my leave now.

395
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:16,352
Giddyap.

396
00:28:21,203 --> 00:28:22,703
Everything has passed already.

397
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,283
How can you still blame Minister Qu?

398
00:28:25,443 --> 00:28:27,983
I wonder if you can step forward
to donate your family's wealth,

399
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:31,523
or force Senior Official Pei to levy three
to five years of farming and weaving taxes.

400
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:33,883
Let's post the notice.

401
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,683
Let the people of Xizhou witness

402
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:38,123
the methods of Chancellor Pei.

do you still remember

409
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,043
one day, you held a sword sheath

410
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,883

This moment

416
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:26,803
is even more nerve-wracking

417
00:29:26,803 --> 00:29:28,403
than back then.

418
00:29:29,323 --> 00:29:30,643

to become your friend?

420
00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:35,323
I never thought of being your enemy.

421
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:37,963
Not in the past. Nor do I now.

422
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:39,523

Congratulations, Master.

443
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:50,843
You have a very handsome son.

444
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:51,936
Is the Madam well?

445
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:55,723
The Madam is well. Don't worry.

446
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:01,683
Congratulations on having a son.

447
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:02,720
Congratulations, Master.

[Pei's Mansion]

449
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:13,312
Sanlang,

450
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:15,683
the Master knows you love wine.

451
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:18,843
Fine wines are here.

452
00:32:19,643 --> 00:32:22,203
Silang,
the Master knows you're partial to beef.

453
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:24,163
Have a taste of these.

454
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:29,163
The Master and the Madam have been married
for more than a decade.

455
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:30,883
Now, finally they're blessed with an heir.

456
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,440
Let's drink together to celebrate.

457
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,624
Cheng,

458
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:35,783
over these years,

459
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:39,203
the Deputy Protector-General has promoted education
and benevolent governance in Xizhou.

460
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:40,483
He finally moved God

461
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:42,272
and was rewarded.

462
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:44,083
Let's toast the Deputy Protector-General.

463
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,152
Let's toast him.

464
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:52,483
The Master once wrote a poem for this wine.

465
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:53,803
This really is a fine wine.

466
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:56,803
At the pavilion we bid our farewells.

467
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:02,243
Bees inebriated, wings too heavy to lift.

468
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:05,723
Peace and prosperity across the lands.

469
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,523
O, what fine wine.

470
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:11,523
Fine wine.

471
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,376
Drink.

472
00:33:13,923 --> 00:33:14,923
Fine wine.

473
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:30,483
How is the baby today?

474
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,896
He's good.

475
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:06,683
Who sent this?

476
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:08,763
Though the thing is ordinary,

477
00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:11,043
the thought behind it is estimable.

478
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:14,443
It is master Fang and lady Liu.

479
00:34:15,563 --> 00:34:16,923
How nice of them to send this.

480
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:18,903
Are they doing well now?

481
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:20,363
How did it get sent here?

482
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:24,883
Lie did a credit,

483
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,323
and he doesn't vie for power,

484
00:34:28,923 --> 00:34:30,443
so he can have a peaceful life

485
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,683
under Ashina Duzhi's control.

486
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:34,403
I have my own ways to contact him.

487
00:34:34,403 --> 00:34:35,680
You don't have to worry.

488
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:38,963
Things in the world are unpredictable,

489
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:40,803
but there's still hope.

490
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:42,496
I believe that one day,

491
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:45,483
Master Fang will certainly bring lady Liu

492
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,043
back upright and aboveboard.

493
00:34:57,723 --> 00:34:58,803
Madam Yang has sent a letter.

494
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,488
[Madam Yang's Letter]

495
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,483
Today, the appointment was proclaimed.

496
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:21,963
I am appointed

497
00:35:23,043 --> 00:35:24,083
as the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs.

498
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:28,363
In the end,

499
00:35:29,683 --> 00:35:30,843
we still must return to Chang'an.

500
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:33,728
Liuli,

501
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,963
if none of you go back,

502
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:41,003
how good that would be?

503
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,323
Chongyu once said

504
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:46,563
Chang'an

505
00:36:47,923 --> 00:36:49,163
was the least free place

506
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:51,923
in the world.

507
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:56,723
He was right.

508
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,883
People can find supreme power

509
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:02,283
and wealth there,

510
00:37:03,683 --> 00:37:05,863
and it draws everyone

511
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,163
under its sway.

512
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,763
No matter how much I want,

513
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:15,763
I ultimately can no longer stay by his side.

514
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:19,872
Liuli,

515
00:37:20,883 --> 00:37:22,483
in the future,

516
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:24,243
could you and your husband

517
00:37:26,403 --> 00:37:28,483
take care of Chongyu for me in Chang'an?

518
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,563
Although he has never told me,

519
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:35,283
I know

520
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:39,043
he is afraid of going to that place,

521
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,283
but he has no way.

522
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:46,944
Yunyi.

523
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:50,016
Liuli,

524
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:53,683
I really admire you and your husband.

525
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,363
Wherever you are,

526
00:37:57,363 --> 00:37:58,803
whatever obstacles you face,

527
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,683
you always walk hand in hand,

528
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:03,963
never parting.

529
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,112
How great.

530
00:39:28,483 --> 00:39:30,443
How could you?

531
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:31,552
Liuli,

532
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,643
from the moment I saw you today,

533
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:36,043
I realized that I was terribly wrong,

534
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:38,283
but I never imagined

535
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:41,283
that I had made such grave mistakes.

536
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:43,683
You just wait

537
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:45,903
and see how I'll settle the score with you

538
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:47,163
after I leave here.

539
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:49,443
Liuli!

540
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:50,563
There was such a moment

541
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:52,563
when I was really afraid of losing you.

542
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:54,343
Don't talk nonsense.

543
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:55,803
I swear

544
00:39:55,803 --> 00:39:57,943
I'm sticking with you for life.

545
00:39:57,943 --> 00:40:00,603
Even if I become an old woman
with a face full of wrinkles,

546
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:02,003
don't even think about getting rid of me.

547
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:04,563
This is our home.

548
00:40:05,723 --> 00:40:08,403
This is the first courtyard
we bought ourselves.

549
00:40:09,163 --> 00:40:10,523
No schemes,

550
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,483
nor any glamorous traps.

551
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,603
Just a clean

552
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,603
and reassuring scent.

553
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:18,603
Please have faith in the Chancellor.

554
00:40:18,603 --> 00:40:20,163
Please give the Chancellor more time.

555
00:40:23,443 --> 00:40:24,576
Call for Physician Han.

556
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:28,160
Shouyue,

557
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:30,203
I want to return to Chang'an.

558
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,283
That is our only chance to turn the tables.

559
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:37,343
My foster father and Empress Wu
are in Chang'an.

560
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:38,763
I will not be in danger.

561
00:40:42,283 --> 00:40:43,360
You're back.

562
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:51,843
My lady.

563
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:53,363
- Liuli.
- My lady.

564
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:58,688
Physician Han,

565
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:00,523
is there any other way?

566
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:03,123
Maybe we can try moxibustion.

567
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:05,203
Please, Physician Han.

568
00:41:14,643 --> 00:41:15,744
Liuli,

569
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,083
please wake up.

570
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:20,803
Those interesting books.

571
00:41:22,323 --> 00:41:23,483
Every night,

572
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,443
I'll read them at your bedside.

573
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:28,544
How does that sound?

574
00:41:29,427 --> 00:41:33,983
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

575
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:40,511
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

576
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:44,831
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

577
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:48,511
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

578
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:53,759
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

579
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,592
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

580
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:01,780
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

581
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,184
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

582
00:42:05,184 --> 00:42:08,224
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

583
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:11,719
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

584
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:15,079
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

585
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,311
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

586
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:21,883
I really hate to leave.

587
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:26,565
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

588
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:29,573
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

589
00:42:29,573 --> 00:42:33,012
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

590
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:35,973
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

591
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:39,796
♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫

592
00:42:39,796 --> 00:42:42,644
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

593
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:46,021
♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫

594
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:51,072
♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫

595
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:02,975
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

596
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:09,503
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

597
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:13,823
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

598
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:17,503
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

599
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:22,751
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

600
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:29,151
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

601
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:35,711
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

602
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:40,543
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

603
00:43:40,543 --> 00:43:44,031
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

604
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:50,527
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

605
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,919
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

606
00:43:53,919 --> 00:43:56,927
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

607
00:43:56,927 --> 00:44:00,479
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

608
00:44:00,479 --> 00:44:03,583
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

609
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,815
♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫

610
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:10,079
♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

611
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,439
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

612
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:18,335
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫

613
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:36,543
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

614
00:44:38,354 --> 00:44:44,095
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

615
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:47,662
