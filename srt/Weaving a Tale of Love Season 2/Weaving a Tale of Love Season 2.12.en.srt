<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,570
Is the Protector-General's
acting a bit over the top?

4
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,350
Shouyue, let me toast your second cup,

5
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,490
Sit down,

6
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,748
I don't think so,

7
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:50,570
- Look,
- Come on, Senior Official,

8
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,610
It's quite sincere,

9
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,830
You're all seeing to it, huh?

10
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,250
- Try this meat,
- I'll just have a drink,

11
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,550
Senior Official, I toast to you,

12
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,290
Isn't that a bit beneath his dignity?

13
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,670
Approachable and humble, Respectable!

14
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,930
Chongyu

15
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,730
- The third cup,
- Come on,

16
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,690
What, are you talking about
my grandfather-in-law, your father-in-law

17
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,210
having a guilty conscience?

18
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,330
Nonsense, I absolutely didn't mean that,

19
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,890
- Eat more vegetables,
- Okay,

20
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,530
I'd like to propose a toast to you as well,
Mr, Pei,

21
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,148
Sincerity,

22
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:31,510
Senior Official,

23
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,170
Madam, try these dates,
They're particularly sweet,

24
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,330
Madam, try our pears here,

25
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,490
Madam Kudi, this plate
of grapes in front of you

26
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,050
is extremely delicious, Have a taste,

27
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,070
Please, try this,

28
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,092
Thank you very much,

29
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,410
<i>[Qu Zhizhan's Concubine, Madam Qi]</i>
You may not be aware,

30
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,350
Madam Kudi, before marrying Senior Official Pei

31
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,090
was a master at the Bureau of Garment,

32
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,130
famous for her clever mind and skillful hands,

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,310
It is said that the dresses made by you

34
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,930
were greatly favored by Lady Wu,

35
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,650
Qu is well-informed,

36
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,350
Liuli is merely interested in dressmaking,

37
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,570
And Lady Wu shows favoritism,

38
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,870
Madam Kudi,

39
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,150
I wonder what kind of makeup is fashionable
in Chang'an now?

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,370
Can you tell us about it?

41
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,380
Yes,

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,190
The trendiest makeup now is probably
the bold green eyebrows,

43
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,530
Diagonal red should be drawn thinner,

44
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,810
Decorate the eyebrows with golden flowers
to accentuate the color,

45
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,530
It's so lively,

46
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,450
You didn't even call out for me,

47
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,090
How did she come back?

48
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,010
Weren't you going hunting
with Captain Yan and the others?

49
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,490
It was no fun with them, so I came back early,

50
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,450
So you are Kudi Liuli,

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,410
And this is?

52
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,210
<i>[Qu Chongyu's Sister, Wife of Wang Junmeng, Qu Jingtang]</i>
I am Qu Chongyu's sister, the wife of Wang Junmeng,

53
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,730
You may call me Lady Jing,

54
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,410
So you are the Madam of Ming's Mansion,

55
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,410
Lady Jing, since you're back,
let's eat together,

56
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,370
Shouyue, let me toast one more drink to you,

57
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,890
- Yeah,
- Thank you, Protector-General,

58
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,010
Lady Jing was here just now,

59
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,410
What a good drink tolerance!

60
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,730
You didn't tell her anything, did you?

61
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,108
No, I just said that

62
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,210
I don't like Kudi Liuli,

63
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,930
I really don't like,

64
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,950
I heard my elder brother has had a tough time
with you throughout the journey,

65
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,530
I came out of curiosity just to see
what you look like,

66
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,130
Have I made you satisfied, Madam?

67
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,330
It is better to see a person in the flesh
than to know him by repute,

68
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,050
I thought
you would be a woman with double-pupil,

69
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,970
a blue face and fangs,
and capable of lifting a cauldron,

70
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,530
But now it seems you're very ordinary,

71
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,690
However,
you are better looking than all of them,

72
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,490
Thank you for your compliment, Madam,

73
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,650
How delicate you are!

74
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,170
You don't seem like someone
who practices martial arts,

75
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,410
The Princess sent so many people to kill you,

76
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,650
If it were me,
it would be difficult to escape unharmed,

77
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,810
How did you and Pei Xingjian manage to do it?

78
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,290
Lady Jing, what are you babbling about here?

79
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,830
Which Princess? I haven't even heard of her,

80
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,370
If you make a fuss like this again,
I will call for Protector-General,

81
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,150
Alright, stop pressuring me
with Father all the time,

82
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,220
I'm leaving right now,

83
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,050
You're good, I like you a lot,

84
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,610
Come to my place another day,

85
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,390
Teach me that makeup,

86
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,450
I will certainly visit,

87
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,610
Alright then, you guys eat slowly, I'm leaving,

88
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,610
I'm giving you those two chickens,
no need to thank me,

89
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,850
She has been spoiled by her father,

90
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,570
I've made a fool of myself in front of you,
I'm really sorry,

91
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,250
I actually find her
quite naive and straightforward,

92
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,770
She is a very interesting person,

93
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,756
Senior Official Pei,

94
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,828
What's happening here?

95
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,850
Let's have another drink,

96
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,700
Drink,

97
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,350
The Senior Official has had too much to drink,

98
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,250
Someone help the Senior Official to rest,

99
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,690
Senior Official Pei can't hold his liquor,

100
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,170
Take it slow,

101
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,770
Have another drink,

102
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,250
Let's call it a day for now,

103
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,930
Have another drink,

104
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,116
Slow down,

105
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,050
If you're that worried, go check on it,

106
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,476
I… I'll take a look,

107
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,710
Senior Official had a bit too much to drink,

108
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,330
He has been helped to the guest room to rest,

109
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,300
Got drunk?

110
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,570
She has already left,
There's no need to look for her anymore,

111
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,068
Lady, Madam Kudi,

112
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,530
I heard that Shouyue has gotten drunk,
is it true?

113
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,990
He's Happy today, and drank a few more glasses,

114
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,890
Minister has already ordered someone
to help Senior Official back to guest room to rest,

115
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,810
Madam, I want to see Shouyue,

116
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,770
Alright, I'll have someone take you there now,

117
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,410
Lady, Lady Jing hasn't caused any trouble,
has she?

118
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:37,580
<i>[Qu's Residence]</i>

119
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,156
Madam,

120
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,684
Come in,

121
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,670
Madam, the hangover soup is here,

122
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,708
You've worked hard,

123
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,810
How did I not notice before

124
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,570
my Liuli is so virtuous?

125
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,676
You are fooling me again,

126
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,756
How did I fool you?

127
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,930
Those officials in the Xizhou
asked me to drink one after another,

128
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,050
I have drunk at least a pound or two,

129
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,050
If I drink any more, I will really be drunk,

130
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,570
At first night in the Xizhou,

131
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,730
do you want to listen to a drunkard
talking all night nonsense?

132
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,130
I'll get you some sobering soup,

133
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,420
I'll do it myself,

134
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,810
Your body is finally a bit warmer,

135
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,010
Xizhou seems even hotter than Chang'an,

136
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,570
The weather here has always been hot and windy,

137
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,270
This house, being warm in winter
and cool in summer, is quite nice,

138
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,350
Moreover, the windows are unusually tall
and the walls are remarkably thick,

139
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,890
The effect of sound insulation
and thermal retention must also be very good,

140
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,010
Protector-General Qu
receives us with such enthusiasm,

141
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,570
I wonder what he wants to do,

142
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,770
Since we are here,
we might as well settle down,

143
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,170
No matter what tactics they use,

144
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,850
we will simply counter every move,

145
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,590
By the way, I saw Wang Junmeng restless today,

146
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,530
And he kept glancing at
the curtains of the female guests,

147
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,290
Nothing happened, right?

148
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,370
It was that darn peacock
that had a surprise for me,

149
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,730
What tricks is he playing this time?

150
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,756
Nothing much really,

151
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,370
He just wanted me to meet his sister,

152
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,090
Have you met Qu Jingtang?

153
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,370
I've heard this girl is arrogant,
willful, and domineering,

154
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,090
She is a villainous woman
that everyone in the Xizhou avoids,

155
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,410
She didn't do anything to you, did she?

156
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,730
Indeed, she is quite a troublesome character,

157
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,170
However, I can still handle her,

158
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,050
It seems that she quite likes me,

159
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,970
It would be wise
to have less contact with such a person,

160
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,690
Don't worry, I know how to handle it,

161
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,350
But that dead peacock,
He's full of cunning tricks,

162
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,288
Be careful,

163
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,850
You are not allowed to mention him again,

164
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,650
From now on, you should think of nothing,

165
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,596
Do not think about anyone,

166
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,732
Liuli,

167
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,930
Why haven't you gone to court yet?

168
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,930
My silly Liuli, have you overslept?

169
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,530
What time is it?

170
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,770
It should be past the time of Chen already,

171
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,990
I just heard some noise outside,

172
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,250
Has someone come to visit?

173
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,668
No hurry,

174
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,970
I just drank a bit too much,

175
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,930
Your ears are quite sharp,

176
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,730
Who is the visitor?

177
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,090
It must be either Madam Qi or that peacock,

178
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,970
Lady, morning,

179
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,670
Minister Qu just came by a moment ago
and just left,

180
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,050
He said he'd come later,

181
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,212
It's him,

182
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:49,050
<i>[Zhao's Lamb Soup and Pancake]</i>

183
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,170
Protector-General,

184
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,050
Please sit,

185
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,210
Father-in-law, breakfast is ready,

186
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,150
Didn't you tell Lady Jing
that we were eating together this morning?

187
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,316
I forgot,

188
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,170
Forgot what? She just doesn't want to come,

189
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,530
You ask even though you know,

190
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,632
You…

191
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:10,656
Time to eat,

192
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,490
Tell me, is it wrong
that I just want to protect this peace?

193
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,130
Of course, there's nothing wrong with that,

194
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,210
But the Qu family is not
what it used to be anymore,

195
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,890
Now, to protect Xizhou,

196
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,770
we still need to rely on
the power of the Tang Dynasty,

197
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,130
You mean, let me spare that person
for the time being,

198
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,290
That's not what I mean,
It's what Chongyu means,

199
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,610
Moreover, Chongyu is indeed considering
the Qu family's interests,

200
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,210
Even though we know
he was sent to counterbalance our Qu family,

201
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,810
Father-in-law,
I would like to say something out of line,

202
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,490
This place is no longer
the Kingdom of Gaochang,

203
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,250
but Xizhou of the Great Tang,

204
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,730
Is it I that

205
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,610
have not yet let go of what I hold in my heart?

206
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,050
I, on the other hand,
think Protector-General has already let go,

207
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,630
Otherwise, how could there be

208
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,810
this current scene of tranquility in Xizhou?

209
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,650
Then, for the time being,

210
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,530
let's slow down for now,

211
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,570
Allow that person to live a bit longer,

212
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,610
But,
that person will have to be killed eventually,

213
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,730
Wait for the opportunity,

214
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,850
Then, start by killing those around him,

215
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,570
I obey the order,

216
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,330
My lord, my lady, Minister Qu has arrived,

217
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,892
Shouyue,

218
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,650
I heard Minister had come early in the morning,

219
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,370
It was Xingjian who was rude,

220
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,010
Why so polite?

221
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,250
Indeed, I was wrong yesterday,

222
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,810
I didn't discipline those juniors,
which made you drink more,

223
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,650
They are very enthusiastic,

224
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,650
They are enthusiastic,

225
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,250
But it made me listen to a drunkard
talking all night long,

226
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,270
After a difficult journey to the Xizhou,
I wanted to sleep in peace,

227
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,530
As a result, I was hassled until dawn
before I could sleep,

228
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,570
Indeed, I was wrong yesterday,

229
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,450
I owe an apology to Madam Kudi,

230
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,050
You're too serious,

231
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,610
I cannot bear it,

232
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,830
We have just arrived in the Xizhou
and we are unfamiliar with everything here,

233
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,350
In many aspects,
we are relying on Minister's guidance,

234
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,730
How dare I blame you?

235
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,930
Madam Kudi is indeed aware of
the bigger picture,

236
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,450
I am quite relieved,

237
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,290
Shouyue, why don't you invite
Minister to sit down?

238
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,384
- Please,
- Please,

239
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,850
I wonder what brings you here?

240
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,530
You saw

241
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,130
the situation around
the Protector-General's Mansion yesterday,

242
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,890
I wonder where you plan to settle down,

243
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,150
Thank you for your concern, Minister,

244
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,850
We have already bought a homestead
in Floating Water Workshop,

245
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,370
We are going to move there today,

246
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,490
Floating Water Workshop?

247
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,690
But to my knowledge,
there are more foreigners there,

248
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,290
I'm not sure with the status of Shouyue,

249
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,690
whether it is suitable to be in a place
like Floating Water Workshop,

250
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,610
Is that so? That actually suits me,

251
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,930
I think Shouyue wouldn't mind,
What do you think, Shouyue?

252
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,850
Yes, As long as you're happy,

253
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,330
Did you prepare a mansion for us?

254
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,330
I indeed prepared a good residence for you,

255
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,340
but I just did not expect…

256
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,290
I have to betray your kindness,

257
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,610
However, this may be a good thing for you,

258
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,530
In this way,
if a thief gets into our home in the future,

259
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,530
we won't be able to blame you anymore,

260
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,170
Liuli, all this is in the past,

261
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,910
How can you still blame Minister?

262
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,810
I hope you will not take offence
for my inappropriate words,

263
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,170
No worries,

264
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,710
How about this? Now that you're here,

265
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,770
let's all take a look at the new residence
together,

266
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,210
At noon, I'll personally cook

267
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,890
a few of my specialty dishes
to apologize to you,

268
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,530
Coincidentally,
your younger sister generously gave me

269
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,690
two wild pheasants last night at the banquet,
with their flesh still intact,

270
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,050
I'll cook them together for you to taste,

271
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,810
You are too kind, I have
numerous governmental affairs to attend to,

272
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,108
I shall take my leave first, goodbye,

273
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,450
Given such unfortunate timing,
let's postpone to another day,

274
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,170
I wonder what kind of food you prefer,

275
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,090
I can prepare in advance,

276
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,650
I have no particular preference,
I will take my leave now,

277
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,416
<i>[Understand a Man by his Faults]</i>

278
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,530
You little rascal,

279
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,050
It seems that
Qu Chongyu may have a vengeful nature,

280
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,330
It's better not to provoke him,

281
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,110
Why did he revenge? I invited him to dinner,

282
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,410
He irritated us early in the morning,
He asked for it,

283
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,570
I see they sincerely want to give us the house,

284
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,570
Unlike someone who have established businesses
before they even left Chang'an,

285
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,190
I didn't initially include you in this,

286
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,630
only buying a small residence,

287
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,090
If you don't like it,
there's still time to regret,

288
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,428
You're joking again,

289
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,930
What do I need Qu Chongyu's house for?

290
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,450
Am I supposed to let him ambush
in the neighborhood?

291
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,710
Anyway, I'm sticking with you,

292
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,570
As long as there's your bed in that house,

293
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,010
I won't worry about having a place to sleep,

294
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,970
Your face is getting thicker,

295
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,210
Always so thick,

296
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,610
- What are you doing?
- Always so thick,

297
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,250
<i>[Rising Sun and Forever Moon]</i>
Master and Lady,

298
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,090
It's really a trouble for Steward He,

299
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,450
How could someone of low status like me
deserve the word 'trouble'?

300
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,572
Everything's in order,

301
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,350
You go first and instruct
the kitchen to prepare for lunch,

302
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,050
Then, list the names of the elders here

303
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,410
in Xizhou to whom we need to give gifts,

304
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,090
After we have prepared the gifts,

305
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,910
you'll then take Ni
to deliver them to each house,

306
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,770
telling them that
we will visit another day to pay respects,

307
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,444
Yes, my lady,

308
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,650
The three rooms in the West Wing outside,

309
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,730
you may choose at will,

310
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,670
Ni, pack your bags and see
if you're missing anything,

311
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,740
Tomorrow, we shall go to the market,

312
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,924
Yes,

313
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,450
First come, first served,

314
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,090
You've arranged things quite quickly,

315
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,390
Why is it that you alone are visiting
the relatives of An Family?

316
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,750
Aren't we going together?

317
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,330
We have just arrived in the Xizhou,

318
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,050
Don't you need to handle official affairs
and make connections with colleagues?

319
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,050
Of course not,

320
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,290
Now, the most important thing for me
is to be with you,

321
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,750
That dead peacock is both
enticing and intimidating

322
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,210
He simply don't want you to get involved in
the affairs of the Xizhou,

323
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,210
Xizhou is the foundation of the Qu family,

324
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,110
The Tang dynasty has only been in control
for a dozen years or so,

325
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,050
Now it's back in the hands of the Qu family,

326
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,810
Listening to the words of
those officials' families,

327
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,450
I think these Xizhou clans
are intertwined with each other,

328
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,450
Alright, you can rest assured,

329
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,690
You don't have to worry about these things,
I have my own sense of measure,

330
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,830
This time, let's visit and socialize well,

331
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,650
Enjoy food, drinks, and fun, alright?

332
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,730
Okay,

333
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,970
Right, I saw you in the yard just now,

334
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,050
What are you so lost in thought about?

335
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,850
I'm not thinking about anything in particular,

336
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,110
Actually, before I came here,
I had never imagined

337
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,850
what this residence would look like,

338
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,090
When I entered today,
I immediately felt very familiar,

339
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,330
Everything looks pleasing to me,

340
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,850
The decoration of this room is quite ordinary,

341
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,850
But the more I look around, the more I like it,

342
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,930
I don't know why,

343
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,370
My silly Liuli, you still don't understand?

344
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,090
This is our home,

345
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,428
Our first home,

346
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,330
The more I look at it, the happier I become,

347
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,452
Yes, indeed,

348
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,130
This is the first residence
we bought ourselves,

349
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,130
No schemes, nor any glamorous traps,

Lady, would you like
to take a look at this ewer,

354
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,650
This gold ewer with chiseled designs
is dazzlingly brilliant!

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,330
It suits your temperament so well,

356

I'll take this one,

I want this one,

00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,650
Go… Golden eagle,

374
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,630
This eagle seems to have had a great awakening
and became a Buddha,

375
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,850
How can it hunt rabbits?

No matter how much you push him,

he paints the birds and beasts all
in the same style,

380
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,450
There's nothing I can do,

381

Since someone in your store is capable of
painting this design,

382
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,210
he can paint the golden eagle that I want,

383

in Chang'an,

- Then, invite him here,

I'll pay the expenses,

386
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,770
The painter of this design is
of special status,

387
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,530
Truly, he's not someone
who can be swayed by money,

388
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,990
That's your business,
It has nothing to do with me,

389
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,050
Madam Qu, please don't make it
difficult for me anymore,

390
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,790
I paid a lot of money for a screen,

391
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,890
And also, according to your rules,
I paid half the deposit,

392

you still can't give me the design I want,

395

Bidding farewell to the respected Prefect Wang,

490
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,490
Protector-General asks me
to relay the message to you,

491
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,770
Next year's expenses must be reduced
by 300,000 coins,

492
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,970
which is also three hundred min,

493
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,310
But as for how to save,

494
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,410
you need to come up with a solution,

495
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,910
We officials have already

496
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,210
received very little money,

497
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,370
If they continue to cut down,
it would be an extreme oppression,

498
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,470
They are officials assigned by the court,

499
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,890
They stay in the house every day,

500
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,790
They have sufficient salary and office fields,

501
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,650
But they also want to deduct from us,

502
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,310
We didn't have much to begin with,

503
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,930
You've been looking at this account book
for a long time,

504
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,530
Do you have any idea now?

505
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,930
Mr, Pei is new here
and doesn't have any suggestions yet,

506
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,210
I hope
all my colleagues can put our heads together,

507
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,050
Only in this way can we live up
to Protector-General's expectations of us,

508
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,690
Actually, the overhead expenses
of Protector-General's Mansion are not that high,

509
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,410
Logically, Protector-General Qu is still holding
the position of Prefectural Governor of Xizhou,

510
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,090
He has provincial officials and clerks,

511
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,170
But now the positions are concurrently held
by officials from our Protector-General's Mansion,

512
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,570
Firstly, in terms of manpower,
there is no possibility for further reduction,

513
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,130
Secondly,
salaries and miscellaneous allowances,

514
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,610
Half of our officials are appointed
by the court,

515
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,730
Our spending on money and grain is also
below the amount set by the court,

516
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,170
Not to mention those yamen runners outside,

517
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,910
each of them costs only few thousand a month,

518
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,410
If we reduce further,
how can they support their family?

519
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,850
So it's really impossible to save,

520
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,730
I think,
it is appropriate to reduce expenditure,

521
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,110
But if we reduce too much,

522
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,730
it would cause unrest among the people,
The loss outweighs the gain,

523
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,272
I am aware of everyone's difficulties, but

524
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,330
next year, the imperial court
is planning a distant campaign to the north,

525
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,370
Furthermore, the arrears in tax revenue
from Xizhou are not a plight of just one day,

526
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,730
If we do not broaden sources of income
and reduce expenditure,

527
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,870
and the imperial court issue an order
next year to deliver military provisions,

528
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,930
I wonder if you can step forward
to donate your family's wealth,

529
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,770
or force the Senior Official Pei

530
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,610
to levy three to five years
of rent and tributes,

531
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,930
Senior Official,
the expenditure must certainly be reduced,

532
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,900
Go ahead and do it,

533
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:27,090
I believe everyone present here
will strongly support you,

534
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,290
- Drink,
- Come on,

535
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,450
I can't drink anymore,

536
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,604
Drink quickly,

537
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,250

00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,250

Brother San, drink them all under the table,

Drink, Brother San!

546
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,730
Brother Si,

547
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,010

548
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,330
Get the money quickly!

549
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,350
Quickly, Take the money!

550
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,368

554
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,090
- Minister,
- Slow down,

555
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,048
Minister,

<i>[Rising Sun and Forever Moon]</i>
What official documents has been sent by Protector-General's Mansion?

557
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,970
It's the newspaper from Chang'an,

558
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,230
A month ago, Empress Wang

559
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,010
and Mistress Shu, Lady Xiao,
have been demoted to a commoner,

560
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,990
Their relatives have been exiled to Lingnan,

561
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,370
I'm afraid at this very moment,

562
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,970
we will soon have to start addressing her
as Empress Wu,

563
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,770
It was expected that
Lady Wu would take the position of Empress,

564
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,050
But why have they eagerly brought this to you?

565
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,090
Naturally, it's to remind me that

566
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,770
I'll never have the chance
to turn things around in Chang'an,

567
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,330
That ill-intentioned peacock,

568
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,090
In this way, I can accompany you more,

569
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,410
Are we going to continue
pretending to be stupid to avoid injuring?

570
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,290
Is this the newspaper?

571
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,150
If the newspaper is this thick,
it's going to be in trouble,

572
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,050
<i>[Tang Xizhou Gaochang County's Civil and Military Officials' Salary]</i>
This is last year's account book from Protector-General's Mansion,

573
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,250
They're willing to show you the accounts
so soon,

574
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:35,010
It is said that the tax arrears
in Xizhou are accumulating year by year,

575
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,650
It is time for the Protector-General's Mansion
to broaden sources of income and reduce expenditure,

576
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,650
This is indeed the most offensive job,

577
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,850
It is now most appropriate for me to do it,

578
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,036
You start packing things first,

579
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:51,290
I will also have a look
to see if there's any clues,

<i>[Pei's Mansion]</i>

00:41:10,628 --> 00:41:12,640
<i>[Rising Sun and Forever Moon]</i>

582

Stop embroidering,

583
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,610
Comfort in shoes and socks is enough,

584
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,330
What's the use of making it so exquisite?

585
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,140
You're straining your eyes,

586
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,330
The expenses of Protector-General's Mansion
are nothing more than personnel and other items,

587
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,810
As for humans,

588
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,370
on the surface,
there are indeed some external officials

589
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,372
have received their salaries,

590
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,610
But Xizhou has five counties
and twenty-four townships,

591
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,250
The court has not appointed any officials,

592
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,530
It can only be assigned
by Protector-General's Mansion,

593
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,970
It's 50% less than what the court should give,

594
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,290
There is absolutely no reason
to reduce it further,

595
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,610
As the newly appointed Senior Official,
if the first thing you do upon assuming office

596
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,850
is to reduce the already meager treatment
of your subordinates,

597
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,850
Aren't you digging a hole for yourself?

598
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,588
Can't it be done without cutting?

599
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,500
Probably not,

600
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,650
Since this matter has been brought to me
and I'm asked to make a decision,

601
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,910
I guess that Minister Qu has his own methods

602
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,170
to force me to do it,
