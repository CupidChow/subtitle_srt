Lady Zhang.

4
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:44,964
Prefect Wang are also here.

5
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,064
What a coincidence!

6
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,324
What is the order from Minister?

7
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:51,124
Minister sent me to deliver wine
to the Senior Official.

8
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,964
The carvings on this wine flask
are extremely exquisite.

9
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:56,484
It must be a wine tool
of the northern nobility.

10
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,084
I wonder if this wine is from the north.

11
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:00,672
Exactly.

Lady Ni.

14
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:16,604
Why you come here together?

15
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,204
Not together. We just met at the entrance.

16
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:20,764
On the order of Minister,

17
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,404
I'm here to deliver the wine.

18
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:29,536
On behalf of master and my lady,
I thank Minister.

19
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:30,604
You're welcome.

20
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:31,724
Please come inside.

21
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:32,884
No need.

22
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:35,524
Junmeng has to leave for official duties.

23
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,044
Let me see you off.

24
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:39,204
Lady Zhang, please come in.

25
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,484
Yunyi.

26
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:45,984
Ni has gone to see him off.

27
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:48,524
Why don't Yunyi sit and chat with me?

28
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:50,524
I have nothing to say to you.

29
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:51,964
Are you scared of me?

30
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:54,724
This is your sister's house.

31
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:55,924
What a joke!

32
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,644
Being upright, why should I fear you?

33
00:02:59,484 --> 00:03:00,804
I was joking with you.

34
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,804
Yunyi, why are you so serious?

35
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,724
I can walk. No need to fake it.

36
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:20,924
Tell me. Are you here today

37
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:23,964
to sow discord or spread false accusations?

38
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:26,144
There must be some misunderstandings.

39
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:28,564
I stopped you to clear up the misunderstanding.

40
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:29,724
I know you like Minister.

41
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,444
I do, too.

42
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,804
No need for underhanded tactics used on me.

43
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:35,844
To like someone openly,

44
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:37,764
to love frankly, isn't it better?

45
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,884
There seems to be a real misunderstanding.

46
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:41,704
Truth be told.

47
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,364
Matching me and Minister

48
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:44,924
is the intention of my family.

49
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,204
But Yunyi, do you know

50
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:49,264
Minister is not a good match for you or me.

51
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:51,044
Nor is he a match for any woman.

52
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:55,604
You may not know that

53
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:58,844
Minister has a lawful wife in Chang'an.

54
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:01,904
She is noble, dignified and graceful,

55
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:04,604
handling all affairs of the Qus in Chang'an.

56
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:08,244
It is because Madam Minister
is willing to stay in Chang'an

57
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:10,424
that Minister could return to Xizhou

58
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,444
to live in a free world and

59
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:13,524
realize his dreams.

60
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,504
Minister respects and loves his first wife.

61
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:17,944
He once promised her that

62
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:19,444
should he return to Chang'an,

63
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,244
he would bring back no other women.

64
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:22,884
For so many years,

65
00:04:22,884 --> 00:04:24,764
Minister has always kept his promise.

66
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,644
He has no other women.

67
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:31,284
This shows that Minister
is a person of love and loyalty.

68
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:34,644
There's nothing inappropriate.

69
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:37,244
I want to tell you that

70
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,204
any woman by Minister's side

71
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:40,624
will not stay long.

72
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:42,844
One day he will return to Chang'an,

73
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,524
back to his legal wife.

74
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,984
All this happened before I knew Minister.

75
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:55,644
And it's already a fait accompli.

76
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:58,044
Why should I bother about this?

77
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,564
My lady said so much with Yunyi

78
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:18,124
about Minister's legal wife.

79
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,704
But she seemed not to care.

80
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:22,564
She's just pretending.

81
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:24,844
I am a woman, also deeply

82
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:26,044
in love with Minister.

83
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:29,264
Which woman wouldn't care about such a thing?

84
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,644
They just hide their feelings.

85
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,964
Since my lady, with several words,

86
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:35,944
has planted thorns inside Yunyi,

87
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:37,524
why are you still unhappy?

88
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:40,404
The wine Minister sent

89
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:41,844
to Senior Official Pei

90
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:43,324
is for Ashina Yunyi.

91
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,484
Minister may deceive others

92
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:48,164
and perhaps even himself,

93
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:50,124
but not me.

94
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,284
Perhaps my lady worries too much.

95
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:56,764
The wine is for the Senior Official.

96
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:00,984
It's strong liquor
from Ashina Yunyi's hometown.

97
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,604
It's not what Senior Official likes,

98
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:03,964
but Yunyi's does.

99
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,044
Minister is very clever.

100
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:07,644
He must know.

101
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,304
It was last year's dress.

102
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:20,924
I have seldom worn it.

103
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,844
Now it's a bit tight to wear.

104
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:26,084
Good Ni, just let me take a walk
in the courtyard.

105
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:29,604
My lady, master reminds us every day.

106
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:32,324
We must not let my lady get tired
or catch a cold.

107
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:34,604
Listen to master's words.

108
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:35,684
Rest for more days.

Please say something fair.

Haven't I recovered?

113
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:51,504
If I go on to stay in this room,

114
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,044
I will have mental illness.

115
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:56,124
Let Physician Han take your pulse first.

116
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,280
How is it?

117
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:20,284
Madam, you have recovered indeed.

118
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:23,964
Going out
and relaxing once in a while is beneficial.

119
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:25,856
Thank you, Physician Han.

120
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:28,404
See, even Physician Han has said so.

121
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,844
I should go out more often.

122
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:33,184
Yes, you should.

123
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:34,604
But take it lightly.

124
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,764
Don't say you want to ride a horse
outside town now.

125
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:40,564
I do want to ride a horse.

126
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:41,964
Would my husband agree?

127
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:43,364
I can't lie in bed anymore.

128

Even my feet have got fat.

129
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,204
Look at yourself.

130
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:50,924
You're way from fat.

131
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:56,992
Put me down.

132
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:00,404
As expected, it's heavier.

133
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:02,124
But it's still too light.

134
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:05,204
I'll be too heavy for you to lift me later.

135
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:08,164
I wish so, but I dare not to expect it.

Let the kitchen tell me and sister Ni.

139

We can make it for you.

Why you do it yourself?

141
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:53,044
It's livelier if I make it with you.

142
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:56,644
It's been really bland these few months.

143
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:57,964
Today I'll eat tasty food.

144

I really can't take the plain porridge anymore.

What do you like my lady?

146
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:05,544
It's helpful to eat more for lunch.

147
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,144
I often hear Physician Han say,

148
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:09,044
"Food is the best medicine."

149
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,524
Thanks to Physician Han's words today.

150
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:16,164
Otherwise, I wouldn't know when I could go out.

151
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:19,204
Ni, please say thank you to him for me.

152
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:20,352
Yes.

153
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:23,584
Liuli, you're welcome.

154
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:25,524
You don't need to thank him.

155
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,044
He merely spoke the truth.

156
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:30,304
But since you have recovered,

157
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,724
why keep staying indoors

158
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:33,484
and in bed?

159
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:34,984
It's not good for the body.

160
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,484
He did say

161
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:37,884
you have recovered.

162
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:40,004
No need to take the medicine.

163
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,004
But he also said

164
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:42,764
you need to keep resting longer.

165
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:44,564
I don't know why he talked so much.

166
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,204
Sister's words are so strange.

167
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:51,864
Tan heard many "he"s. Who is "he"?

168
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,044
Please, sister, explain it to Tan.

169
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:58,524
Anyway, it's not your Cheng.

170
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:02,564
Sister, don't joke with me.

The grace of my lady and master.

172
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,404
Tan dares not disobey.

173
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,984
The young should respect the old.

174
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:12,124
Sister should make decision first.

175
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:16,084
Alright, I won't argue with you.

176
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:21,724
Liuli, I heard from Han Si
that you are better now.

177
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:22,964
So I come and see you.

178
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:25,284
Here is some specialty from the capital.

179
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:27,504
I can rest assured upon seeing you well.

180
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:28,764
Thank you, sister.

Won't you stay for lunch together?

182
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:33,724
No.
Someone has already prepared a meal at home.

Thank you sister.

184
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:45,464
I wonder why Tan is so articulate today.

185
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:47,324
You're a bit anxious.

00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:50,104
Who, who's anxious?

00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:52,384
I'm just worried for sister.

188
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,124
My lady, please don't tease me.

189
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:56,444
I'm not teasing you.

190
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,164
If you're not anxious at all,

191
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:00,724
Master and I would worry.

192
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:03,824
When waiting to be married at Su's Mansion,

193
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:05,684
I was somewhat anxious, too.

194
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:08,124
When awaiting marriage,

195
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:09,444
what needs to be done?

196
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:10,624
Learn bookkeeping.

197
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:12,004
Learn communication.

198
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,464
Learn how to manage a home.

199
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,724
Learn music and manners.

200
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,444
Now it's all useless.

201
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:19,384
If my mother knew that

202
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:21,624
Shouyue has made me like this,

203
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:23,624
a waste who sleeps and eats all day,

204
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:25,324
she must be deeply distressed.

205
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:28,724
If Madam Yu knew,

206
00:11:28,724 --> 00:11:30,284
she couldn't be happier.

207
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:31,924
Ni thought before

208
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,064
Xizhou is a remote and frigid place.

209
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:36,704
Now I am gradually getting used to
the climate here.

210
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:39,604
I find it much more relaxing than in Chang'an.

211
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:42,744
Don't laugh at me.

212
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,604
A few days ago, I even loosened my skirt.

213
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:49,684
Ni's face has indeed become rounder.

214
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:50,964
Why didn't I notice?

215
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:57,284
Why can't I gain weight?

216
00:11:58,004 --> 00:11:59,184
Previously,

217
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:02,284
Sanniang said
I won't gain weight even with rice and flour.

218
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:05,204
I'm still the same now.

219
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:06,884
If you, in one day,

220
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,364
can keep quiet longer,

221
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:09,824
you would've got fat by now.

222
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:10,944
As you command.

223
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:29,104
This soup-boiled meatballs

224
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:30,504
are both hot and tasty.

225
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:31,684
Absolutely delicious.

226
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,064
Sister has recovered.

227
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:34,764
She can make meals for me again.

228
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:36,484
This is really a joy.

229
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:41,164
Slow down. Don't burn yourself.

230
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:42,244
No scrambling.

231
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:47,564
This wine

232
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,404
was sent by Minister Qu.

233
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:51,284
It's for the Senior Official.

234
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,564
But I guess he wanted to give it to you.

235
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:04,404
It's from my hometown.

236
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:12,064
Sis, you didn't make a mistake, did you?

237
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:13,364
If Minister gives me wine,

238
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:14,804
why not give me directly?

239
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:16,724
Why it's for my brother-in-law?

240
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:19,704
Really a single-minded silly child.

241
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:22,844
Before, I was sick
and afraid of your getting drunk alone.

242
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,524
So I dared not give you the wine.

243
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:25,824
Now, I am watching you.

244
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:27,164
Only a small cup.

245
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:34,924
It's really good wine.

246
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:36,344
It's my hometown's taste.

247
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:37,744
And it's from Minister.

248
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:38,884
I treasure this.

249
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,244
I'll save it for later.

250
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,384
Yunyi.

251
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:52,144
What lady Zhangmin said to you a few days ago,

252
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:53,444
Ni has already told me.

253
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:56,604
Lady Zhangmin had ill intentions.

254
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:58,204
So she told you that.

255
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,404
But what she said was true.

256
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:03,924
Minister is not the one
who will stay with you forever.

257
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:14,112
Sister,

258
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:15,944
do you also think

259
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:17,644
that I'm not worthy of Minister?

260
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,984
Minister is a man who keeps his promises.

261
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:24,204
He will surely keep his words
for his lawful wife.

262
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:27,644
Sister fears that one day, if ever,

263
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:29,684
you're heartbroken and desolate.

264
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,684
Sister didn't say this to you before

265
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:34,524
for thinking Minister didn't like you.

266
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:35,844
But now it seems that

267
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,404
sister has got it wrong.

268
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:41,124
Sister,

269
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:42,244
you mean

270
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:44,404
Minister likes me.

271
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:50,976
Sister.

272
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:54,604
Even if Minister does not like me,

273
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,044
I still like him.

274
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:58,604
Even if he returns to Chang'an,

275
00:14:58,604 --> 00:14:59,864
to his legal wife,

276
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:00,928
without me,

277
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:03,284
my feelings for him wouldn't change.

278
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:07,164
Even if it cannot last forever,

279
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:10,004
I also want to be with him

280
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:11,044
while I can.

281
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,152
Warm him.

282
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,608
This is enough.

283
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,564
Yunyi won't regret.

284
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,404
Such a silly child with foolish love.

285
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:25,856
Eat.

286
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:40,884
My lady, go to bed and rest.

287
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:43,244
Master reminded several times before going out.

288
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:44,904
He would come back later.

289
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,684
Don't let my lady wait in vain.

290
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:48,576
You're so chatty.

291
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:53,952
My lady.

292
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:57,904
Tan, invite lady Liu over for a talk now.

293
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:00,304
Tell her that Fang Lie has come to our mansion,

294
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:01,744
having relations with her.

295
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:02,752
Yes.

296
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:05,164
Is the person lady Liu wants

297
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,040
found by you?

298
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:09,120
No haste.

299
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:12,044
It's complex.

300
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,324
I can't tell if it's good or bad.

301
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:16,124
What's going on exactly?

302
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:18,204
This time,

303
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:20,084
General Ashina Mishe comes to Xizhou,

304
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:21,944
bringing five or six generals.

305
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:24,164
Master Fang is one of them.

306
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:26,564
So to speak, this master Fang

307
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:28,444
has been relied upon by Ashina Mishe.

308
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:31,264
Ashina Mishe has been friendly with us,

309
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:33,264
and just became pacification ambassador.

310
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:34,684
But why did you say

311
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:36,364
you can't tell it's complex?

312
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:38,884
I'll explain it to you later.

313
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:40,804
Let's go over first.

314
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:43,404
We should not keep master Fang waiting.

315
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:49,284
I thought

316
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:51,404
master Fang made huge trouble.

317
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:54,404
But that shepherd official

318
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:56,604
was indeed outrageous.

319
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,124
And he

320
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:00,764
has always been unfair,

321
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:02,924
He has no relatives in Xizhou.

322
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:06,124
As time goes by,

323
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,364
no one would care about it anymore.

324
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,472
Master Fang,

325
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:15,524
if remains unknown,

326
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:19,124
could pretend to be an immigrant.

327
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:21,244
He could change his name

328
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:22,284
and register again.

329
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:24,444
Living in peace

330
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,080
won't be hard.

331
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,644
Master Fang truly is a talent.

332
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:34,444
Within just a few years,

333
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:37,804
he became the trusted general of Ashina Mishe.

334
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,284
Now he followed the general into the barrack,

335
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:42,364
into Xizhou.

336
00:17:42,964 --> 00:17:46,084
I'm afraid
it won't be easy to hide his identity.

337
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:50,752
It doesn't stop there.

338
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:53,884
The way he looks

339
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:55,684
is truly eye-catching.

340
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:57,664
Everyone who has seen him

341
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:58,924
will not forget probably.

342
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:02,104
If he can win battles,

343
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:04,124
there are precedents for amnesty.

344
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,844
But such a chance

345
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:07,724
is indeed rare.

346
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:10,684
You would never have thought

347
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:12,644
he changed his own name to Fang Lie.

348
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:15,084
I was shocked upon hearing.

349
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:17,204
In the barrack,

350
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:19,364
he heard that I was looking for Fang Lie.

351
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:21,244
So he came to me, drunk.

352
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:23,444
We recognized each other

353
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:25,684
and fled to come here.

354
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:29,984
The merit worthy of amnesty

355
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,324
is not easy to attain.

356
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,056
That is of course.

357
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:34,976
Think about it.

358
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:36,764
The crime he committed

359
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:38,444
was killing a superior.

360
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:41,604
Without victory,

361
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:44,284
how can we persuade His Majesty?

362
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:47,804
Winning victory in the battle

363
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:50,244
depends on ability

364
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:51,404
but mostly fortune.

365
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,124
In his current situation

366
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:56,884
it's unlikely to hide his identity.

367
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:00,004
I just talked with him.

368
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:01,760
Regarding his tone,

369
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:03,764
he is a pride person,

370
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:05,764
unlikely to compromise.

371
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,284
If master Fang

372
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:11,324
will compromise at the slightest,

373
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:13,604
by then his child might be five feet tall.

374
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:15,844
Need lady Liu try so hard?

375
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:59,072
[Fang Lie]

376
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:04,204
Thanks, Senior Official, Madam.

377
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:07,364
It's nothing.

378
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:11,044
Madam and I have also troubled lady Liu.

379
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,124
It's nothing. Don't bother.

380
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:17,164
I should thank you
for looking after my younger sister.

381
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:21,484
Master, my lady, lady Liu is here.

382
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:22,484
Yue, you…

383
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:28,444
You…How are you?

384
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,804
Me? What could possibly be wrong with me?

385
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:34,560
It's just you…

386
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:43,724
You two catch up.

387
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:46,044
My wife and I will excuse.

388
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,744
I beg your pardon.

389
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:33,524
The moon is full.

390
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,324
People miss home.

391
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:49,088
Don't worry.

392
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:51,924
Master Fang and lady Liu

393
00:23:53,084 --> 00:23:54,804
have gone through ups and downs.

394
00:23:55,324 --> 00:23:56,644
Finally, they meet.

395
00:23:58,524 --> 00:23:59,684
So the Heaven

396
00:24:00,724 --> 00:24:02,364
still favors lovers.

397
00:24:06,124 --> 00:24:07,444
May the flowers bloom

398
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:09,600
and the moon be full.

399
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:12,284
May lovers always stay together.

400
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:34,784
Yue.

401
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:36,704
Did my appearance

402
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:39,244
scare you?

403
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:52,224
Does it still hurt?

404
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:55,204
It's been many years.

405
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:56,992
How could it hurt?

406
00:24:58,324 --> 00:24:59,404
It's really nothing.

407
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:01,884
It's just…

408
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:03,684
When I was playing with friends,

409
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:05,844
I cut my face with a knife.

410
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,644
I'm doing quite well over there.

411
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:12,244
It's nothing more than following the general,

412
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,764
hunting everywhere, drinking and eating meat.

413
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:16,544
It's a lot of fun.

414
00:25:17,924 --> 00:25:19,444
I thought that it was just me.

415
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:21,544
I just live my life alone,

416
00:25:21,544 --> 00:25:22,964
carefree and unencumbered.

417
00:25:24,804 --> 00:25:27,404
But since I heard
about that mother and daughter,

418
00:25:29,284 --> 00:25:30,804
I've been worrying about you,

419
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,524
about how you're doing.

420
00:25:34,644 --> 00:25:36,804
I've asked merchants to inquire.

421
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:38,484
But no news came.

422
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:40,964
I was thinking

423
00:25:41,804 --> 00:25:42,816
till the war is over

424
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:44,804
I'll go back myself.

425
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,604
I didn't expect you to come looking for me
in Xizhou.

426
00:26:24,724 --> 00:26:25,792
What brings you here?

427
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:27,644
You must be lonely.

428
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:28,644
I'll accompany you.

429
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:30,144
Who's lonely?

430
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:31,204
Who needs you?

431
00:26:32,244 --> 00:26:33,404
Then in the distance,

432
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:34,924
I saw someone there sniffling.

433
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:36,884
Well,

434
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:38,524
upon hearing their love story,

435
00:26:38,524 --> 00:26:39,604
you pitied yourself.

436
00:26:39,604 --> 00:26:41,084
I was just cold.

437
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:44,524
So I brought you a cloak in case of a cold.

438
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:48,004
You talk too much.

439
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:49,164
Why talk so much?

440
00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:52,684
Okay, okay, I was wrong. Stop pouting.

441
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:10,004
The moon is beautiful.

442
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:18,404
I heard you're in Xizhou.

443
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,804
So I came here, hoping against hope.

444
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:23,764
I thought I couldn't find you.

445
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:26,244
But now

446
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:28,844
the Heaven has treated me well.

447
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,584
You've desired success since you were young.

448
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,784
Now that you are working under the general,

449
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:38,604
you have the chance to succeed.

450
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:43,564
I will follow you.

451
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:54,644
It's not like Xizhou.

452
00:27:56,404 --> 00:27:57,604
You wouldn't like it.

453
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,564
Besides,

454
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:05,324
you don't need to sacrifice for me.

455
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,024
Yue,

456
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:10,656
I've worked it out.

457
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,324
Now the war is imminent.

458
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:15,504
I will win victory

459
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,364
and return to marry you with honor.

460
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:20,104
In Chang'an,

461
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:22,044
there is no Liu Ruyue.

462
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:26,124
I cannot return to Chang'an with you honorably.

463
00:28:27,364 --> 00:28:29,124
If it's this easy to win victory,

464
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:31,884
Xizhou will be full of titled officials.

465
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:35,564
Are you leaving me in a huff again?

466
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:41,376
Yue.

467
00:28:43,804 --> 00:28:45,124
I listen to you.

468
00:28:49,204 --> 00:28:50,524
I will not leave you.

469
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:43,072
Congratulations.

470
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:46,848
Many thanks.

471
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:49,724
It's just that I have another favor to ask.

472
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:52,524
Helping others is a blessing.

473
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:55,244
Yue and I have worked it out.

474
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,364
I'll stay for a few days.

475
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,924
After marrying Yue in Xizhou,

476
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:00,964
I'll take Yue away.

477
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:03,204
But

478
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:05,164
Yue may temporarily stay in Xizhou.

479
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:07,244
Madam, please care for her.

480
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:10,804
It's easy.

481
00:30:12,204 --> 00:30:13,924
But the general…

482
00:30:13,924 --> 00:30:15,040
No need to worry.

483
00:30:15,644 --> 00:30:17,244
The general seems serious,

484
00:30:17,244 --> 00:30:19,004
but generous in fact.

485
00:30:19,724 --> 00:30:20,804
I have mentioned that

486
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:23,124
I have a fiancee in Chang'an.

487
00:30:23,964 --> 00:30:25,444
The general knows about this.

488
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:26,524
He won't blame me.

489
00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:28,096
That's good.

490
00:30:28,924 --> 00:30:30,016
It's late.

491
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,164
Let's go back to Protector-General's Mansion.

492
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,164
Inform Minister Qu about this as well.

493
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,084
I just got the news.

494
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:56,804
The chief of the Nishu Tribe,

495
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:58,764
Yunyi's father,

496
00:30:59,264 --> 00:31:00,352
passed away.

497
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:04,364
Now

498
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,044
Yunyi's half-brother

499
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,244
succeeded the chief.

500
00:31:09,844 --> 00:31:11,804
Yunyi has deep feelings for her father.

501
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,324
Even if a war is imminent,

502
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,204
we should find a way

503
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:17,884
to send Yunyi back to the tribe.

504
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:21,524
Liuli, listen to me first.

505
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:24,924
It should indeed be so emotionally,
but logically…

506
00:31:25,604 --> 00:31:26,804
Now the war is imminent.

507
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:29,524
If we send Yunyi back,

508
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:30,524
is there a way?

509
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:32,704
If there is,

510
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,924
Nishu tribe is far.

511
00:31:35,884 --> 00:31:37,164
When she arrives,

512
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:38,604
her father must be buried.

513
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:40,644
Yunyi couldn't see her father.

514
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,208
I understand.

515
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:51,044
Master Fang won't stay in Xizhou for long.

516
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,604
Lady Liu and he have no relatives
or elders here.

517
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:58,044
Even the marriage is prepared by us.

518
00:31:58,604 --> 00:31:59,884
We really can't leave.

519
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:02,524
But for Yunyi, this…

520
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,640
I know.

521
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:07,684
I know you are close as sisters.

522
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:09,568
But these days,

523
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:11,724
please don't tell her.

524
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:14,084
Otherwise, Yunyi

525
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:15,684
will surely sneak back.

526
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,204
It will surely get risky then.

527
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,488
Liuli.

528
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:21,924
Let's get things done first.

529
00:32:22,884 --> 00:32:24,764
Then go to the tribe with Yunyi.

530
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,564
It's a grievance for Yunyi.

531
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:31,084
But it's the only way.

532
00:32:32,064 --> 00:32:33,120
When the time comes,

533
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:35,404
I'll apologize to her.

534
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:36,924
Beg her forgiveness.

535
00:32:38,684 --> 00:32:39,964
I hope this works.

536
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:42,496
Yes.

537
00:32:55,936 --> 00:32:57,952
[Liu's Residence]

538
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:01,644
Thank you, cheers.

539
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:03,552
Cheers.

540
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:06,044
Congratulations. Here. Please.

541
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:07,744
Here.

542
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:10,564
I'll make a toast.

543
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:11,616
Here.

544
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:25,004
- Minister, a toast to you.
- Me too.

545
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,084
Minister can't drink. I'll drink for him.

546
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,984
- Here. Cheers.
- Okay.

547
00:33:29,984 --> 00:33:31,804
Senior Official, madam.

548
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:33,088
Come dance with us.

549
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:34,124
Okay.

550
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:35,144
Liuli's had illness.

551
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:37,384
She shouldn't be tired. Please excuse her.

552
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:38,444
- Come.
- Let's play.

553
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:39,704
Play with the newlyweds.

554
00:33:39,704 --> 00:33:42,604
The livelier the wedding,
the luckier it is. Off you go.

555
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:44,640
Alright then.

556
00:33:55,008 --> 00:33:56,032
Okay, here.

557
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:58,364
Good wine.

558
00:33:58,364 --> 00:33:59,392
Good wine.

559
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:07,204
Are you tired? Do you want to rest?

560
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:08,524
I'm not tired.

561
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:11,424
Seeing master Fang
and lady Liu finally get married,

562
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,564
I am really happy.

563
00:34:31,724 --> 00:34:32,884
Here, drink one more.

564
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:33,920
Okay.

565
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,604
Here, Minister. Toast, Minister.

566
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:40,000
Toast to you.

567
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,004
Minister, Minister, toast.

568
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:43,164
Here, here, let me drink for Minister. Here.

569
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,124
Chongyu, Chongyu.

570
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,884
What's the matter? Why did you go out?

571
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:01,724
It's this.

572
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,604
Yunyi loves singing and dancing.

573
00:35:04,124 --> 00:35:05,844
But she's uninterested today.

574
00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:08,284
She often dresses in bright colors.

575
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:10,244
But her dress is plain today.

576
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:11,564
I think

577
00:35:11,564 --> 00:35:13,604
she knows about her father's death.

578
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:16,104
Oh no, there could be trouble.

579
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:17,204
What should we do?

580
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:18,624
Let's split up and search.

581
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:19,776
Okay.

582
00:36:28,524 --> 00:36:29,604
About your father.

583
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:33,632
You know it all.

584
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:07,168
Don't cry.

585
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:09,604
I'll escort you back.

586
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:18,048
You mean

587
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:22,964
you'll escort me to the tribe.

588
00:37:26,204 --> 00:37:27,444
The war is approaching.

589
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:32,044
You are so indifferent

590
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:33,924
as to send me back.

591
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,352
Actually,

592
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:54,644
I inadvertently heard
my sister and brother-in-law's conversation.

593
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:56,800
They said

594
00:38:58,084 --> 00:39:00,164
once sister Liu's wedding is over,

595
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,004
they'll find a way to send me back.

596
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:06,284
Since then,

597
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:08,640
I've decided that

598
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:12,684
I'm not going back.

599
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:21,120
Why?

600
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:23,404
The journey is so long.

601
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:27,764
Even if I go back,

602
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:31,124
my father will have been buried.

603
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:35,844
I can never see him again.

604
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,724
Sending me back at this time

605
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:41,484
is not just troublesome.

606
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:44,124
It's even full of dangers.

607
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:46,244
The war is imminent.

608
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:49,804
For Xizhou, Senior Official

609
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:52,804
has greater responsibilities.

610
00:39:54,564 --> 00:39:57,004
He has more important things to do.

611
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:10,364
Minister, it's the same for you.

612
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:21,164
This seems not like what you'd say.

613
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:23,644
I thought

614
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:27,844
upon hearing what
Senior Official told your sister,

615
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:29,804
you would act recklessly

616
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:32,164
and go back.

617
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:36,244
If I did that,

618
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:39,084
my sister and her husband

619
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:42,004
would go looking for me.

620
00:40:44,764 --> 00:40:47,044
Sister Liu's wedding would be disrupted.

621
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:51,244
They've all been so good to me.

622
00:40:52,924 --> 00:40:54,324
I cannot do this.

623
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:58,848
Yunyi.

624
00:41:01,444 --> 00:41:03,204
Your father is not by your side.

625
00:41:05,884 --> 00:41:06,912
From now on,

626
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:15,204
let me be your support.

627
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:20,724
Let me protect you.

628
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,032
Okay.

629
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,124
[Six years later.
The second year of Longshuo. Autumn]

630
00:42:02,124 --> 00:42:03,204
Six years later.

631
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:05,244
The second year of Longshuo.

632
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:08,764
Pei Xingjian assisted Su Dingfang in the army,

633
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:10,484
pacifying the tribes in the north,

634
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:13,324
building roads and posts,
helping the poor and the sick.

635
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,384
Under the governance of Pei Xingjian,

636
00:42:15,384 --> 00:42:18,964
the ten northern clans
sincerely pledged allegiance to Tang.

637
00:42:28,832 --> 00:42:32,672
[Pei's Mansion]

638
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:48,744
Since the illness in Xianqing,

639
00:42:48,744 --> 00:42:49,904
every lunar December,

640
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:51,784
my lady always falls sick.

641
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:53,224
They say it's a cold.

642
00:42:53,224 --> 00:42:55,024
Actually she has been weakened.

643
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:56,524
Her body still needs toning.

644
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:04,575
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

645
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:11,103
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

646
00:43:12,607 --> 00:43:15,423
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

647
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:19,103
♫ I write a poem

660
