00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,955
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

3
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:48,692
Unexpectedly, you're a devout believer,
Lady Jing,

4
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:51,532
Liuli, please stop teasing me,

5
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:52,732
Although I'm going to worship Buddha,

6
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:54,412
my heart of self-interest
exceeds worshipping Buddha,

7
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:56,812
It seems even the Buddha has seen through this,

8
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:59,572
That's why, despite many years of worship,
my wishes have never been fulfilled,

9
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:03,332
Lately, I have moved on,

10
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,372
So, I don't have too high expectations,

11
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:07,532
I wonder what are you praying for,

12
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:09,252
Is it convenient to tell me?

13
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,492
Actually, it's nothing,

14
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,912
This matter is already known to all,

15
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:14,452
All this while, those busybodies have

16
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:16,192
never been short of talking about me
behind my back,

17
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,612
What?

18
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:18,852
I'm getting more and more curious,

19
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,532
I have been married to Wang Junmeng
for many years,

20
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:24,152
Liuli, you know this as well,

21
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:27,412
But I have never borne him a son or a daughter,

22
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,852
At first, I didn't take it seriously,

23
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:31,712
But as time went on,

24
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,212
it became my heartache,

25
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:38,692
Of the three unfilial acts,
having no descendants is the worst,

26
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:41,052
This matter is indeed no small issue,

27
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:45,292
His elders have actually been
expressing their disapproval for some time,

28
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,492
They also thought about
finding him a concubine,

29
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,052
Besides, I feel guilty about this,

30
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:51,932
If he really wants a concubine,

31
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:53,492
I'll stop him,

32
00:02:56,492 --> 00:03:00,252
But he decisively refused all matters
relating to finding a bride,

33
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,892
He would rather have people mock him
behind his back for having no descendants

34
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:05,252
than let me down,

35
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:09,772
I didn't expect
Wang Junmeng to be such a devoted person!

36
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:12,172
It made me see him in a new light,

37
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:14,972
But the more he does so,
the more guilty I feel,

38
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:17,012
Over the years,

39
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:18,752
I have tried all the methods I could,

40
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:20,172
but none have been effective,

41
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:24,372
Therefore, the bronze Buddha worshipped
in this Great Buddha Temple

42
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,712
is my wife's only hope,

43
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:28,692
Is this Great Buddha Temple truly
so miraculous?

44
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:31,132
Madam Kudi, you have not been in Xizhou
for a long time,

45
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:32,272
and don't know certain things,

46
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:34,932
The bronze Buddha in Great Buddha Temple
is extraordinarily miraculous,

47
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:36,652
Every few years,
it would become real to people,

48
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:39,972
Back when that cruel
Protector-General Qiao was in office,

49
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:42,252
he forced people to dig city walls
in the scorching heat,

50
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:43,572
Many people died,

51
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:46,672
Within days, the bronze Buddha began
to weep and sweat,

52
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:48,452
which shook the entire Western Regions,

53
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:49,992
Protector-General Qiao was also frightened,

54
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:51,332
So he stopped the forced labor,

55
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,432
Later on, the newly appointed
Protector-General Chai

56
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,412
claimed to promote Taoism over Buddhism,

57
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:57,792
He intended to build a Taoist temple
in the eastern district,

58
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:58,972
But within a couple of days,

59
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,112
this bronze Buddha wept
just as it had in the past,

60
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,092
The matter of repairing the Taoist temple

61
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,372
was thus left unresolved,

62
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:07,372
It's truly unheard of

63
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:09,972
for a bronze Buddha to weep and sweat,

64
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,412
This is not something I made up,

65
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,252
Everyone in Xizhou knows about this,

66
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,452
If it's true,

67
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:17,012
indeed, it's worth worshipping Buddha,

68
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:21,652
This time, I will also pray to
the bronze Buddha for you,

69
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,732
Perhaps the two of us together

70
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,852
can move the Buddha to bestow a miracle,

71
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:28,532
I will pray as well,

72
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:29,772
As long as it is real to people,

73
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,172
even if my head gets cracked open,

74
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:32,532
Tan is also perfectly willing,

75
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,452
About her body deed,

76
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:36,932
is there really no room for turning back?

77
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:42,712
I-I-I truly wish the best for Madam Qu,

78
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:44,812
I also don't want to leave my wife,

79

Qu Tanyue,

82
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,772
Long time no see, how are you doing recently?

83
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:23,456
Monk Yizhao,

84
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,812
Liuli, you get on the carriage first,
I will follow shortly,

85
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:35,632
Monk Yizhao,

86
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:37,872
I was saying
that I didn't see you in the temple today,

87
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,412
So you went out to speak the Dharma,

88
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:41,792
Our Buddha provides universal salvation
to all beings,

89
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,172
Therefore, we need to spread the Dharma
everywhere,

90
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:58,652
Giddyap,

91
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:00,960

00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:06,688

- Giddyap,
- My lady,

98
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:13,072
Move aside!

99
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:14,112
My Lady,

100
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,192
What's going on?

101
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,096

Giddyap,

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,752
What are you doing?

104
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:36,768
Giddyap,

105
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:38,688
Giddyap,

106
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:40,172
My horse,

Giddyap,

108

Giddyap,

109
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:46,688
Out of the way,

110
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:52,544
Giddyap,

111
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:02,944
Giddyap,

Lady Jing,

Liuli,

00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:56,320
Giddyap,

123
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,496

124
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,552

125
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,176
Giddyap,

126
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:04,332
- Stop,
- Giddyap,

127
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,480
Stop,

128
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:20,852
Giddyap,

129
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,232
Giddyap,

130
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:27,680
Stop now,

131
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:31,072
Stop,

132
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:45,772
Lady,

133
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:48,732
I had the kitchen make a bowl of calming soup
for you to drink while it's hot,

134
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,856
Leave it there,

135
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,652
It's okay, don't cry,

136
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:00,712
I am doing well, right?

137
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:02,492
No, you're not,

138
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:06,212
Look at you, my lady, you're all injured,

139
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:08,552
It's all Tan's fault,

140
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:11,452
I was clearly right next to the carriage,

141
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:14,012
but you got taken away by thieves,

142
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:21,088
Stop,

143
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:32,632
All of you may leave now,

144
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:33,696
Yes,

145
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:24,572
Could you please not do this?

146
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,344
Shouyue,

147
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,572
When at Yunwei Residence,

148
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,252
I just swore solemnly

149
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:36,812
to protect you well and

150
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,812
definitely won't put you in danger,

151
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:46,848
Shouyue,

152
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,512
All of this

153
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:50,732
should have been my responsibility,

154
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:04,692
Don't blame yourself,

155
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:06,532
It's all my fault,

156
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:08,320
I promise you,

157
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,892
in the future, I will certainly be careful,

158
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,732
I will definitely take good care of myself,

159
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,492
As long as you are safe and well,
that's alright,

160
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:31,712
Who?

161
00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:39,072
Who? Who locked me in the door?

162
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:40,160
I,

163
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:50,372
My lady, why are you locking the door?

164
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,732
Did you send the person to kidnap Liuli?

165
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:55,412
Who?

166
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:00,012
Why did you suddenly change my carriage driver
today?

167
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:01,732
So, you have premeditated it,

168
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:05,872
My lady, I don't understand what you mean,

169
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,832
If not under your command,

170
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:09,992
then how dare the carriage driver kidnap Liuli,

171
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:11,252
What a huge misunderstanding!

172
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:12,412
My lady, without any ill feeling,

173
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:14,452
why would I kidnap Kudi Liuli?

174
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,492
So you wanted to kill her,

175
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,452
My lady, it's absolutely a false accusation,

176
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:20,492
If you don't believe me,
you could ask the coachman to come back,

177
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,032
We can confront each other face to face,

178
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:23,492
He has run away,

179
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,412
Where can I go to find him?

180
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:27,612
My lady, it wasn't me,

181
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:29,732
It's not me,

182
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:21,452
Do you know why am I looking for you?

183
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,212
Whatever means you use,

184
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,132
I, Pei Xingjian, will accompany you to the end,

185
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:30,336
But let me make it clear in advance,

186
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:34,252
if you ever think of hurting Liuli again,

187
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,732
despite of giving up my official robe,

188
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,412
I'll disrupt the Qu family,

189
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:46,848
Senior Official Pei,

190
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:49,052
I am not responsible for this matter,

191
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:51,932
If I wanted to kill you,

192
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:54,412
you couldn't walk out of Dunhuang alive,

193
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:55,968
Assassination

194
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:58,252
is something I disdain,

195
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,332
I hope so,

196
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:10,812
I will ensure the safety of Madam Kudi

197
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:16,612
for the honor of my Qu family,

198
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:28,652
My lady, this matter has nothing to do with me,

199
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:29,760
Close the door,

200
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,892
My lady,

201
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:31,904
Everyone gets out,

202
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,296
Speak,

203
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,892
My lady, I really have nothing
to do with this matter,

204
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:50,692
Alright, if it wasn't you,

205
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:51,692
then who?

206
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:55,892
No, Kudi Liuli is capricious
and has made countless enemies,

207
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:58,292
Perhaps it is another enemy seeking revenge,

208
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:00,572
Liuli just arrived in Xizhou and is unfamiliar with everything,
Where has her enemy come from?

209
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:03,132
Maybe they came from Chang'an,
thousands of miles away, to seek revenge?

210
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:05,132
About the matter of my invitation to her
to the Great Buddha temple,

211
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:06,372
how could outsiders know about it?

212
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:09,572
Although the coachman is unfamiliar,
he is still a servant of our family,

213
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,812
How should this be explained?

214
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:14,372
He is just a servant,
Give him some silver taels and he will

215
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:15,612
inflict grave injuries on Liuli,

216
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,052
committing the act of betraying his master,

217
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,492
Isn't this very normal?

218
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:20,052
You sure know
how to clear yourself of any blame,

219
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,132
I… No… I…

220
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,052
My lady, I understand

221
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:29,772
you want to abuse father
by ostensibly pointing to me,

222
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:30,852
forcing the father to submit,

223
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,912
But believe me,
it is absolutely impossible for him…

224
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,452
No, it definitely wasn't done by him,

225
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,612
My lady,

226
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:42,732
My lady,

227
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:45,412
Why do you have to be like this?

228
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:47,692
Calm down,
It's a disgrace to the educated class,

229
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:52,252
I will give you one last chance,

230
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:55,520
My lady,

231
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,704
You…

232
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:08,092
My lady,

233
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:09,972
Since Junmeng married into the Qu family,

234
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:12,452
I considered myself as a son of the Qu family,

235
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,832
I am a person of the Qu family in life,

236
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:17,092
In death, I am a ghost of the Qu family,

237
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,248
Scram,

238
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:25,824
Thank you, Chongyu,

239
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:39,732
He was not smart,

240
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:42,012
What?

241
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:43,832
You want to smash him even more stupid

242
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,172
and then take care of him for a lifetime?

243
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,252
- But…
- And furthermore,

244
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:48,172
this is not a big deal,

245
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:51,212
There's no need to let the whole city know,
understand?

246
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:52,412
Brother,

247
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:53,440
Get lost,

248
00:19:58,852 --> 00:19:59,968
Wang Junmeng,

249
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:13,280
Who?

250
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:17,792
Chongyu, you're here,

251
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,412
They both have stopped, right?

252
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,452
You, just say what you want to say,

253
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:30,052
Why are you looking at me like that?

254
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:31,332
You promised me that

255
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,932
you wouldn't interfere
with those matters anymore, right?

256
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:34,952
Yes,

257
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:38,052
Those recent events in Xizhou,

258
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:39,892
weren't they all handled by you?

259
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:45,532
I really didn't do anything,

260
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,892
Haven't you seen
my Protector-General Mansion Hall,

261
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:52,292
which has long been deserted?

262
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,812
You can catch sparrows on the doorstep,

263
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:56,492
About the matter of Wang Junmeng sending people
to kidnap Kudi Liuli,

264
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:57,492
do you know?

265
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:00,932
You scoundrel!

266
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,652
How can you blame this

267
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,412
on your brother-in-law?

268
00:21:04,412 --> 00:21:06,492
Don't you understand
what kind of person your brother-in-law is?

269
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:09,772
Is he the type to disregard the law
and act on his own whim?

270
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:11,292
Is he a person who acts recklessly?

271
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,652
He ordered to kidnap Kudi Liuli,

272
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:16,492
Do you think that he has the courage?

273
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,212
Of course, he doesn't have that courage,

274
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,292
What do you mean?

275
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:31,712
Are you saying that

276
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:33,752
I was the one who made him do it, huh?

277
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,252
If not, that would be best,

278
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,932
This way I can act impartially,

279
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:38,412
without giving others grounds for gossip,

280
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:39,972
And I'll not give

281
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:42,332
Pei Xingjian a chance to accuse our Qu family
of favoritism and illegal behavior,

282
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:43,972
- How dare he!
- Of course,

283
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:45,052
Why wouldn't he dare?

284
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:47,292
If it were me,
my wife and children were harmed for no reason,

285
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,652
I would definitely find out the instigator
behind this no matter what,

286
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:51,972
Even if I have to fight till the end with him,
I won't stop until death,

287
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:53,732
What are you saying?

288
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:54,972
Stop talking nonsense,

289
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:56,612
What does this matter have to do with you?

290
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:08,412
No matter who did this,

291
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:10,012
just remember that

292
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,292
it has nothing to do with our Qu family,

293
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:13,852
Your brother-in-law didn't do it,

294
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:16,932
and neither did I, your father,

295
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:22,852
Besides, that Kudi Liuli is fine now,
isn't she?

296
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:25,652
Moreover, I heard that
the coachman had also run away,

297
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:28,492
Don't mention that
Pei Xingjian wants to investigate,

298
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:30,732
Even if we investigate,

299
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:32,532
it's not certain
that we'll investigate it well,

300
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:34,732
So, you think

301
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:36,736
this matter

302
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:39,692
will once again come to nothing,

303
00:22:43,692 --> 00:22:45,612
Just turn a blind eye to it,

304
00:22:46,892 --> 00:22:48,372
Pretend it never happened,

305
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:50,272
Anyway, her fate

306
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:51,892
has nothing to do with us anyways,

307
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,692
Even if the emperor sends someone
to investigate,

308
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:58,612
they won't find evidence about our Qu Family,

309
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:00,224
So,

310
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:03,212
if Pei Xingjian has lost a wife,

311
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:05,372
he couldn't possibly annihilate
our entire family, could he?

312
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:09,292
Moreover,

313
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:11,852
isn't she actually fine now?

314
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,016
Father,

315
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:15,972
Actually, like you,

316
00:23:17,092 --> 00:23:18,172
I also do not wish

317
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,292
those outsiders

318
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:24,852
to meddle in our affairs in the Xizhou,

319
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:37,292
But I'm even less willing to

320
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:39,892
be controlled by him,

321
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,536
Father,

322
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:43,732
Pei Xingjian came to Xizhou this time,

323
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:46,132
Anyone knows why,

324
00:23:46,132 --> 00:23:47,332
I think

325
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:51,772
we can deal with him fair and square,

326
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:56,096
Father,

327
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:58,612
we are the royal family of Gaochang,

328
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:00,772
We cannot disregard our dignity,

329
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,692
using those despicable means,

330
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:09,692
Do you think your father forgot who he is?

331
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:13,732
The Gaochang royal family

332
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:16,292
certainly doesn't

333
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,892
use those despicable means,

334
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:26,292
Alright, you can go now, I'm tired,

335
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:28,320
I'm leaving now,

336
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,472
Wait a moment,

337
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:37,088
This matter,

338
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:39,252
Let's end it here,

339
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:44,692
I wish they were all dead,

340
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:50,532
Bye,

341
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:39,172
Father-in-law,

342
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:43,212
you have already decided to postpone
taking action against Pei Xingjian,

343
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:44,772
Why suddenly…?

344
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,412
There has been a change,

345
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:07,512
Do it cleanly,

346
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:08,732
After it's done,

347
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:09,812
leave Xizhou immediately,

348
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:10,880
Yes,

349
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,932
Bye,

350
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:23,732
Kudi Liuli,

351
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:00,732
How are you up?

352
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:02,532
When I turned over,

353
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:04,052
I found you're not by my side,

354
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:05,372
so I got up to look for you,

355
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:08,732
Where did you just go?

356
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,252
I went to Qu Chongyu's place,

357
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,312
Shouyue,

358
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:23,652
I don't want you to take on too much for me,

359
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:25,652
Both you and I know

360
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:28,292
whether it's the matter with the carriage
this time

361
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:30,092
or the same as before the matter of Su Nanjin

362
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:31,772
in Liangzhou,

363
00:27:31,772 --> 00:27:33,332
they are all directed at me,

364
00:27:34,412 --> 00:27:36,872
In this world, only the princess

365
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,392
holds such hatred towards me,

366
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:39,692
You are the person I love the most,

367
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:42,852
Protecting the person I love the most

368
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:45,452
is my responsibility as a husband,

369
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:48,772
Whether it's the princess or anyone else,

370
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:52,452
I won't allow anyone to harm you,

371
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:59,132
I also won't allow you
to suffer any harm for me,

372
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:11,136
I know,

373
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,652
My lady,

374
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:34,752
My lady,

375
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:46,772
You three don't have to follow me,
You can do your own affairs,

376
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:48,128
Yes,

377
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,732
I am very safe at home,

378
00:28:55,732 --> 00:28:57,052
You don't have to be so nervous,

379
00:28:58,368 --> 00:28:59,392
We're not nervous,

380
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:00,452
Are you nervous?

381
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:03,772
Yes, We're not nervous,

382
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:36,332
If you all look at me like this,

383
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:37,652
how am I supposed to keep eating?

384
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:42,252
My Lady is uncomfortable being watched,
you can turn around,

385
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:46,720
Yes,

386
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:50,092
My Lady, Gu has turned around,
You can eat in peace,

387
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:55,052
Then, I will also turn around,

388
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:58,688
Please take your time,

389
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,972
Lady, what would you like to eat?
Let me serve you,

390
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,172
S-S-Serve…

391
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:15,652
I feel suffocated, I'm going for a walk,

392
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:19,412
You're not allowed to follow,

393
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,144
<i>[But Golden Evening]</i>

394
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:53,760
Is there anything you want to ask about?

395
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:56,128
Senior Official…

396
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,892
Senior Official,
you didn't leave the city today,

397
00:31:29,132 --> 00:31:30,532
Such a big thing happened at home,

398
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:32,092
How dare I leave the city,

399
00:31:33,312 --> 00:31:34,332
That makes sense,

400
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:37,452
Actually, you don't need to go out of town,

401
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:40,092
Because I have already understood
the situation of Lady Liu's cousin, Fang Lie,

402
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:41,452
clearly,

403
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:49,112
He came to the Xizhou five or six years ago,

404
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:52,012
I heard he is an excellent horse rider and archer,
and he has a bold personality,

405
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:54,552
But I don't know why
he offended his official superiors,

406
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:56,172
marginalized quite a bit,

407
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:57,952
Three years ago in autumn,

408
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,892
his superior, that is, the Prime Minister Mu,

409
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:01,392
made things difficult for him once again,

410
00:32:01,392 --> 00:32:03,332
He ordered him to leave the city on a windy day

411
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:05,432
to search for two lost horses,

412
00:32:05,432 --> 00:32:07,372
Fang Lie was very angry,

413
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:09,452
and abruptly seized the Prime Minister Mu,

414
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:10,852
They left the barracks together,

415
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:13,652
From that point on, he never appeared again,

416
00:32:13,652 --> 00:32:14,892
Some people say

417
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,892
that the two of them perished together,

418
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:19,492
Others say that
after he killed Prime Minister Mu,

419
00:32:19,492 --> 00:32:21,352
he has been on the run ever since,

420
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:22,732
Thank you, Prefect Wang,

421
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:26,532
Cheng,

422
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,552
tell Lady Liu about this now,

423
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:29,568
Yes,

424
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,312
Is there anything else?

425
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:40,612
Actually, there isn't,

426
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:52,092
Actually there is something,

427
00:32:53,492 --> 00:32:54,496
About…

428
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:58,272
About the incident where Madam Kudi was
in danger yesterday,

429
00:32:58,272 --> 00:33:01,072
I feel deeply guilty,

430
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:03,112
Letting such thieves into the house

431
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:04,532
is indeed my responsibility,

432
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,072
But this thief definitely

433
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:08,452
infiltrated the residence without my knowledge,

434
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:10,952
I definitely did not do it intentionally,

435
00:33:10,952 --> 00:33:12,252
Please discern the truth,

436
00:33:12,252 --> 00:33:14,872
I absolutely did not mean that,

437
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:15,904
I understand,

438
00:33:17,692 --> 00:33:18,692
This matter is unrelated to you,

439
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:20,736
Yes,

440
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:22,752
Is there anything else?

441
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:24,960
Truly, there is nothing left,

442
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:27,520
Farewell,

443
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:06,292
Liuli, I've come to see you,

444
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,452
Lady Jing, why did you come here?

445
00:34:10,452 --> 00:34:12,352
How are you? Hope your body is well now,

446
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,952
Do you still feel any discomfort anywhere?

447
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:15,492
Yesterday, after returning,
I took some medicine,

448
00:34:15,492 --> 00:34:16,692
I'm well now,

449
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:19,092
It's better to take another look for caution,

450
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,372
I have called the two best physicians
in the city for you,

451
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:25,052
I really don't need it,
Look, am I not doing well?

452
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,092
Then you should take some medicine to recover,

453
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,092
Lady Jing, I appreciate your kindness,

454
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:37,812
But I only suffered a few scratches,

455
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:40,012
I don't need these valuable medicinal herbs,

456
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:43,172
I have already brought them,
so you just keep them,

457
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:46,552
Tan, take them to put down the medicinal herbs,

458
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:47,692
Yes, my lady,

459
00:34:48,372 --> 00:34:49,504
Follow me,

460
00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:02,452
Yesterday, I put you in danger,

461
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:04,452
I truly feel guilty in my heart,

462
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:06,252
But Liuli, you must believe me,

463
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:07,892
I do not have any slightest
intention to harm you,

464
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:09,760
My family

465
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,132
also absolutely does not have any intention
to harm you,

466
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:14,132
Lady Jing, don't overthink it,

467
00:35:14,652 --> 00:35:15,932
How could I doubt you?

468
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:18,012
And I won't doubt your family even more,

469
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:21,632
If it weren't for you risking your life
to save me yesterday,

470
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:24,132
how could I even be alive to sit here and talk,

471
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:26,332
But I…

472
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,412
Okay, everything has passed already,

473
00:35:28,412 --> 00:35:29,612
Let's not mention it again,

474
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:31,992
No matter what happens in the future,

475
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:34,532
Lady Jing will always be Liuli's good friend,

476
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,132
I am leaving, please stay,

477
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:56,132
When did these guards appear
in front of the door?

478
00:35:57,452 --> 00:35:59,612
This is sent by Minister Qu to protect you,

479
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:03,532
Where have you just been?

480
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:06,252
I went to Qu Chongyu's place,

481
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:11,412
But Liuli, you must believe me,

482
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:13,092
I absolutely have no intention of harming you,

483
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:17,012
My family also has absolutely no intention
of harming you,

484
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:29,092
Family, Wang Junmeng, Protector-General Qu,

485
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:09,600
Take the medicine,

486
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,812
Hasma,

487
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,728
Han Si,

488
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:32,052
the taste of this medicinal wine today

489
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:34,332
tastes kind of strange,

490
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:39,732
Yesterday, I helped a Hu man,
who is a medicine merchant, deliver a calf,

491
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:41,052
He didn't have money
to pay my consultation fee,

492
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:43,092
So he compensated me with

493
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:45,332
a rare red-crowned Hasma,

494
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:46,372
I added it to your medicine,

495
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:48,416
What is that?

496
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:52,092
According to the medical book,

497
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:55,612
it is a very good medicine,

498
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:58,812
I don't understand the specific effects
of the drug,

499
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,252
You should know it after trying it today,

500
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:02,732
You are using me for drug testing again!

501
00:38:02,732 --> 00:38:04,172
Alright, don't be so shocked,

502
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:07,252
This time,
it's different from the previous times,

503
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,892
After you take it…

504
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:16,000
What will happen?

505
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:19,372
It should be beneficial

506
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:21,172
to your body,

507
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:31,492
Why do I feel a numbness in my lips?

508
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:33,376
Hallucination,

509
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:38,304
Han Si,

510
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:40,480
Look at me,

511
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:42,572
Am I drooling?

512
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:48,612
Take it easy,

513
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:50,688
I'll go and skim through the medical book,

514
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:52,864
Han Si,

515
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:55,168
Han Si,

516
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:57,212
Han Si,

517
00:38:57,892 --> 00:39:00,692
Do you believe I will kill you?

518
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:05,692
Here,

519
00:39:10,692 --> 00:39:11,776
Although

520
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:14,772
we have arranged guards for surveillance
at Pei's Mansion,

521
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:16,852
we still have to arrange some tricky things

522
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,592
to Pei Xingjian,

523
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:21,132
I've heard that
recently within the Xizhou city,

524
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:23,412
over twenty calves were stolen
from many households,

525
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:26,208
Up until now,

526
00:39:26,816 --> 00:39:27,852
there are still no clues,

527
00:39:27,852 --> 00:39:29,652
Perhaps Senior Official Pei can give it a try,

528
00:39:30,812 --> 00:39:32,572
Actually, there's another case,

529
00:39:32,572 --> 00:39:35,492
The case of
Zhang Er and his nephew fighting over a calf,

530
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:38,092
Although this case is not difficult to solve,
the difficulty lies in that

531
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,332
Zhang Er comes from a rich family,

532
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:42,392
sealed as a cavalry officer with honors,

533
00:39:42,392 --> 00:39:44,252
If Zhang Er admits guilt,

534
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:47,832
then Pei Xingjian is bound to
offend the magnates of Xizhou,

535
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:50,012
If Zhang Er does not admit guilt,

536
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,732
Pei Xingjian will surely lose people's heart,

537
00:39:53,332 --> 00:39:54,932
Then assign both cases to him,

538
00:39:56,012 --> 00:39:57,972
You can contact this Zhang Er again,

539
00:39:58,528 --> 00:39:59,532
to find out a bit,

540
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:02,532
You can help him out
after figuring out the real situation,

541
00:40:04,092 --> 00:40:05,852
Understand, give it to him,

542
00:40:07,012 --> 00:40:08,772
See what tricks he wants to play,

543
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:14,624
In my opinion,

544
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:17,732
these two cattle theft cases were done
by the same person,

545
00:40:20,332 --> 00:40:21,632
It's that Zhang Er,

546
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:25,892
Is it truly the act of a single person?

547
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:31,572
Senior Official Pei,

548
00:40:32,772 --> 00:40:36,032
this matter must not be taken so lightly,

549
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:38,012
About the case of
the uncle and nephew disputing over a cow,

550
00:40:38,012 --> 00:40:39,572
although there are

551
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:41,412
more than twenty calves,

552
00:40:41,412 --> 00:40:43,612
the ins and outs of this case

553
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:45,372
are extremely clear and simple,

554
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:48,372
Zhang Er is a local notable,

555
00:40:48,372 --> 00:40:52,332
If you say he took advantage of the opportunity
to take care of his nephew Qiao Liu's herd of cows,

556
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:54,252
and embezzled those more than twenty calves,

557
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:55,992
Although there is no ironclad evidence,

558
00:40:55,992 --> 00:40:57,672
it's still a plausible explanation,

559
00:40:57,672 --> 00:40:59,372
However, if only by this alone,

560
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:02,372
we say that he is the thief stealing calves
all over Xizhou,

561
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:04,892
T-T-Then, it can only be said…

562
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:06,892
That's absolutely nonsensical,

563
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:08,892
Then, according to your view,

564
00:41:09,572 --> 00:41:11,352
about these twenty stolen calves,

565
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:12,692
where are they all now?

566
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,412
The sale of cattle and horses
must be registered with market vouchers,

567
00:41:15,412 --> 00:41:16,772
Could it be that they have flown away?

568
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:19,132
This case has been delayed for
as long as three months,

569
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:21,772
Rumors are rampant in Xizhou,
and the people are panic-stricken,

570
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,172
The servants dispatched from the yamen
have gone so many times,

571
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:25,692
but not a shred of a clue is found,

572
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,092
Now, this clue is right in front of us,

573
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,012
However, you think this is utterly nonsensical,

574
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:33,592
You must have a clear understanding

575
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,332
of this case, right?

576
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:41,632
T-T-That's not exactly true,

577
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,652
I'm also in the fog about this case,

578
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:48,472
Based on my shallow experience
in handling cases over the years,

579
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,652
t-this case of cattle theft is indeed strange,

580
00:41:52,652 --> 00:41:56,572
But this case of uncle and nephew
fighting over a cow is very simple,

581
00:41:56,572 --> 00:42:00,252
Just because they're both lost calves,

582
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:03,292
we forcibly connect these two cases together,

583
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:05,012
which would be far-fetched,

584
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:07,392
About settling a lawsuit,

585
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,452
you're careful and cautious,

586
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:10,172
I know it, too,

587
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:13,092
But being too cautious

588
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:14,492
may not necessarily be a good thing,

589
00:42:18,772 --> 00:42:21,052
Since Prefect Wang said
this case is very simple,

590
00:42:22,412 --> 00:42:23,592
then this case,

591
00:42:23,592 --> 00:42:25,232
why has it

592
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:26,572
remained unresolved after a long time?

593
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:32,592
I feel ashamed about this matter,

594
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,492
But it is quite simple,

595
00:42:38,227 --> 00:42:42,783
<i>♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫</i>

596
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:49,311
<i>♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫</i>

597
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:53,631

598
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:57,311

610

612
