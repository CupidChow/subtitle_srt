[Episode 32]

3
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,250
Before Xizhou was led by Governor Qu.

4
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,330
Chongyu could manage us.

5
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,070
But now, he's offended the commander.

6
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,670
No one knows if he's going to be fine.

7
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,310
You think he's still in charge of Xizhou?

8
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,010
Father, are you saying that

9
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,170
the noble families in Xizhou

10
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,610
are joining hands against the Qu family?

11
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,984
Yes.

12
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,650
As the saying goes,

13
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,650
"Better offend a gentleman
than a petty person."

14
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,450
The father and son of the Su family
are so cruel.

15
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,370
If we still stand with Chongyu,

16
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,890
they could be angry with us.

17
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,710
If we angered people like them,

18
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,950
we could have no day of peace.

19
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,490
Father, if I weren't married into
the Qu family,

20
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,610
and they gave me the position
of county magistrate,

21
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,570
our family couldn't have gone back to Xizhou.

22
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,830
Father, regardless of other families,

23
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,690
we can't

24
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,250
do such an ungrateful thing.

25
00:02:55,684 --> 00:03:01,920
[Noble Spirit]

26
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,810
He married the daughter of the Zhang family,

27
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,770
gave some positions in the Chief Administrator Office
in Xizhou to the noble families,

28
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,410
and said a few promises
that don't need to be fulfilled.

29
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,210
And he just won over so many families.

30
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,250
This plan of Su Ziyu

31
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,530
is such a success.

32
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,250
They have been having old grudges,

33
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,650
and concerned only their own benefits.

34
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,850
They had no lofty aspirations.

35
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,770
And lost their minds for Su Ziyu's offer.

36
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,610
Minister, have a taste.

37
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,210
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

38
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,210
Come, have a taste.

39
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,770
Lost their minds? Do they have minds?

[Zhao's Lamb Soup and Pancake]

41
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,610
Our families have been holding hands
for more than a hundred years

42
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,370
and helping each other in Chang'an
for more than twenty years.

43
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,250
For those small interests,

44
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,210
they stabbed me and my father from behind.

45
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,650
How could anyone with gratefulness
do a thing like this?

46
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,936
Junmeng,

47
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,736
it's lucky that Lady Jing married you.

48
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,950
Don't misunderstand me. I raised my hand
just now because

49
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,210
I couldn't help it under such circumstances.

50
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,250
You can't touch my hand.

51
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,010
It was my fault…

[Drill Ground]

53
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,856
Here.

54
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,504
Put it here.

55
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,520
Let's go.

56
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,530
500 dan from the Zhang family.

57
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,090
The Zhang family of Dunhuang
sent 500 dan supplies.

58
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,370
- Be careful.
- Okay.

59
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,690
The Qi family sent 350 dan supplies.

60
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,970
The Wang family sent 400 dan supplies.

61
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,370
I couldn't see people through
and had an unrealistic dream.

62
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,890
I must have made fun of myself.

63
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,330
Madam once said,

64
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,330
"Families are like countries.

65
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,610
There are no friends or enemies.
It's all about benefits."

66
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,050
They used to hold hands with the Qu family,

67
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,330
because you shared similar conditions.

68
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,850
Since someone offered them a better interest,

69
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,410
it's time that they will cut ties with
the Qu family.

70
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,170
We are all from noble families.

71
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,010
Can't you think of this?

72
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,490
It's all about interests.

73
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,850
You are right. I was too serious about this.

74
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,490
I'll go back after finishing this bottle.

75
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,650
We should go back sooner.

76
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,250
Something's not right about
what happened last night.

77
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,210
We have to make plans earlier.

78
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,810
We can't have their supplies now.

79
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,730
We can't tell what they will do next.

80
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,690
But just to be safe,

81
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,170
you can have your informers

82
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,170
in the Chief Administrator's office
watch his actions.

83
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,570
Especially the trusted soldiers of Su Haizheng.

84
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,690
They've done things like

85
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,330
slaughtering the city and taking over the land.

86
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,250
Drink less.

87
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,450
You can't win by drinking wine.

88
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,610
If others see,

89
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,050
they'd only say that we had no ideas and
had to use wine to expel our worries.

90
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,490
Don't provoke me.

91
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,010
I've thought about this.

92
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,536
After this,

93
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,210
the officials in Xizhou don't have to
come from noble families.

94
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,816
From now on,

95
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,210
I'll never let them get involved in
Government finance and taxation.

96
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,968
It should be like this long ago.

97
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,770
Nature has its law to grow or die.

98
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,010
The prosperity of a family lies
in virtue and talent.

99
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,690
You liked

100
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,810
to leave the positions in Xizhou to them
regardless of their virtue,

101
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,410
and think about them regardless of them
being right or wrong.

102
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,570
That's why we have this group of people
who are not ambitious but only profit-oriented.

103
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,370
If we don't change this,
it does no good to Xizhou,

104
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,090
and it has a better harm on the noble families
as well.

105
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,896
No matter what,

106
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,030
their rise and fall have nothing to do with me.

107
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,690
I want them to remember,

108
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,530
if they offend me, I'll pay back.

[Protector-General's Mansion]

110
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,770
Shouyue, Chongyu.

111
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,490
Ziyu, sit.

112
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,250
I'm here to tell you

113
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,650
I've bought a new mansion
in the new area of Luoyang,

114
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,250
and I'll get married with the Zhang family
on the sixth day of next month.

115
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,970
Hope you two will come.

116
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,848
Congratulations.

117
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,410
I wonder this daughter of the Zhang family

118
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,450
is whom?

119
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,330
The cousin of Zhang Huaiji,

120
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,816
Lady Min.

121
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,450
You are so lucky.

122
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,810
She writes and plays music well,
and she's good at making tea.

123
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,770
Few women can be compare with her in Xizhou.

124
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,050
And she can make flutes.

125
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,770
My flutes here

126
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,850
have no cracks till now.

127
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,130
Her talking and etiquette
are also incomparable.

128
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,690
Even few daughters of
the noble families in Chang'an

129
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,890
can compete with her.

130
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,510
You noble families in Xizhou know so much
about each other.

131
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,030
No. it's just that although Lady Zhang
is so famous,

132
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,130
few people can see her randomly.

133
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,130
Shouyue and I are so lucky

134
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,730
to have drank her tea and blown her flutes.

135
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,650
Ziyu, you are so lucky.

136
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,130
Right, Shouyue?

137
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,950
I almost forgot that Shouyue had recognized
Lady Zhang as his sworn sister.

138
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,050
He will be your brother-in-law from now on.

139
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,650
I didn't expect us to have such a link.

140
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,744
Yes.

141
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,450
Unexpectedly.

142
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,610
I have something to do in the army.

143
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,968
Goodbye.

144
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,952
Okay, congratulations, Ziyu.

145
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,650
Senior Official, Minister,
I'll take my leave too.

146
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,216
Okay.

147
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,970
Chongyu, that wasn't a polite thing to do.

148
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,970
You want me to be polite to him?

149
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,050
I'd rather be a stone turtle.

150
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,130
Okay, you are a stone turtle.

151
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,490
You are a stone turtle.

152
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,090
Yes, you are right.

153
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,610
I suddenly think of something.

154
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,930
Among your servants,

155
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,210
how many of them can ride horses
and shoot arrows?

156
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,930
Why did you ask this?

157
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,010
Around 500.

158
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,104
How good are they?

159
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,450
They can fight with
the elites of the commander.

160
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,184
You want to…

161
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,008
I don't need them now.

162
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,530
I've sent Bai San and others to
the Protector-General's mansion in Kunling.

163
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,090
I think

164
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,170
it's about time that Fang Lie will send
his wife and son to Xizhou.

165
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,370
I'll see them.

166
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,744
Minister,

167
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,730
Minister, please go back.

168
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,570
The governor is sick.

169
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,792
Is he okay?

170
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,896
Yes.

171
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,010
He has the blessing of the god.

172
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,010
Who angered him?

173
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,050
Wang, of course.

174
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,210
He invited my father

175
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,910
to Su Ziyu's marriage

176
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,370
and asked about the supplies.

177
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,250
I told my servants

178
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,730
not to tell my father what is happening.

179
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,310
I thought the noble families in Xizhou
didn't dare to meet my father.

180
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,530
Surely they won't come here.

181
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,432
But this Su

182
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,668
can't wait for a moment.

183
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,930
Senior Official,

184
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,610
you are here in time.

185
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,690
Persuade Chongyu for me.

186
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,170
I was not in good health,

187
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,530
and I didn't take offense.

188
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,770
But we can't act in anger now,

189
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,650
or we'll fall into his trap.

190
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,530
Governor, don't worry.

191
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,370
Chongyu was just worried about you.

192
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,290
Since you are fine, he won't act recklessly.

193
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,450
I'm glad you can see this.

194
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,490
The Su family is turning us against them.

195
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,930
They hope we can have life-and-death
grudges against them.

196
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,330
How can you let him fulfill this?

197
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,970
From tomorrow, I'll change this medicine

198
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,410
and go to the Governor's office
to deal with stuff for half a day.

199
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,650
But the doctor said you have to rest in peace.

200
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,690
We have to get through this first.

201
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,970
As long as I'm standing here,

202
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,130
they won't step their feet

203
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,210
on us.

204
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,330
Shouyue,

205
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,170
it was my fault last time.

206
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,970
I was only thinking about myself

207
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:34,210
and thought that you were such a
generous and polite person

208
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,610
to fulfill a wish of mine.

209
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,610
But that was only a mistake.

210
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:55,370
Ignore those things I told you.

211
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,770
Don't take them to heart.

212
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,770
That was not worth mentioning, Governor.

213
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,450
Shouyue, we owe you so much.

214
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,810
I hope we can pay you back.

215
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,570
You don't have to fool me.

216
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,850
I have one question for you.

217
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,330
Can you finish the task of the supplies?

218
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,010
You don't have to worry about this.

219
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:58,048
[All Rivers Flow to the Sea]

220
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,810
Is the Governor okay?

221
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,144
He's fine.

222
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,450
Minister, how many supplies
did the Qi family send today?

223
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,290
They sent more than ten large carts,
less than 400 dan.

224
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,610
Madam, I don't want to offend you.

225
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,450
You once said

226
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,490
that family was the biggest reliance
for a woman.

227
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,150
I want to know that if one day

228
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,650
the noble families all abandon the Governor

229
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,990
and you,

230
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,690
what would you choose?

231
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,570
Will you choose your husband

232
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,010
or your family?

233
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,630
The noble families in Xizhou were all protected
by the Governor.

234
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,230
How could they turn their backs on Governor?

235
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,090
I can't see a reason for this.

236
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,690
I hope so.

237
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,010
I should have thought of this.

238
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,250
Madam Kudi warned me long ago.

239
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,330
But I didn't believe her till now.

240
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,290
From tomorrow, Governor will
go to the office for half a day every day.

241
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,610
Please take care of him.

242
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,710
If someone with evil spirits
comes to disturb him,

243
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,290
please use some ways to scare him away.

244
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,150
Relax, Minister, as long as Governor
can have a good health,

245
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,430
I'm willing to live shorter.

246
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,570
From now on, I'll never let them control me.

247
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,690
I won't let Governor worry about them anymore.

248
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,770
Madam, when my father dies,

249
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,010
I'll protect you

250
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,530
as long as I'm here in Xizhou.

251
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,490
If I leave Xizhou to go back to Chang'an,

252
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,570
I'll leave the cotton workshop to you.

253
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,210
And the servants in Xizhou
will still serve you.

254
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,290
I only care about my father's health.

255
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,770
I'll thank you first, Madam.

256
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,370
Rest assured, Minister.

257
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,410
I'm not a smart person, but I've seen

258
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,610
my foolishness before
and the mistakes I've made.

259
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,890
I hope you can forgive me.

260
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,810
I'm sorry, I was in such a haste

261
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,370
to give the cotton workshop to my step mother.

262
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,110
I forgot about your forty percent.
Will you mind?

263
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,130
What forty percent?

264
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,304
You don't know?

265
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,790
Aren't you busy these days?

266
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,810
Why are you back so early today?

267
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,130
I want to stay longer,

268
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:13,670
but the officials in the Governor's office

269
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,210
are all avoiding me,

270
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,450
so I came back early to let them relax.

271
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,410
That's great. You can have a few days' rest.

272
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,624
Let them go.

273
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,184
Right,

274
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,272
I have something to ask you.

275
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,930
Tell me the truth,

276
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,570
are you hiding something from me?

277
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,130
What are you planning?

278
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,090
Tell me, what is it?

279
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,570
You've known it. Why do you have to ask?

280
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,530
I want to hear it from you in person.

281
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,530
I won't say it.

282
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,290
What a miser.

283
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,850
When did we have forty percent
of the cotton workshop?

284
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,890
If Chongyu didn't tell me today,

285
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,570
I wouldn't have known this.

286
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,650
That was close. Luckily I wasn't fooled
to tell him the truth.

287
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,010
I thought he knew about me
making tokens of passage privately.

288
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,590
I didn't hide from you,

289
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,170
but you never asked me this.

290
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,430
It's nothing different from
the 30% of the Buddhist scriptures

291
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,250
and 20% of the fabric printing shop.

292
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,824
You are right.

293
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,390
This flute is not so delicate.

294
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,890
If you don't like it,

295
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,130
I can make a new one for you,

296
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,890
but it will take more time.

297
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,490
I can't say I've made a hundred flutes
these years,

298
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,770
but I surely have made seventy or eighty.

299
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,584
I made this one

300
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,430
but I didn't want to give this away,

301
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,570
so I have kept it for many years.

302
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,570
I don't know if you like this.

303
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,610
She has such a talent.

304
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,370
It's normal to make some flutes for others.

305
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,904
No need. This one is good.

306
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,290

to do this anymore.

338

Governor has handed the office over to him.

344
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,050
and punished them severely.

According to what you said,

346
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,130
they should have given us the supplies,

If this continues,

00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,930
Pei Xingjian and Qu Chongyu
should start gathering supplies.

361
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,730
It's a time of patience now.

362
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,096
But

363
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,610
I also found an odd thing.

364
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,272
What's wrong?

365
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,930
Merchants should have been hoarding grain

366
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,190
and buying rice long ago
when they heard the news.

367
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,650
But now most of the merchants are not
in Xizhou.

368
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,330
Do you think

369
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,450
we should let Zhang Gao probe about this?

370

00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,930
Advisor Zhang, please sit.

372
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,664
What's wrong?

373
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,850
The two states and four towns
have all finished sending supplies,

374
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,290
but there are still more than 20,000 dan left
for us.

It's about the day to transport supplies.

376
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,490
As an advisor, I should share the worries
for you.

377
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,530
How do you plan to share my worries?

378
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,890
I made some inquiries and heard

379
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,290
that there is still grain left
in the big families.

380
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,130
If the price is high,

381
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,810
most of them are willing to sell them to you.

382
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,890
It's rare that they can still have grain left

383
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,160
under such circumstances.

384
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,930
But how could we fight with the people
for interest?

385
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,190

392

don't care about military orders at all?

393
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,840
It's hard to say.

394
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,690
Maybe they have other plans.

395
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,370
But Senior Official Pei won't take the grains,

396
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,270
and it's about the time to transport them.

397
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,432
If we delay the Chief Administrator for this--

398
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:48,292
I have a question.

399
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,570
How many grains do you still have?

400
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,030
Do you have 30,000 dan?

401
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,160
Of course.

402
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,410
We managed to buy some at a high price
this month.

403
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,810
So we have more than 40,000 now.

my lord can't interfere in
local government affairs,

and Senior Official Pei won't take them,

can't my lord share some worries
for the Chief Administrator?

from other places?

413
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,770
Where can he find tens of thousands
dan of grain in Xizhou?

414

If it's further,

415
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,290
should he let eagles

Next, we will have to transport the grains
and do other stuff like this.

539
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,150
Transporting more than 100,000 dan grains
to the army

540
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,130
need a large number of chariots,
horses, and soldiers.

541
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,650
Now we lack soldiers in Xizhou.

542
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,810
We can't even gather hundreds of soldiers
to guard the city.

543
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,330
how could we take the responsibility
of transporting the grains?

544
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:41,610
Master Su heard that you have many
brave troops under your command.

545
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,290
He wants to borrow them.

546
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,330
The Chief Administrator will return this favor
after the grains are transported to the army.

547
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,968
This…

548
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,130
You want to borrow our troops.

549
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,890
How many do you want?

550
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,730
The more, the better, of course.

551
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,970
I think more than five hundred men are needed.

552
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,064
Five hundred.

553
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,232
This…

554
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:16,770
We can try to… to gather these men,

555
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,570
but they are all ordinary people.
They can take on heavy responsibilities.

556
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,470
I'm afraid they will mess this thing up.

557
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,570
You don't have to worry so much.
Since we borrowed them to transport the grains,

558
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,470
if it's lost,
we won't let you make up for this.

559
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,850
We'll ask the Governor to fill in.

560
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,130
We have plenty of grains now.

561
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,288
You just have to let the troops

562
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:42,470
listen to Master Su's orders.

563
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,570
He won't let them risk their lives randomly.

564
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,000
This…

565
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,016
Master,

566
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,168
they agreed.

567
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,870
Those people can see the situation.

568
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,410
It has come to this.

569
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,730
I'm sure

570
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,970
they want to fool two sides

571
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,690
but they dare not show it in front of me.

572
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,850
Moreover, this is not a big matter.

573
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,010
I'm afraid they haven't come to their senses.

574
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,370
What can they do if they come to their senses?

576
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:48,736
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

577
00:42:49,764 --> 00:42:54,368
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

578
00:42:55,588 --> 00:42:58,912
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

579
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:02,560
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

580
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,520
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

581
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:14,016
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

582
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:20,736
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

583
00:43:22,276 --> 00:43:25,184
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

584
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:28,704
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

585
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:35,008
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

586
00:43:35,008 --> 00:43:38,496
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

587
00:43:38,496 --> 00:43:41,568
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

588
00:43:41,568 --> 00:43:45,088
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

589
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:48,608
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

590
00:43:48,608 --> 00:43:51,456
♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫

591
00:43:51,456 --> 00:43:54,528
♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

592
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:58,144
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

593
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:03,008
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫

594
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:21,632
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

595
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:29,024
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

596
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:32,224
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

597
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:35,520
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫
