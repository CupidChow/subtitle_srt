00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:35,987
<i>[Episode 10]</i>

3
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:39,935
Our master

4
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:41,655
is the Emperor's confidant,

5
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:43,755
and General Su Dingfang's favorite disciple,

6
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,955
If you suspect
that our master is some kind of northern spy,

7
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:50,435
you must first ask

8
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:51,835
whether His Majesty approves,

9
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:57,635
Alright,
hurry up and tell that Advisor Su of yours,

10
00:01:58,195 --> 00:01:59,575
Have him release our master immediately,

11
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:00,955
or

12
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,235
just wait for the Emperor's judgment,

13
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:04,875
Where's the drink?

14
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:12,515
My master, you've finally being released,

15
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:14,075
Cheng, let's go,

16
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:15,104
Yes,

17
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:17,635
I have prepared a banquet

18
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:18,935
to calm Senior Official Pei's nerves,

19
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,875
I hope Senior Official Pei can give me a chance
to apologize,

20
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:25,195
Cheng, let's go back to the post station to

21
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:27,235
burn incense, bathe, and change clothes,

22
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,275
So we could get rid of the bad luck from us,

23
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:32,875
I-I have also prepared a generous gift,

24
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,255
hoping Senior Official Pei will accept it
with pleasure,

25
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,615
I led the troops poorly,

26
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,215
causing Senior Official Pei to suffer injustice
and grievance

27
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:39,635
I deserve a thousand deaths for my guilt,

28
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,495
But if Senior Official Pei walks away
in a huff like this,

29
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,995
the military advisor will not spare me
for certain,

30
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:46,935
Senior Official Pei,
you are indeed magnanimous,

31
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:48,075
please spare my life,

32
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:54,395
I have just come out of the prison,
and I'm too busy to attend to such matters,

33
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:55,915
How could I possibly concern about your fate?

34
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:58,475
If I had this spare time,

35
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,435
I would rather worry about my cellmates
in prison,

36
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:04,275
Perhaps among them,

37
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,835
there are also a few who, like me,
bear grievances and suffer injustice,

38
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:08,475
But no one on earth

39
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:09,955
will answer them,

40
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:12,555
If I may be presumptuous,

41
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:14,655
I would like to ask Senior Official Pei
for a favor

42
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,995
to interrogate the young lady in prison
with me,

43
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:23,415
First of all, Senior Official Pei
and the young lady are destined,

44
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:26,355
Secondly, the young lady
trusts Senior Official Pei more,

45
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:28,655
As long as Senior Official Pei is there,

46
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,335
there'll definitely be no miscarriages
of justice,

47
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,075
Yes, There'll definitely be no miscarriages
of justice,

48
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:39,475
Since Advisor Su

49
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,155
said it's official business,

50
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:45,475
then I for sure cannot refuse,

51
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:52,955
My appointment to Xizhou this time

52
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:55,035
coincides with the unrest in the north,

53
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,395
And indeed,

54
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:58,815
I should also humbly learn some skills
and techniques

55
00:03:58,815 --> 00:03:59,875
from Advisor Su

56
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:01,955
to enhance my knowledge,

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,115
Young lady,

58
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:35,255
May Advisor Su show mercy,

59
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,835
He will first represent the Judicial Advisor

60
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:38,395
to question you along with Senior Official Pei,

61
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:44,215
Master,

62
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:46,375
I wonder how this question works,

63
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,635
I'm not going to be tortured, am I?

64
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:49,775
Young lady, don't be afraid,

65
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,855
The spies from the north have become rampant
recently,

66
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:54,195
I brought you back
just to get some clear answers,

67
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:56,135
Later, if you explain yourself well and clear,

68
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,035
Advisor Su will for sure let you go,

69
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,115
Rest assured, master,
I would never dare to speak any nonsense,

70
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,144
Let's go,

71
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,715
Advisor Su, Senior Official Pei,
the suspect has been brought here,

72
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:27,075
I pay my respects to Senior Official Pei

73
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,395
and Military Advisor Su,

74
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:32,155
What is your name, young lady?

75
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:34,675
Why were you brought back
to the government office?

76
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:36,075
And why do you cry injustice?

77
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,515
Don't be afraid, young lady, Tell the truth,

78
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:41,635
Advisor Su will certainly stand up for you,

79
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:45,315
My name is Jade,

80
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:46,955
and I grew up in Xizhou since I was a kid,

81
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:49,235
This time
I was going to visit relatives in Liangzhou,

82
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,175
I plan to go back to Xizhou today,

83
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:53,115
However,
I haven't even reached the city gate yet,

84
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:54,835
the soldiers came up to question me,

85
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:57,235
I hasn't been much experienced,

86
00:05:57,235 --> 00:05:58,675
and I got scared

87
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,475
so I couldn't explain myself clearly,

88
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:03,155
Therefore,
the soldiers misunderstood me as a spy,

89
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:06,415
A delicate young lady

90
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:08,395
travels alone with a merchant convoy
heading west,

91
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,555
Where is your family?

92
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:12,595
And your husband?

93
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:18,880
Unless…

94
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,595
you are still single,

95
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:22,895
It is better not to mention about it,

96
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,255
Once you bring it up,

97
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,995
I have a bellyful of grievances,

98
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:28,155
Before I left Xizhou,

99
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,675
it was just after my wedding,

100
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:33,695
I thought I had married a husband
who knew love and righteousness,

101
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,535
however,
he turned out to be a man without conscience,

102
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:38,855
We encountered a temporary difficulty,

103
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:40,955
yet he left a divorce document

104
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:42,155
and ran away on his own,

105
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:45,875
That's why I went to Liangzhou
to visit relatives as a distraction,

106
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,995
What kind of irresponsible man is he?

107
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:51,635
As a man, you feel the same way too,

108
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:52,875
Advisor Su?

109
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:55,835
I was still thinking,

110
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,275
perhaps he really has some hidden problems,

111
00:06:58,275 --> 00:06:59,555
and he did so for my own good,

112
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:01,915
No matter how difficult the situation,

113
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:02,955
he can't leave his wife behind

114
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,115
and run away alone,

115
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:07,755
Why do you need
such a heartless and unfaithful husband?

116
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:09,795
With your beauty,

117
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,435
finding someone else who is considerate
and caring,

118
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:12,995
who cherish you,

119
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:13,995
is not hard at all,

120
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,835
Senior Official Pei, what do you think?

121
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,435
She went through a lot,

122
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:32,915
Come, have a sip of tea
to moisten your throat first,

123
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,155
After you finish the tea,
then you can take your time to scold,

124
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:47,968
Senior Official Pei,

125
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:50,415
In my opinion,

126
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:51,915
this Lady Jade is simply

127
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:53,575
an upright and honest lady,

128
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:55,635
She's absolutely not a spy from the North,

129
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:59,235
I wonder what does Senior Official Pei think,

130
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,675
Advisor Su had made a clear judgement,

131
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,675
Lady Jade is all by herself,

132
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,315
and she traveled to the Xizhou alone,

133
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:11,155
I'm afraid there are many inconveniences
along the way,

134
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,555
This time you're lucky that

135
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:14,915
you met me and Senior Official Pei,

136
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,235
What if you encounter danger again next time?

137
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,235
Then what should you do?

138
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:21,935
I think Senior Official Pei might as well
be kind through and through,

139
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,715
and escort Lady Jade all the way to Xizhou,

140
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,835
It can also be considered a meritorious act
of kindness,

141
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:34,515
As the Chancellor of Xizhou,

142
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:36,395
when the people run into troubles,

143
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:38,515
I will surely lend a helping hand,

144
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,955
Lady Jade just needs to stay
by Senior Official Pei's side,

145
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,555
There will be no more hardships in the future,

146
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:50,755
I wonder if it would be convenient for me
to have a word with Senior Official Pei,

147
00:08:58,688 --> 00:08:59,808
You just wait and

148
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:02,875
see how I'll settle the score with you
after I leave here,

149
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,504
Liuli,

150
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:08,035
won't you forgive me yet?

151
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:11,595
With Senior Official Pei's protection,

152
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,995
I couldn't ask for more of course,

153
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:49,632
Come in,

154
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:02,915
My lady,

155
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:04,275
The Master is worried that you might be hungry,

156
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,155
He specially ordered a few dishes you love

157
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,264
and instructed me to deliver them to you,

158
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,035
He also instructed me to guard
outside the door,

159
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:12,195
making sure no one's allowed to enter,

160
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,635
My lady, just rest assured,

161
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,455
Cheng, has Shouyue told you

162
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:19,475
why we need to stay one more night
in this dangerous place?

163
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,075
About the Master's temper,

164
00:10:22,075 --> 00:10:23,235
don't you know yet?

165
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,695
Su has caused you such a grievance,

166
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:27,655
The Master will definitely not give up easily,

167
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:30,435
He must make him suffer to vent our anger,

168
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,502
<i>[Following Orders and Obeying the Laws]</i>

169
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:49,315
Beautiful ladies,

170
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:53,568
Delicious dishes,

171
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:55,435
Fine wine,

172
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,816
Intimate friends,

173
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:06,395
I have been in Liangzhou for three years,

174
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:08,995
and it's hard to meet an old intimate friend,

175
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,915
Brother Pei is highly valued by the Emperor,

176
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:15,355
and you're bound to have a limitless future,

177
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:18,755
In the future, I hope you'll take care of me,

178
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,395
Everyone says that

179
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:25,515
I am highly valued by the Emperor,

180
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:28,295
But how many people actually know

181
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:30,275
that the reason for my trip to Xizhou

182
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,675
is indeed hard to put into words,

183
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:37,755
I don't quite understand,

184
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:06,515
It's all due to my momentary carelessness,

185
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,315
I fell into the scheme of Minister Zhangsun
and Chu Suiliang's

186
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:11,235
the cunning plans,

187
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:14,755
And thus, I was demoted to Xizhou,

188
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,088
Cheers,

189
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:21,635
I'm listening,

190
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,355
and willing to offer some advice
for Brother Pei as well,

191
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:26,555
Don't ask too much,

192
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,715
otherwise you might get implicated too,

193
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,288
Anyway,

194
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,035
I've said my words today,

195
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:38,755
If the Emperor continues to believe any words
from those two old fools,

196
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,235
sooner or later,
there will be a heavy price to pay,

197
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:48,595
I'm going to nap for a while,

198
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:55,424
Brother Pei,

199
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:00,795
Brother Pei,

200
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:01,856
You!

201
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:10,555
Don't let today's matter

202
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:12,995
be known to any other person,

203
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:20,595
You must not be like Yu Chengsu,
the Chancellor of Qizhou,

204
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:23,715
for betrayed me

205
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:25,355
for the sake of his own future,

206
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:35,835
<i>The Chancellor of Qizhou?</i>

207
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,504
<i>Exactly,</i>

208
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:40,035
<i>How come I didn't think of this method?</i>

209
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:43,136
<i>Brother Pei,</i>

210
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,715
<i>You taught me this,</i>

211
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,395
<i>You can't blame me for being ruthless,</i>

212
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:24,224
Drinking so much,

213
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:25,952
Be careful,

214
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:27,840
Thank you,

215
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,195
I can still drink,

216
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:34,915
Pour the wine,

217
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:41,335
Master, the lady has finished all the dishes
you ordered,

218
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:43,215
She also prepared a hangover remedy for you
in the room,

219
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:44,315
She specifically instructed me

220
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:45,315
not to tell you about it,

221
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:48,835
Then why did you still tell me?

222
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:52,075
Master,
it's about knowing oneself and the other,

223
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:05,376
Here, be careful,

224
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,992
Be careful,

225
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:27,328
It's getting late,

226
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,675
Why did Senior Official Pei come to my room
like this?

227
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:32,595
Do you want everyone to know
about your improper behavior?

228
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:33,795
Known by everyone,

229
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:37,315
Isn't it in line with the lewd character
I've been playing all day?

230
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,035
Besides, I guess Su Nanjin

231
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:42,595
is now eagerly writing a document to accuse me

232
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:46,515
of the crime of slandering Zhangsun Wuji
and Prime Minister Chu,

233
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:48,475
How can he have the time to care about me?

234
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,395
The document has to be sent to the capital
at full speed,

235
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,535
No delay allowed,

236
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:10,656
Yes,

237
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:13,515
About the Princess,

238
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:14,755
shall we report to her as well?

239
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,152
Wait a bit longer,

240
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,675
It's not that easy

241
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:22,355
to kill someone,

242
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:57,515
Why does Su Nanjin want to report you?

243
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,075
Because I took advantage of the alcohol

244
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,875
and harshly criticized how Zhangsun Wuji
and Chu Suiliang

245
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,035
planned a scheme against me

246
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:12,435
and demote me to Xizhou,

247
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:14,515
Then, under the guise of drunkenness,

248
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:15,875
I warned Su Nanjin,

249
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:18,195
I told him not to repeat

250
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:20,035
the actions of Yu Chengsu,
the Chancellor of Qizhou,

251
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,075
Yu Chengsu, the Chancellor of Qizhou,

252
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:25,792
I remember now,

253
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,275
The Empress Wang's uncle, Liu Shi, got demoted,

254
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:29,915
When he was passing through Qizhou,

255
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,575
The Chancellor of Qizhou, Yu Chengsu

256
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,875
charges him for privatizing a forbidden affair,

257
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:37,955
As a result, Liu Shi was further demoted
another thousand miles,

258
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,455
However, that Chancellor of Qizhou, Yu Chengsu,

259
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:41,955
got rewarded for this,

260
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:44,635
Su Nanjin is determined to make a contribution,

261
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:47,215
and he wouldn't miss such a shortcut,

262
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:49,435
When his report reached the Emperor,

263
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,795
won't he too have considered
as Zhangsun's party member?

264
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:53,440
This is the first of all,

265
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:55,136
Secondly,

266
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:57,115
reports from officials
around the different regions

267
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,355
all have to go through the Department
of State Affairs,

268
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,555
His report involves Zhangsun Wuji
and Prime Minister Chu,

269
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,635
They will for sure know about it,

270
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,755
As people say suspicion arises from doubts,

271
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,344
these two will suspect

272
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,595
that Su Nanjin knows some inside details,

273
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:14,635
How could they be let him return to Chang'an
to spread this matter?

274
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:17,024
Su Nanjin

275
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:18,755
Is single-mindedly determined to return
to the capital,

276
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:20,995
As the saying goes, haste makes waste,

277
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,115
Indeed, the ancients did not deceive me

278
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,975
This report from Su Nanjin

279
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:28,675
has offended both the Emperor
and two high-ranking ministers in the court,

280
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:31,155
One can imagine what the outcome will be,

281
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:33,715
You use public office for private revenge,

282
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:35,435
People like Su Nanjin

283
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:37,995
brings only harm to the local area he governs,

284
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,315
For the sake of his own future,

285
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,595
He could disregard the lives and properties
of his citizens,

286
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,435
If I don't send him such a gift,

287
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:46,875
should I let him continue to commit evils?

288
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,480
Furthermore,

289
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:50,275
he even wants to silence you,

290
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:52,595
That's truly audacious and fearless,

291
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,115
You didn't support Lady Wu's ascension,

292
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:56,515
and the Emperor is still angry,

293
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,875
If Su Nanjin's report

294
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,375
wins the Emperor's favor

295
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,195
and gives the Emperor a reason to punish you,

296
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:03,395
what should we do then?

297
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:10,464
His Majesty is a wise monarch,

298
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:14,355
He has always harbored great ambitions
for the Western Regions,

299
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,875
Do you still remember the day
of Princess Linhai's banquet

300
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:21,195
and His Majesty summoned me for an audience?

301
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:30,115
Your Majesty,
you had shown great kindness to me

302
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:32,355
and intended to promote me to join
the Ministry of Personnel,

303
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,635
However, I would prefer to go to Xizhou
to serve as an official,

304
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,075
Why would you want to go to
as a desolate and perilous place like Xizhou?

305
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:42,155
The turmoil in the North

306
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:43,795
is always a major concern for Your Majesty,

307
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:46,195
The Western Regions is unstable,

308
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:48,715
There are frequent rebellions
in the Northwestern region,

309
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,475
and Turpan is threatening to us
in the distance,

310
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:53,735
Although our dynasty has established
military garrisons along the border,

311
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,595
yet we had to appoint surrendered Vassal Kings
as the heads of Xizhou,

312
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,115
Ultimately,
this move isn't a long-term solution,

313
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,035
I believe that

314
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:03,315
in order to pacify the turmoil in the North,

315
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:05,675
the urgent consideration lies in the power
of military might,

316
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:08,515
and the long-term consideration lies in
the union of the people's hearts,

317
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:12,315
I'm willing to take up my post in Xizhou,

318
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,435
I'll do my utmost to gather military provisions

319
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,795
and educate the border residents,

320
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:17,555
Your Majesty's grace

321
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:19,035
will extend widely
to the vast land of the barbarians,

322
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:20,635
The bright moon of Tang Dynasty

323
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,355
will Illuminate the territory
of the Western Regions,

324
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:25,155
Your aspiration

325
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:26,475
indeed coincides with mine,

326
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:31,115
I intend to send General Su Dingfang
to pacify the Western Regions next year,

327
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,955
If you're willing to serve in Xizhou

328
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:36,475
and help General Su to prepare,

329
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:39,075
this battle is bound to yield twice the result
with half the effort,

330
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,395
It's my duty to share the monarch's worries,

331
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,835
Moreover, the frontier battlefield

332
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,675
is where a strong man can achieve great deeds,

333
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:47,555
I dare not let down Your Majesty's grace,

334
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:50,235
I dare not fail
to live up to my mentor's teachings,

335
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:54,995
I'm only a modest man of limited talents,
please grant me your approval, Your Majesty,

336
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:00,355
If every Tang's official were like you,
Shouyue,

337
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:03,155
what would I have to worry or fear?

338
00:22:09,435 --> 00:22:10,795
This is what the Emperor

339
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:11,835
discussed with you that day?

340
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:14,555
So, you're saying,

341
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:17,475
regardless of the plot
by Zhangsun Wuji and Chu Suiliang,

342
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:19,995
you would still take the position
as the Chancellor of Xizhou,

343
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:22,275
It's just a bit earlier than

344
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:24,435
expected appointment,

345
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:26,675
Zhangsun Wuji and Chu Suiliang

346
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:27,915
gave His Majesty a reason

347
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:29,675
The Emperor and I share the same mindset,

348
00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:32,235
and we just followed their lead,

349
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:44,640
Liuli,

350
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:48,928
you're still not sleeping this late,

351
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,040
and you also prepared a hangover remedy,

352
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:54,535
Are you worried about me?

353
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:55,712
Not at all,

354
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:05,235
You've had the remedy,
and it's getting really late,

355
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:07,835
You should go back and rest early,
Senior Official Pei,

356
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:13,792
Liuli,

357
00:23:15,355 --> 00:23:16,435
I know you are still mad at me,

358
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,144
It's all my fault,

359
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:20,096
From now on, no matter what happens,

360
00:23:20,835 --> 00:23:22,835
I will definitely not hide anything
that I could share with you,

361
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:25,795
I will also absolutely not act wisely
out of wishful thinking again,

362
00:23:26,595 --> 00:23:28,435
I will discuss everything with you,
and we advance or retreat as one,

363
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:31,275
I will never leave you alone again,

364
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:39,715
What is that cannot be shared?

365
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,275
Military and national affairs cannot be shared,

366
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,155
Others' private matters cannot be disclosed,

367
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:47,296
And

368
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:49,435
things I'm less than fifty percent sure of,

369
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:52,235
the things that cause unnecessary panic
when divulged,

370
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:54,112
Just these three,

371
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:58,355
What Senior Official Pei has just said

372
00:23:58,915 --> 00:23:59,955
truly touched me,

373
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,275
It's just a pity that

374
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,275
you had already written the divorce letter,

375
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,215
Now you and I are strangers,

376
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:07,395
and we no longer bear the title
of husband and wife,

377
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:09,755
Senior Official Pei, please go back,

378
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:12,035
Whatever there is to say can wait until dawn,

379
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:13,888
Divorce letter?

380
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,000
What divorce letter?

381
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:18,435
Show it to me,

382
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:21,395
The divorce letter was stolen by that Hu women,

383
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:22,735
How could I still have it?

384
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:24,115
Since there is no divorce letter,

385
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,415
then you, Kudi Liuli,

386
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:27,315
will forever be my wife,

387
00:24:34,835 --> 00:24:35,840
Liuli,

388
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:38,755
from now on, I'll never let go again,

389
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:42,155
In the past, all I wanted was for you to live
in peace and joy,

390
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:44,475
without suffering the slightest grievance
or harm,

391
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,395
That's why I let go and left you in Chang'an,

392
00:24:48,435 --> 00:24:49,595
But I later realized

393
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:53,435
the things I let go of,

394
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:55,515
you never took to heart,

395
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:57,475
The things that I could do,

396
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:59,235
you could do better than me,

397
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,976
Liuli,

398
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:05,952
from now on

399
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:08,395
no matter what happens,

400
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,048
whichever path I take,

401
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:13,515
I will never let go again,

402
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:18,235
You were free to let go at first,

403
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:20,875
now you don't want to let go,

404
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:23,075
What kind of person do you think I am?

405
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:24,675
I know you're mad at me,

406
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:26,715
and you have every right to do so,

407
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:29,915
But over the past month,

408
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:31,555
I've been regretting about it every day,

409
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:34,976
I originally thought

410
00:25:37,155 --> 00:25:39,515
that I could only see you again in my dreams,

411
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:43,435
Isn't that a problem of your own making?

412
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
Yes,

413
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:51,648
that's all my own doing,

414
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:55,392
I will never forget about

415
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,315
what you owe me for eternity,

416
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:15,395
Ruyue thanks Senior Official Pei and Lady Kudi

417
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:16,995
for lending a helping hand,

418
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:20,755
It's a small effort, Official Liu,
you don't need to mention it,

419
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:24,375
If I may ask, Ruyue,

420
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,035
why do you go to Xizhou by yourself?

421
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:28,715
Since childhood,
my cousin and I like each other,

422
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:32,115
Both of our parents set our engagement
very early,

423
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:34,635
I only know that my cousin

424
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:36,235
was banished to Xizhou
to serve in the military,

425
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:37,955
This trip

426
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:39,275
was to go out and search for him,

427
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:37,984
<i>[Lead a Tranquil and Fulfilling Life]</i>
<i>[Xizhou, Protector-General's Mansion]</i>

428
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:50,015
Protector-General,

429
00:28:50,015 --> 00:28:52,675
The entourage of Pei Xingjian,
the Imperial Appointed Chancellor of Xizhou,

430
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:53,755
is now approaching Dunhuang,

431
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:55,295
The Minister of Xizhou and Prefect Wang

432
00:28:55,295 --> 00:28:57,515
has already led their personal troops
to head to Dunhuang to welcome them,

433
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:04,035
Alright, noted,

434
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,555
Pests

435
00:29:12,275 --> 00:29:13,595
are coming to Xizhou soon,

436
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:17,115
<i>[Anxi Protector-General, Qu Zhihan]</i>

437
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:18,875
Are you guys scared?

438
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:28,355
Yes? You are?

439
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,435
Don't be scared,

440
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,035
Nobody should be scared,

441
00:29:38,635 --> 00:29:39,955
As long as I am here,

442
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:43,955
no one can harm you,

443
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:17,696
<i>[Dunhuang City]</i>

444
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:31,995
Shouyue, who is playing the reed pipe?

445
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,515
Minister Qu did so to welcome us,

446
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:36,475
He really went to a lot of trouble,

447
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:15,955
The reed pipe music is the saddest,

448
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:18,115
The lady in white plays the reed pipe,

449
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:20,435
The song is not yet over,

450
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:23,235
but it already saddens people from afar,

451
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:28,275
Aren't you curious who I am, Chancellor?

452
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:29,395
I'm afraid you won't find another

453
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:31,995
such unparalleled talented person

454
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:34,075
in Xizhou,

455
00:31:41,555 --> 00:31:42,715
That's very kind of you, Chancellor,

456
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,195
Chongyu takes the orders of my father

457
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,935
and waits here to welcome the Chancellor,

458
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:49,475
Protector-General Qu is being too polite,

459
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,520
Thank you for all this, Minister,

460
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:53,995
I considered you as an old friend

461
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,195
at first sight,

462
00:31:55,195 --> 00:31:57,555
Don't call me by the Minister anymore,

463
00:31:57,555 --> 00:31:59,355
Please call me Chongyu from now on,

464
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:02,464
will you?

465
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:06,715
I dare not to obey the order of the Minister,

466
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,480
Chongyu,

467
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:19,075
Senior Official Pei is a very favored person

468
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:21,248
to the Emperor,

469
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:23,395
Are you coming to Xizhou

470
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:24,835
to spread your wings?

471
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,455
Pei Xingjian is nothing
but a convicted official,

472
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,755
and I only come to Xizhou because of demotion,

473
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:35,475
I have no intention
of intervening in the affairs of Xizhou,

474
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:38,275
I only wish to keep to myself

475
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:39,635
and just be a loyal solider,

476
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,155
I hope the Protector-General and the Minister

477
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:44,224
will feel free to dispatch me at any time

478
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:47,955
Nonsense, That's too kind to say,

479
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,824
Come,

480
00:33:06,915 --> 00:33:09,155
Let me introduce him,
This is my brother-in-law, Wang Junmeng,

481
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,515
Currently,
he's the magistrate of Gaochang County,

482
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:12,555
Prefect Wang,

483
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:13,555
Chancellor, welcome,

484
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:17,075
A few days ago at the inn,
I noticed the Chancellor only had one servant,

485
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:18,155
and I was worried
that he would not serve you well,

486
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:19,975
therefore,
the Minister specifically instructed me

487
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:22,155
to send them to you, Chancellor,

488
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:24,155
Meet your new master,

489
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,096
This…

490
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:38,275
I can't,

491
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:39,495
Chancellor, you don't need not be polite,

492
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:42,235
These are the beauties presented
by the leaders of various tribes in Xizhou,

493
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:43,935
They have already undergone special training,

494
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:45,075
and the pleasure is endless,

495
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:46,435
Chancellor, you will know once you try,

496
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:47,935
This is too much,

497
00:33:47,935 --> 00:33:50,035
I absolutely cannot accept this,

498
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:51,275
Chancellor, you don't need to be polite,

499
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:52,480
- Just accept it,
- Go and have a look,

500
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:55,475
Gu, go and have a look,

501
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,635
This is absolutely impossible,

502
00:34:01,635 --> 00:34:03,115
Since they are full of kindness,

503
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:04,555
Shouyue, you should accept it,

504
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:08,555
Shouyue, who are these two?

505
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:14,075
I'll introduce them to you, my lady,

506
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:17,115
This gentleman is the son
of the Protector-General of Xizhou,

507
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:18,435
Qu Chongyu, Minister Qu,

508
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:20,256
This is his brother-in-law,

509
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:23,555
the magistrate of Gaochang County,
Prefect Wang,

510
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:26,635
This is my wife, Kudi Liuli,

511
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,855
What does it mean for the Minister
to send these wonderful beauties to Shouyue?

512
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:33,915
Is it because I'm considered vulgar,
shallow, and clumsy,

513
00:34:33,915 --> 00:34:35,295
and I can't take good care of my husband?

514
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:36,755
No, absolutely not,

515
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,315
My lady,
you're naturally beautiful and skilled,

516
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:41,355
They simply just cannot compare,

517
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:43,355
So, do you feel that I'm not serving
or caring well enough,

518
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:44,355
and I can't satisfy you anymore?

519
00:34:44,355 --> 00:34:45,955
No, absolutely not,

520
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,635
Having you in my life is more than enough,

521
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:52,275
I swear with the sun and moon as my witnesses,
that my devotion will not change,

522
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:54,944
What about them?

523
00:35:02,595 --> 00:35:04,115
Minister, your kindness is deeply appreciated,

524
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:06,555
I already have a wife,

525
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:07,875
I have no other desires in this life,

526
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,400
These beauties…

527
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,115
I can't accept them,

528
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:15,035
That was a quick refusal,

529
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:16,755
I did agree to accept
the Minister's generous offer,

530
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:17,955
Are you truly not regretting it?

531
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:19,040
I have absolutely no regrets,

532
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:22,835
Minister, what about them?

533
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,275
It's okay if you can't accept it,

534
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:27,555
Anyway, it's a good intention,

535
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:28,768
Good intention?

536
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:42,315
Who is this?

537
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:46,415
He is my wife's cousin,

538
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:47,675
May I ask how to address you?

539
00:35:48,224 --> 00:35:49,280
He's the third son of the Mu family,

540
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,315
He's truly born talented,

541
00:35:56,035 --> 00:35:57,095
I'm a bit tired,

542
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,435
Did the Minister come to greet us?

543
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:00,235
Minister's overwhelming hospitality

544
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,655
had also made me flattered,

545
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:03,680
Well, let's go then,

546
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:44,155
This Qu Chongyu

547
00:36:44,155 --> 00:36:45,795
really infuriated me today,

548
00:36:46,515 --> 00:36:48,355
He even dared to present you these maids
in front of me,

549
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:51,555
I'll make sure he pays for this in the future,

550
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:55,875
It would be wise for you
to avoid provoking Qu Chongyu,

551
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,555
This person is extremely cunning
and suspicious, He's very dangerous,

552
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:03,435
The number of people who I find inscrutable

553
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:04,475
is few and far between in this world,

554
00:37:05,235 --> 00:37:06,715
but he is definitely one of them,

555
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:08,672
So what?

556
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,795
I'm not afraid of Pei Xingjian,
how can I be afraid of him?

557
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:17,415
Fine, fine, fine, you're not afraid,

558
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:18,715
It's me who should be afraid, alright?

559
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:20,195
What are you afraid of him for?

560
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:22,535
Minister Qu

561
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:24,315
was quite famous in Chang'an back then,

562
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:27,435
At the age of sixteen,
there were noble ladies crazy about him,

563
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,275
Some were entangled with him,

564
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:31,595
and some were jealous over him,

565
00:37:31,595 --> 00:37:32,995
but he paid them no attention at all,

566
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:34,635
He has a single-minded desire

567
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:36,235
for those handsome young men,

568
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:39,355
After he got married and had children,

569
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:41,235
everyone thought he had restrained himself,

570
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:42,795
However, he claiming to the others

571
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:45,055
that thankfully the first child born was a son,

572
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,115
Therefore,
he doesn't have to deal with women anymore,

573
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,155
Such arrogance,

574
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:51,975
Is he not afraid of ruining his own future&gt;

575
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:53,655
It's because of his unrestrained behavior,

576
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:55,715
the court let down its guard against him

577
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,435
and gave permission
for him to return to Xizhou,

578
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:00,715
You're saying that

579
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:03,315
it's possible that he was putting up an act
for the court,

580
00:38:09,435 --> 00:38:11,075
My lady, please follow me this way,

581
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:15,035
All the arrangements in this courtyard

582
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:16,915
are all from the hands of the Minister,

583
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:18,875
Secluded and elegant,
with unique craftsmanship,

584
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,555
The most distinctive feature is

585
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,555
the hot springs
located throughout this courtyard,

586
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:25,835
The people of Dunhuang gave this courtyard

587
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:27,155
a nickname called Tang Quan Court,

588
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:29,195
On regular days,

589
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:31,755
it's not easy to get in

590
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:34,275
even for a passing-by prince,

591
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:37,395
In the past few days,
in order to wait for Senior Official Pei,

592
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:39,715
no one was allowed to come in,

593
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:43,115
Such a courtyard was built

594
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:44,575
in this remote and desolate city,

595
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:47,275
The Minister is really sympathetic
to the sufferings of his people,

596
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,015
If the Minister of the Qu family lives
without pride and extravagance,

597
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:53,915
wouldn't that arouse suspicion?

598
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,035
They'll say our Qu family

599
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,115
has ulterior motives,

600
00:38:57,995 --> 00:38:59,115
There's indeed some sense to it,

601
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:01,295
But if one has nothing to hide,

602
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:02,835
why would he fear others' suspicion?

603
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:04,275
My lady, that's not true,

604
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:06,275
Ever since ancient times,
countless loyal ministers and good generals

605
00:39:06,275 --> 00:39:08,655
have all been ruined by the slander
of petty men and treacherous officials,

606
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:10,055
If it were not so,

607
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:12,475
how could Senior Official Pei, a man of honor,

608
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,155
come to Xizhou?

609
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:18,875
I'll escorted you here,

610
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,032
Thank you for your efforts, Prefect Wang,

611
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:28,075
My lady, please

612
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:38,475
All of you may leave now,

613
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,835
Your service isn't needed,

614
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,075
I want to be alone and some quite space,

615
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:42,715
Yes, my lady,

616
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,595
Chancellor's wife has arrived,

617
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:25,315
Prefect Wang has arrived,

618
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:52,032
Slow down,

619
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:15,615
This attire of Minister Qu

620
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:17,515
is like a peacock with its feathers unfolded,

621
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:38,175
<i>♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫</i>

622
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:44,703
<i>♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫</i>

623
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:49,023
<i>♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫</i>

624
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,703
<i>♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫</i>

625
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:57,951
<i>♫ The years pass by like a bird♫</i>

626
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,351
<i>♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫</i>

627
00:43:06,463 --> 00:43:10,911
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

628
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:15,743
<i>♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫</i>

629
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:19,231
<i>♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

630
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:25,727
<i>♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫</i>

631
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:29,119
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

632
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,127
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

633
00:43:32,127 --> 00:43:35,679
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

634
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,783
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

635
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:42,015
<i>♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫</i>

636
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:45,279
<i>♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫</i>

637
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,639
<i>♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫</i>

638
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,535
<i>♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫</i>

639
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:11,743
<i>♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫</i>

640
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:19,295
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

641
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:22,862
<i>♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫</i>

642
00:44:22,862 --> 00:44:26,158
<i>♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫</i>

643
00:44:26,158 --> 00:44:32,654
<i>♫ I've endured hardship

644
00:44:32,654 --> 00:44:36,046
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

645
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:39,342
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

646
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:42,766
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

647
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,998
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

648
00:44:45,998 --> 00:44:49,230
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

649
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,590
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

650
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,822
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

651
00:44:55,822 --> 00:45:00,814
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>

652

656
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,422
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

657
00:45:17,422 --> 00:45:20,270

658
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,647
