I wonder if they are satisfied with it,

Madam, you played your cards well,

216
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:30,292
Although
Pei Shouyue is the eldest son of Pei family,

217

he couldn't dare to refuse the gift from you,

Moreover, it is said that

00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:49,772
I'm sure he is keeping this from his new wife,

find such a person

even her flute is quite similar,

Yunu looks like the ex-wife of the master?

I'm just a poor woman

Now I'm here,
the only one I can rely on is master,

301
00:22:50,572 --> 00:22:52,572
I heard that the master and Lady Luqi

302
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,292
once were very in love,

303
00:22:56,812 --> 00:23:01,932
After Lady Luqi died,
master felt guilty and missed her very much,

304
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:06,212

My lady, this must not happen,

311

Princess said she sent her as a maid,

Besides, even if we want to sell,
I'm afraid no one would dare to take her,

315
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:49,252
Who said I'm going to sell her?

316
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:51,812
Then, what do you want to do?

317
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,052
As a new bride, I should

Princess,

325
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:26,048
on that day, Lady Cui

326
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,792
brought this beautiful woman to visit my home,

327
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:31,412
and she forgot to take Yunu with her,

328
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:35,272
Thinking that I would drop by,

329
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:38,652
so, I let her stay at my house for a few days,

330
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,892
Today, I brought her back to you,

331
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:50,012
Cui, what's the matter?

332
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:55,192
She misunderstood,
That day I made it very clear,

333
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:57,452
that Yunu was given to Shouyue and Kudi

334
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,832
as a maid by your ladyship,

335
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,092
I even instructed Yunu

336
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:04,932
to serve the master and lady well,

337
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:09,892
Could it be you've forgotten?

338
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:14,452
I'm sorry for that,

339
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:18,192
It's just that
Lady Cui forgot to leave her contract

340
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:19,892
when she sent Yunu over,

341
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,052
So, I just thought

342
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:26,112
"it only right to send the maid
and her contract over",

343
00:25:26,112 --> 00:25:27,292
So, I got confused,

344
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:37,056
Cui,

345
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:40,272
what exactly are you doing?

346
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,412
I knew you were just careless,

347
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:46,972
but others would think
I was being mean on purpose,

348
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:51,172
Go and fetch Yunu's contract,

349
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:00,064
Yes,

350
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:12,532
<i>The princess was pressured by Kudi</i>

351
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:13,692
<i>and had no choice but to say so,</i>

352
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,512
<i>If I were to actually hand over her contract,</i>

353
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:18,172
<i>she would definitely vent her anger on me,</i>

354
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:19,612
<i>What should I do?</i>

355
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:33,332
Madam, pardon me,

356
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:36,572
I mixed up her contract with other documents,

357
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,252
leaving it at another estate,

358
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:43,852
I've already ordered someone to fetch it,

359
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,692
and as soon as it's retrieved,
I will immediately send it to Lady Liuli,

360
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,372
Thank you, Lady Cui,

361
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:52,572
And thank you, princess,

362
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:55,572
I shall accept Yunu as a generous gift,

363
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:57,692
Lady Liuli knows the proper etiquette,

364
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:01,452
The younger
shouldn't refuse the gift from the elder,

365
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:07,572
And the younger shouldn't hit, scold

366
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,892
sold, or abuse the maid who is a gift,

367
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,732
I couldn't afford the princess to say so,

368
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,712
Someone as delicate as Yunu,

369
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:26,972
me and Shouyue will be loathed
to part with her,

370
00:28:00,852 --> 00:28:02,252
Where to go?

371
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:04,792
That tramp is playing her flute again,
trying to seduce master,

372
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:08,052
I know my lady upholds dignity
and doesn't bother to give a fuss,

373
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:09,572
I'll go and punish her for you,

374
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:10,624
No,

375
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:37,292
Why did she stop all of a sudden?

376
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:40,692
My lady,
could it be that master really went to see her?

377
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,972
Otherwise, why would she stop right there?

378
00:28:48,252 --> 00:28:49,452
She plays the flute all day long,

379
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:52,132
but doesn't expect master to come see her,

380
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:56,692
She just wants to sabotage our relationship,

381
00:28:58,572 --> 00:28:59,652
For example,

382
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:03,152
she plays the flute, you let your mind wander,

383
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:06,492
when she stops, you still let your mind wander,

384
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:09,772
In the long run,

385
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:15,092
misunderstandings and estrangements
will inevitably arise between the couple,

386
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:17,192
Since you have already seen through her tricks,

387
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:18,892
do not let her spoil your mood,

388
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:23,492
The most vicious thing of psywar is

389
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:26,572
even after seeing through the tricks,
the misunderstanding still exists,

390
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:31,532
As long as I love Shouyue,
there will be jealousy,

391
00:29:32,332 --> 00:29:34,372
Where there is jealousy,
there will be suspicion,

392
00:29:34,892 --> 00:29:37,132
Where there is suspicion,
there will be an estrangement,

393
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:42,452
The saying goes, "care leads to confusion",

394
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,384
<i>[Harmony and Steadfastness]</i>

395
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:00,512
Cheng,

396
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:01,532
Yes,

397
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:02,692
Did you put this flower here?

398
00:30:03,572 --> 00:30:05,332
No, master, it's not me,

399
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:06,932
I did,

400
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:12,416
<i>[Harmony and Steadfastness]</i>

401
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:16,932
Greetings, master,

402
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:20,632
I brought the michelia figo here,

403
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:22,752
for the master and lady to enjoy,

404
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:27,132
It's delicate and pleasant to smell,

405
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:29,572
Furthermore, I overheard

406
00:30:29,572 --> 00:30:33,252
Lady Luqi loved it a lot when she was alive,

407
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:41,092
And she wore herself out for Pei family,

408
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:44,772
<i>[Harmony and Steadfastness]</i>
The master has always felt guilty to her,

409
00:30:45,572 --> 00:30:47,292
Therefore, I put it here,

410
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:51,692
to appease master's longing for her,

411
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:56,852
Kudi Liuli, though she is a barbarian woman,

412
00:30:57,972 --> 00:31:00,612
Still, she used to be an official in the palace

413
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:02,812
<i>[Treasures fill the home]</i>
and as a head of Bureau of Garment,

414
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:08,332
So, she is much cleverer than Lady Luqi,

415
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:13,092
Even if Lady Liuli has some small tricks,

416
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:15,532
could she even compete with princess?

417
00:31:16,452 --> 00:31:18,652
She will end up in failure,

418
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:22,492
How much better can she be than Lady Luqi?

419
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:26,012
In the end, after all…

420
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:27,040
What?

421
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:30,872
Lady Luqi's death, what has it to do with me?

422
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:36,012
Ten years ago,
Shouyue married Lady Luqi on mother's order,

423
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:39,852
They just wanted me to honor our promise

424
00:31:40,372 --> 00:31:43,572
to return Pei family's fortune
that I had managed for years,

425
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:48,732
Pei's family was really ruthless,

426
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:53,372
They fixated on Pei Shouyue's inheritance,

427
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:55,492
that ultimately drove Lady Luqi to her death,

428
00:31:58,172 --> 00:32:00,972
After all, what does this have to do with me?

429
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:05,092
Yes, madam, you're right,

430
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:06,872
You should visit the Pei mansion,

431
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:08,852
We need to help Yunu do her work,

432
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:11,904
Yes, madam,

433
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:17,652
Today, I have come for two matters,

434
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:21,832
The first is to apologize to you,

435
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:25,452
Yesterday,
I sent someone to fetch Yunu's contract,

436
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:28,012
But the residence was burglarized,

437
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,892
Besides gold, silver, and money

438
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,972
the thief also stole Yunu's contract,

439
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,952
There is such a bold thief,

440
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:41,172
daring to steal from Hedong Duke,

441
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:43,412
and specifically took Yunu's contract,

442
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:47,932
In this case, there is no need to hurry,

443
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:50,144
Once Shouyue catches the thief,

444
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:53,072
you will naturally get her contract,

445
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:56,172
I wonder what the second matter is,

446
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:03,632
Recently, princess feels weak and exhausted,

447
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:05,372
We called the imperial physician several times,

448
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,932
Madam was thinking of
going to pray and seek blessings at the temple,

449
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:13,432
Hence, I am here to follow her instructions

450
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,932
to invite you to join us,

451
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:19,572
Princess wishes for me to accompany her
to the temple for prayers,

452
00:33:20,692 --> 00:33:24,412
You know enough not to refuse

453
00:33:24,412 --> 00:33:26,692
the chance to show filial piety to her, right?

454
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:33,792
Concerning the well-being of the princess,

455
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,852
if I can offer even a little support,
it would be a blessing I earnestly wish for,

456
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:42,252
Yunu, princess has treated you very well,

457
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:45,212
you shall accompany me to serve her,

458
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:48,612
No, there is no need for Yunu to go,

459
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,720
Why not?

460
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,892
Her birth chart clashes

461
00:33:53,892 --> 00:33:55,132
with that of the Princess,

462
00:33:55,132 --> 00:34:00,732
She can stay here to serve Shouyue for you,

463
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:15,792
Please take a message to princess for me,
Lady Cui,

464
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,512
I will take good care of my master,

465
00:34:18,512 --> 00:34:20,532
with no negligence whatsoever,

466
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:24,292
Then, I won't take up any more of your time,

467
00:34:27,772 --> 00:34:30,012
I will come to fetch you tomorrow morning,

468
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:31,132
Goodbye, Lady Cui,

469
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:44,012
The fragrance on your body
is sweet but not cloying, with a gentle scent,

470
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,052
I wonder what fragrance you use,

471
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:51,532
It's indeed special, but it isn't mine,

472
00:34:53,812 --> 00:34:57,372
You must be referring to my fragrance,

My father is a florist,

474
00:34:59,212 --> 00:35:01,792
I've grown up among the flowers,

475
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:05,412
Many have said I have this unique scent,

476
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:08,852
it's not from any fragrant powder,

477
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:11,452
Sorry to make you laugh at me,

478
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:19,212
Being as pretty as a flower is one thing,

479
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:21,412
but to also have a natural body scent,

480
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:26,532
Indeed, a rare beauty in this world,
even I cannot help loving you,

481
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:31,092

00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:10,496
Master,

523
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:26,052
If you want to pray to Buddha,

524
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:30,372
you need to be peaceful and pure,

525
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:34,652
How can you be so impatient about it?

526
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:36,692
You just let me down,

527
00:39:36,692 --> 00:39:40,972
I was going to teach you about courtesy,

528
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:45,452
You're right, princess, I'm too young,

529
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:48,232
I can't be like you

530
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,372
be so observant and alert,

531
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:53,852
You can pay attention to me,
to see if I'm peaceful or not,

532
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:55,932
and also concentrate on worshipping the Buddha,

533
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,312
Sorry for my ignorance,

534
00:40:02,176 --> 00:40:04,072
Princess just said,

535
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:08,132
in front of the Buddha,
it's best to be peaceful and pure,

536
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:12,172
Please don't be angry, princess,

537
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:35,052
Have you returned in the rain, master?

538
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:36,412
Why are you all wet?

539
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:40,212
I have prepared ginger soup,
please drink it to warm your body,

540
00:40:40,212 --> 00:40:41,732
Then change into dry clothes,

541
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:44,412
Catching a cold is not funny,

542
00:40:44,412 --> 00:40:45,472
Why are you here?

543
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:49,752
I heard that
master will sleep in county office today,

544
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:51,212
So, I prepared

545
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:53,172
some food and clothes for change,

546
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:56,192
This is the ginger soup I made myself,

547
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:57,932
Please drink it while it's hot, master,

548
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:05,492
I know you are a new bride,
You worry about your husband,

549
00:41:06,252 --> 00:41:10,012
It is human nature to feel restless,

550
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:15,052
Yunu is very considerate,

551
00:41:15,812 --> 00:41:19,732
She will surely take good care of Shouyue,

552
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,412
Don't worry, Lady Liuli,

553
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:38,732
Master, drink the ginger soup first,

554
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:41,772
I will help you change later,

555
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,656
My lady,

556
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,472
How is everything at home?

557
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:28,192
Master stayed at the county office last night,
everything is fine at home,

558
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:32,372
But, Yunu went out last night
and has not returned yet,
