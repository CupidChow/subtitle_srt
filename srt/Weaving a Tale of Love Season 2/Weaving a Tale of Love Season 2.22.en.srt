<i>[Episode 22]</i>

3
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,755
Here comes the second glass of wine,

4
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:49,835
It's for thanking you for rescuing Fuxian
and saving Song'er,

5
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:52,035
Our Qu family

6
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:55,075
could finally get rid of the shackles
of the Princess,

7
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,464
Song'er,

8
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:02,835
you must make sure to express your gratitude

9
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:05,015
to Senior Official Pei and Madam Kudi,

10
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,635
They're our family's life savers,

11
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:11,200
Song'er,

12
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,195
Thank you, Senior Official Pei,
Thank you, Madam Kudi,

13
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:24,608
You're too polite, young master,

14
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:32,275
Chongyu, Lady Jing,

15
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:36,915
You two should also thank Senior Official Pei
and his wife heartily,

16
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,575
I've long considered Liuli as a sister,

17
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:41,755
and saying thanks would be too formal,

18
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,675
But I still want to thank you

19
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,895
for risking your life

20
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,715
for saving my sister-in-law and Song'er,

21
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,016
Let's go,

22
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:56,192
Sit here,

23
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:00,704
Shouyue,

24
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:02,848
thank you,

25
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,200
Minister,

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,120
you're welcome,

27
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:21,875
Protector-General, Minister,

28
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,115
please forgive my rudeness,

29
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,048
My wife and I

30
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,355
would like to propose a toast to Prefect Wang,

31
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,528
Prefect Wang,

32
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:45,275
we're grateful for your assistance that night,

33
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:47,235
If it wasn't for you,

34
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:49,355
our dilemma in Xizhou
would not have been resolved,

35
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:50,995
If it wasn't for you,

36
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,995
we would not have been able to settle here,

37
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:55,635
Prefect Wang,

38
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,235
you are the benefactor of both me and Shouyue,

39
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:58,475
I pay my respect to Prefect Wang,

40
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,008
Junmeng,

41
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,355
I treated you first as my brother-in-law,

42
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:11,595
then as my brother,

43
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:14,215
From this day forward,

44
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:15,735
I'll see you as a brother first,

45
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:16,915
then my brother-in-law,

46
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:22,575
You saved my family,

47
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:24,875
You saved my son,

48
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,835
and you also saved
the Senior Official and his wife,

49
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,315
You kept us a good official

50
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:32,755
for our people in Xizhou,

51
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:33,875
A toast for you

52
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:37,275
along with the Senior Official's couple,

53
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,112
Drink it up,

54
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:54,395
Drink it up,

55
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,515
So many people are toasting to you,

56
00:04:56,515 --> 00:04:57,595
and you're still pretending over there,

57
00:04:58,755 --> 00:04:59,955
Without you,

58
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,195
I don't yet know when

59
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,035
I'll be able to see my lovely grandson,

60
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,035
Father-in-law,

61
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:30,912
I toast to you,

62
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:32,704
I,,,I'll drink it up,

63
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:34,655
Good, good,

64
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:35,744
Chongyu,

65
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:39,155
Brother, I'll drink it up,

66
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,075
Senior Official, Madam Kudi,

67
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,115
I have caused a lot of offense in the past,
I'll drink it up,

68
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:51,275
Aunt, I'll drink it up,

69
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:53,875
Junmeng, don't drink too much,

70
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:58,615
Young master, let's have a drink,

71
00:05:58,615 --> 00:05:59,648
Sit down for me,

72
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:08,675
Come, let us all raise our cups together

73
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:12,695
to thank the Senior Official Pei and his wife,

74
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:13,795
Respect to the Senior Official's couple,

75
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:30,784
<i>[Protector-General's Mansion]</i>

76
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:34,915
Come, come, Make way, make way,

77
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:37,475
Take a look at the trinket,

78
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:43,235
Sanniang from An family requests an audience,
Master,

79
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,184
Please let her in,

80
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,336
Sister,

81
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,995
There's no outsider in this room,
why the need for such formalities?

82
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:58,080
Please come in,

83
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:05,595
My visit this time is to

84
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:07,075
report important matters to you,
Senior Official,

85
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:09,555
Sister, thank you for

86
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,835
having gathered so much grain and fodder,

87
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:12,875
I can't conceal anything from you,

88
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:15,395
From the past half month,

89
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,795
many merchants and families have rushed here
from various counties and villages,

90
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,515
which has indeed saved us
quite a bit of effort,

91
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,895
The weather is quite good this year,

92
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:23,995
The harvest in the counties of Xizhou
is also quite good,

93
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:27,235
and I've heard good news
from places like Dunhuang and Qiuci,

94
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:30,595
For now, we closed the deal
for 100,000 dan of grain,

95
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:32,195
More than 50,000 dan have also been put
into the warehouse,

96
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:33,475
The remaining 40,000 dan

97
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:35,475
are estimated to be delivered continuously
by the end of the month,

98
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,475
Most of the fodder has also been collected,

99
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:39,232
That's great,

100
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,675
It's just that
everyone's granaries are almost full,

101
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,755
If more grains are sent here,

102
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,835
I'm afraid we can't hold any more,

103
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:48,195
I don't know
when we can start using the government granary,

104
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,635
The granary will be opened for grain collection
in half a month,

105
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:52,815
When the military warehouse collects grain,

106
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:55,115
we pay half of the money to each business,

107
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:56,315
The other half will be paid

108
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:58,455
when they transport the grains
to the military warehouse,

109
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:00,515
The payment can be redeemed with
the military warehouse's expense slips,

110
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:01,795
What merchants fear the most

111
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:03,475
is the accumulation of unpaid goods,

112
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:06,995
Moreover,
purchasing such a large quantity of grain

113
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,315
requires a lot of money,

114
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,795
If one can truly

115
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,815
receive half of the payment as agreed
after half a month,

116
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,315
the pressure would be greatly reduced,

117
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,395
Sister,
you're truly a person of meticulous thoughts,

118
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:26,635
So many detailed matters

119
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:27,995
have all been arranged neatly,

120
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,995
It's all because of you,

121
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,515
It's nothing,

122
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,755
This was indeed a rare opportunity
not to be missed,

123
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:36,315
Even our An family has a solid foundation
in Xizhou,

124
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,835
but I have only been here twice,

125
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:40,035
And this time

126
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,515
almost all the wealthy merchants of Xizhou

127
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:43,075
participated,

128
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:44,375
Although there are difficulties

129
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,015
this time,

130
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,695
but as long as thing are carefully arranged,

131
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,895
I believe

132
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,155
the status of the An family
in the business world

133
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,595
will rise with the tide,

134
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:59,415
Master, Minister Qu invites you
to his residence,

135
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,635
and he says it's about the Military Commander
of Congshan Route,

136
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:03,775
General Su has sent a staff officer over,

137
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,835
General Su's people sure arrived quickly,

138
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:07,515
This General Su

139
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,715
is not the one you think of,

140
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:22,815
Senior Official Pei,

141
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,195
you are late,

142
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,355
You should be penalized,

143
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,335
Protector-General,

144
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:28,480
Minister,

145
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:32,995
Shouyue,

146
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:34,535
I didn't expect us to meet again

147
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:35,755
this soon,

148
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:38,915
It turns out to be Brother Ziyu,

149
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:40,235
This is truly a pleasant surprise,

150
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,475
You have followed General Su to Yizhou?

151
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,235
<i>My father and I are now exiled to Yizhou,</i>

152
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,395
<i>All thanks to you,</i>

153
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,128
Exactly,

154
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:54,195
I didn't expect the Emperor's grace
to be this immense,

155
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:56,275
He granted me to serve
under my father's command,

156
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,515
My father is now the Military Commander
of Congshan Route,

157
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:01,115
I came here this time

158
00:10:01,115 --> 00:10:03,315
to supervise the military readiness in Xizhou,

159
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,035
I'm afraid it may disturb your watch
for several days

160
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:08,975
I couldn't ask for more,

161
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,035
For the matter of supply and tax in Xizhou,

162
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:12,835
just ask me,

163
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,675
These matters are all entrusted to Shouyue,

164
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:17,195
I am unaware of any,

165
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:19,875
However, if you want to know
where to find the finest wine,

166
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,115
or the most gorgeous performance,
then I'm your guy,

167
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,995
You guys keep going,

168
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:29,595
Just now, Chongyu mentioned he know nothing
about the money and grain,

169
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,275
I thought it was just his modest talk,

170
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:35,175
But I didn't expect that Pei Xingjian truly

171
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:37,915
had the means to isolate the Qu's family,

172
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:40,955
Shouyue,

173
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,135
let's talk about official matters first

174
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:44,335
before anything personal,

175
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,715
Okay,

176
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:47,475
I wonder how much supplies have been prepared
by Xizhou

177
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:48,915
for the army,

178
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,975
50,000 dan of millet and corn
have been prepared,

179
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:52,975
along with 10,000 carts of forage and grain,

180
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,455
Everything will be ready
by the end of the month,

181
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:55,835
Once the army is here,

182
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,555
we can immediately transport everything
to the military warehouse,

183
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,475
Shouyue, you're not joking, right?

184
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,155
The population of Xizhou is nearly 40,000,

185
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:04,955
How can you only prepare 50,000 dan of corn?

186
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:08,635
Yizhou's population is less than 10,000,
yet more than 20,000 dan have been prepared,

187
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,595
The expedition of the army to the west
is a serious matter for our country,

188
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,115
Do not joke about this;

189
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:15,275
take it seriously
and do not treat it as child's play,

190
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,755
Ziyu, there're things you don't know,

191
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,975
Yizhou is a place where the land is vast,
and the population is sparse,

192
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:23,475
Xizhou is

193
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,515
Crowded but with less land,

194
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,235
I have been struggling for the past two months,

195
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:28,895
Buying grain at a high price,

196
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,995
engaging traders,

197
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,095
I have tried all kinds of methods,

198
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:34,595
I was prepared for 100,000 dan
in the beginning,

199
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:36,415
But now

200
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:37,915
I could only be certain about 50,000 dan,

201
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,715
If you add the rent from the summer harvest

202
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:42,595
and the back-up supply in the granary,

203
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:44,955
it's about 60,000 approximately,

204
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:48,555
To be honest,

205
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:50,955
I also know this is a difficult matter,

206
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:53,475
But this time, the army has 100,000 people,

207
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:57,375
Chief Administrator Cheng issued
a military order to my father a few days ago,

208
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,955
Before the arrival of the army,

209
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:00,755
the three states of Xi, Ting, and Yi must

210
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,315
prepare the army rations
in the amount of three dan per household,

211
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,315
If there're any violations,

212
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:06,735
the military law will surely be discussed,

213
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:07,995
Three dan per household,

214
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,275
That's a total of 120,000 dan then,

215
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:16,675
Don't worry too much, Shouyue,

216
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,535
My father knows that you and I go way back,

217
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:20,595
therefore,

218
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,275
he specifically sent me to

219
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,715
lend you a helping hand,

220
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:25,635
I came with 300 elite solders this time

221
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:27,875
by order,

222
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:30,475
Once the grain is stored,
should there be a shortage,

223
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,335
I will then dispatch my troops

224
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,915
to levy grain from the villages,

225
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:35,075
Master Su,

226
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:42,075
I'll definitely do my best
to hand in the corns,

227
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:44,675
But 120,000 dan

228
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:47,755
have indeed exceeded the burden
of the people of Xizhou,

229
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,575
You really have a kind heart,

230
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:52,235
I respect that,

231
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,455
However, the military orders are unyielding,

232
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,435
there's no room for negotiation,

233
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,595
You go ahead and collecting grain as you could,

234
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,635
If it could be delivered in full,

235
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:01,715
that's the best,

236
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,455
If there's any shortage,

237
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:06,155
I certainly will not sit by
and watch General Cheng

238
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,915
have you subjected to the military law

239
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:09,315
even if it means bearing a bad name,

240
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,675
I have taken Ziyu's good intentions to heart,

241
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:16,075
but could you grant me a few more days?

242
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:18,615
The army is about to arrive,

243
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:20,955
Even if I want to help you delay
for a few more days,

244
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:22,315
but the military law is ruthless,

245
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:25,915
You better not harbor any wishful thinking,

246
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,555
Reporting to the Protector-General,
the plum juice is ready,

247
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:39,395
Is it ready?

248
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:40,435
Okay,

249
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:45,835
Now that you two have done talking business,

250
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:46,915
then let us

251
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:48,355
go together and have a taste

252
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:51,035
of plum juice from Meizhong County,

253
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,704
Protector-General Qu,

254
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,155
I will go and instruct the subordinates first

255
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:56,435
to hurry up in collecting grains
from all places,

256
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,115
Ziyu, I will take my leave first,

257
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:01,595
When I have time,

258
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:03,595
I will surely treat you to a good drink,

259
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:07,015
You're indeed diligent in government affairs

260
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:08,195
I am impressed,

261
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,635
It seems that Senior Official Pei is too busy,

262
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:24,115
Ziyu,

263
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,555
let's go try it together,

264
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,475
Let's go,

265
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:39,835
120,000 dan,

266
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,035
This is unreasonable,

267
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:44,515
The 100,000 dan of grain my people collected
in Xizhou

268
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,155
were already the work of miracles,

269
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:48,875
If we are to collect another 20,000,

270
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,275
it's not that we can't collect them,

271
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:53,695
We could collect some more

272
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,075
if we transport from other places now,

273
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:57,655
However, time is limited,

274
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,895
First of all, too much money will be spent,

275
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:01,275
Secondly, it's somewhat risky,

276
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,035
Listen to me first, sister,

277
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,395
I know that collecting grain locally in Xizhou

278
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:09,675
is the cheapest and lowest-risk way,

279
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:13,075
But nowadays, besides those wealthy households,

280
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:15,575
ordinary households do not have much left,

281
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,795
Even if we want to collect,
we can only do so by force,

282
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:20,515
I did the calculation,

283
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:23,895
The grain silos in Xizhou areas
have a few thousand dan of grain left,

284
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:25,835
If we include what comes out
of the official and public fields,

285
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:27,395
we can barely collect 10,000 dan,

286
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,195
But for the remaining 10,000 dan,

287
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:38,715
sister, do you have any plans?

288
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,515
In fact,

289
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:44,775
we 110,000 dan of grain

290
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:45,875
this time,

291
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:47,520
What do you mean?

292
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:49,575
You also know that

293
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,215
there're many rules about the army warehouse,

294
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,795
It's hard to deal with those
who are difficult to talk,

295
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:54,715
There's a chance
that they will deduct 20 percent from you,

296
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:56,115
There's nothing we can do about it,

297
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,535
Therefore, when collecting,

298
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:59,075
we left some margin,

299
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:01,935
Fortunately, this year's prices are 20 percent
higher than previous years,

300
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:04,075
so those farmers did not really mind,

301
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,035
if you can make sure

302
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,155
that the measurement is fair

303
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,115
when it comes to storage,

304
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,355
I'm sure that these 110,000 dan

305
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:12,515
might still have a surplus,

306
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:19,035
120,000 dan of military rations,

307
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:23,435
This far exceeds the capacity of the people
in Xizhou,

308
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:26,435
As Su Nanjin said,

309
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:28,875
he will send troops to the countryside
to collect grains,

310
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:32,475
The meaning behind these words

311
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:35,355
is so cruel,

312
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,715
This matters to all the people in Xizhou,

313
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:43,195
We cannot stand by and watch,

314
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:47,275
For the shortage,

315
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:49,635
I will try to make up for it
from the public field

316
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,915
and suspend the grain allowances
of our officials in Xizhou,

317
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:55,475
The rest,,,

318
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,355
I'll try to buy from the surrounding areas,

319
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:21,248
What's the matter?

320
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:26,375
I've heard that Su Haizheng,
the Military Commander of Congshan Route,

321
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,195
has sent his son Su Nanjin
to supervise the grain collection in Xizhou,

322
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:33,315
Did he give you any hard time about it?

323
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:37,435
Given Su Nanjin's narrow-mindedness

324
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:38,755
and his vicious nature,

325
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:41,555
of course he made big demand

326
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:42,955
in terms of numbers,

327
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:44,128
No wonder,

328
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:46,015
Back in Liangzhou,

329
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:47,015
Su Nanjin

330
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,555
thought he killed me, the Senior Official's wife,

331
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,715
without anyone noticing,

332
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:54,055
but now I am alive and well,

333
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:56,235
Besides,
he submitted a document impeaching you,

334
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:57,815
which would surely offend the Emperor,

335
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:59,355
Therefore, he and his father

336
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,755
suffered,

337
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:02,735
How could he not understand
that he has fallen into your trap

338
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:04,915
even if he's stupid?

339
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:07,055
His trip to Xizhou

340
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:08,555
made him face his enemy again,

341
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,315
He'll not let us go,

342
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:15,515
What happened in Liangzhou
is his own fault for his earlier misdoings,

343
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,275
He wants to use public office
for personal revenge,

344
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,875
and let's see

345
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:22,835
whether they have the capability or not,

346
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:25,475
Regarding the matter of gathering grain,

347
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:27,075
do you have a countermeasure ready?

348
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,555
Rest assured; I have my own plans,

349
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,195
But for you,
Su Nanjin already hates you thoroughly,

350
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,195
Now with him in Xizhou,

351
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:39,275
although the chances of you two
seeing each other are slim,

352
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,075
you still need to be very careful,

353
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:43,755
I will also be extra careful around him,

354
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:49,216
Don't worry anymore,

355
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:55,680
<i>[The Great Buddha Temple]</i>

356
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:06,784
Shouyue,

357
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:12,495
Shouyue, such a coincidence,

358
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:13,875
- Protector-General,
- You also come to the Great Buddha Temple?

359
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,895
My wife had a sudden feeling in her heart,

360
00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:18,195
and she said she wanted to come
and pay her respects,

361
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,475
It turns out that Madam Kudi wishes to come
and worship the Buddha,

362
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:25,595
The same for me,

363
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:28,875
Master Juexuan is coming,

364
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:32,755
Amitabha,

365
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:33,824
Master,

366
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:37,735
The Senior Official and the Protector-General
have come together today,

367
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:39,235
Good, good,

368
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:41,595
Come, please,

369
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:42,752
Okay, please,

370
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,835
When I came to the Great Buddha Temple
to offer incense recently,

371
00:19:56,835 --> 00:19:59,695
I have not seen the miracle
of the Bronze Buddha shedding tears again,

372
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:00,775
So did I,

373
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:03,735
I hope to witness the miracle one more time,

374
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,215
But despite many attempts at offering incense,
my wish has not been fulfilled,

375
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:08,195
Could it be
that my intentions are not sincere enough?

376
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:16,715
This Bronze Buddha no longer sheds tears,

377
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:19,435
It must be because our great Tang is peaceful
and prosperous,

378
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,715
and the weather in Xizhou is favorable,

379
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:23,195
The Bronze Buddha
no longer needs to pity the world,

380
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:24,755
Therefore, no more tears,

381
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:26,975
That makes sense,

382
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,095
The Buddha compassionately looks upon
all sentient beings,

383
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,795
Now, everyone lives in peace and happiness
in Xizhou,

384
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:34,595
It doesn't make sense
that the Bronze Buddha would shed tears,

385
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:36,736
Yes,

386
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,958
<i>[The Great Hall]</i>

387
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,075
I hope that Gods will not shed tears anymore,

388
00:20:57,835 --> 00:20:59,075
May the people in Xizhou

389
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:00,195
live and work in peace and contentment,

390
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:01,555
Our Tang Dynasty is prosperous,
and the people are at peace,

391
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:03,715
The Buddha has mercy,

392
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:05,195
I pray sincerely to the Buddha,

393
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:07,155
Please protect our people in Xizhou,

394
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:26,035
The tea made by the Master is excellent

395
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:28,075
May I bother for a cup today?

396
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:29,355
I wonder if it will disturb you,

397
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:31,115
I couldn't have asked for more,

398
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,635
So, I'll bask
in the Senior Officials' light too

399
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:35,495
and ask you for a cup of tea, Master,

400
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,915
For sure,

401
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:38,915
Please go ahead, Protector-General,
Please go ahead, Senior Official,

402
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:40,115
- Please,
- Please, my lady,

403
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:58,848
Master Juexuan,

404
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:01,895
I came here today

405
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:03,235
to ask for a favor,

406
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:05,875
You must also be aware

407
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:08,995
that
Xizhou is now facing an unforeseeable crisis,

408
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,155
I wonder if the Great Buddha Temple

409
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:13,355
is willing to offer kindness,

410
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,195
contributing money and effort

411
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:16,715
for the people in Xizhou,

412
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,312
Senior Official,

413
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:24,875
you hold the secret of the Bronze Buddha,

414
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,195
Do you intend to use it as leverage

415
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,195
and forcing the Great Buddha Temple
to pay military provisions?

416
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:38,715
Amitabha,

417
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,835
Thank you for your support, Protector-General,

418
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:43,835
I believe

419
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:47,995
If Senior Official Pei wants to use the secret
of the bronze Buddha to blackmail,

420
00:22:48,555 --> 00:22:50,995
he'd not have deliberately guided
public opinion just now by

421
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:55,295
dispelling the believers' expectations
of the Buddha shedding tears,

422
00:22:55,295 --> 00:22:56,352
The Master is wise,

423
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,635
If the Master wishes to know the secret
behind the tearing Bronze Buddha,

424
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:01,915
I'll tell you without reservation,

425
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:05,175
It is not difficult for the Master
if he wants to know the secret,

426
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,355
The difficulty lies in
knowing how to conduct oneself afterwards,

427
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:09,835
A monk does not tell lies,

428
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:12,955
Let alone a high monk
of great virtue and esteem like the Master,

429
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,995
If the Master were to reveal to the devotees
after knowing

430
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,315
the secret of the tearing Bronze Buddha,

431
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,555
it would destroy the sanctity of the Temple
in the hearts of the believers,

432
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:23,955
If the Master wishes to preserve
the sanctity of the Great Buddha Temple,

433
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:25,795
then he must lie to the believers,

434
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:27,675
I wonder if you have thought of a solution

435
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:29,955
for this kind of dilemma, Master,

436
00:23:32,835 --> 00:23:33,955
Amitabha,

437
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:36,075
Don't be aware,

438
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,715
Don't listen or ask,

439
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:42,995
Let the secret of the tearing Bronze Buddha

440
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:45,235
hide in the Great Buddha Temple,

441
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:46,795
It shall never to appear again,

442
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:48,395
This is true wisdom,

443
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:51,155
I here thank

444
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:54,595
the Senior Official's couple
for your kind intentions,

445
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:03,315
You two

446
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:06,035
indeed have great wisdom,

447
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:08,475
At the sacred land of Buddhism,

448
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:11,035
we hold compassion at heart,

449
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:13,995
However, this matter of money and grain

450
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:16,995
is indeed the intrinsic duty of us
imperial officials,

451
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,075
How can one shift the blame to others?

452
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:23,515
The Senior Official is truly dedicated
to working out plans for the people,

453
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:26,195
I'm also deeply impressed,

454
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,275
However, today's matter

455
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:31,075
was indeed too abrupt,

456
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:34,595
Rest assured, Master,

457
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:36,095
Regarding such government affairs,

458
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:39,355
my family will certainly bear
all the responsibility,

459
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,515
We'll neither let the people in Xizhou
feel uneasy,

460
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:46,115
nor disturb the pureness
of the Buddhist monastery,

461
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:53,955
Amitabha,

462
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:56,395
Thank you for your kindness, Protector-General,

463
00:24:57,115 --> 00:24:59,875
Also, thank you for your family
for taking the responsibility,

464
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:02,355
But the matter of military provisions

465
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,635
concerns thousands of civilians in Xizhou,

466
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:06,875
The Buddha has mercy,

467
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:10,315
The Great Buddha Temple
should also bear its responsibility,

468
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:12,595
In this last half-month period,

469
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:15,815
the merits donated by the believers

470
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,635
are already more than 40,000 strings of coins,

471
00:25:18,912 --> 00:25:20,032
The temple

472
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,755
is willing to donate them as military supplies,

473
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,675
On behave of the people in Xizhou,

474
00:25:34,555 --> 00:25:35,616
thank you, Master,

475
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,475
The Great Buddha Temple

476
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:45,755
has been worshiped
by the believers of Xizhou for many years,

477
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:47,315
It should be so,

478
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:48,960
Protector-General,

479
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:50,835
there's no need to worry anymore,

480
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:18,755
Pei Xingjian

481
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,435
directly asked Master Juexuan,

482
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:25,795
hoping that the Great Buddha Temple
will make a move

483
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:27,995
to solve the problem of grain supplies,

484
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:32,195
Master Juexuan surprisingly agreed all at once,

485
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:33,875
And he decided firmly to make such a donation,

486
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:36,235
Father, you went to the Great Buddha Temple,

487
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:42,176
I know

488
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,195
I shouldn't go,

489
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:48,115
but in my heart,,,

490
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:58,315
As a father, I've wasted half my life,

491
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,635
In terms of great talent and strategy,

492
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:03,115
I'm far inferior to your grandfather,

493
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,355
In terms of charisma and popularity,

494
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:07,835
I'm also far inferior to your uncle,

495
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:10,755
The only thing I can do

496
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:13,675
is just

497
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:16,435
knowing how to lose,

498
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:21,955
I always lose,

499
00:27:24,195 --> 00:27:25,395
In my heart--

500
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:26,400
Father,

501
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:30,675
in fact, you're not afraid to lose,

502
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:33,235
Father, you just fear

503
00:27:34,555 --> 00:27:37,235
that people think
our Qu family has actually fallen into

504
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:40,555
a situation where we have to rely on outsiders
for everything,

505
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:43,040
am I right?

506
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,808
Father,

507
00:27:52,915 --> 00:27:54,315
I actually believe

508
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,515
that up to now, our family's

509
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:01,355
the greatest achievement is you,

510
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,235
It's not the grand strategy of my grandfather,

511
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:08,635
or the charm and esteem of my uncle,

512
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:11,515
But rather, it is you, father,

513
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:13,755
because you know

514
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:17,515
when we should admit defeat,

515
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,235
Back then, Gaochang surrendered to the Tang

516
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,355
for the sake of the common people,

517
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:31,915
to prevent them from suffering
the horrors of war,

518
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:34,395
And father,

519
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:36,128
you also know

520
00:28:36,755 --> 00:28:37,955
how to lose,

521
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:41,035
In this way, we can make sure Xizhou,

522
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:42,635
our family,

523
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:45,395
won't suffer from Advisor Su's hardships

524
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:48,635
because of the provisions,

525
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:56,395
And it's just because

526
00:28:59,315 --> 00:29:01,675
I didn't learn your way of losing

527
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:04,915
and has made you worry so much about me before,

528
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:07,235
I made you do

529
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:09,715
so many

530
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:11,955
things that shouldn't have been done,

531
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:17,824
Father,

532
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,384
I know that

533
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:21,920
all these years,

534
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:24,515
have been constantly putting yourself
at a disadvantage

535
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:28,155
for Xizhou and for me,

536
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:35,955
As long as it's for the good of people
in Xizhou,

537
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,115
and for you as well,

538
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,595
this bit of hardship I endure

539
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:46,715
didn't count for much,

540
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,435
They didn't count for much,

541
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:03,488
Here you are,

542
00:30:03,488 --> 00:30:04,608
No need,

543
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:06,240
Alright,

544
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:09,312
Then you

545
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,555
will work together

546
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,464
with Senior Official Pei,

547
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:16,815
Pei Shouyue,

548
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,835
for the sake of Xizhou and me,

549
00:30:18,635 --> 00:30:19,648
And you two will

550
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:21,440
advance and retreat together,

551
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,056
Protector-General,

552
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:31,835
Advisor Su requests a meeting,

553
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:38,275
Let's go have a look,

554
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:46,475
Master Su,

555
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:48,224
I'm here to see you, Protector-General,

556
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,195
If there're places
where my son didn't take care of you well

557
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:53,455
in the past few days,

558
00:30:53,455 --> 00:30:54,720
please forgive me,

559
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,315
Please come inside,

560
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:57,440
Protector-General Qu, please wait,

561
00:30:58,995 --> 00:30:59,995
Let's make the long story short,

562
00:31:00,555 --> 00:31:02,555
Senior Official Pei sent someone to inform me

563
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:04,895
that the military provisions have been prepared

564
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:06,275
and can be put into the warehouse tomorrow,

565
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:08,295
He invited me to go and inspect

566
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:09,675
and take over the matter
of the grain warehouse,

567
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,995
I wonder if this is your order,

568
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:16,835
This is how it works,

569
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:18,775
Senior Official Pei

570
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:21,395
is in charge of the finances and grain supplies
in Xizhou,

571
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:24,515
Since he said it's all set,

572
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,755
then it must be ready,

573
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:32,155
I think there's no need
to involve two masters for one matter,

574
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:33,935
It's bothersome to trouble you this time,

575
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,915
but it's to avoid

576
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:38,715
the hassle of going to the military warehouse
again in the future,

577
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:42,075
Protector-General,
you're unaware of this matter?

578
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:47,435
I've made you laugh,

579
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:49,955
The Senior Official is cautious and diligent,

580
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,775
He has always been proper in his dealings,

581
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,035
I

582
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:57,635
also take the opportunity to be lazy,

583
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:01,735
Since this is the case,

584
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:03,435
I understand now,

585
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:06,400
I'll take my leave then,

586
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,675
I'll walk you out,

587
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,395
I don't know

588
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:27,115
what trigger Pei Shouyue pulls recently,

589
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,195
He's able to make the merchants in Xizhou

590
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,355
help him to gather grains and fodder
before and after the saddle,

591
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:34,875
I suppose he must have been confident

592
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:38,155
since he let me go tomorrow,

593
00:32:39,115 --> 00:32:40,155
However,

594
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:42,775
this matter of gathering grains

595
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:44,915
is not the work of one day,

596
00:32:45,555 --> 00:32:47,075
Ziyu, you are saying,,,

597
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,152
Chongyu,

598
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:52,395
would you like to go see a good show tomorrow?

599
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,515
I have official duties tomorrow unfortunately,

600
00:32:56,864 --> 00:32:57,995
So be it,

601
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,195
Just wait here for the news,

602
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:02,755
Giddy up!

603
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:05,632
Giddy up!

604
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:26,475
Master Su is indeed bold and ruthless,

605
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,595
It seems the information I heard is correct,

606
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:31,195
They intend to tamper with the amount

607
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:33,395
and deduct 20 percent,

608
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:38,752
What do you plan to do?

609
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:40,416
Father,

610
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,795
I'd like to inform Shouyue about this,

611
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:46,976
Okay,

612
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,195
Come, give me a hand,

613
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,256
Come on, push hard,

614
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,824
Erlang,

615
00:33:58,515 --> 00:33:59,635
- Alright,
- Be careful,

616
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:00,640
Put it here, over here,

617
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:04,155
Long time no see, how have you been?

618
00:34:04,736 --> 00:34:05,760
Slow down,

619
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,168
- Okay,
- Slow down, slow down,

620
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,715
Come on, lend a hand,

621
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,952
- Everything is here,
- Let's go,

622
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:11,555
Push harder,

623
00:34:11,555 --> 00:34:12,608
It's done,

624
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:34,955
You're short by twenty percent, Add more,

625
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:37,856
What's the matter?

626
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:42,655
How could this be?

627
00:34:42,655 --> 00:34:44,595
This bag clearly holds the amount of one stone,

628
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:46,175
There can only be more,

629
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:47,355
How could there be less?

630
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:49,955
You have a lot of nerve,

631
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:54,595
You deceitful merchants dare to defraud
and deceive the military warehouse,

632
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,235
You really don't want to live,

633
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,335
Send someone here,

634
00:34:58,335 --> 00:34:59,360
Yes, yes,

635
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,755
Drag him down for me,

636
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:02,995
Give him a severely beat
with twenty military canes,

637
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,115
- Yes, yes,
- You!

638
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,035
Who are you calling a deceitful merchant?

639
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:09,115
I'm the Commandant of Militant Cavalry
of the Tang,

640
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,136
Who dares to touch me?

641
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:13,335
Don't do this, Master Su,

642
00:35:13,335 --> 00:35:15,075
Zhang Erlang is not from a merchant family,

643
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:16,715
He's from a prominent family in Xizhou,

644
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,395
He was appointed as a titled official
due to his military merits years ago,

645
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:20,555
He must not be subjected to punishment,

646
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:29,440
Step down,

647
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:35,755
Since you are an official of the Tang,

648
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:37,675
you should abide by the laws of the Tang,

649
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:40,675
Can this matter of military provisions
be manipulated?

650
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:43,215
If you continue to make such a noise,

651
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:44,635
delaying the military provisions
from entering the warehouse,

652
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,315
even if I can tolerate you,

653
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:49,955
the military law will not tolerate you,

654
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:52,355
Retreat quickly!

655
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,175
After handing over these four vessels,

656
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:10,715
take the rest back for me,

657
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:13,715
Don't be angry, Erlang, w
We will advance and retreat with you,

658
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,955
We'll advance and retreat together with Erlang,

659
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,035
<i>Commandant Zhang is even braver than I thought,</i>

660
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,035
If I allow these people to take the grain away
today,

661
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,115
opening the granary for grain collection
would become a joke,

662
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:29,075
It would be a slap in my face first,

663
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,328
Guards!

664
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:47,875
No one is allowed to leave!

665
00:36:50,315 --> 00:36:51,875
Master Su, that won't do,

666
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,695
That won't do, Master Su,

667
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:55,595
Today's grain collection is a military affair,

668
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:58,115
For those who delay the military grain
from entering the warehouse,

669
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:00,995
don't blame me for dealing with it
in accordance with military law,

670
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,560
Brother Ziyu,

671
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:08,235
what's the cause of this excitement?

672
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:15,875
Senior Official Pei, Senior Official Pei,

673
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:19,955
Shouyue,

674
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,355
why are you late today?

675
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:23,195
Ziyu,

676
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:26,255
I went to handle the money and grain affairs
today,

677
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:28,515
Sorry for being late, please forgive me,

678
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:32,128
Please,

679
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:33,280
Please,

680
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:43,275
Shouyue,

681
00:37:43,275 --> 00:37:45,315
the merchants and titled officials from Xizhou

682
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:46,315
are indeed very bold,

683
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,895
I collect grain
using the official measuring vessels,

684
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:51,235
and they even complain that it's too much
and refuse to submit the grain,

685
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:54,795
They really treat it as their own backyard,
huh?

686
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,155
Regarding those who despise the military law,

687
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,235
what do you think should be done
about the situation?

688
00:38:01,835 --> 00:38:02,915
Despising the military law?

689
00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:05,755
I'm here to see you, Senior Official,

690
00:38:07,515 --> 00:38:08,555
The Senior Official's insight is clear,

691
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:10,475
How dare we despise the military law?

692
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:14,235
It's just that we clearly measured,
and here's a bit more than one dan of grain,

693
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:16,755
Yet during the handover,
it was a full 20 percent short,

694
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:20,035
- I don't know how to deliver this grain,
- Exactly,

695
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:22,475
Thank you for the great help in this matter,
Commandant Zhang,

696
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,215
Rest assured, Commandant Zhang,

697
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:25,555
The measuring vessels

698
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:26,715
are made under the court's regulation,

699
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:28,615
If someone deliberately
increases or reduces the volume,

700
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:30,095
they should be treated as thieves
according to the law,

701
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:31,735
If someone is negligent in supervision,

702
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:32,960
they should also be held accountable,

703
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:38,275
Master Su would never violate the law
since he knows it so well,

704
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:42,755
Shouyue, you're ignorant of certain matters,

705
00:38:43,675 --> 00:38:45,075
The official vessels collected for grain
this time

706
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,075
were all taken out of the military warehouse
by myself,

707
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:48,995
They had always been used
by the military warehouse,

708
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:51,155
These ignorant troublemakers

709
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:52,595
even dare to levy accusations,

710
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:54,915
I have military orders to bear,

711
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,435
I must deal with it strictly,

712
00:38:57,715 --> 00:38:59,355
Military rations concern the morale
of the troops,

713
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,355
Those who disturb the morale of my troops
shall be execute without mercy,

714
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:06,015
If Commandant Zhang is determined
to have a taste of the military law,

715
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:08,475
then I will have no choice but to oblige you,

716
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:10,055
Young master,
what you said doesn't makes sense,

717
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,375
This so-called military ration

718
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:12,795
is grain
that has entered the military warehouse,

719
00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:14,915
All the grain carts here

720
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:16,795
have been purchased voluntarily by us,

721
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:19,355
The military has not paid any money,

722
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:20,555
nor have we signed a contract,

723
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,475
How did they become military grain already?

724
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:26,315
- That's true,
- If they collect every grain they see,

725
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:28,635
is this called collection or robbery?

726
00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:32,955
Exactly,

727
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:34,075
This officer title of mine

728
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:36,355
was earned with a knife and gun
on the battlefield,

729
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,955
This grain was grown
in my own household fields,

730
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:42,035
Should this grain be turned over
to the military granary

731
00:39:42,035 --> 00:39:43,275
or kept for personal use,

732
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:44,835
can't I make my own decision?

733
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:48,415
Whether this official measuring vessel
is large or small,

734
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,275
once sent to the Department of Treasury
in Chang'an for verification, it will be known,

735
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,515
I just don't believe it,

736
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,775
The world is such a big place,

737
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:56,195
and there has to be a place
that can discern this principle,

738
00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:02,272
Ziyu,

739
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,875
this is a seventh-rank official,

740
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:07,795
If there's no solid evidence of guilt,

741
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:10,795
you can't just beat or kill him,

742
00:40:19,195 --> 00:40:21,455
Arrest this one who is spreading wild rumors,

743
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,715
- Yes,
- How to you arrest someone?

744
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:24,512
Wait,

745
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:28,675
Are you going to protect her?

746
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:31,712
Exactly,

747
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,715
Senior Official Pei is really good,

748
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:37,435
Yes, he speaks for us,

749
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,695
By the time the army arrives,

750
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:41,395
Shouyue, please also take responsibility
for the lack of grain and fodder,

751
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:44,835
Ziyu, what you said was wrong,

752
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:48,635
It's exactly because we can't afford to
not having grains ready when the army arrives,

753
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:50,435
We shouldn't harm these merchants,

754
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:52,515
Think about it,

755
00:40:52,515 --> 00:40:54,155
The grain and fodder in this training field now

756
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,355
is not even a tenth
of the required army's provision,

757
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,035
It's easy to beat or kill the merchants,

758
00:40:57,675 --> 00:40:58,835
but where will you find

759
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:00,395
the remaining food and fodder?

760
00:41:01,115 --> 00:41:03,595
If this matter causes a delay
in collecting the grain,

761
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,675
I deserve to die of course,

762
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:07,835
But Ziyu,

763
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:11,075
I'm afraid
you won't be able to escape censure either,

764
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:19,935
You would rather be short of a few vessels
than not protecting them,

765
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,475
then I won't stop you,

766
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,435
I dare not ask too much
about this grain collection matter,

767
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:26,275
We can only wait until the army arrives,

768
00:41:26,795 --> 00:41:27,955
We will discuss it then,

769
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:30,875
The matter of grain collection is significant,

770
00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:33,184
Indeed, not a moment can be delayed,

771
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,195
We don't have the time,

772
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:35,232
The only plan at the moment

773
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:38,075
is to make the merchants willingly comply,

774
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:41,395
The military grain must not be short
in weight either,

775
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:43,115
Only in this way

776
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:44,755
could the two of us fully complete this task,

777
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,635
Senior Official Pei, do you have a clever plan?

778
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:49,435
Nothing clever,

779
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:51,595
I suddenly remembered

780
00:41:52,395 --> 00:41:53,440
that it should not have been you and me

781
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:55,555
collecting the grain today,

782
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,355
Once the person
who's supposed to collect the grain arrives,

783
00:41:58,075 --> 00:41:59,595
let alone these merchants,

784
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:01,935
not a single person

785
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:03,395
in the entire Xizhou

786
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:05,275
dares to shortchange,

787
00:42:11,435 --> 00:42:14,275
I wonder who this person is,

788
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,155
It's almost the time,
and he should be arriving soon,

789
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:22,496
Ziyu, please wait a moment,

790
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:45,600
