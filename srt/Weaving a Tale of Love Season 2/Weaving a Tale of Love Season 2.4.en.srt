<i>[Weaving A Tale of Love 2]</i>

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,808
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

3
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:48,048
My lady, this 'Five Times Picture'
is really well drawn,

4
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:50,428
People will be surprised
just by having a glimpse of it,

5
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,828
My lady, the peasants from Luoyang
have arrived,

6
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,228
They said Princess Linhai had ordered them

7
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:02,428
to come to the residence and
pay their respects to the new mistress,

8
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:06,988
Go tell them

9
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,168
the master has gone to the county office and
will not return to the residence until later,

10
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:12,948
Let them come later,

11
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:15,028
That's exactly what I told them,

12
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:16,508
But they would not listen

13
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,148
They said they must return home before noon,

14
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:19,508
otherwise the labor hours would not be enough,

15
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,248
The property in Luoyang belongs
to the young master,

16
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:24,148
and has been under the management of
Princess Linhai,

17
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:27,548
The farm owners traveled
all the way from Luoyang,

18
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:30,708
It doesn't make sense for them to travel back
without taking a rest,

19
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:33,268
It seems

20
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:34,788
it is me who they want to meet,

21
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:36,800
Fine,

22
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:41,768
Cheng, take those farm owners
to the upper yard,

23
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:45,908
L-lady, you are going to meet them on your own?

24
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:48,788
Shouyue is busy with his work,

25
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:51,428
There is no need to add to his pressure,

26
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:52,480
Yes,

27
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:58,988
Lady, where should the screen be placed?

28
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:02,848
No need for the screen, Are there any
life-extending rewards left in the palace?

29
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,148
Go and get a dozen or so,

30
00:03:04,148 --> 00:03:07,788
This isn't quite proper, is it?

31
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:11,908
That's what I intend to do,

32
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:20,416
Don't just stand there,

33
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,720
Greet the lady,

34
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,068
<i>[Luoyang Farmland, Farm owners]</i>
We, the humble ones, greet the lady,

35
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,308
<i>[Walking in Harmony and Steadfastness]</i>
Thank you for your greetings,

36
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:34,428
You all work for Linhai Princess and
are helping master take care of his estates,

37
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:36,628
According to common practice,

38
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:39,148
I am merely your landlord,

39
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,028
Liuli greets everyone here,

40
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:42,912
Landlord,

41
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,508
Ni and Xiaotan, please tie
the 'life-extending' threads for everyone,

42
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,908
It's a token of goodwill for our meeting
during the festival

43
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:53,368
These 'life-extending' colorful threads

44
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,628
are a gift from Lady Wu,

45
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:58,608
They are the best for warding off evil and
averting misfortune

46
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:01,748
What's more precious is this grace
from Lady Wu,

47
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:04,708
Let's share this joy and grace,

48
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,588
Just help yourself, You need to return back
to Luoyang after the meal

49
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:31,388
Madam has been too good,

50
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,268
We are all servants in the Pei mansion,

51
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:36,708
We don't deserve to be so well-treated,

52
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:40,188
When Lady Lu family was in charge,

53
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:42,828
she was so considerate,

54
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:45,908
We always thought that she

55
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:49,388
was the kindest and most magnanimous mistress
in this city of Chang'an,

56
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:53,228
Unexpectedly, you are even
more courteous than her,

57
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:55,828
Lady Lu is from a reputed family,

58
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,028
I am merely of humble origin,

59
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:00,508
I can't compare with her,

60
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,708
Lady Lu values reputation, but I do not,

61
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:06,828
As long as you have solid evidence,
it's OK if you tell others

62
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,548
that I'm the strictest mistress in Chang'an,

63
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:13,048
My ancestors were merchants, and I've learned
from them by observing and listening,

64
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:15,308
I can understand the accounts
for money and grain,

65
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:18,748
So if there are any problems,

66
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:21,428
just feel free to speak up to me,

67
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,908
I can distinguish right from wrong,

68
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:29,548
It would be best if you know
how a farm operates,

69
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:32,468
Lady,

70
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:36,748
the grain fields we manage
are more barren than others,

71
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:39,148
It seldom rains this year,

72
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:41,348
I'm afraid there won't be any surplus grain
to hand in,

73
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:44,508
Even the farmers will starve,

74
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:45,868
Starvation has hit

75
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,908
This is indeed unexpected

76
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:56,868
The farmers can't even feed themselves,

77
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:59,468
let alone giving surplus to the landlord,

78
00:06:00,508 --> 00:06:02,428
This is indeed too miserable,

79
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:05,948
I don't know how many farmers
there are in the manor,

80
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,348
and how much more grain is needed,

81
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,588
You can tell me,

82
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:12,268
I will allocate grain for each individual
for relief,

83
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,348
My lady, you are indeed a great benefactor,

84
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:21,628
There are four to five hundred households
with more than two thousand people,

85
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,948
So we need 700 dan of grains,

86
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:29,148
Four to five hundred households,

87
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:32,828
I didn't expect that there are so many people
in the Luoyang Manor,

88
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:34,788
May I ask you

89
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:38,268
how many acres
of fields there are in our manor?

90
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:41,440
Err,

91
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:43,508
How are we supposed to know?

92
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:48,384
Err,

93
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:56,828
So it turns out that the head of the estate

94
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:58,828
doesn't even know how many acres
of land there are in his own estate,

95
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:00,748
It's really strange news,

96
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:05,268
In that case, I am giving you a month's time,

97
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:06,428
Go back and check it clearly,

98
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:08,988
If you can't,

99
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:11,388
then I can report this to Linhai Princess

100
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:13,708
and ask her to

101
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,428
employ a group of people

102
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:17,268
that are able to answer this question
to be the heads,

103
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:19,268
Since the lady doesn't trust us,

104
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:23,048
we'll just finish tasks and go back
to the Residence of the Hedong Duke,

105
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:25,344
At least we don't have
to be ridiculed and humiliated,

106
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,508
That's right

107
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:27,588
Great,

108
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:30,748
I'm also thinking of asking the Princess Linhai
to tell me

109
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:33,368
why no head of the estate

110
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:36,148
knows how many acres of lands you have
on your own manor,

111
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,548
I have already checked the past account books,

112
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:40,028
Last year we had a good harvest,

113
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:43,708
In Luoyang, 6 kg of sorghum rice
only cost 2,5 wen,

114
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,828
Everyone knows that

115
00:07:45,828 --> 00:07:47,948
you claimed that you handed in
half of the yield,

116
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,468
or several hundred dan grains,

117
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:54,508
But just now, you tell told you have fed
more than two thousand people,

118
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:58,068
Do you mean that it takes two hundred people
to plant an acre of land in Luoyang?

119
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:06,748
I should hand you all over
to the authorities immediately,

120
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:10,308
so that you could cough up all the money
you've been embezzling over the years,

121
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,448
But I just don't want Princess Linhai
to lose face,

122
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:15,108
That's why I give you this chance,

123
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:18,108
Since you're not afraid of making a big fuss,
why should I?

124
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:21,828
It's an absolute no! If we make a big fuss,

125
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,648
Princess Linhai will never admit that

126
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:25,788
it's she who has been embezzling grains
over the years,

127
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:28,948
And we're the ones who end up
taking the blame for Princess Linhai,

128
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:37,508
In fact,

129
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,828
I don't want to force you all
into a corner either,

130
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:44,348
As I just mentioned, I know
how the farming business operates,

131
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:48,448
As you told me there are
hundreds of farming households,

132
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:51,008
I could tell that the Mr, Pei has

133
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,308
at least over a thousand acres of good land,

134
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,948
Even if it's just one thousand acres
of average land,

135
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,868
even if it's planted with
the least valuable millet,

136
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:01,828
the return won't be low, Since one dan of millet
is worth 33 meters of cloth,

137
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:05,108
As long as you can hand in
1,650 thousand meters of cloth this year,

138
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,508
I can ignore your wrongdoing in the past,

139
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:11,068
After all, it has nothing to do with me

140
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:14,868
Why should I stick to them?

141
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,348
Yes, We'll do what you say,

00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:24,256

00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,468
How come you guys are so useless?

147
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:53,448
You can't even fool a woman,

148
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:56,148
And you were even tricked by her
into signing such a contract,

149
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,028
The yields of Pei Xingjian's 12 estates
in previous years

150
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:07,228
will not be investigated,

151
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:10,748
This year, the estates shall hand in
1,650 thousand meters of cloth,

152
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:19,468
1,650 thousand meters of cloth,

153
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,708
How dare you,

154
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,788
I've never thought you have the guts,

155
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,468
Or were you bewitched by that Kudi Liuli?

156
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,268
Princess Linhai,

157
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:35,968
Lady Kudi was truly difficult to deal with,

158
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,068
We were panicked,

159
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,248
She asked for 1,650 thousand meters of cloth,

160
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:45,248
which was just 30% of the estates' income,

161
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:48,348
That will be better than if she reports that
to the authorities,

162
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:52,508
The foreign woman that Pei Xingjian has married

163
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:55,748
just met you once

164
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:59,228
and she bluntly took 30% of the annual profits,

165
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:03,148
Yet she has coaxed you into speaking for her,

166
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:07,628
Even if this matter is settled,
I cannot let go of it,

167
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,788
If I don't crack the whip,

168
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,108
she will take away even more from me,

169
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,668
More than 1,500 thousand meters of cloth,

170
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,868
Princess Linhai will not let go of you,

171
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:29,668
In the end, I am the thorn
in Princess Linhai's side,

172
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,228
Although she can steal my property

173
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,588
she can't do anything to me,

174
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:33,588
But you are different,

175
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:39,788
Have you forgotten about what happened
to Lady Qi?

176
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,548
Of course I know,

177
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:45,228
But she won't leave me alone
even if I do nothing,

178
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:49,368
The new house, the gazebo in the backyard,

179
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,308
Yunu, who plays the flute in the gazebo,

180
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:53,908
and those heads of estates who visited
when you were at work,

181
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:55,908
each of them

182
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:58,108
was meant to get me into trouble,

183
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,308
All those were supposed to be targeted at me,

184
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:02,428
She plans against you

185
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:03,908
just to get my property,

186
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,228
I said I don't care about that,

187
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:07,428
I only care about your safety,

188
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:12,208
Liuli, why would you risk your life
for worldly possessions?

189
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,548
Why put yourself in danger?

190
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:15,268
Do you think what I have done?

191
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,068
are just for worldly possessions?

192
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,628
That day when we returned home together,

193
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:21,848
you chastised Shanhu and lady Cao for me,

194
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:23,108
what was that for?

195
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,168
Was it for yourself?

196
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:26,240
I…

197
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,024
Liuli,

198
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:45,068
I know you feel aggrieved for me,

199
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,148
and you care about our future,

200
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:51,468
But I really don't want to see you
taking risks for me,

201
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,328
Alright, since you already took action today,

202
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,508
Then don't worry about the future,
You have my back,

203
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:07,748
But you must promise me one thing,

204
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:10,468
Don't act so recklessly in the future,

205
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:12,548
At least let me know in advance,

206
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,228
so that I can prepare as well,

207
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:17,988
I dared to teach them a lesson

208
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:19,868
all because you are by my side,

209
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:22,888
Having such a talented and strong husband,

210
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:23,948
what should I be afraid of?

211
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:55,628
- Master,
- Why did you come home so early today?

212
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:57,948
I noticed you've stayed indoors these days,

213
00:13:58,508 --> 00:13:59,728
I decided to come back earlier,

214
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,548
It would be better even just
to take a walk with you in the yard,

215
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,708
Isn't this the backyard?

216
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,868
Why do you paint this?

217
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:11,708
I want to make a table screen based on
the scenery of the backyard

218
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,348
How do you like it?

219
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:19,348
From pavilions and towers to flowers,
birds, fish, and insects

220
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,268
it's impressive that you remember
all of them so thoroughly,

221
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,308
My lady, the weather outside is just perfect
and the breeze is warm too,

222
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,588
Why not move this painting board
to the backyard?

223
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,468
That way, we can enjoy the spring
while painting,

224
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:35,828
Ni and Tan, help the lady move
this painting setup to the backyard,

225
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:45,788
Shouyue, I have the backyard scenery
etched in my heart,

226
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:47,068
There's no need to move there,

227
00:14:47,748 --> 00:14:50,108
But there's a place I've always wanted
to visit,

228
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:53,868
Shouyue, the weekend is coming,

229
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:56,148
would you want to go with me?

230
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:57,888
On weekend?

231
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:01,828
As long as you want to go,
I will accompany you,

232
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:06,948
I secretly asked Xiaotan,

233
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,868
She said that the lady
doesn't go to the backyard

234
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,028
just because of Yunu,

235
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,228
Yunu has been causing disturbances
in a variety of ways in recent days,

236
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,488
Wherever the lady goes, she is sure to follow,

237
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:20,188
If the lady goes to the backyard to paint,

238
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:21,628
she is sure to paint by the side,

239
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:22,988
And she keeps on talking about the late lady,

240
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:26,788
saying that the late lady sent a lot of
messages to her in dream,

241
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:28,576
The late lady said…

242
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:30,240
What did she say?

243
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:34,488
She talked about what had happened
between you two,

244
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:37,548
After hearing that,

245
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:40,468
Princess Linhai even asked Crown Prince Consort
to visit twice,

246
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:41,504
Crown Prince Consort gave a lot of gifts,

247
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:44,028
saying that

248
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,468
Yunu is the reincarnation of Lady Lu

249
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,588
and the tie between mother and daughter
should be reestablished,

250
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:52,708
It's clear that they wanted
to embarrass my lady

251
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,908
by being so nice to Yunu,

252
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:09,508
<i>Last time a slight scent led to
a rift between you two,</i>

253
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:12,068
<i>I've added so much aroma powder this time,</i>

254
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:15,068
<i>As jealous as you are, Kudi,</i>

255
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,468
<i>you must divorce master,</i>

256
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,888
<i>I won't let you live happily,</i>

257
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:22,788
<i>And I can finish what the Princess Linhai
assigned to me earlier,</i>

258
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:43,768
Hurry up, be quicker,

259
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:44,948
Yes,

260
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:45,948
Fold this one,

261
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,528
Hurry up so that the water
can be boiled quickly,

262
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:50,868
Alright,

263
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:53,508
Hurry up,

264
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,448
Give this to me, please,

265
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:59,264
- Did you finish your task?
- Yes,

266
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:00,708
Which one is the soap used by master?

267
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,148
They all look the same,

268
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:04,868
Nanny,

269
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:05,952
I am giving this to you,

270
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:09,856
Add more firewood,

271
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,028
Is the hot soup for master ready?

272
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,548
It's ready

273
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:14,588
- Come on,
- Be quick,

274
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,228
Master caught a cold yesterday,

275
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:20,068
so don't forget the ginger slices,

276
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:22,188
Ginger slices have already been prepared,

277
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:25,388
Alright, I trust you,

278
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:29,920
Hurry up,

279
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:33,668
Be quick,

280
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,212
<i>[Pei Mansion]</i>

281
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:00,148
Yunu…

282
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:06,176
Exactly,

283
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,028
- She is not one of those ordinary people,
- Right,

284
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:11,508
She really smells good,

285
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,988
Yes, Let's get back to work,

286
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,068
Look, look,

287
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:19,428
Look at her,

288
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:20,480
Congratulations to Miss Yunu,

289
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,068
Congratulations to Miss Yunu,

290
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,308
- A good thing
- Yunu,

291
00:18:31,308 --> 00:18:33,688
- will soon happen in our residence,
- Indeed,

292
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,708
Lady has heard about what happened to you,

293
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:38,548
She has something to ask you,
please come with me,

294
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:00,188
Lady, Yunu is here,

295
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,348
Lady,

296
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,308
what instructions do you have?

297
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:09,148
Everyone in the residence knows what you did,

298
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,548
How dare you pretend to be ignorant and
ask me what's going on?

299
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:16,868
You were trained by Princess Linhai,

300
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:20,108
You are supposed to be more courteous

301
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,748
and have higher self-esteem
than other servants,

302
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:23,068
But I didn't expect

303
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:26,148
you to do such disgraceful things
behind my back,

304
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,028
How am I going to explain this
to Princess Linhai,

305
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:31,508
Princess Linhai asked me to come to Pei Mansion

306
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:34,468
Just to serve madam and master,

307
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:38,028
Yunu knows it's shameful,

308
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:42,748
but please do me a favor

309
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:44,448
as master and I love each other,

310
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:49,748
A priceless treasure is easy to find, but
a man with true affection is hard to come by,

311
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:55,108
Yunu, if you have truly found someone
you can entrust your life to,

312
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,408
for the sake of the Princess Linhai's dignity,

313
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:58,908
I shall do my utmost to help you,

314
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:02,948
But do you know his true intentions?

315
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:06,988
And how can you be sure he's not
flirting with you?

316
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:08,828
Madam, please,

317
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:12,708
Not only me, everyone in Pei Mansion now knows

318
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,108
he smells like you,

319
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,468
Were there any intimacies between you two?

320
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:31,548
Master, if you just stay here,

321
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:33,028
the misunderstanding can't be removed,

322
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:37,228
I already asked him, do you know what he said?

323
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,228
I don't know,

324
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:40,388
He swore an oath,

325
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:43,548
saying he has nothing to do with you,
and he is completely innocent,

326
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:47,588
You tell me, should I believe you or him?

327
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:53,428
I dare not lie,

328
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:56,508
If your words are true

329
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,188
and you insist on entrusting him
with your life,

330
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,348
then I will have to report this
to Princess Linhai

331
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,032
and fulfill your wishes,

332
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:17,188
How can you believe her one-sided statement,
my lady?

333
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:20,028
You'd better ask her

334
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,108
to get a whole and accurate picture,

335
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:26,868
Yunu, tell me, where does the scent come from?

336
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:30,868
It's natural scent,

337
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:32,468
So it's unique

338
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,188
Princess Linhai and Madam Crown Prince

339
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:37,028
also know about this,

340
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:44,308
When and where did you fall in love?
Is there any evidence?

341
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:47,548
The night when madam was with Princess Linhai
at the Buddhist Hall,

342
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:52,268
Yunu heard that Master and Cheng were going
to spend the night in the county office,

343
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,588
I was deeply concerned,

344
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,348
so I took food and drink to the county office,

345
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,308
It rained heavily,

346
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,668
so I stayed overnight there,

347
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:09,188
No wonder when Cheng returned to the residence
the next day,

348
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:11,668
I could smell the scent of Yunu on him,

349
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,856
I'll ask you again,

350
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:16,708
is that really your natural scent,

351
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:20,428
or is it merely the scent of aroma powder

352
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:21,828
which can be bought with money?

353
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,428
This indeed is my natural scent,

354
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:28,008
If madam does not believe it,

355
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,068
you can ask Princess Linhai for confirmation,

356
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:34,928
Shouyue, the fact is right before our eyes,

357
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:36,148
Do you have anything to say?

358
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:45,952
Cheng,

359
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,148
You've heard what Yunu said,

360
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:50,988
and do you have anything to say?

361
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:55,188
<i>Cheng, what does that have to do with him?</i>

362
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:56,788
Master, madam,

363
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:00,328
Cheng maintains his integrity and would never
dare to engage in clandestine affairs,

364
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,068
let alone having sex with a girl,

365
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:07,628
please uphold justice for me and
restore my reputation,

366
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:10,308
Yunu was trained by Princess Linhai,

367
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:13,128
If it were not for you,

368
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:14,228
how could she, a courteous girl,

369
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:22,368
damage her own reputation?

370
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,508
Cheng, what's going on? What has this to do
with Cheng?

371
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:28,688
Cheng, if you dare to deceive and betray Yunu,

372
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:31,108
I will hand you over to Princess Linhai,

373
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:33,708
You should think carefully
about what to do next,

374
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:37,632
Madam, please spare me!

375
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:43,308
Madam, please forgive me

376
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:45,388
if I offended you in the past,

377
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:48,308
I will never dare to hide anything from you,

378
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:52,788
Master, everything I did was for you,

379
00:23:53,628 --> 00:23:57,488
Please,

380
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:58,948
don't get me into trouble,

381
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:16,628
Where is the scent coming from?

382
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:18,708
I was just looking for you

383
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,828
What happened?

384
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:21,508
After I bathed last night,

385
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:22,948
the scent didn't fade, but grew even stronger,

386
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:27,728
Come on, everyone come take a sniff,

387
00:24:27,728 --> 00:24:29,468
- Stop!
- Come take a sniff, come on,

388
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,568
Stop it,

389
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:32,648
Come take a sniff, come on,

390
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:33,688
Come on,

391
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:36,068
Isn't this the scent of Yunu?

392
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:37,952
That's right, this is the scent of Yunu,

393
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:39,008
- I have smelled it before,
- You…

394
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:40,508
Yes, exactly, it's Yunu's scent,

395
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:42,668
Isn't it?

396
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:44,788
Madam Crown Prince also asked Yunu,

397
00:24:44,788 --> 00:24:46,548
And Yunu said

398
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:48,388
it's her natural scent,

399
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,148
body scent,

400
00:24:50,148 --> 00:24:51,468
- Body scent,
- Body scent,

401
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:53,488
So there is such a thing as body scent,

402
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:55,228
How come you smell like Yunu?

403
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:57,388
What is the relationship between you two?

404
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:59,188
Alright, alright, what kind of relationship
can we have?

405
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:01,188
Don't talk nonsense,
We have no relationship at all,

406
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:02,348
Don't believe her,

407
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:04,748
Cheng

408
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:07,548
Everyone in the residence has smelled
the scent of Yunu on you,

409
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:09,108
What else can you say?

410
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,788
Yunu, such a beautiful and delicate girl,
is fond of you,

411
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:14,788
and madam intends to bring you two together,

412
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:16,748
Why not accept her kindness?

413
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:21,988
It's a mistake, it must be a mistake,

414
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:28,308
This is definitely a mistake,

415
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:30,388
How could this be wrong?

416
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:32,028
You just admitted it frankly,

417
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:33,628
Everyone heard it loud and clear,

418
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:34,628
I am wronged,

419
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:37,668
Madam,

420
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:40,108
I firstly got the scent

421
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,148
after I had touched the things brought by Yunu

422
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:44,708
at the county office,

423
00:25:45,348 --> 00:25:47,728
So I s-suspect…

424
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:49,068
Say it,

425
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:51,948
I suspect it was Yunu who
deliberately framed me,

426
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,868
I don't believe there's such thing as
body scent,

427
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,868
Do you think you're a cow or sheep

428
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:00,868
which is full of a foul smell
that can't be washed off?

429
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:05,248
You're talking nonsense, I was sent by
Princess Linhai,

430
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:07,228
How could I ever fancy a servant like you?

431
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:09,628
And why would I go through all the trouble
to marry you?

432
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:13,388
Now you're calling me a servant, huh?

433
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,988
Then why did you say we were in love

434
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:20,788
before master and madam?

435
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,868
And why did you kneel to beg madam to
do you a favor?

436
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:25,888
Everybody heard what you said,

437
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:28,068
Now, you are calling me servant,

438
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:30,788
Okay, stop it,

439
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:35,088
Ni and Xiaotan, you two go to Yunu's room

440
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:36,968
to check if there is anything
with the same scent,

441
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:39,828
If there is not, that proves
what you said is true,

442
00:26:39,828 --> 00:26:40,868
Yunu, rest assured,

443
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:44,788
Madam and I will make sure that Cheng
takes his responsibility,

444
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:21,152
Found it,

445
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:30,268
Really impressive, she almost had us fooled,

446
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:37,208
Exactly,

447
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:40,068
Master, just now Xiaotan and I

448
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:42,048
have had the maids in the residence check it,

449
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:44,108
Everyone said this aroma powder

450
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,588
smells just like Yunu,

451
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:47,668
There can be no mistake,

452
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,468
So it's the scent of this aroma powder,

453
00:27:54,228 --> 00:27:55,308
Isn't she deceiving people?

454
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:02,428
Yunu, why did you frame me?

455
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:07,108
Madam and master, please restore my reputation,

456
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:11,308
The scent is indeed special,

457
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:13,348
It can't be bought in Chang'an,

458
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:15,588
Only then dare you falsely claim it to be
your natural body scent,

459
00:28:16,668 --> 00:28:17,948
But as the saying goes,

460
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:21,948
if you don't want others to know,
you shouldn't do it,

461
00:28:22,592 --> 00:28:23,712
But you were mad at strange scent

462
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:25,748
on master's body,

463
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:31,568
<i>So they set up a trap intentionally</i>

464
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:32,668
<i>so that I could take action,</i>

465
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:35,868
<i>And then they replaced the scented soup
with Cheng's,</i>

466
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:39,628
<i>How stupid I am to fall for their trap,</i>

467
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:51,908
The fire is still not hot enough, Hurry up!

468
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:10,388
Princess Linhai always manages family strictly
and treats people fairly and justly

469
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:13,588
She won't keep such a wicked maid
at her house either,

470
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,296
<i>[Residence of the Hedong Duke]</i>

471
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:31,148
That's it, princess Linhai,

472
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,268
Do you still remember that day?

473
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:39,428
when you smelled the scent on Yunu, Lady Cui?

474
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:41,308
You even asked where the scent came from,

475
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:42,828
What did Yunu say?

476
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:48,668
She said the scent was her natural,

477
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:51,308
Ni, present the aroma powder box to lady Cui,

478
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:53,228
That was found in Yunu's room,

479
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:57,228
Lady Cui, does this smell like

480
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,588
the scent you smelled that day?

481
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:12,708
Madam, please don't make it any difficult
for me,

482
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:17,068
How can I still remember the scent I smelled
a few days ago?

483
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:21,788
It doesn't matter if you can't remember,
I have brought the people anyway,

484
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:25,468
Yunu and the other two witnesses
are outside now,

485
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:30,388
Princess Linhai, if you don't believe me,
just call the people in and ask,

486
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,048
Follow me,

487
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:40,828
Princess Linhai only asked Yunu to come in,

488
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:50,508
Madam said don't acknowledge it anyway,

489
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,308
Princess Linhai will support you

490
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:11,268
Yunu, do you have an explanation
for what Madam Kudi said?

491
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:13,428
Princess Linhai,

492
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:17,268
although there is a huge misunderstanding,

493
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:21,228
I indeed made a mistake,

494
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:24,588
So I won't argue and am willing
to accept any punishment,

495
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:28,228
But Princess Linhai, please give me
one more chance,

496
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:32,248
I will never fail to meet your expectations,

497
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:36,168
Misunderstanding? The whole thing
is crystal clear,

498
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:37,228
Where does the misunderstanding come from?

499
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:38,908
Or the person you wanted to frame

500
00:31:39,828 --> 00:31:43,228
was not Cheng?

501
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:47,488
Yunu,

502
00:31:48,268 --> 00:31:51,148
I'll ask you again in front of Princess Linhai,

503
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,468
Is it that the person you wanted to frame
was someone else?

504
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:57,948
Was it Shouyue?

505
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,228
Madam, Yunu dare not to do so,

506
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:04,548
Princess Linhai, it's all Yunu's fault,

507
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,788
Please give me a second chance

508
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:07,808
to make up for the fault with merit,

509
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:16,828
Cui, it was you who chose Yunu,

510
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:20,588
Now that a mistake has been made,
what do you think should be done?

511
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:25,388
As daughter-in-law, I chose the wrong person

512
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:28,028
and let madam down,

513
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:31,568
I'm guilty, I'm not afraid of any punishment,

514
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:35,288
Yunu, I had high expectations for you,

515
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,668
but you are so incompetent,

516
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:41,148
So you tell me, how should I give you
a second chance?

517
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:43,968
Why should I give you a chance?

518
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:47,264
I beg for Princess Linhai's mercy,
I will not dare to cross the line again

519
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:49,588
I will certainly serve master and madam well,

520
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,828
What are you asking me for?

521
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:55,888
I have long since given you
to Shouyue and his wife,

522
00:32:55,888 --> 00:32:57,988
They are your master and mistress,

523
00:32:58,748 --> 00:33:00,168
Now that you have made a mistake,

524
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:03,588
whether to beat, to kill, to send away,
or to sell you,

525
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:07,268
it should be up to your mistress to decide,

526
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:17,668
Yu Nu is favored by the Madam
all because of Lady Luqi,

527
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:22,028
How about, how about we let Yunu stay
at Pei Mansion

528
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:26,548
to recite scriptures and pray for Lady Luqi,
This way her soul can obtain salvation,

529
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:32,028
and madam can feel assured,

530
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,428
Yunu, is that Okay?

531
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,388
Thank you, Princess Linhai, Thank you, madam,

532
00:33:45,348 --> 00:33:49,408
I must confess, the reason why
I'm particularly fond of Yunu

533
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:51,068
is because

534
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:54,988
she bears a striking resemblance
to my adopted daughter, Luqi,

535
00:33:56,188 --> 00:34:00,308
She reminds me of my adopted daughter,

536
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:05,068
If you can understand the love I have
for my daughter,

537
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:08,868
spare her this time,

538
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:12,488
Once we retrieve her slave deed,

539
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:15,068
we can sell her off to a distant place,

540
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:19,948
By then, she is out of sight, out of mind,

541
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:06,752
What are you doing?

542
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:10,108
This is the breakfast specially prepared
for you by Master,

543
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,588
These were the favorite dishes of Lady Luqi
when she was alive,

544
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,568
Eat quickly; after you finish, I must go
and report back immediately,

545
00:35:15,568 --> 00:35:16,608
I have to finish them!?

546
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:28,628
<i>[In memory of the late Lady Luqi ]</i>
Yunu, this ancestral hall

547
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,928
is the most sacred place in our residence,

548
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,268
Normally, we are not allowed
to enter it without permission,

549
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:37,028
Today, master has specifically ordered
to let you clean it,

550
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:38,656
I?

551
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,308
You know what? This ancestral hall

552
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,948
was personally taken care of by Lady Luqi,

553
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:47,048
Today, master has entrusted
this important task to you,

554
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:48,348
This means he trusts you,

555
00:35:49,588 --> 00:35:51,268
Yet you speak such words,
you are truly letting him down,

556
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:52,288
Stop it,

557
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,948
I will do it,

558
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:56,960
Come in

559
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:05,068
Master has really paid
special attention to you,

560
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:08,428
He ordered me to fetch Lady Luqi's
favorite Buddhist scriptures

561
00:36:08,428 --> 00:36:10,148
for you to study and copy them every day,

562
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:13,268
<i>[Sukhavativyuha Sutra, Volume One]</i>
Start with this book,

563
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:23,788
What are you waking me so early for?

564
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:27,168
In order to help you better clean
the ancestral hall,

565
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:29,632
master wants you to exercise every morning,

566
00:36:29,632 --> 00:36:30,648
What?

567
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:33,348
Start with standing still for two hours
each day,

568
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:41,152
<i>[The spiritual tablets of lady Lu
and Mr, Pei Renji]</i>

569
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:56,668
Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me,

570
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:24,168
She has to stand for two hours
early in the morning,

571
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:26,788
clean the ancestral hall after breakfast,

572
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:29,228
and copy Buddhist scriptures in the afternoon,

573
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:32,428
In the evening, she needs to drink
the medicinal tonic we prepare for her,

574
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:34,408
She is unable to rest from morning till night,

575
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:37,128
Madam, you should see her,

576
00:37:37,128 --> 00:37:38,888
She appears extremely reluctant,

577
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:41,088
but she has no other choice,

578
00:37:41,088 --> 00:37:43,128
Her face turns red with anger every day,

579
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,428
It's really satisfying,

580
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:47,548
Hand me that spool of blue silk thread,

581
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:52,728
This is master's good move
to control the enemy,

582
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,268
Yunu should behave herself for some days

583
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:57,468
and dare not to cause any trouble,

584
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:03,908
Madam, why are you still hiding here?

585
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,908
Why not let Xiaotan accompany you
for a walk in the garden?

586
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:11,048
I have stayed indoors for the last few days
not because I was hiding from her,

587
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:13,228
but because I wanted to finish
this table screen quickly,

588
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,668
I was sent by Princess Linhai,

589
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:26,656
How dare you stop me,

590
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:30,188
I apologize, but master

591
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:31,908
thinks it is unsafe for you to go out alone,

592
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:35,388
so he says he will accompany you,

593
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:38,368
Master is busy, how does he have the time
to accompany me?

594
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:40,568
Even if he is busy, he still has days off,

595
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,600
Just wait patiently,

596
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:44,648
The weekend is on tomorrow,

597
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:46,068
Can't I all today?

598
00:38:47,388 --> 00:38:48,488
I just remembered that

599
00:38:48,488 --> 00:38:51,568
master has already made plans for this weekend,

600
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:53,148
He has to enjoy the spring outdoors with lady,

601
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,728
How about you wait for another ten days

602
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:59,508
and see if he has time to accompany you,

603
00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:08,108
The weekend,

604
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:28,832
My lady,

605
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:34,048
tomorrow is weekend,

606
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:36,640
You promised to go out with me,
do you still have time?

607
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,588
Have you been bored at home these days?

608
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,148
Don't worry,

609
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,028
When have I ever failed to keep my promise?

610
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:49,748
I just need the help of your skillful hands,

611
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:51,808
What is it?

612
00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:54,908
I wanted to do it myself,

613
00:39:55,548 --> 00:39:57,588
That's why I've stayed so late
at the county office,

614
00:39:58,348 --> 00:40:00,068
But alas, no matter what, I can't do it well,

615
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:02,928
Then I think of my lady,

616
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:06,108
the great Kudi who once headed
the Bureau of Garment,

617
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:11,368
who has peerless exquisite craftsmanship,

618
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,588
Across the Tang Dynasty…

619
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:14,988
Alright, alright, stop flattering me,

620
00:40:14,988 --> 00:40:16,588
That must be really hard,

621
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:18,028
Not many things can stump you,

622
00:40:18,028 --> 00:40:19,136
What would you like me to do?

623
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:21,508
I will have a try once we return
back home tomorrow,

624
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:25,828

<i>[Walking in Harmony and Steadfastness]</i>

626
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:46,908
Ni and Xiaotan, have you got everything?

627
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,628
Madam,

628
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:51,228
the wine, dishes, and pastries are all ready,

629
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:54,112
- Give it to me,
- Liuli,

630
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,188
where exactly are you taking me to?

631
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:59,248
Shouyue, I've wanted to go there with you
for a long time,

632
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,728
Unfortunately, we've never had the time,

633
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:02,308
Today is just the right opportunity,

634
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:04,948
It's also a chance to fulfill
a long-held wish of mine,

635
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:10,908
Yunu pays her respects to the master and madam,

636
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:12,528
It seems that

637
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:15,028
master is taking madam out to enjoy
the spring day,

638
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:18,028
How improper! It's none of your business,

639
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:21,268
Princess Linhai asked me to stay in residence

640
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:22,888
and recite sutras for lady Lu,

641
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:25,388
I dare not neglect my duties,

642
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:29,388
Master, you probably forgot that today
is the death anniversary of the late madam,

643
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,928
You are living happily with madam and

644
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,148
even forgot the death anniversary
of the late madam,

645
00:41:36,948 --> 00:41:40,028
Aren't you afraid the late madam cannot
rest in peace?

646
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:42,068
At the break of dawn,

647
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:44,708
master already paid homage to the late madam
in the ancestral hall,

648
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:46,488
You don't have to meddle in these affairs

649
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:49,288
Master is deeply affectionate and righteous
enough to mourn your deceased wife,

650
00:41:49,288 --> 00:41:51,068
which is a matter that is just and honorable,

651
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:52,588
Why must it be done at the break of dawn?

652
00:41:57,668 --> 00:42:00,348
Maybe you just don't want to hurt
madam's feelings,

653
00:42:00,948 --> 00:42:02,188
I'm really being meddlesome,

654
00:42:03,508 --> 00:42:06,508
Shouyue is just about to take me
to pay respects at the grave of Lady Lu,

655
00:42:06,508 --> 00:42:09,028
We are treating it seriously,

656
00:42:10,348 --> 00:42:11,888
Aren't you going to go on an outing?

657
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:13,988
In order to prepare offerings for lady Lu,

658
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:15,608
madam have worked hard

659
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:18,528
to embroider the scenery she loved most
stitch by stitch,

660
00:42:18,528 --> 00:42:20,628
How could you possibly understand this?

661
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:23,228
Do you think lady stays behind closed doors
because she is afraid of you?

662
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:24,896
What a joke,

663
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,808
Yunu, you mention the late madam
every single day,

664
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:37,948
yet you have never even visited her grave,
have you?

<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>

697
00:45:08,736 --> 00:45:12,288
<i>♫ Remembrance of past things ♫</i>

698
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:15,552
<i>♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫</i>

699
00:45:15,552 --> 00:45:18,560
<i>♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫</i>

700
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,952
<i>♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫</i>

701
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:25,344
<i>♫ Winter comes again, and flowers wither ♫</i>

702
00:45:25,344 --> 00:45:28,192
<i>♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫</i>

703
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:31,936
<i>♫ I look outside, like the poems asking ♫</i>

704
00:45:31,936 --> 00:45:37,120
<i>♫ My love, have you
found someone good for you ♫</i>
