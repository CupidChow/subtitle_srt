00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:39,808
[Pei's Mansion]

4
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,880
Our lady gets a cold every winter

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,920
after she got ill in the first Xianqing Year.

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,160
The sickness took a serious toll on her

7
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,660
and she never recovered.

8
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,360
This autumn is much colder than before.

9
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,540
We must be careful.

10
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,780
I'm sure she can slowly recover.

11
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,860
But I'm really worried.

12
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,640
Cheng and I have Kai'er and Ye'er.

13
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,420
You and Physician Han have Fei.

14
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,380
But our lady still hasn't given birth.

15
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,340
Thankfully, Master doesn't mind it.

16
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,540
But all those noble ladies in Xizhou

17
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,140
have been eyeing her position.

18
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,900
Our lady is getting better every year.

19
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,820
Maybe she will be fully recovered soon.

20
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,620
Right now,

21
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,180
you've become a known gynecologist in Xizhou.

22
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,020
Your words are reassuring.

23
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,860
My lady, what's on your mind?

24
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,300
Master will be back tomorrow.

25
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,660
They'll back tomorrow?

26
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,940
Not the day after tomorrow?

27
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,380
I'm sure it's tomorrow. I've been counting.

28
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,408
I see. If Cheng knew that someone had been

29
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:38,980
counting the days to wait for him,

30
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,180
he'd be so happy.

31
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,460
Stop making fun of your maid, my lady.

32
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,980
Why did you call yourself a "maid" again?

33
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,580
Cheng is well respected in Xizhou now.

34
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,900
He wouldn't like it.

35
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,952
He dares not.

36
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,720
You and Master signed the paper to set us free.

37
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,640
Otherwise, Cheng, Ni, and I are still slaves.

38
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,100
Cheng and I will be grateful for life.

39
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,920
Why did you bring it up again?

40
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,620
It's all because we're in Xizhou.

41
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,660
The social hierarchy is strict in Chang'an.

42
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,780
It wouldn't be easy to exempt you

43
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,900
from slavery.

44
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,740
My lady, let's go inside.

45
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,500
Ni just made the medicine.
Have it before it turns cold.

46
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,980
The medicine may be bitter,

47
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,500
but it does you good.

48
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,420
You've grown better year on year.

49
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,900
I hope you're fine this year.

50
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,840
Silly me.

51
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,220
I forgot about the invitation.

52
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:21,060
[To Chancellor's Wife From Madam Qi]

53
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,540
It's for tomorrow.

54
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,780
Madam Qi's maid said they'd be waiting

55
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,100
for your kind reply.

56
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,380
Tell her that I appreciate it
and I will visit them.

57
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,400
My lady, you...

58
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,100
They'll eat me alive or something?

59
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,820
I'd like to see what they're up to.

60
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,020
My lady, Master is back.

61
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,208
Honey.

62
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,780
You're back early.

63
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,460
I thought you'd be back tomorrow.

64
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,020
You're starting to take medicine.

65
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,980
Have you taken it today?

66
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,220
Ni wouldn't forget it. I just had it.

67
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,700
You're much better. Your hands are less cold.

68
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,980
How about Yunyi? Did she have fun?

69
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,240
Chongyu drove a black fox to her

70
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,980
just to please her, and she's been

71
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,980
bragging about it for days.

72
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,820
Remember to praise her later.

73
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,540
I was worried when she married Chongyu

74
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,740
as a consort.

75
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,820
But he's been doting on her.

76
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,640
In Xizhou, only she can
go hunting with her husband.

77
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,700
How come?

78
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,860
Don't exclude yourself.

79
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,100
I'll take you with us once you recover.

80
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,048
Mind the steps.

81
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,672
Come.

82
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,440
Master, my lady, look.

83
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,820
Master caught a fox and here's the fox skin.

84
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,580
It's top-quality.
There's also wolf, hare, and otter skin.

85
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:09,420
So pretty.

86
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,464
Sister.

87
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:13,860
Sister, look.

88
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,900
I caught a black fox on my own.

89
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,128
A black fox.

90
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,980
Here.

91
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,100
This is rare.

92
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,460
I've been hunting a lot.

93
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,980
But I've never seen a black fox.

94
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,420
Once I caught it, I told Chongyu

95
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,480
that only you deserved it. Please accept it.

96
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,060
Only I deserve it? Don't say that.

97
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,940
Others may hear you.

98
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,920
Yunyi, did Madam Qi
tell you about the gathering

99
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,340
at your place tomorrow?

100
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,800
I got changed and came right here.

101
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,200
Nobody mentioned anything.

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,080
I don't like those gatherings.

103
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,840
I'd rather stay in and do nothing

104
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,940
than sit there and talk to those people.

105
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,860
Liuli is invited.

106
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,500
Keep her company.

107
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,900
I bet it has something to do with you.

108
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,620
I haven't spoken to them for six months.

109
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,700
What makes you say that?

110
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,380
Come, let me explain.

111
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,728
Sit, sister.

112
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,260
Tell me. What happened?

113
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,700
Actually, it's nothing.

114
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,160
You know Madam Zhang.

115
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,040
Some days ago, she visited me and implied that

116
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,140
a couple must have children.

117
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,900
So I should find Shouyue
a second wife or a consort

118
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,696
so that we have children.

119
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:39,104
I turned her down.

120
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,180
I bet Madam Qi intended to

121
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,020
close the deal
before you return from the hunting.

122
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,420
But you came back early.

123
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,340
Madam Zhang has nothing to do

124
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,060
and comes to harass you?

125
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Six months ago, she came to me

126
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,840
and kept implying that

127
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,340
women should be magnanimous
and think for their husbands.

128
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,160
Chongyu is of high status.

129
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,540
So he needs a noble lady

130
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,860
to help with daily affairs.

131
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,300
What did you say?

132
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,060
I said, "Are you trying to marry Chongyu?"

133
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,720
Madam Zhang got enraged and shouted,

134
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,220
"What nonsense!"

135
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,140
I said, "Then why are you pointing fingers?

136
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,176
Don't you have

137
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:23,220
anything else to do?"

138
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,140
I told Chongyu about it.

139
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,420
And he praised me.

140
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,660
He told me not to show any mercy

141
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,380
to those rude people even if they're seniors.

142
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,220
Only someone as fearless as you

143
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,460
can handle them.

144
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,340
Sister, are you worried about
running into Madam Zhang

145
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,780
at the gathering tomorrow?

146
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,260
I'll keep you company.

147
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,660
Thank you in advance.

148
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,620
Rest assured.

149
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,220
I won't let anyone bully you.

150
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,848
[Pei's Mansion]

151
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,380
I don't get it.

152
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,540
Yunyi is too bold

153
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,740
to care about Madam Qi and Madam Zhang.

154
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,180
But why doesn't Minister Qu contain her?

155
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,140
It's not ideal for Yunyi to offend Madam Qi.

156
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,900
Do you know what Madam Qi
and Madam Zhang are up to?

157
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,540
I have no idea.

158
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,100
They used to nag Yunyi.

159
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,860
There's nothing I can do about it.

160
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,940
For some reason,

161
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,620
they're trying to tame me now.

162
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,460
Governor Qu is not well

163
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,180
and has skipped the hunting twice.

164
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,420
What does it

165
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,260
have to do with us?

166
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,420
All noble families are alike.

167
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,420
There's nothing they won't do
to keep the family thriving.

168
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,740
The Zhang and Qi families

169
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,460
from Dunhuang used to be
the most powerful in Xizhou.

170
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,820
They have held political marriages
with the Qu family for generations.

171
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,420
They used to control

172
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,060
the entire Gaochang
from the local officials to noble families.

173
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,220
But time has changed.

174
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,580
Governor Qu employed

175
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,780
his acquaintances in major positions
when he was in power.

176
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,540
But if anything happens to him,

177
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,340
what should they do?

178
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,540
The minister never took in consorts,

179
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
except for Yunyi.

180
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,960
They've been trying
to force someone else upon Chongyu

181
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,080
but to no avail.

182
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,500
Governor Qu is not feeling well.

183
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,580
I bet they're anxious.

184
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,660
That's why they're trying to pressure Yunyi.

185
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,620
No wonder Chongyu

186
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,860
wants Yunyi to teach them a lesson.

187
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,300
They're coming after me

188
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,980
as a second option.

189
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,020
What? I'm the second option?

190
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,688
You got me wrong.

191
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,940
To them,

192
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,380
a sickling like me is the second option.

193
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,512
Don't talk nonsense.

194
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm just saying.

195
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
Still, you haven't told me

196
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,500
what they're up to.

197
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,820
You know that

198
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Su Haizheng got promoted.

199
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,740
I bet the Qu family got the tips some days ago.

200
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,820
They must be assuming

201
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,380
that I'll take over Xizhou.

202
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,620
The minister doesn't play along.

203
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,740
So they're trying to pressure you.

204
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,320
No wonder
those snobbish noble ladies are suddenly

205
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,740
concerned about me.

206
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,500
So it's because you might be the next Governor.

207
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,100
That's right. I have no family background.

208
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,780
Neither do I have any children.

209
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,180
So I'm easy to manipulate.

210
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,660
Neither of us is in perfect condition.

211
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,820
Let's recover first.

212
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,660
Then there's nothing to worry about.

213
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,900
[Protector-General's Mansion]

214
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,460
The price is quite acceptable. It's a harvest.

215
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,980
The price is 20% lower.

216
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,540
But we haven't heard anything

217
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,020
from the Western Regions.

218
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,220
Can we make it?

219
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,900
It's not easy to purchase 50,000 dan of grains.

220
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,020
It's a harvest this year.

221
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,940
We have about 100,000 dan of local grains.

222
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,220
Why go somewhere else?

223
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,940
Don't worry, Sanniang.

224
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,860
I'm telling you this because I have a plan.

225
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,632
I pay my respect.

226
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:16,096
Shouyue.

227
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,400
The war in Gaogouli is still ongoing.

228
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,260
Will we wage wars
against the Western Regions this year?

229
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,100
There won't be any huge turbulence
in the Western Regions yet.

230
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,220
But with those Turpan troops lurking around,

231
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,300
small disturbances are inevitable.

232
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,320
It's all about how
the Chief Administrator Su Haizheng

233
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,860
does his job.

234
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,380
Chongyu, if you were him,

235
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,340
would you prefer to stay in Xizhou
or to return to the capital?

236
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,620
Remember, once the war starts,

237
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,540
they will get provisions and loot everyone.

238
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,860
Makes sense.

239
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,820
I'll leave Your Excellencies to talk.

240
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,240
You seem alert.

241
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,100
But don't you know that
you're the most wanted man in Xizhou?

242
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,220
But seeing what you
and your wife are capable of,

243
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,660
I don't believe those women

244
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,060
could do anything to hurt you.

245
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,020
I'm not worried about those women.

246
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,820
They can't even deal with Yunyi,

247
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,900
let alone Liuli.

248
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,900
But things are different now.

249
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,180
You're from the Qu family.

250
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,660
They'd be glad if they could force you

251
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,660
to accept their daughters.

252
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,260
But they wouldn't

253
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,500
get offended if it didn't work.

254
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,312
But it's different with me.

255
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm an outsider to begin with.

256
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,460
Plus, I've been setting up schools,

257
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,980
making tax regulations,
and building trade routes.

258
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,860
None of those pleases them.

259
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,980
Since they can't win me over,

260
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,860
they'd try to drive me away

261
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,260
from the position of Governor.

262
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,900
They have no idea.

263
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,140
You had no power or helpers back then.

264
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,700
I tried my best but couldn't deal with you.

265
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,480
And now, with your reputation,

266
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,340
if you say that the Governor
has committed treason,

267
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,500
I bet 30,000 people

268
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,580
would follow you into the Governor's mansion.

269
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,740
And the rest 10,000
would stand by and watch it happen.

270
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,220
Those stupid noble families must be crazy

271
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,140
to go against you.

272
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,540
You've got some nerves.

273
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,860
Lady Jing, it's been so long. I'm glad I came.

274
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,940
I'm not.

275
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,560
If I knew you'd be here,

276
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,100
I wouldn't have come
to waste my time with these people.

277
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,420
I really appreciate it.

278
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,464
Madam Qi.

279
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,140
I came along for a visit. Please don't mind me.

280
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:38,656
[Madam Qi's little sister]

281
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:40,800
[Madam Guo, Advisor's wife]

282
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,120
What a distinguished guest.

283
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,840
You rarely attend our gatherings

284
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,900
despite all the invitations.

285
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,300
What an honor that

286
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,940
you're visiting us today.

287
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm flattered. I love gatherings.

288
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,900
My sister is coming today.
Of course, I have to come along

289
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,780
so that nobody talks nonsense to offend her.

290
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:06,400
[Madam Wei, Advisor's wife]

291
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,060
What would you like to drink?

292
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,740
The osmanthus wine
Chongyu brought was kind of nice.

293
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,960
What a lady hero.

294
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,740
She's asking for liquor before we sit.

295
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,360
No wonder only you could

296
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,060
join men for the hunting throughout Xizhou.

297
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,300
You want to go hunting?

298
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,020
Tell the advisor to take you with him.

299
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,780
It's just that you can't shower every day.

300
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,140
The rest is just fine.

301
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,740
Normally, it wouldn't have bothered me.

302
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,020
But Su Haizheng was appointed

303
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,340
the Commander.

304
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,020
If I'm right,

305
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,660
he's going to
demonstrate his power in Xizhou first.

306
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,100
If we face enemies on all fronts once again

307
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,780
like what has happened,

308
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,400
will you be able to

309
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,260
sabotage Su Ziyu's plan?

310
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,536
I'm positive.

311
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,296
Good.

312
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,620
Senior Official Pei,
Governor Qu invites you over.

313
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,340
I'm afraid my father wants to talk about
what has been bothering you.

314
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,220
Good luck.

315
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,580
Thank you, Minister.

316
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,592
Farewell.

317
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,340
I pay my respect, Senior Official Pei.

318
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,300
Minniang is the daughter of my acquaintance.

319
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,620
I heard she's good at making tea.

320
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,760
I just obtained some nice tea

321
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,060
and invited you over to enjoy it.

322
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,380
These are precious tea leaves.

323
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,380
I've been thinking and I'm afraid that

324
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,840
she's the only one in Xizhou

325
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,700
who can bring out its aroma.

326
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,740
That's why I invited her.

327
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,860
Madam Kudi,
you've been here for seven or eight years,

328
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,500
but you haven't aged a bit.

329
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,940
I bet life has been easy for you.
We're so jealous.

330
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,784
I'm flattered.

331
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,300
I'm just too lazy to meddle with things.

332
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,660
Everyone in Xizhou knows how blessed you are.

333
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,680
People like us have to worry about our children

334
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,320
and our husbands all the time.

335
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,660
We only wish for a peaceful life.

336
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,980
And we're hanging in there.

337
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,260
But Madam Kudi is truly in peace.

338
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,060
People lead different lives.

339
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,360
She bears no ill will.

340
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,900
Please don't mind my sister-in-law.

341
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,700
In fact, we're all

342
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,860
jealous of you.

343
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,760
To be honest,

344
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,180
I'm very jealous.

345
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,020
It looks like I'm doing well, but who knows?

346
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,180
I'd be really lucky if I could

347
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,900
die before Governor Qu.

348
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Otherwise,

349
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,620
I have to count on
my in-laws and nephews for a living.

350
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,580
I made Longevity Green Tea.

351
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,700
May you be healthy, Governor.

352
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,140
Alright.

353
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,340
May you gain recognition, Chancellor.

354
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,856
Try it.

355
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,420
Shouyue, how do you like it?

356
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,352
Great tea.

357
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,020
Shouyue,

358
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,860
Minniang may look young,

359
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,860
but she's over 20.

360
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,700
To be honest, I've been worried about her.

361
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,700
Her father was from
the Zhang family in Dunhuang,

362
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,460
and he used to be my best friend.

363
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,100
Unfortunately, he died in the war
in the 14th year of Zhenguan.

364
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,100
Shouyue, to tell you the truth.

365
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,180
My days are coming to an end.

366
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,780
The imperial court

367
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,740
will most likely entrust Xizhou to you.

368
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,780
What you've done here

369
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,180
in the past eight years is well-recognized.

370
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,300
Xizhou is prosperous and peaceful

371
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,460
thanks to you.

372
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,020
It'd be a blessing for the people

373
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,700
to have you as the governor.

374
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340
Rest assured, Madam.

375
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,940
The governor loves you wholeheartedly.

376
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,620
He will sort things out for you.

377
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,820
But there is nothing he can do.

378
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,580
I'm married to him.

379
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,120
Without him, or if I'm not here,

380
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,600
I'm nobody.

381
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,780
The Qu family wouldn't care about me.

382
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,920
No matter what,

383
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,140
they wouldn't let me raise their descendants.

384
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,860
Besides, even if they don't mind me,

385
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,940
how can I embarrass myself
by going to Chang'an?

386
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,540
I don't even have children...

387
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,660
What am I saying?

388
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,380
I'm sorry to disturb you.

389
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,800
You're of high status.

390
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,280
Senior Official Pei's children
are your children.

391
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,096
You have nothing to worry about.
Here's to you, Madam.

392
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,140
You are still too young

393
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,180
to worry about such a minor illness.

394
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,660
I've managed to come this far

395
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,540
thanks to your strong support.

396
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,640
I know you are just trying to comfort me.

397
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,060
No need.

398
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,380
But I will accept your gratification.

399
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,500
Shouyue, you know how many officials

400
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,260
have filed complaints
against you over the years?

401
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,260
You've been protecting me.
I won't ever forget that.

402
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,860
I'm not just protecting you.
I'm also protecting them.

403
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,100
I don't think those people

404
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,820
stand a chance against you.

405
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,680
In the end, they feel threatened

406
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,740
because you're an outsider.

407
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,100
It's not hard to solve this problem.

408
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,900
Shouyue, do you know what I mean?

409
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,980
Sister, what's wrong?

410
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,440
The osmanthus wine smells nice.
I got carried away and drank too fast.

411
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,780
Sister, please be careful.

412
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,260
The wine may smell light,
but it's really strong.

413
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,860
Have some food first.

414
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,100
Every family has its problems.

415
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,740
As mistresses,
we can't disregard the long-term concerns

416
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,300
just to enjoy the moment.

417
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,220
Plan ahead, or there will be trouble.

418
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,780
Sometimes, we should make plans.

419
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,460
Sometimes, we shouldn't
ask for things that are not meant for us.

420
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,940
We shouldn't? Why is that?

421
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,700
Madam Zhang is right.
Don't ask for things that are not meant for us.

422
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,000
People love power and wealth.

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,320
Families crave prosperity.

424
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,860
But it's never that easy.

425
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,760
It's common sense that

426
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,700
flowers bloom and wither.

427
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,220
In the end, we're all obsessed,

428
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,620
just with different things.

429
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,740
But the worst hypocrite

430
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,320
pretends to be considerate

431
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,420
only for personal gains.

432
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,820
Why do they think of others as fools?

433
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,420
I've never meant to go against anyone.

434
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,700
Nor will I become a puppet
for a stable career path.

435
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,780
Upright people have few friends.

436
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,020
The world is not black and white.

437
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,200
Why do you have to be so distant

438
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,340
and make enemies for no reason?

439
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,500
Besides, it's a critical moment.

440
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,220
Su Haizheng was made the Commander.

441
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,440
Hasn't it

442
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,860
crossed your mind
that you may be an easy target for them?

443
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,980
Of course, it has.

444
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,860
I've been thinking about it these days.

445
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,140
But there are things I can't do even if

446
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,340
I'll face enemies on all fronts later.

447
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,800
Shouyue, I'm not asking you

448
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,120
to accept their money

449
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,380
or promote their family members.

450
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm only asking you
to marry a lady from Xizhou to show that

451
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,460
you're not defending against the noble families

452
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,980
as if they're enemies.

453
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,180
Once you have ties here,

454
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,940
they won't be so against you.

455
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,700
Besides, I see Minniang as my own daughter.

456
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,020
I want someone to take care of her

457
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,700
so that she doesn't get bullied.

458
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,780
Then I can die in peace.

459
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,904
Besides,

460
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,480
wouldn't it be nice if she gave birth

461
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,820
to a child for you?

462
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,448
Governor.

463
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,260
I will never forget what you've done for me.

464
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,980
It will be my payback to you

465
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,820
to take care of her.

466
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,100
I'm willing to try it.

467
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,128
Alright.

468
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,740
Miss Zhang lost her parents at a young age.

469
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,100
I can totally relate.

470
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,940
I never had any siblings.

471
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,500
If you don't mind it,

472
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,740
I'd like to make her my sworn sister.

473
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,488
Alright. Good.

474
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,160
The osmanthus wine is strong indeed.

475
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,296
Exactly.

476
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,460
The wine was strong and I drank fast.

477
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,300
I'm feeling tipsy. Pardon me.

478
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,856
I'll walk them out.

479
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
The minister is waiting.

480
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,180
Please ask the governor again
if he has read the report.

481
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,460
Prefect Wang, just wait.

482
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,780
The governor is busy.

483
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,980
He's occupied
unless there's a war happening right now.

484
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,040
Sounds convincing.

485
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,620
So what are you doing here?

486
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,940
If our chancellor

487
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,540
calls for help in there,

488
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,340
I'd dash in and save him

489
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,620
at the risk of my life.

490
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,260
What an amazing man.

491
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,780
How come I haven't noticed it before?

492
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,552
I'm flattered.

493
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,720
Wait.

494
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,900
What is taking Prefect Wang so long?

495
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,780
I've sent someone to wait

496
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,060
and invite him over once he's back.

497
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,300
Please inform the chancellor

498
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
that Madam is having a slight fever

499
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,400
and urge him back.

500
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,552
You...

501
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,900
Prefect Wang, Governor wants to see you.

502
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,240
Governor, have you read the report?

503
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,180
Don't beat around the bush.

504
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,500
Chongyu sent you here, didn't he?

505
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,500
I'm so worried that

506
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,720
those people would be
bold enough to offend Shouyue.

507
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,180
Nobody can help make peace.

508
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,300
Listen to me,
if it develops into a serious conflict,

509
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,660
you must try to make peace.

510
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,940
I swear I'll do my best.

511
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,352
Minniang...

512
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,580
We didn't do her right.

513
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,980
Why did you say you were sick?

514
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,100
Cheng said that you wanted us

515
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,160
to find an excuse to get you home

516
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,780
if you're not here by sunset.

517
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,780
Chongyu was waiting for you.

518
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,880
Besides, many people saw me drunk.

519
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,380
That's the best excuse.

520
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,280
Oh right, the governor kept you there

521
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,060
to force someone upon you?

522
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,320
You were right.

523
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Sorry, I got a sworn sister

524
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,220
without telling you.

525
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,740
Sworn sister? Who? Do I know her?

526
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,160
Zhang Minniang.

527
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,280
Why did you make her your sworn sister?

528
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,440
She's weird.

529
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,995
I hate dealing with her.

530
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,620
Let's see how you

531
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,180
wrap things up now.

532
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,140
The governor seemed worried, so I tried

533
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,820
to ease his mind.

534
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,340
Sister, if Zhang Minniang comes
looking for trouble,

535
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,440
just ignore her.

536
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,500
I'm afraid that's impossible.

537
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,880
Then inform me whenever she's here.

538
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,780
You should rest well

539
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,020
and not be bothered.

540
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,340
Don't worry, I won't let her bother us.

541
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,620
That's why it's so quiet out there.

542
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,220
It turns out you're having

543
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,740
bitter water here.

544
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,340
Yunyi, don't talk nonsense.

545
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,660
Minniang is making tea. Have some.

546
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,820
It's been so long, Yunyi.

547
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,620
The tea is ready. Would you like to try it?

548
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,220
Not at all.

549
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,340
Thank you for the tea.

550
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,200
You have the best tea leaves.

551
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,020
I'm just making it into tea.

552
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,780
It surely has a lingering aroma.

553
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,800
Really? Do you like it?

554
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,000
I think there's more.

555
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,980
I'll get them to pack it for you.

556
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,540
Madam, my lady usually drinks the best tea,

557
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,060
called the Mengding Tea.

558
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,540
Do we have it at home?

559
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,220
We had it once.

560
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,260
But Master said that
it was not as great as people praised it

561
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,060
and didn't tell An Sanniang to bring more.

562
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,540
Don't listen to Na, sister.

563
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,500
How can I take your tea

564
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,460
on the first visit as your sworn sister?

565
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,940
Actually, I brought a gift.

566
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,016
It's nothing fancy.

567
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,220
I made it for fun.

568
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,480
It may not be so delicate,
but it's better than ordinary flutes.

569
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,740
Please don't mind it.

570
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,060
My lady is truly modest.

571
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,220
Everyone knows that my lady is skillful.

572
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,280
She's always enjoyed playing music.

573
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,840
But the Xizhou flutes break easily.

574
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,300
So my lady asked someone
to bring fine bamboo from Jiangnan

575
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,120
and she made this nice flute.

576
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,100
Even the best handicraftsmen
would be impressed.

577
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,540
I see. This is so precious.

578
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,220
Do you have any plans later?

579
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,860
Not at all. What can I do for you, sister?

580
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,520
Nothing. I just need to
finish something by noon.

581
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,740
I'm afraid you'll have to wait a bit.

582
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,980
Bring the easel stand.

583
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,648
Understood.

584
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
It will be ready.

585
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,100
Done, Yunyi. Come and take a look.

586
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,180
This is amazing.

587
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,780
I bet Chongyu will like it.

588
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,460
Now I know

589
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,940
what a talented painter is capable of.

590
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,180
Your painting is astonishing.

591
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,740
It's nothing. It just takes time.

592
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,984
I can paint you

593
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,820
if you want. What do you say?

594
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,020
That's inappropriate.

595
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,980
Only a painting

596
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,620
can capture your beauty
and keep it throughout the years.

597
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,320
You have to sit still for that. It's boring.

598
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,820
I bet you're too busy for that.

599
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,900
Please don't make fun of me.

600
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,300
I'm idling around all day.

601
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,540
Alright, let's do this.

602
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,224
Sister.

603
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,720
General, there are only thousands

604
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,100
of Qiuci rebels.

605
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,340
I couldn't have taken them out alone.

606
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,700
We don't need the Army of the Great Tang
to handle so few enemies.

607
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,900
The local troops can handle it.

00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,120
♫ I write my longing for you in Spring ♫

610
00:42:58,148 --> 00:43:02,752
♫ The red plum is in full bloom like you ♫

611
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:07,296
♫ By the pond, next to the willow trees ♫

612
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:10,944
♫ I write a poem
to tell our story from the past ♫

613
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:15,904
♫ The years pass by like a bird♫

614
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:22,400
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

615
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,120
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

616
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,568
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫

617
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:37,088
♫ Under the moonlight,
we parted at the doorstep ♫

618
00:43:37,088 --> 00:43:43,392
♫ I've endured hardship
to tell our lingering story ♫

619
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:46,880
♫ Remembrance of past things ♫

620
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,952
♫ As time goes by, seasons change ♫

621
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:53,472
♫ Flowers wither, and winter has come ♫

622
00:43:53,472 --> 00:43:56,992
♫ Years pass by, and we're young no more ♫

623
00:43:56,992 --> 00:43:59,840
♫ A snowy day, someone sings a sad song ♫

624
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,912
♫ Against the window,
I had a drink for pleasure ♫

625
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:06,528
♫ The moon still hangs in the sky,
but I'm no longer in the mood ♫

626
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:11,392
♫ It's quite and cold outside,
but I grab my pen again ♫

627
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,016
♫ The destiny always comes with regrets ♫

628
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:37,408
♫ Who could relieve my pain of love ♫

629
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,608
♫ Outside the pavilion, by the bridge ♫
