Your painful memory, is he the one who hurt you?

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,066
Well...

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,833
Yes.

Are you okay?

I don't care how long ago or why it happened.

I'll never forgive anyone who hurts you, Kotori-san.

No, no, it's not like that!

9
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:46,700
We found out misunderstandings were on both sides.

10

It's all good now.

Yes.

I'm glad I opened up to you.

14

It made it easier to talk to him.

15
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:01,733
I didn't do anything.

16

Let me treat you to something delicious in return.

18

I'll make reservations right now.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,426
What do you want to eat?

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,593
Kotori, we're making yakisoba (Stir-fried noodles).

25
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:39,626
I'll be right there!

26
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:42,926
Let's go back and talk later.

27
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:45,893
I'll gather info in the meantime.

28

Sorry to keep you waiting!

30
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:56,360
Do you prefer sauce or salt yakisoba?

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,060
- Sauce, for sure!
- See, I told you!

But this is a date so...

60
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:04,397
That's my excuse anyway.

61
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:08,631
Can I use your first name when we are alone?

62
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,593

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,686
The trial period is almost over.

184
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:19,953
Can you answer me after this weekend's event?

185
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,686
Yes, okay.

186
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:33,120
I'm all recharged.

187
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,686
I can keep going now.

188
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:36,490
Good.

189
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,686
I'll go ahead.

190
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,820
Soma-kun was acting a little odd.

191
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:59,153
All set to go?

192
00:13:59,153 --> 00:14:01,230
- Today is the day.
- Right.

193
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,420
This part here bothers me a little.
[Avaz]

194
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,280
Thanks for helping today.

195
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,480
We're short-handed so you're a huge help.

196
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,984
- We're glad to be here.
- Glad to help.

197
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,786
Can you start setting out samples?

198
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:17,453
- I got it!
- Me, too.

199
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:19,353
Thanks.

200
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:24,097
Could you grab the extras from over there?

201
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,331
- Okay.
- Shall we line them up?

202
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,186
- Right.
- Yes, please do.

203
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:29,653
- Over here.
- Let's line them up.

204
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,986
- This looks better.
- Really? You're so meticulous.

205
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:34,241
Then let's do it like this.

206
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,176
We're spacing them evenly, right?

207
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,391
- Wait a second! Like this.
- What?

208
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:41,453
It's going to fall. Watch out.

209
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,564
Looks good. Let's go with this.

210
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:48,989
We should move them a little.

211
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,010
Yes, you're right.

212
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,353
Do we still have more?

213
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:54,453
New protein drink from Avaz!

214
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:57,420
Please come and try it out!

215
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,086
Try one?

216
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:01,116
New protein drink from Avaz.

217
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,210
Try one?

218
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,553
- I'd like one.
- Oh, thank you!

219
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:06,786
Would you mind filling out a questionnaire?

220
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:09,986
Sure. Thank you.

221
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:11,620
This way.

222
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,486
Ogata-san is great at reeling in customers.

223
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:18,120
She and Takamine-san are in sync, too.

224
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,253
Did you hear they were high school classmates?

225
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,553
Really? What a coincidence!

226
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:28,220
I bet they handed out flyers in high school.

227
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,796
Probably.

228
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,597
Maybe they're dating...

229
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,720
- So what if they were classmates?
- I'm sure they're having fun.

230
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,200
Looks like they're reliving their youth.

231
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:44,020
Here.

232
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,686
Is that how you treat a customer?

233
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,553
Sorry.

234
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:54,586
Why that face?

235
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,620
I always look like this.

236
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,220
What?

237
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,720
Cute face, big ego, right?

238
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,886
- No.
- Whatever, Mr. Handsome.

239
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:06,953
Please excuse his rudeness!

240
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:11,620
As an apology, would you like a new protein drink?

241
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,953
- "Drink"?
- Yes!

242
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:16,220
The chocolate one is especially good.

243
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,420
I'm drinking it to lose weight.

244
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,086
As if protein can fix all this here.

245
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:26,530
It's good for diets and workouts,

246
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,286
but it helps with nutrition.

247
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:30,453
"Nutrition"?

248
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:33,486
Yes, easy, affordable health.

249
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:36,920
She's just started drinking Avaz products

250
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,686
to know how customers feel.

251
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:44,320
Leave it to me! Ready to try?

252
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,586
This way, please.

253
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:46,753
Oh, all right.

254
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:50,220
It really does wonders for your health.

255
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,620
Perfectly in sync.

256
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,186
- They saved your life, Soma-kun.
- Yes.

257
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,110
I see.

258
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,820
- Feel free to hold it.
- Thank you.

259
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,200
I feel you have to drink your protein, but...

260
00:17:09,206 --> 00:17:10,939
Ogata-san?

261
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:15,739
I'm really sorry.

262
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:20,173
It's okay. Takamine-kun jumped in, too.

263
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
He always communicated well.

264
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,850
Everyone would go to him for help.

265
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:31,168
I see...

266
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:37,077
You can mix it with other drinks you like.

267
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:51,820
- Thanks so much for helping today!
- Thank you.

268
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,553
You helped get many survey responses.

269
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:55,020
Glad we could help.

270
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,586
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

271
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:59,786
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

272
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:03,286
- We worked a lot.
- I know, right?

273
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:05,153
A beer would hit the spot.

274
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:08,086
- We drink it every day, though.
- Well, yes, still.

275
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,753
I'm going for drinks now.

276
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:12,653
- Nice. Have a good one.
- I'll get going first.

277
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:15,020
- Have fun.
- See you!

278
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:26,053
Hey. Are you almost done, too?

279
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:33,020
So... Can we talk when you're done?

280
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,953
Sorry, I still have stuff to do. Go ahead without me.

281
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:42,720
- I'll help.
- It's okay. I'll do it alone.

282
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,953
Good night.

283
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,786
Why is Soma-kun being cold again?

284
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:08,420
Ogata.

285
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,920
All done?

286
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,353
Thanks so much for helping today.

287
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:16,353
Likewise. Thanks for letting us help.

288
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:18,520
Are you free now?

289
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:22,420
Well...

290
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,520
Is it Soma-san?

291
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:30,353
Well... Um...

292
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:34,286
No need to hide it. I can tell by your face.

293
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:36,920
But is everything okay?

294
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,753
I can listen if you're worried.

295
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,086
No, it's okay.

296
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:51,420
Drinks another time?

297
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,520
Good night.

298
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:06,886
- The number you dialed...
- Why isn't he picking up?

299
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,653
Soma-kun! Wait up!

300
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,186
Is something wrong?

301
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:20,960
Everyone makes mistakes.

302
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:27,286
Remember how you told me to lean on you more?

303
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:31,586
The same goes for you now.

304
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:36,620
If something's wrong, don't bottle it up, tell me.

305
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:42,450
I'm younger than you,

306
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,480
and I'm not smooth like Takamine-san.

307
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:51,986
To you, I may not be very reliable.

308
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:56,640
But I don't want to

309
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,250
give you up to anyone!

310
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:06,453
- I want you to fall in love with only me.
- I love you, Soma-kun!

311
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,453
I love you!

312
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,286
So...

313
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:15,920
No more trial period.

314
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,886
Please be my boyfriend!

315
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,770
Of course.

316
00:21:36,537 --> 00:21:38,820
Soma-kun...

317
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,290
I panicked.

318
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:46,953
I thought he might take you.

319
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,886
I'm sorry I was so cold to you.

320
00:21:55,986 --> 00:22:00,286
I had no idea I could feel this jealous.

321
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,153
I just didn't know how to face you.

322
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:10,153
It's okay.

323
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:16,553
I'm sorry I made you get the wrong idea.

324
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:23,353
Can I kiss you?

325
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,480
Sure.

326
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:33,730
I love you,

327
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,586
Kotori-san.

328
00:22:39,153 --> 00:22:40,986
I love you, too.

329
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:58,486
I don't want to leave you yet.

330
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:00,686
Do you have plans after this?

331
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:04,153
No.

332
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:08,040
I'd like to stay with you longer.

333
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:12,586
Then can I come over?

334
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:17,086
To your place.

335
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:19,920
Wait, wait!

336
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,750
We've only just made this official!

337
00:23:23,758 --> 00:23:26,391
And he's coming to my place already?

356
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,253
I wonder what he meant by "after that."

357
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:36,953
I'm new to dating so I need time to prepare myself.

358
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,753
-I'm a newbie, too.
- What?

359
00:24:38,753 --> 00:24:44,860
Things are finally official, but what do I do now?
