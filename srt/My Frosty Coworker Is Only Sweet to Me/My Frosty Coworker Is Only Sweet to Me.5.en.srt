Do you have plans after this?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,300
No.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,867
I'd like to stay with you longer.

5
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:17,734
Can I come over then?

6
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:21,767
To your place.

7
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,434
Well...

00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,700
Here.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,000
- Thank you.
- Sure.

Soma-kun is in my room!

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,330
I can't believe this is happening.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,334
I'll throw this away.

13
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:03,834
I'll help.

14
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,567
Sorry!

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,367
Don't be so nervous.

16

He noticed...

17
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:22,227
I'm a little nervous, too.

18
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:52,100
Soma-kun has a low body temp and is frosty to all at work.

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,567
But to me, his nosy co-worker with a rather high body temp...

20
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:02,134
he's super sweet for some reason.

No. Sorry, I just don't usually visit other people's places.

Do you think so?

41

No, no, it didn't.

60

It's just... you don't have to check every time.

61

I got all heated up like that. Silly me!

80
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:42,132
I'm mortified.

81
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:53,500

What am I doing, at my age?

83
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,734
He seemed really used to doing all that.

84
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:16,867
He's probably got lots of experience, unlike me.

85
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,834
Stop it, focus on work.

00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,900

00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,400
What's wrong?

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,134
I broke up with my girlfriend.

89
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:39,134
- What?
- Oh, dear me. How come?

90
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:41,100
How come?

91
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,700
She said she never knows what I'm thinking.

92
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,134
I bet you ignore her texts.

93
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:49,467
- You aren't too reliable, are you?
- What do you mean by that?

94
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,867
- I guess it's a matter of communication skills.
- Maybe so.

95
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,867
- That's really important.
- Right.

96
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,020
- I'm sure of that.
- Where's Soma-kun?

97
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,508
I haven't seen him today. I wonder what happened to him.

98
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:04,334
Soma is solving issues at Tamago Company since yesterday.

99
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:07,467
But yesterday was Sunday! How cruel!

100
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:12,685
Don't say that. Only he could handle it.

101
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,655
- If I could...
- Chief!

102
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,034

00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:20,534
Yes, that's right!

104
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,700
I know, I know.

105
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,934
I've got this Gyokuro tea for him once he gets back.

106
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:31,500
So that's what happened to Soma-kun...

107
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,366
Good morning.

108
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,066

109
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,366
Hey, Kotori?

110
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:40,900
- Oh, morning.
- Morning. Let's go to the meeting.

111
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,566
Takamine-san is here early.

112
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,533
Oh, really?

113
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,100
This way, please.

114
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,933
Excuse me.

115
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,300
You were a great help the other day.

116
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,866
- Likewise.
- Oh, we enjoyed it, too.

117
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:02,033
Thanks to you, we got many customer surveys,

118
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:06,033
and we want to focus more on boosting product awareness.

119
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,600
Customer feedback is crucial, isn't it?

120
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,833
So we'd like upper top exposure on our website.

121
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,266
I understand.

122
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:19,633
Can we go over it in detail?

123
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,866
Yes, of course.

124
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,800
- Let's see...
- All right then.

125
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,466
It's been an hour. Shall we take a break?

126
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:32,866
Sounds good.

127
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,766
Yes.

128
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:41,333
- So we're on the same page.
- Right.

129
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,990
- Hello?
- Can we finish in another hour?

130
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,280
I think so.

131
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,660
Excuse me for a moment.

132
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,566
So, Kotori.

133
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:57,133
What happened after the event?

134
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,933
You know, between you and Soma-kun.

135
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,533
You're so obvious!

136
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,100
I saw right through you.

137
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,700
I know you went home together.

138
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:16,733
So... are you two dating?

139
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,000
We started officially going out after the event.

140
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,533
No way! Seriously?

141
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,800
Really?

142
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:38,766
So you and Soma-kun, wow!

143
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,345
I can see it.

144
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:45,133
Wait, how did it all start in the first place?

145
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,466
Do you really want to know?

146
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:47,800
I really do!

147
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,666
It wasn't a special reason.

148
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:54,490
Is it secret? Won't you tell me?

149
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,566
How nice! So you guys are lovey-dovey.

150
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:01,070
Yes.

151
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,890
All this went on in front of me,

152
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,360
and I didn't notice at all.

153
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,066
Has he slept over already?

154
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,800
Your face! He has, right?

155
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Stop it.

156
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,566
Come on, we're at work!

157
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:26,000
No way...

158
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,500
Shall we continue?

159
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,333
Of course.

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,900
Sorry, I'm fine.

161
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:38,133
Well... where were we?

162
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:42,266
We were deciding what elements to incorporate.

163
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,600
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, that's right.

164
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,429
- Sorry!
- Are you okay?

165
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,566
I'm fine.

166
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,633
Well, could you wipe there?

167
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,233
I'm so sorry.

168
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:54,533
Your suit is wet.

169
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,066
- Sorry.
- Do you need to change?

170
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:59,033
No, I'm fine.

171
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,733
Need more tissues?

172
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:04,800
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

173
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,933
Thanks.

174
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:21,700
Takamine-san seemed off after he took that phone call.

175
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,570
I wonder what it was.

176
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:31,200
Sure, will next Tuesday work for you?

177
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:41,933
Man... That hit me harder than I expected.

178
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,566
How do these stay on there?

179
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,500
I don't know... wait, look here.

180
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,766
- Glue?
- it's probably wire, not glue.

181
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:06,100
- Hi, Soma-kun.
- It must have been rough, yes?

182
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,800
- Frosty...
- Hey, Soma, I'm about to...

183
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,200
- Soma-kun?
- Koto...

184
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,166
Ogata-san, were you okay after that?

185
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,533
I wonder what he meant by "after that."

186
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,533
Something happened between them for sure.

187
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:33,000
Right! I'm dying to know!

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,789
- I was going to call...
- Wait, Soma-kun!

189
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:40,533
Well... You should go report to the chief first.

190
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:44,900
He looks so neglected.

191
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,466
Okay.

192
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:56,166
Was he going to discuss it in the office?

193
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,966
- Take a seat.
- No, I'm okay.

194
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:08,033
I can't stand everyone looking at me like that.

195
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,733
Kotori-san!

196
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,130
I'm sorry about yesterday.

197
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,100
I was going to apologize, but then I got a call about an issue.

198
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's okay, that's not a problem.

199
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:37,066
I'm sorry I acted like that and made you worry.

200
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,600
C-Could you back off a bit?

201
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,780
Are you...

202
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,633
angry at me?

203
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:03,100
Is it because I said I wouldn't do anything,

204
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,660
then kissed you like that?

205
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:19,300
I-I'm not angry, no, no.

206
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,133
But we're at work.

207
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:29,800
I'd really appreciate If you could keep our private life out of work.

208
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,866
But why?

209
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:37,720
I want my work life and private life to be separate,

210
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,960
with clear boundaries between the two.

211
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,600
"Boundaries"?

212
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:51,740
Also, I've never dated anyone before.

213
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,900
I'd appreciate if we could take it slow.

214
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,333
I understand.

215
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,640
Sure, you may be used to this.

216
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,930
I'm new to dating so I need time to prepare myself.

217
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:12,733
I'm a newbie, too.

218
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,900
What?

219
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,066
You're the first person I've ever properly dated.

220
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,933
Are you joking?

221
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:27,100
I mean, all he's done so far...

222
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:30,766
A hug to seal the deal.

223
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:33,900
This is what a boyfriend does.

224
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,333
He seemed so used to it.

225
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,100
Really? Is this really Soma-kun's first time dating someone?

226
00:17:56,933 --> 00:18:00,033
If that's true...

227
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,500
Is something wrong?

228
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,166
No, nothing.

229
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,000
Really?

230
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,266
Yes.

231
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,433
So we're both newbies.

232
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:33,266
I'm new to this love stuff

233
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:39,133
so how will I make him, who's also a newbie, slow down?

234
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:43,233
Ogata-san, can you check this?

235
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,566
"Boundaries."

236
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,700
Okay...

237
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:09,260
I'd like to keep this signature font of Strawberry Milk here,

238
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,766
but then highlight it more.

239
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:15,500
- Add a shadow for a 3D look?
- That could work.

240
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,566
- I like how it looks slightly melty.
- I see.

241
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:22,200
- It's super fierce, like it's yelling at you.
- That's true.

242
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,533
I think we could adjust the color.

243
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:28,334
- Yes, maybe.
- Like the color of Strawberry Milk.

244
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,990
- You're right!
- No, we've already chosen the color.

245
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,300
Then how about the dots?

246
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,408
Maybe we should add dots.
[Focus on the meeting!]

247
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,588
On the contrary, checkered may be nice.

248
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:39,779
- Chief, you are like Strawberry Milk!
- Shut up.

249
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,181
Maybe he can't devise anything.

250
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,618
Perhaps a more Showa style

251
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,753
- would make more impact.
- That's true.

252
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:54,833
[Idee]

253
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,526
- Good night.
- Have a good evening.

254
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,090
Kotori-san!

255
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,569
Walk home with me halfway?

256
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,505
I'll go home early today.

257
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,600
Chief, have you an appointment tonight?

258
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,028
- Sorry, I'm in a rush. I'll go alone.
- Today is my son's birthday.

259
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:11,577
- He's turning ten.
- See you tomorrow.

260
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,666
Wow, congrats!

261
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,200
Good night.

262
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
What's up, Soma?

263
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,666
Nothing, Sir.

264
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:24,700
- You can always come to me...
- Good night.

265
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,033
Have a good evening.

266
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,700
Good evening to me!

267
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:56,033
What's the right distance to have when setting relationship boundaries?

268
00:20:56,033 --> 00:21:00,233
Maybe I was too cold to him?

269
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:04,360
Things are finally official,

270
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,030
but what do I do now?

271
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:14,866
I should start by apologizing to Soma-kun.

272
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,330
[Mai-chan]

273
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,033
Hello? Mai-chan?

274
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,966
What, now?

275
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:33,533
I was just in the mood to see my old high school friends.

276
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:35,900
It'll be a girls' night.

277
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,366
[I'm sorry I rushed home today.]

278
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:46,633
[I'm having a girls' night out with a high school friend.]

279
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,233
[Okay. Have fun.]

280
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,366
[Text me when it's over. I'll come get you.]

281
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:53,900
Hey, Kotori! Long time, no see!

282
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,200
Mai-chan!

283
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,315
- Hey. It's been a while.
- I'm so glad to see you!

284
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,200
Me, too!

285
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,700
You still have that soothing aura and warm hands.

286
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,900
I haven't seen Ekko and Kumi in ages.

287
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,300
Oh, they couldn't make it.

288
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,600
So I called some other old friends from Nish High School instead.

289
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,900
- Okay.
- Let's go. It's been so long!

290
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,666
- Yes, it's been long! How have you been?
- Indeed.

291
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,566
- Great!
- How's work going?

292
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,700
I'm so glad you haven't changed a bit.

293
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,239
- Neither have you.
- Really?

294
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:31,066
- I think you got cuter.
- Oh, thanks.

295
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,400
There they are.

296
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,166
Over here!

297
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,666
Takamine-kun?

298
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,366
Ogata...

299
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:46,600
What's going on? I thought this was a girls' night?

300
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,533
Sorry, but it's okay, right?

301
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:51,866
A mini high school reunion.

302
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:53,533
You didn't tell me, either.

303
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:58,166
Come on, it's been so long since we hung out.

304
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,133
- I missed you guys. Thanks.
- Same.

305
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,866
- Let's drink!
- Let's sit down, Kotori.

306
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,500
"I missed you guys"?

307
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,700
- But I did!
- It's been too long.

308
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,120
- Totally.
- How are you?

309
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,266
- Great.
- Good to hear.

310
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:12,333
- What shall we drink?
- What are you having?

311
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,066
- Oolong cocktail.
- A highball then.

312
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:19,000
How will I explain this to Soma-kun?

313
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,040
Not done yet?

314
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,866
Finally.

315
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,260
I hope she's having fun.

- Maybe it's fate.
- What?
