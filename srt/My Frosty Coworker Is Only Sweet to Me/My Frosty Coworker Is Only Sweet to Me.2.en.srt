Will you go out with me?

00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:13,067
Shall we date for a limited trial period?

3
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:16,234
Let's say, a month?

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,800
I've always been afraid of getting hurt and shy about love.

Hey, Kotori-san!

Hey!

13
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,833
Oh, sorry. What is it?

14
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,933
Can you check the revised design for Florena?

15
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:02,766
Yes, sure, after I've finished this.

16
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:04,133
Okay, thanks.

17
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,940
Thank you.

18
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,566
That's enough. I need to get my act together.

Chief, we're back.

20

Welcome back.

21
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:15,033
How did it go at Avaz?

22
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,200
We got their requests as much as possible.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,666
I'll make sure we win the competition.

24
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,766
- You got this.
- Yes, Sir.

25
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:24,733
Soma-kun will be handling the system...

26
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,200
What?

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,033
Hey, Soma-kun?

28
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,266
Yes, what is it?

29
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:34,000
Won't you inform the Chief?

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,166
I already sent him an email.

31
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,533
Oh...

32
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:45,200
But he's right here; you should tell him in person.

33
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:52,933
As cold and unsociable as ever...

34
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,500
- Hey, Ogata.
- Yes?

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,333
I'd like you to handle something.

36
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,833
Yes, Sir.

37
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:10,332
I need this web ad for VidePrime done. There's no rush.

38
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:12,132
No problem!

39
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,032
I'd like to take care of this!

40
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:15,532
- Okay then.
- Yes.

00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:19,540
I'll send the details.

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,332
Okay, Sir.

I'll do my best!

46
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:32,065
If I let my guard down, I'll start thinking of Soma-kun.

47
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:43,165
Come on, focus on work.

48
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:54,498
Soma-kun has a low body temp and is frosty to all at work.

49
00:02:56,132 --> 00:03:00,965
But to me, his nosy co-worker with a rather high body temp...

50
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:04,732
he's super sweet for some reason.

Were you waiting for me?

71
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:34,765
You were so focused, I didn't want to interrupt.

Your hand is ice cold!

74
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:41,765
Did you wait long?

75
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,865
Just like five minutes.

76
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,600
Does it get this cold in five minutes?

77
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,932
Warm me up like this then.

78

81

Are you soaking in the bath every day?

90
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:36,632
I mostly just take showers.

91
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:39,465
No! You need to soak in the hot bath.

92
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:40,898
Why?

93
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:43,732

185
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:41,498
What extra stuff?

186
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:43,498
Let's see...

187
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,498
What? All this?

188
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,865
It's too much to handle.

189
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:50,998
Maybe we can't make the deadline.

190
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:54,508
We need a meeting about this.

191
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:55,860
- Sure.
- All right.

192
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,330
Okay.

193
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,032
[Subject: Corrections and extra info regarding Florena]

194
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:06,598
I'm not sure if we can handle so many changes...

195
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:13,398
We will have to get it done in the next three days.

196
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:15,198
I'll help out, too.

197
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:18,265
No, you've got the Avaz competition, Uehara.

198
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,480
Right, but...

199
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,198
Thanks, Risa. It's okay.

200
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:28,532
I want to do what I can, since the Florena staff were so awesome.

201
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:40,165
We're going to have to redo it from scratch, basically.

202
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,198
We will never finish!

203
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,398
We're not going home today, are we?

204
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:47,365
No...

205
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:51,798
Here, everyone, sugar...

206
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,565
to pump you up.

207
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,332
It's your favorite, Kotori-san. Are you sure it's okay?

208
00:13:57,332 --> 00:14:00,065
Of course! Eat up, you must be hungry.

209
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:03,032
This will keep us going for a while. ("Sugar" sounds like "for a while.")

210
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,132
Get it?

211
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:12,398
Shall I split it into three equally and eat? (homophones)

212
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:37,450
Looks like we're working late again today.

213
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:49,798
Everyone is worn out.

214
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:54,532
Okay, everyone.

215
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:56,698
Let's all go home for today.

216
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,365
But the deadline...

217
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:04,532
Exhaustion affects your judgment and speed.

218
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,732
You'd make dumb mistakes.

219
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,532
So let's go rest.

220
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:16,298
Tomorrow, we will work even harder to finish before the deadline.

221
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:17,798
Okay.

222
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:21,298
- Kotori-san!
- Ogata-san!

223
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:23,130
What about you, Ogata-san?

224
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,865
Will you go home, too?

225
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:31,553
Yes, I'll go home, too.

226
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:44,432
Finally going home!

227
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:47,365
Good night!

228
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:49,165
Kotori-san, you go home, too.

229
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,765
I will, once I lock up.

230
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:56,198
Make sure you eat properly, take a bath, and sleep in your beds.

231
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:57,865
She's like a mom.

232
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:59,640
- Bye.
- Good night.

233
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,853
Good night.

234
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,465
Good night to you as well, Soma-kun.

235
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:18,365
All right then.

236
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:21,432
I'll do as much as I can.

237
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,531
There...

238
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:42,298
I'm exhausted. I need sugar.

239
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:46,065
I want that dorayaki.

240
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,598
Hello?

241
00:16:57,598 --> 00:17:00,798
Ogata-san, are you still at the office?

242
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,635
N-No, I'm home.

243
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:13,598
Soma-kun, what's wrong?

244
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:18,098
Liar.

245
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,518
Why are you here?

246
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:26,065
Did you have dinner?

247
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:30,690
I grabbed some stuff. Take a break and eat.

248
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:34,598
Also... here,

249
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:36,730
though it's not Aiya's.

250
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,098
How did you know?

251
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:42,165
I'm always watching you.

252
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:51,470
I was waiting for you to ask me for help.

253
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:55,798
I'm your boyfriend before I'm your co-worker.

254
00:17:58,198 --> 00:18:00,532
Lean on me more.

255
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:09,418
Thank you.

256
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:15,132
Thank you! I'm so happy!

257
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:18,590
Eat that and take a break.

258
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,765
Really, thank you so much!

259
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,350
No problem.

260
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:26,665
Oh, what's this?

261
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:27,998
Looks good, right?

262
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,732
It does.

263
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:32,198
I've never seen this before.

264
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:40,365
I'll handle the system stuff so send it all to me.

265
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:42,998
Got it. Thanks so much.

266
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:57,965
I uploaded the data.

267
00:18:57,965 --> 00:18:59,972
Okay.

268
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,998
Let's see...

269
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:04,832
Should be good now.

270
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:07,365
I think we will make the deadline.

271
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:09,432
Yes.

272
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:21,620
Thank you, Soma-kun.

273
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:27,065
Likewise. Thank you for relying on me.

274
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,032
We're sleepy, aren't we?

275
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,032
Good morning.

276
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:48,198
What? You two did all this?

277
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:53,098
Kotori-san, you did this secretly? You should have told us!

278
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:56,765
- It's fine; Soma-kun helped me.
- I see.

279
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:59,998
What? Where did Soma-kun go?

280
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:04,398
He looked totally drained so I told him to nap.

281
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:05,898
You go take one, too, Ogata.

282
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:08,365
Yes, get some rest.

283
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:11,765
Leave the rest to us!

284
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:15,098
Thanks, I will.

285
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,798
- Amazing!
- Back to work!

286
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:20,780
- You did great.
- Yes, I did my best.

287
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,098
Good morning.

288
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,110
- Let's catch up on yesterday's work.
- Morning.

289
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,920
Good. I'm counting on you.

290
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:07,732
What is this feeling?

291
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:09,598
Thank you.

292
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:19,878
You're leaving?

293
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:23,598
Sorry, did I wake you?

294
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:28,665
No, I'm too hyper; I can't fall asleep.

295
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:31,398
Was there a problem?

296
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,398
No.

297
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:37,298
Is there anything you want, Soma-kun?

298
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:43,298
As thanks for the food and for helping me out.

299
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,632
Then...

300
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:53,098
As my reward,

301
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:58,998
will you kiss my cheek?

302
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:32,632
Just jok...

303
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:38,670
S-Sorry!

304
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,560
I... I really meant to just kiss your cheek!

305
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:46,298
I didn't think you'd turn.

306
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:52,232
Go back to sleep! Rest up, okay?

307
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:09,965
Come on! My first kiss wasn't meant to be an accident!

I haven't seen you since high school.

327
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:35,965
- I didn't recognize you.
- A social gathering?

328
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,265
- I'll go.
- Will you?

329
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:40,265
Is he the one who hurt you?

330
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:44,632
I'll say it again and again. I like you just the way you are.
