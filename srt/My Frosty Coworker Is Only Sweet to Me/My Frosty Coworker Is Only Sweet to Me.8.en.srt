00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,053
I've never seen my brother so impressed before.

182
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,986
- He's super hot, too.
- Really?

183
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,253
Talking about me?

184
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,220
I'm so glad we got his approval.

185
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,253
He's hard to please, but you awed him.

186
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:34,486
No, I couldn't have done it without you.

187
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:40,220
You devised ideas and ways to win him over.

188
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,686
He cares deeply about being Aiya's face.

189
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,553
What's wrong?

190
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,686
I haven't told you something.

191
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,630
The day you had that fever,

192
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,500
I called my brother.

193
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,020
Kotori-san will manage your site. I'll handle the system.

194
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,653
Oh, you will?

195
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:20,653
Might as well give it your all,
as it'll be your last job there.

196
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:21,886
"My last job"?

197
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:25,986
When this is over, you'll return to Kyoto, right?

198
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,970
You haven't yet repaid Father for raising you.

199
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,986
Th-Then once this is all over...

200
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:39,686
No, I won't go back, never.

201
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:42,053
What? You're not?

202
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:47,586
That's right. I'll keep pursuing this job here.

203
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:54,186
With Kotori-san, I'll build a mind-blowing site.

204
00:16:55,453 --> 00:17:00,520
So this job was for my benefit, too.

205
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,960
I wanted to show my family my pride in my work.

206
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,487
I'll repay them that way, as my brother said.

207
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,535
Thank you for telling me.

208
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:22,035
That honestly makes me very happy.

209
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:28,040
You didn't do your best only for me,

210
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,680
but for your own sake as well.

211
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,752
I want us each to have our own goals

212
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:42,752
and support each other through the process,

213
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,952
for the rest of our lives.

214
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:53,886
You warm me when I'm cold; I'll cool you when you're hot.

215
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,752
Like that, right?

216
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,486
Exactly.

217
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,140
I prefer white.
[Idee]

218
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,220
You prefer white? I'll go with blue.

219
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,370
Blue... I see.

220
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,519
- Idee, Hata speaking.
- How about

221
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,852
- Oh, hello.
- this color?

222
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:15,686
- Yes.
- Looks good.

223
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:19,552
- Ogata? One moment, please.
- So this is the edge, right?

224
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:24,119
Kotori-san, Aiya's president on line 1 for you.

225
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,819
What? The president?

226
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,350
Yes.

227
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,319
Is something up?

228
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,086
So sorry that you had to come.

229
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:43,587
I wanted to thank you in person before I go to Kyoto.

230
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,386
Thank me?

231
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:50,352
Orders pour in since the website opened.

232
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:53,486
Apparently, we trend on social media as well.

233
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:57,052
This is unprecedented.

234
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,019
Is that so?

235
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,986
Do you have a moment?

236
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:05,552
Of course.

237
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,244
I was actually always jealous of my brother.

238
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:15,540
Though he was raised in the same household,

239
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,810
why was he given more freedom?

240
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,700
I found myself wishing for that freedom.

241
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:30,152
Now we've received orders from clients nationwide.

242
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:34,119
Sweets I take pride in bring joy to so many people.

243
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:39,052
And I've realized, it makes me very happy, too.

244
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,719
Yes.

245
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:47,586
Aiya's sweets have made me very happy, too.

246
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,290
These are to thank you.

247
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,419
Thank you.

248
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:59,219
Farewell then.

249
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,752
Gosh, these make me so happy!
[Dorayaki]

250
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,819
- Here.
- Thanks.

251
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,519
You take one, too, Soma-kun.

252
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,086
But you don't like them.

253
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,152
I'll have one, too.

254
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,052
I think I'll like it now.

255
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,686
All right, let's dig in!

256
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,986
Yummy.

257
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,986
Our dorayaki is the best.

258
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:57,819
Right?

259
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:08,386
But seeing your face as you eat these is the best.

260
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,119
Oh, good.

261
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,152
The chief gave us a couple of days off to rest.

262
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,852
This is great.

263
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,586
So... any ideas for our long weekend?

264
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:33,419
Actually, can we go to a hot spring in Hakone?

265
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,952
A trip?

266
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:38,852
That means...

267
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,552
W-We're staying the night?

268
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,152
I actually made reservations.

269
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,019
What do you say?

270
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,752
Yes, let's go.

271
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:59,752
"Stay the night"? What the heck, Soma!

272
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:02,119
Kairi, why...

273
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:05,186
Your door was unlocked. Be more careful, Nee-chan.

274
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:07,786
I'll watch that, but why are you here?

275
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:11,919
These are Mom's thanks for the sweets you sent.

276
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:19,019
But listen, Soma! I'm coming on this trip with you!

277
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:21,186
You won't lay a finger on her.

278
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:22,652
Hey...

279
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:25,619
Sure, go ahead. Right, Kotori-san?

280
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,652
Another day, another amazing tea.

281
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:38,852
You think they'll bring back steamed sweet buns?

282
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:41,552
I want to go see the Northern Lights.

283
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:44,786
Maybe I'll go camping.

284
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:46,886
I recommend Yamanashi Prefecture.

285
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:48,519
Oh, the lakes, right?

286
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,019
No reservation needed.

287
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:53,419
- Oh yes, they're the best!
- The best, right?

288
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,852
- I want to go, too!
- Me, too!

289
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:56,410
Take us.

290
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,710
Let's all go.

291
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,710
Sorry, I'm late.

292
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,380
Did you wait long?

293
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,500
Don't worry. I just got here.

294
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:09,619
Wait, where's Kairi-san?

295
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,686
He went home this morning,

296
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:15,586
despite what he said.

297
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:16,786
Is it all fine?

298
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:19,980
Yes, I'll make it up to him later.

299
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,719
Let's go, Soma-kun.

300
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,819
"Ryosuke."

301
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,732
What?

302
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,190
Call me by my first name.

303
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,670
♫ What makes you laugh? ♫

304
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,880
♫ I want to be by your side ♫

305
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,819
Let's go, Ryosuke-kun.

306
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,086
Let's go, Kotori-san.

307
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,530
♫ Tell me I'm cute ♫

308
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,050
♫ I put on the lipstick that's darker than usual ♫

309
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,119
Can't wait to go to Hakone.

310
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,419
Yes, I can't wait!

311
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,319
I'm glad the weather's nice.

312
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,786
I'm warm today.

313
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:08,452
- Kotori and...
- Ryosuke.

314
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:11,952
- The high body temp girl...
- And the low body temp guy's...

315
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,719
- diaries!
- diaries!

316
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,650
Welcome.

317
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,052
Takeout, two medium coffees, please.

318
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:22,219
Hot or iced?

319
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:23,952
- Iced.
- Hot.

320
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,352
- Iced. Come on!
- Hot.
