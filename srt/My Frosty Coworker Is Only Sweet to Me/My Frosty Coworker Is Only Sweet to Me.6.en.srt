1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,314
You two met at work?

2
00:00:05,314 --> 00:00:07,940
What a coincidence!

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,173
Maybe it's fate.

4
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,120
What?

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,606
Your Hokkaido carpaccio.

6
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:19,433
I got it, thanks.

7
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,854
Why that reaction?

8
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:24,987
No, no, it's not like that at all.

9
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:28,987
- Right?
- Y-Yes, right.

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,920
Did Nakano-kun from our hometown really get married?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,380
Yes, he even became a dad this year.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,154
What? "A dad"?

13
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:40,020
Wow.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,320
Do you have someone special, Kotori?

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,254
You do, yes?

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,420
Actually...

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,587
Recently...

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I started seeing someone.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,417
- Whoa!
- Congrats!

20
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:06,333
What's he like? Older or younger? How long?

21
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:10,726
He's younger. We just started dating.

22
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:13,487
What do you like about him?

23
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:16,620
Well...

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,920
I can't really put it into words,

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,110
but he's very

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,180
dear to me.

27
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,054
- Oh, how nice!
- The early days are great.

28
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:32,120
Right, Takamine?

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,830
Yes, right.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,254
Congrats.

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,087
Thanks.

Recently...

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,687
Soma-kun has a low body temp and is frosty to all at work.

34
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,187
But to me, his nosy co-worker with a rather high body temp...

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,854
he's super sweet for some reason.

Okay. Then let's do this again sometime.

We're this way so see you.

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,754
Kotori-san!

59
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:31,020
Soma-kun!

60
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,854
Why is Takamine-san here?

61
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,587
Wasn't it a girls' night?

62
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,087
Well, you see...

63
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:46,987
Plans changed at the last minute so it became a mini reunion.

64
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:49,120
We both found out there.

- Right?
- Yes.

66
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:56,454
I'm sorry, Soma-kun. I was going to text you.

67
00:03:56,454 --> 00:04:00,120
It's not like you could have done anything.

68
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,942
So the boyfriend you mentioned earlier...

69
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,025
It's me.

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,287
Wait, your hands are like blocks of ice!

71
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:26,320
You need to wear more layers.

72
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,220
Here. I told you before to keep your neck warm.

73
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,787
Well, then I'm going that way.

74
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:41,254
I'll see you at work.

75
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:43,754
Yes, see you.

76
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,020
Let's go.

77
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,554
As long as Ogata is happy,

78
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:02,087
I can still back out of it.

79
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:06,720
I'll put a lid on my feelings before they grow bigger.

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,618
Is he angry?

81
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:18,552
You said the plans changed last minute,

82
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:22,660
but it didn't feel good seeing you with another guy.

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,353
Of course.

84
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:28,586
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:32,320
But you told them about me, right?

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,120
Takamine-san said you mentioned having a boyfriend.

87
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,286
The topic came up.

88
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:50,053
I told them that I'm seeing someone very special.

89
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:53,086
Oh, I'm blushing!

90
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,953
Then Kotori-san,

91
00:05:55,953 --> 00:06:00,093
now on, let me know if anything comes up,

92
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,561
whether it's good or bad.

93
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:07,986
Let's gradually create something like our own little promises.

94
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,815
"Our" promise.

95
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,914
Okay.

96
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I don't want to make you worry, either.

97
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,453
So if something ever bothers you, tell me.

98
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,627
Then if we go to a drinking party with the opposite sex,

99
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,420
let's tell each other beforehand.

100
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:39,986
It's okay if it's for work though.

101
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:42,853
Sounds good.

102
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,753
Do you want any terms?

103
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,320
Let's see...

104
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,686
At work, I'd prefer we maintain a senpai–kohai relationship.

105
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,653
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,742
I'll be careful from now on.

107
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,386
Thanks.

108
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:09,853
I wasn't really sure how this dating thing worked, but...

109
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:12,886
Can we go on a shopping date next?

110
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:15,420
Oh yes, you mentioned that before.

111
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,420
I realize now. We will figure it out together.

112
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,352
I liked that washing machine.

113
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:25,619
Me, too.

114
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,219
- Right?
- Yes.

115
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,252
Weren't you going to get a heater? They had some good ones.

116
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:35,219
I'll get one online.

117
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,052
Was it cheaper?

118
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,586
About the same.

119
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:42,486
Then buy it now to use it right away.

120
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:48,386
But I'd have to carry it so I couldn't hold your hand.

121
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,519
I also liked the robot cleaners.

122
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,786
What do you want?

123
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:56,786
Let me see... a croissant.

124
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:59,886
Two croissants and...

125
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:02,486
- To drink...
- As for drinks...

126
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:04,152
An iced coffee for me.

127
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:07,119
One iced and one hot coffee, both tall.

128
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,152
Okay.

129
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:10,786
That'll be 2,300 yen (15.50 USD).

130
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,250
I got it. I'll pay.

131
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,850
No, let me.

132
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:16,786
Next time. Tap to pay?

133
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:18,586
- The crois... Hey!
- Look, look.

134
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:22,252
The croissant is bigger than your face!

135
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,652
- Incredible! Let's dig in.
- Yes.

136
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,186
Tasty.

137
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:33,019
- Delicious, isn't it?
- Yes.

138
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,770
I've never dated before.

139
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,960
I'd appreciate it if we could take it slow.

140
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,786
How slow is slow?

141
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:54,030
Her feelings are important to me, but...

142
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,896
She's just too cute; I don't know if I can take it slow.

143
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,266
Would you like to come in?

144
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,866
Yes!

145
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,780
Have that ginger tea while the room warms up.

146
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,552
Thank you.

147
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:22,052
And use these to keep you warm.

148
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,952
Your legs might get cold. Sorry for walking in front of you.

149
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,786
Kotori-san.

150
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,786
This will warm me up best.

151
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,786
R-Really?

152
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,752
I had a lot of fun on today’s date.

153
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,352
Me, too.

154
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:04,952
Well...

155
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,110
Are you not going to kiss me today?

156
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,086
I mean, I don't think I can stop if I start.

157
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,619
I don't want to do anything you don't want.

158
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,019
I want you to...

159
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,786
Kotori-san...

160
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,919
Hey, Nee-chan, let me stay the ni...

161
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,519

162
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,586
Who the heck is this guy?

163
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,686
Wh-What are you doing here?

164
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,740
I went to visit a friend, but his girlfriend was there.

165
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,686
This is from Mom.

166
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,419

Soma-kun, this is my little brother, Kairi.

171

173
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,219
Impression: cold and unfriendly.

174
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:45,119
I don't like it!

175
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:49,919
Face: nice, very "now."

176
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,819
I don't like it!

177
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:56,786
Body shape: tall and killer body.

178
00:11:56,786 --> 00:11:58,786
I don't like it!

179
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,950
Conclusion...

00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:05,870
I don't like him, at all!

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,252
You're toying with Neechan (older sister), aren't you?

What are you saying? Soma-kun would never do that!

183
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:14,119
I'm not toying with her.

184
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:18,286
I love everything about her. This is serious.

185
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:22,730
Then say you didn't touch her,

186
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,450
although you're in her room so late!

187
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,886
How dare you do this to my nee-chan, you scoundrel!

188
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,486
You must have been flirting with her!

189
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:38,943
Stop it, Kairi. You've got it all wrong.

190
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,519
Fine, I'll play your game.

191
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,152
I've got old photos of her!

192
00:12:48,152 --> 00:12:50,261
I've got lots of them.

193
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,352
- Jealous?
- Can I see those?

194
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:56,252
- Hey, stop it...
- Kairi-san, wait!

195
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:59,052
I'm not showing you anything!

196
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:02,552
- How mortifying...
- Fine.

197
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:09,352
I've got a very recent photo of Kotori-san blissfully eating dorayaki.

198
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:12,286
"A very recent photo"?

199
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:15,170
When did you take that?

200
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,619
Would you like to see?

201
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:22,837
Kill me now...

202
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:28,186
Sure!

203
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,652
Hey...

204
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:30,886
Look here.

205
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:34,877
When she eats, her face hasn't changed since back then.

206
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:36,505
She looks so contented.

207
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:38,952
I love how she looks when she eats.

208
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,650
Right? That's my nee-chan for you.

209
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:45,519
Both of you, that's enough!

210
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,586
Yes, that's enough! Go on and leave!

211
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:49,886
Kairi!

212
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:56,386
No, I'm staying until you know I'm serious about her.

213
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:00,919
Are you staying?

214
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:04,652
So cute...

215
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:13,430
I can't believe I'm letting both Kairi and Soma-kun sleep over.

216
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:17,752
I'm sorry for ending up staying over.

217
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:23,019
It's okay. I'm sorry that Kairi is being so rude.

218
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,952
You can use that to sleep.

219
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:27,052
Thank you.

220
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:33,786
It's great you two get along.

221
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:38,319
Is it getting along, or is he just clingy?

222
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:41,352
Do you have any siblings?

223
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:46,319
I have one older brother.

224
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:50,419
Really? What is he like?

225
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:53,286
He's quite normal.

226
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:58,152
He doesn't seem to want to talk about him.

227
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:04,886
I see. Normal is best though, unlike my brother.

228
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:08,152
I'm a bit jealous, to be honest.

229
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:13,119
My brother is more like a stranger to me.

230
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:16,052
"Like a stranger"?

231
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:20,852
There must be a story.

232
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:44,219
Hey! Don't make out while I'm in the shower!

233
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:48,110
You're not a child anymore! Dry yourself off already!

234
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,350
You’re dripping everywhere!

235
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:52,852
Hey, you!

236
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,952
I'm sleeping next to Nee-chan tonight!

237
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:58,952
I'll be on guard all night.

238
00:15:58,952 --> 00:16:02,552
It's too cold for this; go back now.

239
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:06,219
Quickly! You're all wet.

240
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:08,586
Hot...

241
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:25,919
Is Soma-kun fine? Is he getting any sleep?

242
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:34,686
- Soma-kun?
- Quiet.

243
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:46,652
Give me your hand.

244
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:50,286
Okay.

245
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:57,952
- You're warm.
- You're cool.

246
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:06,319
I'll settle for just this today.

247
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,319
Good night.

248
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,252
Good night.

249
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:31,819
How can I sleep with Soma-kun sleeping so close to me?

250
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,852
Chill... Easy now...

251
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:39,852
Hold your fire...

252
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:48,019
I couldn't sleep.

253
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:52,219
At all.

254
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,419
Get your energy up, you two!

255
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,919
Here, I made breakfast. Eat this and wake up.

256
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:03,286
I haven't had your cooking in ages!

257
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:04,986
- Here you go.
- Wow, it looks good.

258
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:08,300
It doesn't just look good; it is good.

259
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:11,886
Sorry, Nee-chan. Thanks. Let Soma do it.

260
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,519
- Sure.
- Looks great.

261
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,852
Eat up, Onee-chan.

262
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:16,386
Sure. Thanks.

263
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,152
- Thank you, Kairi-san.
- Go ahead.

264
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:21,919
How is it?

265
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,519
Haven't tried it yet!

266
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,119
Eat up already.

267
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,452
It's really good!

268
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:29,386
Of course, it is!

269
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:35,997
Kairi is studying super hard at culinary school to become a chef.

270
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:37,486
That's amazing.

271
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:40,952
I'm not a great cook so I really admire you.

272
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:49,219
At least learn to make porridge for when Nee-chan is ill.

273
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:53,086
Got it, I'll practice.

274
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:57,019
It feels a bit tingly to have my family and boyfriend here.

275
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,319
- Eat up.
- Sure.

276
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:04,986
But that means Soma-kun is slowly becoming a part of my life...

277
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:07,419
and that makes me so happy.

278
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:10,019
Is something wrong?

279
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,519
No, nothing.

280
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,552
Do you like it?

281
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:18,652
- Very fluffy.
- It is, right?

282
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:23,586
I haven't accepted you yet!

283
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:26,650
Hurt her and I'll come after you!

284
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:29,552
Don't worry.

285
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:33,619
I'll stand by her.

286
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:36,252
Hey, hands off!

287
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:40,786
Kairi, go on, you'll be late for your part-time job!

288
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:44,119
Darn it, I'll come check on you again.

289
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,719
- Bye bye, Nee-chan.
- Take care.

290
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,486
Bye bye.

291
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:53,852
Honestly...

292
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:55,952
He's a tornado, here and gone.

293
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:58,819
He was such a pain. I'm so sorry.

294
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:03,852
No, it was nice to see what real siblings are like.

295
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:09,386
Let's do a proper sleepover again soon, though.

296
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,686
Shall we?

297
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,486
What's wrong?

298
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:25,819
We've got that long weekend next month.

299
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:27,086
Right.

300
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:29,252
Why the sigh? It's good, though.

301
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:33,052
That just pushes up the deadlines.

302
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:36,786
I can't get motivated until it's almost due.

303
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,352
I suppose.

304
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:41,686
I'll bet you have plans for fun already.

305
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:43,752
Of course.

306
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:46,752
But you know...

307
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:50,886
Long weekend with my dear Kotori-san.

308
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:55,219
Search "recommended vacation spot for couples."

309
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:01,452
Sorry I'm late, Soma-kun.

310
00:21:01,452 --> 00:21:05,619
No, you weren't late. Want to go get dinner?

311
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:09,252
Before we do...

312
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:12,870
The limited sweets go on sale today.

313
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:16,086
So can we stop by Aiya?

314
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:21,023
Sure, of course.

315
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,686
Thanks.

316
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:30,986
I'll wait over here.

317
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:32,652
Oh, okay.

318
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:34,819
I'll be right back.

319
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,990
I saw you the other day.

320
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:44,686
Oh, you're one of our valued customers.

321
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:47,228
Thank you for your patronage.

322
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:49,252
Not at all.

323
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:55,581
Look, it's someone unexpected.

324
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,086
Why are you here?

325
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,686
Is that all you say after so long?

326
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:08,052
You never change, do you?

327
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:10,919
You know him, Soma-kun?

328
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,286
Sorry for not introducing myself earlier.

329
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:18,486
Thanks for caring for my otouto (younger brother).

330
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:24,623
"Ayato Soma"?

331
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:26,530
S-Soma?

332
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,852
What? Is he Soma-kun's older brother?

333
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:36,886
Pleasure to meet you.

334
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:41,352
I'm Kotori Ogata, one of Soma's co-workers.

335
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:44,519
"Co-worker"?

336
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,619
Is that so?

337
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:52,552
I never thought I'd see you here.

338
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:55,450
It's been six years.

339
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:58,719
Glad to see you are well.

340
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:05,080
So when are you returning to Kyoto?

341
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:09,486
I thought I made it clear; I'll never return there.

342
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,152
Let's go, Kotori-san.

343
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:24,219
Soma-kun?
