Vit just wanna pick us up as his car is bigger,
and you and Dangjai can sit comfortably.

19
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:43,610
I love everything if it's from you.

20
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,473
If you're so fed up then move out with him!

21
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:48,152
Who else can bear your mood swings! Huh!

22
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:49,973

00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,592

00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,334
Did you get hurt?

25
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:54,527
Appreciated, Vit.

26
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:58,101
I'm sorry...

27
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:01,125
for getting you in trouble with Koon

28
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,719
You knew it...

29
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,640
You had a loud fight and how couldn't your neighbor not know.

30
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:16,362
I'm sorry too for troubling you with this nonsense.

31
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,603
Koon... he's just made things up and you know he's...

32
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,562
He's true to say such a thing.

33
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,866
I know that you secretly...

34
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,072
feel something for me.

35
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,741
And I feel the same

36
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:49,272
I don't know if you can sense it.

37
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:53,278
But I want you to know

38
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,137
I've fallen for you...

39
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:02,888
since day one.

40
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,425
I like everything about you.

41
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:44,273
If you're so fed up then move out with him! Go!

42
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:45,974
You like him tho!

43
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,466
Sorry. I'm not feeling the same as you do.

44
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,711
-I'm sorry...
-I'm sorry...

45
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,325
I'm so sorry...

46
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,869
for scolding you.

47
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:11,484
I'm sorry for mine too.

48
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,632
I won't think that way anymore.

49
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:21,114
And you won't leave me, right?

50
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:28,950
How could I, because I love you so much.

51
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:08,907
I've fallen for you... since day one.

52
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:24,707
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

53
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,558
Thanks but I'll drive today.

54
00:09:57,874 --> 00:10:01,843
Haven't had lunch? The break is almost up.

55
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:04,540
We had some bread already.

56
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,009
And what are you guys doing?

57
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,134
Reading a novel, bro.

58
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:17,675
The writer is so great. I'm a fan of his writing, reading and buying all.

59
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:20,477
Sit down and let me read to you

60
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:24,412
This novel just makes me think of you.

61
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:33,338
What novel?

62
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:36,226
"The Sin of Falling for a Next Door"

63
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:38,447
Let me read to you tho.

64
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:45,830
"I may need to fall out of love,
as the one living with him turned out to be his lover for years."

65
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:53,334
[Vit's voice]
"And this sin made me uneasy as I knew he was the right one."

66
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:59,769
[Vit's voice] "But how come did he have a lover?
I might need to stop feeling for him."

67
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:09,293
[Vit's voice] "But how easily could I do that?
Because I've fallen for him since day one."

68
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:20,507
[Vit's voice] "His smile makd my heart swelled."

69
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:29,795
[Vit's voice] "I wanted to have him in my life.
I wanted to own his body and heart."

70
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:36,161
[Vit's voice] "But that's just all in my dream."

71
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:41,987
Taw.

72
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,839
Taw!

73
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:54,724
Taw!

74
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,584
Huh. Got mesmerized?

75
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:01,973
Mesmerized for what?

76
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:09,520
I just didn't listen to your reading.
Just thought about what the boss asked me to do.

77
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,395
Duh! So annoyed you didn't listen!

78
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:16,276
Duh! Lemme have some coffee.

79
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:22,679
Brother Taw...

80
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,378
You might wanna find some time to read this one as it's written well.

81
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:33,642
His pen name 'Burning.'

82
00:12:38,114 --> 00:12:41,023
-'Burning?'
-Uh-huh.

83
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:45,631
What's the matter?

84
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,729
You know him?

85
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:53,953
Really?

86
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,200
-More than you know.
-Oh.

87
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,581
How? Tell me! How do you happen to know him?

88
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:09,029
-He's just my next door.
-Oh. How come you have so much luck.

89
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,063
Then...

90
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,406
Does he look handsome? I just know him in photos.

91
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:24,581
-Quite tho. Yet so cool.
-Ohh.

92
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:37,670
-I wanna meet him once. But how tho?
-Next time you can visit me and I'll introduce him to you.

93
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,193
-Are you for real?
-Yep.

94
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:45,053
-Oh my gosh. Don't trick me.
-Stop.

95
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:50,944
-And why are you so fanatic?
-You don't know me being a huge fan.

96
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,560
-Can you have Mr. Burning sign in the book for me?
-Mhm.

97
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,557
Thanks! Now lemme get to my work.

98
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,584
Taw, babe.

99
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,987
Sweet smelling!

100
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:21,851
-What's the matter?
-I'll have you train me in some work that needs 'finishing.'

101
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:24,460
Just wait there. I'll go now.

102
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:30,271
I'm so fed up.

103
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,982
[Is he crazy?]

104
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:36,824
Koon

105
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,849
-Koon.
-I'm here.

106
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:48,954
-Can I have a talk with you?
-Sure.

107
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,678
What's the matter?

108
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:58,758
Umm...

109
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:09,476
Thanks.

110
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,278
What's the matter?

111
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:15,536
Umm...

112
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:21,992
Last night I heard you and Taw fight, so I want to explain.

113
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:33,133
I don't feel anything for Taw.
The reason I help you guys is because I admire your love.

114
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:36,116
And...

115
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:43,914
I'm a single child and dream all my life of having a brother.

116
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:49,757
Until I've met you both who hit it off and that Taw call me brother

117
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:56,751
So, if possible, I'd be glad if I can be your brother too.

118
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:58,476
Is that possible?

119
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:04,186
Umm... I've talked to Taw about all and realized I'm overly worried.

120
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:12,473
I only have Taw in my life.
I love him so much that I fear losing him.

121
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:17,204
I need to apologize to you by the way.

122
00:16:17,204 --> 00:16:21,556
And for your asking, I can call you brother anyway.

123
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:37,704
Another thing is that Taw avoids me for fear that it disturbs you.

124
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,798
And I don't like this kind of thing.

125
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:46,196
-Can you...
-I'll talk to him about it.

126
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:53,146
Really? Thanks! I'm glad to have not one but two brothers.

127
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:59,897
Then I'm your older brother and I'll call you younger brother.

128
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:02,308
Okay.

129
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:30,106
Don't think being a boss should be bossy, duh.

130
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:43,752
[brother Vit]

131
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,492
"I'm sorry for last night. Don't be like this. I won't do it again."

132
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,374
-What's that!
-Eh!

133
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:12,604
Oh no. I'm sorry.

134
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,195
I'm so sorry.

135
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:18,132
Never mind. I was not careful enough tho.

136
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:22,323
Oy! Let me buy you a new one then.

137
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:24,987
No. I'll have it repaired.

138
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:30,044
Let me pay for the repair. But I don't think it will work.

139
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:33,550
-Let me buy you a new one then.
-No.

140
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:53,099
-Look! Uncle Taw has arrived.
-Hello!

141
00:18:56,795 --> 00:19:02,422
I called you but no answer.
Just wanna ask what to have so that I'll cook for you.

142
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:10,023
My phone just broke. I had it repaired but wouldn't work.
I need a new one.

143
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:19,538
-You can have mine for now tho.
-Never mind. I'll buy a cheap one once I get my salary.

144
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:21,716
Are you sure?

145
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:31,495
-I'll buy you a new one!
-How can you afford?

146
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:40,542
Look at me now!

147
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:45,486
Hello, audience! See you again this time...

148
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:53,604
Today I have lots for you to shop.
First come first serve and now or never!

149
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:58,526
Oh. Lots of good stuff! Let me see the comments tho.

150
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:04,412
Mr. Put asked if I could try on a T-shirt.

151
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,851
This one?

152
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:12,676
Alright. I'll try on it and you need to get one, okay?

153
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:20,592
Ms. Nee asked if I could stay topless during the live.
No, no. I could get cold to death!

154
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:26,435
It looks a bit big. Oh, what? You bought this one?

155
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:30,565
Thanks so much. Let me change my top.

156
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:38,182
Umph!

157
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:45,124
-Look at this! Free size for all types!
-Let me help.

158
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:49,578
Do you like it?

159
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:54,164
-You'll get two? Oh thanks, Mr. Tom.
-Thank you.

160
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:58,163
-Koon.
-Hm?

161
00:20:58,163 --> 00:21:06,184
-I'll take the bus. You need the car more than I do.
-Never mind. I'm comfy with all. You take it then.

162
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:14,942
-We've talked that who needs it more will have it. You do for today.
-No. You have it. I can go myself.

163
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,429
Anything I can help?

164
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:23,664
Oh. We're deciding who'll use the car.

165
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,720
-Koon...
-And we cannot decide.

166
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:33,960
-I said that you need it more to deliver your stuff. I can go myself.
-No.

167
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,165
-How about I give you a ride, Taw?
-Never mind tho.

168
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,628
-I think it's a good idea.
-But...

169
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:49,504
We've talked about it.
I believe there's no such a thing between you and Vit

170
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:53,050
Let him do it. Come on.

171
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:56,441
Come one babe.

172
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:03,779
-Get in.
-Take care of him.

173
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:23,194
So scared of me?

174
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:25,991
No.

175
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,113
-Or you feel angry and disgusted toward me?
-No.

176
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:36,413
Then make yourself comfy. Don't feel awkward.

177
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:45,135
I'm sorry for that day.

178
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:52,560
I didn't mean to do that. But my feeling led me.

179
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:57,380
Don't mention it. I don't wanna talk about it.

180
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:05,097
-What did you say to Koon?
-We've talked and become in good terms.

181
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:08,679
And for you, I also wanna make myself clear.

182
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:10,825
About what?

183
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,900
Just to make myself clear about the love affair.

184
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:25,274
I just wanna tell you that what I said that day was from my heart.

185
00:23:27,592 --> 00:23:32,535
And I felt that for real, not just my sudden feeling.

186
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,954
-But I have my boyfriend.
-I know.

187
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,783
I just wanna tell you my feeling. for you

188
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,379
I'm sorry. I cannot leave Koon.

189
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,664
I know. And I don't want you to do so.

190
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:02,599
I just regret meeting you too late.

191
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:10,514
If we met faster, I wanted to know if I was the right one.

192
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,788
Welcome!

193
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:52,675
-Qatar!
-Koon!

194
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,617
Why stunned for too long?

195
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:21,815
Oh.

196
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:29,610
-You work here, Tar?
-It's my cafe.

197
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:38,549
-Really? Looks good.
-What's to have?

198
00:25:39,682 --> 00:25:43,196
How long we haven't seen each other?

199
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:46,474
Since you decided to break up with me.

200
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,394
But I understand you. Your dad was so strict back then.

201
00:25:54,894 --> 00:25:58,566
I would have done the same if I had been you.

202
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:06,830
-Thanks for having no hard feelings.
-I might. But I understand you anyway.

203
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:13,262
Long time no see. Let's update. Are you busy for now?

204
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:19,194
Not really. But just a few minutes as my nephew's waiting.

205
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:21,811
Your nephew's with you?

206
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:28,691
Why don't you take him in for the air and some dessert?
It's my treat for your nephew.

207
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:32,182
Okay.

208
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:51,512
"Thank you Bubble for your support.
Hope you remain my no.1 supporter forever."

209
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:56,085
Oh my gosh! Thanks, Taw!

210
00:26:56,085 --> 00:27:00,730
This makes my life complete.

211
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,506
And even more complete as Vit invites you for a meal!

212
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,543
-Really?
-Uhm.

213
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:17,178
Oh, no! Am I dreaming? Slap me!

214
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,526
-Do it!
-Ouch!

215
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:24,817
-Hurt?
-Who doesn't!

216
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:30,709
-Then you're not dreaming. Wanna go?
-Oh no! It's real?

217
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:33,714
-Did he invite me for real?
-Yep.

218
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:46,350
-Dangjai, say hi to Uncle Qatar.
-Hi.

219
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:52,149
Why look stunned. This is my nephew, not my kid.

220
00:27:55,437 --> 00:28:00,514
Oh yeah. The one you talked about. He looks adorable.

221
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:10,275
What about you? Long time no see and you look more handsome.

222
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:17,187
-And do you have a lover?
-Hold on.

223
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:31,128
Oh. You need to show the photos instead to make me believe.
You're so crazy in love.

224
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:40,917
-You weren't like this when we had a relationship.
-Yeah. We were too young and you knew how dad was.

225
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:51,541
-And you. Any lover?
-Nobody. Just focus on the cafe and no time for such a thing.

226
00:28:53,223 --> 00:29:01,363
-You might wanna think of a lover who can help you with the cafe.
-You wanna help me with the cafe?

227
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:17,600
-Anyway, you have card reading service?
-You know I have a sixth sense and can read cards.

228
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,757
-Interested?
-Nope. I don't like being read by cards.

229
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:30,589
-Come on, just try it. Or to prove how well I do it.

230
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,128
As you like it.

231
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:39,574
Give me your hand.

232
00:29:45,987 --> 00:29:49,471
You said just try. Why so serious?

233
00:29:53,128 --> 00:29:58,678
Shuffle the cards based on your age and plus one.
Stay mindful while doing it.

234
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:24,485
Pick ten cards.

235
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:16,817
Koon, what have you done? Why the cards read like this?

236
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:31,412
-Taw!
-Huh!

237
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:37,600
-This.
-What's this?

238
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,601
-A new phone. Just bought it for you.
-I said don't.

239
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:53,569
-But I broke yours. Lemme get it right tho. Take it.
-You're so persistent. I said no.

240
00:31:54,301 --> 00:32:03,898
-Um... I'll use it tho, but just only for your call. Okay?
-Who the heck okay?

241
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:13,347
-But at least I've redeemed my mistake for you.
-Redeemed me what?

242
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:22,592
Your VIP client Mr. Suchart messaged, saying he couldn't reach out to you. He wanted to sign contracts today.

243
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:26,200
Oh. I just forgot.

244
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:34,009
-Never mind. I did it all so that you won't be sacked if the boss knows you missed a meeting with the VIP.

245
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,821
-And take this for the boss. He's waiting.
-Thank you so much.

246
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:44,520
Would be nice if it turns to something else.

247
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,502
-Ouch!
-No!

248
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:50,161
-Go give it to him.
-Yeah. Thanks by the way.

249
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:54,362
Koon.

250
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:02,600
Wear this for your safety. Your cards read so bad.

251
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:14,867
It's not usual for a person to pick lots of bad omen cards, but you got Wheel of Fortune, Death, Tower, Justice, and Ghost.

252
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:21,403
But if you don't believe it, then wear it as an accessory.

253
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:27,381
-Mhm.
-Take it.

254
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:39,866
Koon, if something bad happens, just reach out to me.

255
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:54,898
I'll tell you one thing.
You're not good at reading cards as my life's been happy lately.

256
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,033
I may go.

257
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:19,548
You cannot eat my face. Let's eat pizzas then.

258
00:34:21,343 --> 00:34:28,167
Um, sorry tho. I don't expect to meet you in person.
It's like I'm dreaming.

259
00:34:36,332 --> 00:34:40,887
-What's that?
-You're still mindful, then it's not a dream.

260
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:46,915
You know how to crack real jokes.

261
00:34:55,026 --> 00:35:02,760
-Eat as much as you want. It's my treat.
-Okay. I'll eat to the fullest then.

262
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:16,516
Next time you should invite Bubble again.
You both seem to get along well.

263
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:19,345
Alright, I'll go to the restroom.

264
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:34,340
-You want anything more? May I get my phone for a few minutes?
-Nothing. Take your time.

265
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,579
-I'll be back.
-Sooner better.

266
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,075
You said you'll go to the restroom?

267
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:55,605
Jealous?

268
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,851
Jealous of what?

269
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,216
We're not in a relationship. It's all you business.

270
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:19,834
Vit, can you spoil me the end of 'The Sin of Falling for a Next Door.' Will the next door end up with his neighbor?

271
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:33,154
-I wonder too. Will they end up together?
-Oh. You won't spoil. But I'll wait for your next plot.

272
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,339
Let's eat.

273
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:46,604
-I didn't expect Bubble to be so crazy about you.
-I like him. He's cute and lively.

274
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:53,057
-Will you flirt with him? I can help.
-You know exactly who I love.

275
00:36:55,096 --> 00:37:01,108
But that's fine as we've agreed not to mention it again.

276
00:37:02,468 --> 00:37:08,334
-And what about your phone. When to buy it?
-Late this month.

277
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:17,972
But this is just early in the month.
You can take my old one as I got a new one from my editor.

278
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:24,106
-Never mind. I don't wanna bother you.
-Don't think so. We're close enough.

279
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:31,434
Can I buy from you instead? With a cheap price and installment.

280
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:38,662
I won't sell it but give it for free. If you're not comfortable with it then just think you're borrowing it from me.

281
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:51,567
Don't be too serious. It's useless in my drawer. Just a waste of it.

282
00:37:54,161 --> 00:37:55,086
You take it tho.

283
00:37:57,601 --> 00:37:58,632
Okay.

284
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,957
Aaah!

285
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:46,568
Oww.

286
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:59,598
-Koon.
-Oww!

287
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:07,740
-Koon, are you okay?
-I'm okay. Just finding a bracelet.

288
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:18,606
-What bracelet?
-Oh. I met my old friend and he gave it to me as an amulet.

289
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:23,367
Old friend? I guess not an ordinary one.

290
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:33,936
Um... he's actually my ex.
But if you're uncomfortable with it I can return it to him.

291
00:39:36,147 --> 00:39:43,005
Why uncomfortable?
I know you won't cheat on me. Don't get overconcerned.

292
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:52,064
You bought a new phone? I said I'll buy it for you.

293
00:39:53,702 --> 00:40:02,414
I didn't buy it.
My boss gave it to me because I need it for work.

294
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:13,818
-It looks expensive. Your boss is so generous.
-I dunno if it's expensive. I'm familiar with the cheap ones.

295
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:21,884
So, I'll buy you a new one more expensive than this.

296
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:29,973
Thanks babe. But I prefer a cheap one.

297
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:34,795
-Eh, I'll take a shower now.
-I'll go with you.

298
00:40:34,795 --> 00:40:36,581
Oww!

299
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:40,174
-What?
-Let's go.

300
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:22,623
-Taw, Dangjai is having a temperature. Let's take a look.
-Okay.

301
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,673
-He's in a good state. Nothing else.
-But the thermometer showed 39.5.

302
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:34,924
If we don't take him to see the doctor he'll get worse.

303
00:41:34,924 --> 00:41:40,115
I think we should wipe him, get him some pills, and observe his symptoms.

304
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:45,415
-But we don't have a pill for a child.
-Then use the one for adults but with half pill.

305
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:48,749
We can't! I'm afraid Dangjai will get worse.

306
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:59,525
-Can you go buy a fever reducer for children? Please.
-Koon! It's pouring outside and how can you let me go.

307
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:03,726
If you're not going to buy a pill then take him to the doctor.

308
00:42:03,726 --> 00:42:09,288
Wipe him, and give him half of the pill for adults. He'll be fine.

309
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:14,030
And you decide what to do. Go for the pill or go see the doctor.

310
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,148
-You ask me to go out for real?
-Yes.

311
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:23,166
Sure enough! I'll get it for you.

312
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:54,476
What's happening? Get inside.

313
00:43:14,527 --> 00:43:18,471
Stay strong, Dangjai.
Uncle Taw is going for your pill.

314
00:43:32,414 --> 00:43:36,769
I don't wanna get angry, but it's too much.

315
00:43:38,193 --> 00:43:42,755
He asked me to go out in this pouring rain for the pill.

316
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:50,857
You should take Koon to consult the doctor. I know that taking the same medicine might cause a drug resistance.

317
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:59,455
He won't go. And if I force him more, he might not take even a pill and get worse.

318
00:44:25,052 --> 00:44:30,844
I saw you look at me and think you might wanna touch me.

319
00:44:57,363 --> 00:45:02,849
-How was it? You like it?
-You should do this.

320
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:16,204
-You don't need to fear.
-I don't like thunders.

321
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,724
It's terrifying.

322
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:25,323
I mean... you don't need to fear being true to your feeling.

323
00:45:26,277 --> 00:45:32,864
If his love is unbearable, then he's not the right one.

324
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:40,923
Don't fear doing wrong... because you deserve happiness.

325
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:07,073
You wanna go see him so you just fake the story, right?

326
00:47:07,697 --> 00:47:11,803
-So you're jealous?
-It's your business to love or feel for anyone.

327
00:47:16,352 --> 00:47:20,963
