10
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:19,435
I want you to see the storeroom.
I think there's something strange.

11
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:24,935
You're not delusional. There exist the ghosts.

12
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:25,811
Koon!

13
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:26,892
Taw!

14
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:28,457
Nobody can help you!

15
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:35,042
You wanna meet him so you make things up?

16
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:39,347
-Jealous?
-Why so? I don't care about your charisma or love affair.

17
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:43,000
I saw the two owners. They are a cute couple.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,620
Such a lovely couple.

19
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,035
Umph.

20
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:53,792
So relaxing to take a rest.

21
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:57,716
Wanna have some drink?

22
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:02,844
Hm... just a glass of red soda.

23
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:06,202
-Ken.
-Yep?

24
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:09,818
-Can I have one red soda and one plum soda?
-Got it.

25
00:03:14,854 --> 00:03:16,441
What's the matter coming here?

26
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,149
What's that?

27
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:34,918
Um... Taw's uneasy thinking you and I feel for each other again.

28
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:41,651
Crazy! I just gave you a necklace tho. Don't mind it.

29
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:44,683
Just keep it for safety.

30
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:50,375
I don't wanna get into trouble with Taw.

31
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:57,936
You keep it. I'd better see ghosts than troubling with Taw.

32
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:09,333
If you have some big problems, reach out to me any time.

33
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:17,789
Though we broke up, my feeling for you still remains.

34
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:22,983
Thanks.

35
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,104
Koon's cheating on me. How dare!

36
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:38,107
He's doing so, and why are you hesitating?

37
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:43,960
What do you mean?

38
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,284
Our affair then.

39
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:54,991
Koon can do so, and it's not wrong for you and me to...

40
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:24,036
I don't we should do it... here.

41
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:26,948
How about in the room?

42
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,349
Calm down, boy.

43
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,026
Are you sure to do this?

44
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:55,848
Want me to act more?

45
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:06,941
Taw.

46
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:08,703
Taw!

47
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:12,637
Taaw.

48
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:18,622
-Lost in thought?
-Nope. Just pondering.

49
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:23,735
-I've finished the work. Please have a look.
-Okay. Be there soon.

50
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:30,248
-Eh. I've sent you what you asked.
-Thanks.

51
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:43,898
I've read Vit's novel. So fierce. Dunno if he's too.

52
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,627
Have a look at my work.

53
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:00,797
Bloody boy!

54
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:07,393
-Lucky you have your Uncle.
-Calm down. That's the way he does.

55
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,466
Not at home?

56
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,240
Hey, Thanwa. What's the matter?

57
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:30,076
I need to talk to you.

58
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:34,355
Let's talk inside then.

59
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:37,430
What's the matter?

60
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:42,179
-I need to warn you.
-Of what?

61
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:49,146
Your bloody handsome next-door...
Need to beware of him. I think he likes Taw.

62
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,699
-How do you know that?
-I saw him drop Taw off at the office.

63
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,567
Is it funny?

64
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:09,618
-I was the one asking Vit drive for Taw.
-Eh? How come... did you trust him?

65
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,924
He might be flirting with Taw.

66
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:20,284
Don't worry. I've talked to Vit about it.
He said he loves Taw as a brother.

67
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:30,456
I think you trust him too easily. Beware of a snake in the grass.

68
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,357
I don't trust him...

69
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,527
I just trust Taw.

70
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,296
Nothing to say more.

71
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:49,408
Maybe you need to distrust yours and you'll understand more.

72
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:52,486
Better watch out!

73
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:53,687
I gotta go.

74
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:13,336
-Did you drive today?
-Yeah. Why?

75
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:19,442
-Badly I can't give you a drive then.
-What? You said like you're flirting with Taw.

76
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:22,614
-Thanwa's just talking around. Crazy dude.

77
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:24,304
Let's go then.

78
00:10:26,513 --> 00:10:28,640
-Vit?
-Eh.

79
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:37,641
-What are you doing round here?
-Just done some work so I pick Taw up.

80
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:43,241
-Sorry then. Taw's driving today, aren't you?
-Yeah.

81
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:52,388
-Then pick me up. I'm not driving today.
-Stop there. You go with me.

82
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:58,547
-Why so?
-You need to discuss tomorrow's pitching.

83
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,027
-It's not tomorrow.
-It's been shifted for tomorrow.

84
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:09,731
-You might waste your time today.
-Not really.

85
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:16,963
Can I go for... a ride... with you?

86
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:28,805
Of course. A ride or whatever. All for you.

87
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:30,878
After you.

88
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:39,579
-This... this is too much.
-Say nothing! Get home!

89
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,649
And you get home to your beloved.

90
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:45,680
Go!

91
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:56,480
[Vit's voice] But the more you delude yourself about your feeling,
the less my feeling for you will become.

92
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:23,119
Your writing is... so fierce.

93
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,880
Like it?

94
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,397
Like it or not...

95
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:34,853
I need to prove it first.

96
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,153
Are you sure you wanna prove it?

97
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:44,308
Can't help if you get addicted to it.

98
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:52,339
Are you challenging me?

99
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,594
If you can.

100
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,472
Let's get in the room.

101
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,317
You can't change your mind.

102
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,533
You neither.

103
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:39,383
You got back.

104
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,592
Hm... I bought...

105
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:03,871
Aaah!

106
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:08,354
-What did you eat?
-Just a supplement.

107
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,534
Umph.

108
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,701
-What?
-Did you dodge for your ex today?

109
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:32,356
Taw.

110
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:38,548
I didn't dodge. I just returned him the necklace.

111
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,912
You don't want me to have it tho.

112
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:47,749
Do you feel for Qatar?
Why are you so caring about him?

113
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:54,897
Taw, why do you need to find faults while we're happy together?

114
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:59,259
Just wanna know tho.

115
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:03,876
Don't think you can hide me what you've done.

116
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,022
Taw.

117
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,738
My life has only you and Dangjai.

118
00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:19,863
I've never thought of cheating on you.
No one will ever replace both of you.

119
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,894
Come on.

120
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:32,424
I love you.

121
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:38,076
And I hope you don't cheat on me either.

122
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,576
I love you too.

123
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:49,200
I gotta apply the face cream.

124
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:59,358
Have you done it yet?
Let me do it for you then.

125
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:22,627
Done.

126
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:25,023
-Done?
-Um.

127
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,316
So light.

128
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,615
-Let's go to bed.
-Okie.

129
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:35,622
Koon.

130
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:40,104
Get back to bed and don't forget to take the pills.
Got it?

131
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:41,678
Got it.

132
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,813
Bye.

133
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,011
Wait.

134
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,518
Cheer me up.

135
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,004
Why so confused. I just want you to cheer me up.

136
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:04,218
Mwah.

137
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:13,873
Concentrate your work.

138
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:49,117
Make way, please.
I gotta be late.

139
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:51,522
You teased me?

140
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,300
Nope. Just wanted my lil to cheer me up.

141
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:00,771
Are you sure you didn't try to tease me?

142
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:07,766
Sure enough.
We're not in a relationship tho.

143
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:12,479
You wanna have sex with anyone? That's your business.

144
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:22,344
As I said, if you can't decide, I might fall out of love for you.

145
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:29,370
If you hold on, it's my choice to have sex with anyone.

146
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:36,777
And if you keep hold on,
you'll see me having sex with more and more.

147
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:02,792
Dangjai, I'll take you to bed.

148
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:08,803
I'll sleep here. Can you sleep here too?

149
00:21:14,195 --> 00:21:15,410
Of course.

150
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:35,539
Nin! Nin! How was it?

151
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:43,170
-Hey!
-Pakkad... she...

152
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:46,982
gave birth!

153
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:48,914
I'm a father now.

154
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:51,547
-Really?
-Yeah.

155
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:55,701
-Congratulations!
-And you're an uncle now.

156
00:21:55,701 --> 00:22:00,502
-Help me raise my child.
-Sure. I'll do my best.

157
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:02,150
-Whoo!

158
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:33,370
You're here. I've searching for you.

159
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:39,150
-What's the matter?
-I've got some news to tell you.

160
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:46,724
-What news?
-The news that Chopin already slept with that handsome guy.

161
00:22:48,196 --> 00:22:53,911
-Why did you tell me then?
-Just so you know and get over him.

162
00:22:56,427 --> 00:22:58,167
Get over what?

163
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:04,662
I didn't feel for him. We're brothers.
Stop your bloody idea.

164
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:10,917
Good for you. You know now that he's so wildly promiscuous.

165
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:16,204
-You're not then?
-Are you defending for him?

166
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:21,687
Just go away. Leave me alone.

167
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:27,446
-You can tell me what makes you unease.
-Leave me alone.

168
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:30,061
Taw, you know I'm...

169
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:34,578
Are you mad? I said leave me alone.

170
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,472
Reading Vit's novel?

171
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:11,318
Yep. What's the matter? Wanna read it?

172
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:21,995
-You can borrow me.
-I don't need to read it because I did it for real with Vit.

173
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:26,484
Ssss... so good!

174
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,728
Just like what he wrote.

175
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:32,927
Really?

176
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:36,651
Yep.

177
00:24:37,481 --> 00:24:42,486
Ssssss... so good indeed!

178
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:42,676
Oy!

179
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,343
Aah! Aaah!

180
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:49,982
Arrrgh!

181
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,631
Oy!

182
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:54,212
Arrrgh!

183
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:59,886
Oy!

184
00:25:59,886 --> 00:26:02,102
Aaaah!

185
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:05,762
Oy!

186
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:09,898
Arrrgh!

187
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:13,162
Oy! Oy!

188
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:16,491
Aaarrrgh!

189
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:18,510
Oy!

190
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,765
Nin! Pakkad!

191
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:40,267
Help!

192
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:43,832
Help! Aaaaah!

193
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:48,342
You didn't help us when you saw the flame.

194
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,569
Get how freaking tortured we are!

195
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:08,855
Aaah!

196
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,134
-Nin! Pakkad!

197
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:21,735
Help!

198
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:23,816
Help! Aaah!

199
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:27,813
You didn't help us when you saw the flame.

200
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:33,261
Get how freaking tortured we are!

201
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:37,273
Aaaaaah!

202
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,586
-Koon!
-Aaaah!

203
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:47,878
Koon!

204
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:56,496
You're fine now. You're safe.

205
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:23,333
You're safe now.

206
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:25,917
I had a bad dream.

207
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:30,306
Dangjai!

208
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:31,884
Dangjai!

209
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:36,466
Dangjai!

210
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:40,790
Have you seen Dangjai?

211
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,707
-Your nephew?
-Yes.

212
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:47,955
He just slept beside me. Dangjai!

213
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:51,363
I haven't seen him when I got here.

214
00:28:52,674 --> 00:28:56,428
That weirdo must have taken him away.

215
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:01,219
Dangjai!

216
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:04,281
Where are you Dangjai!

217
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,749
-Dangjai!
-Koon!

218
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:18,635
-Koon!
-Dangjai!

219
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:20,380
Koon!

220
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,939
Koon!

221
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:25,134
Dangjai!

222
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:29,325
Dangjai! Dangjai!

223
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:44,949
-Where have you gone?
-I haven't gone anywhere. Why are you crying?

224
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,995
I'm not!

225
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:05,903
Tar, I don't wanna stay here.

226
00:30:07,068 --> 00:30:09,104
Shall we go grab a bite then?

227
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:16,147
-Dangjai, let's grab something delicious! Okay?
-Okay!

228
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:17,792
Let's go.

229
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:32,302
Bubble.

230
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:36,687
I've sent you info and please check the schedule.

231
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:43,411
I've dealt with the studio. Just wait for some info and I'll book it all.

232
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:46,442
Got it. I'll check for it now.

233
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:48,785
Taw!

234
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:51,952
Did you burden my nephew with lots of work?

235
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:54,541
What again, boss?

236
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:59,283
Why didn't you do it yourself?
Why burdened my nephew so much?

237
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:03,922
He didn't get home yesterday because you loaded him with works!

238
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:11,645
-Don't get me wrong. I didn't ask Chopi...
-Are you going to say he's lying?

239
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:14,954
He's a good one. He never once lies to me.

240
00:31:15,863 --> 00:31:22,214
Next time report to me what you will assign him. Got it?

241
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:24,509
Got it.

242
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:33,891
What the heck! Just complained and left.

243
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:42,548
But Chopin's so bad. He did wrong and let Taw get blamed.

244
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,733
Forget it. Just get to work tho.

245
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,068
Let's see if I can't revenge him for Taw.

246
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:56,655
Better check what I've assigned you first!

247
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:59,114
-Faster!
-Got it.

248
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:01,112
Got it and got it.

249
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:10,862
-Dangjai!
-Don't! Let him sleep tight.

250
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:25,098
-So... you still remember how much I like Japanese food?
-I never forget anything about you.

251
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,950
And you? Remember anything about me?

252
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,039
Of course.

253
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:44,279
You like wagyu rolls but don't like beef.

254
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:48,074
I need to get it off for you every time.

255
00:32:57,511 --> 00:33:00,110
Let's eat! So hungry.

256
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,709
May I?

257
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:22,785
Koon.

258
00:33:24,164 --> 00:33:26,972
-Can I talk with you a bit?
-Sure.

259
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,195
Oh. Wait.

260
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:38,705
-Dangjai, you go play the swing for a moment.
-Okie.

261
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:39,736
Go ahead.

262
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:47,582
What's the matter?

263
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,695
Will you blame me...

264
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:05,087
if I just wanna love you like this?

265
00:34:14,337 --> 00:34:15,748
Um...

266
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,834
I just wanna love you... but I won't try to separate you and Taw.

267
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:36,990
Just want you to keep me in touch
and think of me whenever you're troubled.

268
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,912
That's all.

269
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:49,237
Okay.

270
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,765
I appreciate your good feeling for me.

271
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:00,851
Come on.

272
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:23,743
Wanna have me for a meal? You said once.

273
00:35:25,848 --> 00:35:27,193
Wanna pick me up right?

274
00:35:30,683 --> 00:35:35,311
Sorry Chopin. Today Vit will pick me up.

275
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:38,318
How? You are driving today, huh.

276
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:43,004
My car just broke. So I call him to pick me up.

277
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:47,091
-Right?
-Yeah.

278
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:50,463
Let's go then.

279
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:07,649
Sorry for you, Chopin.

280
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:14,415
Never mind. I got him once.

281
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:21,572
My pity for someone who wants it so much, but fails.

282
00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:25,343
What a pity!

283
00:36:27,492 --> 00:36:28,800
Gotta go.

284
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:36,255
-Thanwa.
-What?

285
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:39,623
Wanna some real drink with me?
How lonely I am!

286
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:43,192
How lonely I am! No one wants me!

287
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,710
-Why are you smiling?
-I'm just happy.

288
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,470
-With what?
-You knew it.

289
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,435
I don't know.

290
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:03,888
Vit?

291
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:08,231
This is not straight to our houses.

292
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,004
-What are you doing?
-I'll let you decide.

293
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:33,987
If we're to continue, then get in the room together.

294
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:37,871
If not, I'll drive you home now.

295
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:52,101
Calm down.

296
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,230
Carry me.

297
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,005
I said carry me.

298
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:02,699
Ouch.

299
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:05,796
Are you sure?

300
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,851
Are you right? Don't like it?

301
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,309
I just feel bad for doing wrong to Koon.

302
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:03,318
Don't feel that way because Koon is doing wrong too.

303
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:15,888
You see? Then you're fine.

304
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:19,201
He's cheating on you first.

305
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:25,947
I didn't expect him to betray me.

306
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:34,591
So our affair... is fine.

307
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:39,487
Just do what we feel.

308
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:47,334
And how will others think about me?
I'm still in a relationship with Koon.

309
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,176
And how can I leave him for you?

310
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,989
Don't worry. I've planned it all.

311
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:59,602
It's on you to join me or not.

312
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:11,504
Don't be curious. Let's enjoy another round.

313
00:41:12,564 --> 00:41:14,522
I can starve you more.

314
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:30,152
-Just enough. You're too drunk.
-What!

315
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,910
Who's drunk. No wayne.

316
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:35,639
Just upset. Gut it?

317
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:40,148
Why so upset just because that writer won't sleep with you.

318
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:42,758
So many others on earth!

319
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,878
Am I too ugly?

320
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,625
Why doesn't he want me.

321
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,030
Why do you think so?

322
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,674
Don't care about him. Find some others!

323
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:02,877
And...

324
00:42:06,563 --> 00:42:08,376
Do you wanna with me?

325
00:42:12,022 --> 00:42:14,412
See? You don't dare.

326
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:18,957
You're too drunk and talk nonsense.
Enough!

327
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:20,926
Nope.

328
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:25,802
Enough. Give me that.

329
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,044
-Come on
-Ouch!

330
00:42:28,638 --> 00:42:31,744
-Are you alright?
-I just tripped over.

331
00:42:34,004 --> 00:42:38,739
-And you've come together?
-Yeah.

332
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,200
-Can we give a toast?
-Yeah.

333
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:42,580
Hey!

334
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:50,890
You just butted in and didn't see that his wife is here?

335
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,001
Wife?

336
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,860
Where then?

337
00:42:56,389 --> 00:42:57,576
It's freaking me!

338
00:42:58,499 --> 00:43:00,772
He's... my husband.

339
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:03,117
And I'm the wife.

340
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:04,357
Huh?

341
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:06,192
Go away.

342
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:09,035
Oy! Such a shame!

343
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:12,740
-What have you said Bubble!

344
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,109
-Dang!

345
00:43:15,408 --> 00:43:18,436
You come with me and need to go with me.

346
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:23,722
-I don't want you to go with anyone.
-You're too drunk. Let's get home.

347
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:27,140
-Just go.

348
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,060
Ouch!

349
00:43:40,782 --> 00:43:43,769
You're out of control. Better go home.

350
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:45,690
Let's go.

351
00:43:46,426 --> 00:43:47,104
Duh!

352
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:49,054
Stand up!

353
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:02,586
Umph!

354
00:44:11,923 --> 00:44:15,078
Are you sober now?

355
00:44:15,935 --> 00:44:17,006
Are you sure to...

356
00:45:24,165 --> 00:45:26,960
Why so late? What are you up to?

357
00:45:34,206 --> 00:45:38,952
The boss burdened me with much work.
I gotta finish it all.

358
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:49,914
[whispering] D I E

359
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,237
~ D I E~

360
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:18,375
"Dangerous drug"

361
00:47:28,365 --> 00:47:33,632
I've planned it all. It's on you to join me or not.

362
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:38,001
"Don't use for those with hallucinations"

363
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:53,259
Ouch!

364
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:57,231
-Have you had the pills today?
-I have.

365
00:47:58,382 --> 00:47:59,572
Halt!

366
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:01,445
-Oy!
-Ouch!

367
00:48:05,303 --> 00:48:06,493
Ouch!

368
00:48:07,046 --> 00:48:09,427
Ouch!

369
00:48:10,124 --> 00:48:12,553
Is it just random or you secretly meet my love?

370
00:48:12,553 --> 00:48:15,345
I'm not that type of person with secret... sex.
