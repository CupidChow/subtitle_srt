How dare you

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,160
do that to Prince Wei?

52
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,160

54

I don't understand what you're talking about.

55
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,600
Why would I do that to him?

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,430
They took revenge on me

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,510

58
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,950

Foolish.

63
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,040

You still won't tell the truth.

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,950
I told the truth,

69
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,920
but you don't believe me.

70
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,070
Had you colluded with the man

71

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,430
I don't follow you.

73

If you want to put me in the wrong,

74
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,120
just get to the point.

75
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,240

76
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,510

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you would have gotten what you wanted, right?

78
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,950

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,920

81

85

You know, murdering a prince

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,600

87
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,950
If you tell the truth

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,480
and tell us who is behind this,

89
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,750
I may make a request to His Majesty

90

91

95
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,000

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,920

100
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,270
Of course.

101
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,830
I don't believe it.

102
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,510
In the world,

103

Do you feel a sharp pain
in your heart at midnight?

106

At first, it's like

107
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,630
your heart is being hammered.

108
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,270
Then it's like being pricked by needles.

109
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,310
The circle repeats

110
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,040
for around one hour.

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,560

112
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,360
That's not an important thing.

113
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,680
The important thing is

114
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,310
I know how to relieve your pain

115
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,560

Okay.

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
I'll tell you.

120

125
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,430
I tried to murder Prince Wei

126
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,510
because they forced me to do that.

127

187
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,790
It's detestable!

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,080
you defended your country

191
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,630
and increased our national prestige.

192
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,270
I'll reward you well.

193
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,080
Qin Chen.

194
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,320
You're the biggest contributor.

195
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,750
Tell me.

196
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,200
What do you want?

197
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,360
It's an honor to serve the country.

198
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,080
How can I ask for a reward?

199
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,840
Good…

200
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,320
With young talents like you,

201
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
the Xuan will definitely thrive.

202
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,750
Qin Chen.

203
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,840
I grant you Marquis of Qianhu.

204
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Lin Tian, Wang Qiming.

205
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,360
I grant you Marquis of Baihu.

206
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
The rest of you will be rewarded too.

207
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,000
Thank you, your Majesty.

208
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,080
All right.

209
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,960
You go back to have a good rest.

210
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,270
Xiao Zhan, Mr. Chu, Zixun.

211
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,030
Come with me.

212
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,550
Yes, Father.

213
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,750
-Yes, your Majesty.
-Yes.

214
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,870
I heard

215
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,960
Qin Chen defeated Cao Heng and Nian Wuji

216
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
and saved Princess Lingshan.

217
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,480
Is that true?

218
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,510
It's true, father.

219
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,390
In that case,

220
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,030
the death of Cao Heng and Nian Wuji

221
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,480
is not the work of Qin Feng.

222
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,550
Qin Feng.

223
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,870
He said he was nearby

224
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,870
but didn't show up
when Lingshan got injured

225
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,080
and even colluded with Yuchi Cheng
to frame up Qin Chen.

226
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,840
He's unforgivable.

227
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,600
Father.

228
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,150
You promised to grant him

229
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,320
Marquis of Champion if he gets the first.

230
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,320
I don't even think

231
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,360
he's fit to be a captain.

232
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,240
He hasn't gotten the first, right?

233
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,240
Zixun, you must be tired.

234
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,480
Go to rest.

235
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,240
Go.

236
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,630
Yes, Father.

237
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,440
Just go.

238
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,440
Xiao Zhan.

239
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,960
What do you think of Qin Chen?

240
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,640
Your Majesty.

241
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,480
I think

242
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,200
he's a man of loyalty.

243
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,000
Why do I feel

244
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,310
Qin Chen has played Qin Feng

245
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,270
like a game?

246
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,480
Regardless of how their brotherhood is,

247
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,240
we would have suffered

248
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
heavy losses

249
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,110
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms

250
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,750
without Qin Chen.

251
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,680
Yeah.

252
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,920
Forget it.

253
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,200
Let's see how it goes.

254
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,790
Let's see which of the brothers

255
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,550
is better at martial arts.

256
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,440
I can't believe

257
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,920
Li Qingfeng became a rebel

258
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,550
and tried to murder
the prince and princess.

259
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,480
Your Majesty.

260
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,200
I was interrogating Li Qingfeng

261
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
to know who was behind this,

262
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,680
but

263
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,510
Li Qingfeng died suddenly.

264
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,790
Who were there at the scene?

265
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,030
Your Majesty.

266
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,160
There were Prince Wei, General Yan,

267
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,400
Qin Chen, and I.

268
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,680
Remember

269
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,640
to order a news blackout.

270
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,030
Keep it secret.

271
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,110
Got it.

272
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,880
Xiao Zhan.

273
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,350
Take your men

274
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,880
to surround Marquis Wu'an Residence.

275
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,440
Arrest Marquis Wu'an

276
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,920
and interrogate him.

277
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,030
In addition,

278
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,590
catch and interrogate anyone who's

279
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,440
related to Shadow-slay House.

280
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,310
-Got it.
-Got it.

281
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,550
Do it immediately.

282
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,200
Yes.

283
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,400
Have you heard

284
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,750
our Xuan won the preliminary contest

285
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,640
of the Competition of Five Kingdoms

286
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
and made a name for itself?

287
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,070
I heard the death
of the third prince of the Zhao

288
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,590
is the work of Qin Feng.

289
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,790
Qin Feng is no wonder
the first talent of our country.

290
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,240
Bah!

291
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,830
He's a snob who fishes for fame!

292
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,310
Fish for fame?

293
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,000
Haven't you heard about it?

294
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,550
Qin Feng feared that the Zhao
and the Ghost Immortal Sect

295
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,350
would seek revenge on him,

296
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,790
so he passed the buck

297
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,200
to Qin Chen.

298
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,070
He wanted the Ghost Immortal Sect
and God of Killing

299
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,160
to get revenge on Qin Chen.

300
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,830
He stood by and did nothing

301
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,160
when Princess Lingshan was being hunted.

302
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,400
I didn't hear of it.

303
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,680
I heard

304
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
when Qin Chen and Princess Lingshan

305
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,720
battled with Cao Heng and Nian Wuji,

306
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,680
Qin Feng hid, watching that.

307
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,480
When the two sides got injured,

308
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,830
Qin Feng took advantage

309
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,830
and attacked the two.

310
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,000
I also heard

311
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,070
it was because of Qin Chen

312
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,400
that the Xuan

313
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,960
achieved such a good result.

314
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,510
However, Qin Chen

315
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,350
knew Qin Feng's nasty trick

316
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,030
but still spoke

317
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,160
for Qin Feng at the key moment.

318
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
He was almost

319
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,000
killed by Yuchi Cheng of the Zhao.

320
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,750
He's really a man of loyalty.

321
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,070
I thought

322
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,720
Qin Feng was a hero.

323
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,680
It looks like

324
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,550
he's nothing compared to Qin Chen.

325
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,820
[Qin Residence.]

326
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,720
Feng!

327
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,440
Feng, you…

328
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
What happened to you?

329
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,000
This…

330
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,880
Darn Qin Chen.

331
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,070
Qin Chen.

332
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,310
It's Qin Chen again!

333
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,960
Mom.

334
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,030
Mom.

335
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,200
Mom!

336
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,200
My poor son.

337
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Mom.

338
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,070
Find me a place to cultivate.

339
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,240
I must

340
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,200
get revenge for myself.

341
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,880
Rest assured.

342
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,110
I'll not let you suffer in vain.

343
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,720
Fen.

344
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,720
Take your brother to rest.

345
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,920
Feng.

346
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,110
Qin Chen, Qin Yuechi.

347
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,640
I'll not let go of you.

348
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,350
Enough!

349
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,400
Do you still want to humiliate yourself?

350
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,160
I told you

351
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,070
not to mess around.

352
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,240
Look at this.

353
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,510
Look what Feng has become!

354
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,070
Qin Yuanhong.

355
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,110
How could you say that?

356
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
If you had gone for Qin Chen,

357
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,960
would Feng have become this?

358
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,270
Since you stay out of it,

359
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
I'll deal with it.

360
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,790
You.

361
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,480
You…

362
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,830
You rest assured

363
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,070
that I won't get you involved.

364
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,480
My Marquis.

365
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,960
Mom.

366
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,750
Qin Feng tried to frame me up,

367
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,590
so I played him at his own game,

368
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,030
and he got severely injured.

369
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,200
Here.

370
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,440
As long as you come back safely,

371
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,510
I don't ask for anything else.

372
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,350
Your dad

373
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,680
was once a great talent

374
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,830
and an illustrious man.

375
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,640
Mom.

376
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,880
Who's

377
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
my dad anyway?

378
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,510
Where's he?

379
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,200
It's not that I don't want to tell you,

380
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,750
but that

381
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,310
he doesn't know about your existence.

382
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,750
If you know about him,

383
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,640
it's not a good thing

384
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,510
for him or you.

385
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,110
But he left you here alone

386
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,510
and hasn't come back for over a decade.

387
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,350
Don't say that about your dad.

388
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,310
He had a reason.

389
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,680
I don't blame or resent him.

390
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,480
As long as you're well and happy,

391
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,590
I'm satisfied.

392
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,350
Chen.

393
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,830
You've really grown up.

394
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,350
What did you come for?

395
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,110
We came to practice with you.

396
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,160
Watch this.

397
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,160
Chen, be careful.

398
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,200
Why is that?

399
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,240
Again.

400
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,000
Wang Qiming.

401
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,510
You can join in if you want to.

402
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,640
Can I?

403
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,830
Why not?

404
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,000
We're just practicing.

405
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,640
Come.

406
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,160
Okay.

407
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,440
I'll go.

408
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,880
Stop.

409
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
Stop…

410
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,070
We're no match for you at all.

411
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,350
This

412
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,640
is Spirit Core Crystal
that can summon Bloodmist.

413
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,350
I give it to you.

414
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,440
It can harden your bodies again.

415
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,680
By that time,

416
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,750
your strength will take a leap.

417
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,830
Chen, you…

418
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Are you serious?

419
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,110
When have I lied to you?

420
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,790
In the Competition of Five Kingdoms,

421
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,880
Li Qingfeng betrayed the country.

422
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,880
I suspect that the Xuan has a crisis.

423
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,510
You seize the time

424
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,880
to improve your strength.

425
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,680
Go.

426
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,240
Go to Dan Pavilion with me.

427
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,880
Go.

428
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,400
Wait for me.

429
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,400
King of Lingwu, thanks for your work.

430
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,270
Mr. Qin.

431
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,510
What did you come for?

432
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,590
What have you found

433
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,270
about Li Qingfeng's murder?

434
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,750
I'll report

435
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,400
the fact

436
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,680
to His Majesty in court.

437
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,830
When you see His Majesty,

438
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,920
King of Lingwu, please…

439
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,270
Rest assured, Mr. Qin.

440
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,440
I always

441
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,270
keep my promises.

442
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,110
Thank you a lot.

443
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,310
Please.

444
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,790
King of Lingwu.

445
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes.

446
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,830
What have you found about Li Qingfeng's murder?

447
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,510
Your Majesty.

448
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,000
I took the order

449
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,270
and gathered soldiers

450
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,680
to surround Marquis Wu'an Residence.

451
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,750
However,

452
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,750
I searched through the residence

453
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,830
but couldn't find Marquis Wu'an.

454
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,750
What?

455
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,070
