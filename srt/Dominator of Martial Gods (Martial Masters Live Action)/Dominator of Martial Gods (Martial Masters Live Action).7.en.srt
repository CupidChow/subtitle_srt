00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,320
we should disqualify Qin Chen from the test

148

and expel him from the academy.

Qin Chen,

150
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,240
you said that you've awakened your bloodline.

151
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
Do you have any proof?

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,790
I don't.

153
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,270
Because I awakened my bloodline

154
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,550
by myself.

It's fine if he can't awaken his bloodline,

the facts are clear.

166
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,200
I think it's safe to say that

167
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,750
Qin Chen is morally flawed

168
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,840
and should be expelled

169
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,670
as a warning to others.

170
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,670
The testing for bloodlines is quite simple.

171
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,670
You just need to find a Bloodline Master

172
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,120
to verify,

173
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,790
and you'll know if my bloodline has awakened.

174
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,630
Mr. Dean,

175
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,030
how can we change our procedures

176
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,720
for the examination

177
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,670
for Qin Chen alone?

178
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,030
This is highly inappropriate.

179
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,630
Qin Chen,

180
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,080
since you've awakened your bloodline,

181
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,150
go ahead and join the awakening ritual.

182
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,910
If you display any bloodline aura,

183
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,080
you'll get a pass.

184
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,670
Otherwise,

185
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,510
you'll be severely punished.

186
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,630
Yes.

187
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,360
It'll be a miracle

188
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,840
for a loser like him to awaken his bloodline.

189
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,790
Qin Fen,

190
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,750
you kept saying that
I was trying to muddle through.

191
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,840
Dare you make a bet with me?

192
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,790
A bet?

193
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,120
If I haven't awakened,

194
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,790
you can do anything to me

195
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,120
after the contest.

196
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,670
But,

197
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,790
if I did awaken my bloodline,

198
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,550
you'll need to bark like a dog

199
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,080
in this drill ground

200
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,200
and say loudly that you're a loser.

201
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,360
How's that?

202
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,630
You!

203
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,440
Are you scared?

204
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,480
Since you have a death wish,

205
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,790
I'll grant it.

206
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,440
Everybody is watching.

207
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,030
Qin Fen, don't go back on your words.

208
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,270
My guess is that it's impossible!

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
Qin Chen, stand here.

210
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,630
The awakening ritual begins now!

211
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,550
Someone has awakened his bloodline.

212
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,870
It's Gao Hong from the freshmen class,

213
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,360
the son of Deputy Chief Gao of the City Guard.

214
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,480
Red tiger bloodline.

215
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,320
He did it as early as twelve.

216
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,840
Grade two red tiger bloodline.

217
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,750
His future is boundless.

218
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,510
Yeah.

219
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,630
He's only twelve.

220
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,670
And he has awakened a grade two bloodline.

221
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,240
Way stronger than some loser.

222
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,000
Not bad.

223
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,630
Mostly grade one bloodlines.

224
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,630
And a few grade two bloodlines.

225
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,670
I told you.

226
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,240
He's obviously lying.

227
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,720
Qin Fen, just shut up.

228
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,790
It's actually a dead crystal.

229
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
Did someone tamper with it?

230
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,670
Zhao Feng has probably bribed this Ge Hong.

231
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,120
No wonder Qin Fen was so assured.

232
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,440
But,

233
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,510
do they think they can stop me from releasing

234
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,720
the bloodline aura with just a dead crystal?

235
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,080
They've underestimated me.

236
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,770
What?

237
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,650
Holy… The crystal exploded!

238
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,600
What kind of bloodline is this?

239
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,530
Thunder bloodline.

240
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,770
It's a rare type.

241
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,720
How's this possible?

242
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,290
What…

243
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,560
No way!

244
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,930
How could this be?

245
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,770
I've indeed tampered with his crystal.

246
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,120
This can't be.

247
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,640
Qin Yong,

248
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,490
what exactly is going on?

249
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,800
I have no idea, Madam.

250
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,450
Ge Hong promised me

251
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,160
that he'd definitely pull this off.

252
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,120
Useless!

253
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,800
What do I need you for

254
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,880
when you can't even do this?

255
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,840
Please calm down, Madam.

256
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,930
Potian,

257
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
are you seeing this?

258
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,050
Chen has finally awakened his bloodline.

259
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,770
He did it.

260
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,970
Qin Chen,

261
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,690
thunder bloodline,

262
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,080
grade one.

263
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,840
Star Academy

264
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,930
is indeed the best school in the Xuan.

265
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,970
You flatter us, King of Lingwu.

266
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,930
But I seem to have seen the bloodline aura

267
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,770
from Qin Chen somewhere

268
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,250
not long ago.

269
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,290
I keep feeling that it's quite familiar.

270
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,290
Speaking of which,

271
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,930
I seem to feel the same.

272
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,160
Forget it.

273
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,360
Probably a false impression.

274
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,400
Thunder bloodline?

275
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,970
It's quite a rare type!

276
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,160
Not bad, Chen.

277
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,210
Qin Fen,

278
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,970
what else do you have to say?

279
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,930
Nothing
but one of the trashiest grade one bloodlines.

280
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,490
What's there to be arrogant about?

281
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,600
Qin Fen,

282
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
since I've awakened my bloodline,

283
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,560
don't forget our agreement.

284
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,360
You…

285
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,640
Qin Fen,

286
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,450
are you trying to welsh on it?

287
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,120
So many people have heard

288
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,800
about your bet with Chen,

289
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,320
including Mr. Dean.

290
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,450
Top cultivators in the Capital are all here.

291
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,320
If you're trying to go back on your words,

292
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,730
think clearly about the consequences.

293
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,800
Why did Qin Fen make a bet
for a reason at all?

294
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,530
Cultivators must honor their words.

295
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,050
If Qin Fen breaks his promise,

296
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,290
how is he going to live in the Capital?

297
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,970
The second young master
of the Qin family barks like a dog?

298
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,490
This is the weirdest news!

299
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,600
Well…

300
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,360
Woof, woof!

301
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
And?

302
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,690
Why did he bet anyway?

303
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,530
Yeah.

304
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,690
I'm a loser!

305
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,160
Qin Fen,

306
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,320
you are self-aware, after all.

307
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,530
You know you're a loser.

308
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,320
Just you wait.

309
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,930
Students,

310
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,490
we're having the next round of examination,

311
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,290
the martial test.

312
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,880
You're looking at

313
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,560
strong bows of 50 piculs.

314
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,530
Each student

315
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,560
must shoot the steel arrow
into the star iron bull's-eye.

316
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,880
Those who made it

317
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,640
shall be deemed as passing the test.

318
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:01,840
Now,

319
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,690
the test begins.

320
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,690
First one.

321
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
It's a spiritual array!

322
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:40,970
Back to position.

323
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,840
Second one.

324
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,360
This time,

325
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,690
I must avenge the previous insult.

326
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,490
That's too good!

327
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,640
He shot the bull's-eye with one shot.

328
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,840
How much strength must he have?

329
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,400
Qin Fen is just one step away from Earth level.

330
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,400
No wonder he's so arrogant.

331
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,360
The Qin family is indeed
a strong military family in the Xuan.

332
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,120
Qin Fen really has some talent.

333
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,050
But his elder brother

334
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,690
is truly amazing.

335
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,120
Do you mean Qin Feng?

336
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,320
Exactly.

337
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,530
Back then,

338
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,490
it only took Qin Feng two years

339
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,770
to advance to Earth level.

340
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,840
After joining the army,

341
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,050
he rendered excellent military services.

342
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,210
Now,

343
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,880
I wonder what level he is at.

344
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,690
Let's see how long you can keep pretending.

345
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,050
I'm afraid

346
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,250
you can't even pass

347
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,560
the strength test.

348
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,290
Third one.

349
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,050
Lin Tian, relax.

350
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,490
Concentrate your vital energy on the arrow.

351
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,880
Lead the tail of the arrow with its head.

352
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Tear open the spiritual array,

353
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,320
and you'll be able to hit the bull's-eye.

354
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,530
I did it.

355
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,530
Back to position.

356
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,450
Fourth one.

357
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,530
He's only drawing the bow halfway.

358
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,690
He didn't stretch it to the full extent.

359
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,360
Is he so weak?

360
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,530
This seems odd.

361
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,880
Qin Chen can never be so weak like this.

362
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,640
See? I told you Qin Chen was strong.

363
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,160
Qin Chen is way too lucky.

364
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,050
His arrow only stuck in
the target by a little bit.

365
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,730
It almost fell off.

366
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,080
Can you pass the test like this?

367
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,160
Excellent control of strength.

368
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,770
This kid is not as simple as he looks.

369
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,640
If you want to shoot a ten-pound iron arrow

370
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,360
into the iron target,

371
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,640
you shall at least draw the bow to its fullest

372
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
and put in your power of bloodline,

373
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,050
that's how you go through the spiritual array.

374
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,050
But the force

375
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,320
of Qin Chen's arrow

376
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,880
was only thirty piculs.

377
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,050
However, due to the spiraling vital energy

378
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,730
attached to the arrow,

379
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,930
the penetrating force
of the iron arrow was doubled.

380
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,640
That's how it stuck into the iron target.

381
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,560
I'm afraid his control of strength

382
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,970
and vital energy has reached

383
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,690
the level of perfection.

384
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,050
A lot of

385
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,400
Earth level cultivators

386
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,840
can't even do that.

387
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,840
Have you decided to pick him?

388
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,770
It's too early to say that.

389
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Let's keep watching.

390
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:28,930
Back to position.

391
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,930
Master Liang,

392
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,730
Qin Chen really has some good luck, huh?

393
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,770
Luck?

394
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,970
He's got some dumb luck.

395
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,080
Fifth one.

396
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,770
He just shot through such a thick iron plate?

397
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,640
He's way too strong!

398
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,450
This Li Qingfeng is not bad.

399
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,160
He advanced to Earth level at 17.

400
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
He's a diamond in the rough.

401
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,400
Next.

402
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,770
She didn't use her full strength.

403
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,530
She should be at Earth level.

404
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,210
Good.

405
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,880
King of Lingwu,

406
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,730
this is the daughter of Lord Kang.

407
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,160
She's got great gifts.

408
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,320
She awakened a third grade bloodline.

409
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,250
With these few,

410
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,320
finally I'll be able to

411
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,250
finish the task that His Majesty gave me.

412
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,490
The test has finished.

413
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,930
For the first round,

414
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,730
a total of sixty students participated,

415
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,530
and twenty-four of them passed.

416
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,320
Now let's begin the second round: martial fight.

417
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,250
It'll be a fight between three people.

418
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,560
Killing is strictly prohibited.

419
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,640
Cheating is strictly prohibited.

420
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,770
Once you're found to break any rules,

421
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,530
you shall be disqualified!

422
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,560
The result of the fight doesn't matter.

423
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,770
Whether you can learn something from it

424
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,690
is the difference between
the strong and the weak.

425
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,490
I got it.

426
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,490
Punk,

427
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,320
when you meet me in the fight,

428
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,160
let's see if you can still be so calm.

429
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,640
Qin Fen!

430
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,880
When you meet that punk in a minute,

431
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,010
destroy him for me.

432
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,290
Yes.

433
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,250
First group:

434
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,400
Lin Tian,

435
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,360
Qin Fen,

436
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,730
and Chen Xiang.

437
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,690
Count yourself unlucky for meeting me.

438
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,640
If you're really tough,

439
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,360
don't admit defeat.

440
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,490
Admit defeat?

441
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,560
Are you kidding?

442
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,690
Solar Fire Fist!

443
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,690
Lie down!

444
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,050
Fire bloodline!

445
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,360
A mere grade one fire bloodline

446
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,690
dares to challenge me?

447
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,360
