the fact that Qin Chen spoke insolently
to Princess Zixun

shows that he has no respect
for the imperial family.

[Could it be…]

Everyone,

152
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,030
let me introduce to you.

153
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,440
King of Lingwu

154
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,870
and Mr. Chu

155
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,750

Come here.

161
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,360
I'm sure you all know Lin Tian.

162
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,440
He is the young talent recommended to me

163
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,630
by President Dongfang of Bloodline Holy Land

164
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,200

165
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,120

166
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:08,870

167
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,000
he will be joining you

168
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,600
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

169
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,150
He is a commoner
and didn't even make it to the top ten.

170
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
How is he qualified to join us?

171
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,150
Mr. Dongfang has always been
an extraordinary man.

172
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,360
Even Father has a lot of respect for him.

173
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,390
He's someone who's indifferent to fame
and fortune and lives in seclusion.

174
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,150
How come

175
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,510
he recommended that Lin Tian goes
to Bloodmist Holy Land with us

176
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,870
on his own initiative this time?

177
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,320
Chen,

178
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,150
as per your request,

179
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,480
I've brought Lin Tian here.

180
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,270
Thank you very much, Mr. Dongfang.

181
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,840
You're welcome.

182
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,120
In fact, I came here today

183
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,960
to seek your advice.

184
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,870
Chen, in your opinion, this…

185
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,360
Mr. Dongfang?

186
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,270
Mr. Dongfang?

187
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,510
It's getting late. I guess that's it for now.

188
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
All right, Chen,

189
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,440
we'll discuss the rest

190
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,320
in detail

191
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,720
when you come back.

192
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,550
I'll ask you then.

193
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,960
Lin Tian.

194
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,790
Don't be nervous.

195
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,360
The baptism at Bloodmist Holy Land

196
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,150
will be

197
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,910
a great learning opportunity for you.

198
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,790
Mr. Dongfang and I hope that you will

199
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,360
live up to our expectations.

200
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,750
I'm very grateful for Your Majesty's
and Mr. Dongfang's support.

201
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,750
I'll spare no effort this time

202
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,630
and serve the kingdom in the future.

203
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,840
Go ahead.

204
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,630
Chen,

205
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,440
how exciting!

206
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,360
Finally, I get to go

207
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,480
to Bloodmist Holy Land with you.

208
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,870
This feels like a dream.

209
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,030
I pinched myself several times
on the way here

210
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,600
but didn't feel any pain,

211
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,750
so I thought, "Oh no,

212
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,550
I must be dreaming."

213
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,030
But then I looked down and realized

214
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,600
that I'd been pinching someone else.

215
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,630
Fool.

216
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,870
Idiot.

217
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,240
Don't get too excited yet,

218
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,600
and stay close to me later.

219
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,510
OK.

220
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,790
King of Lingwu,

221
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,000
Mr. Chu.

222
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,480
Your Majesty.

223
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,510
I'll now

224
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,000
entrust these young talents

225
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,240
of the Xuan Kingdom…

226
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,150
to you.

227
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,630
Please be assured, Your Majesty,

228
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,670
that we'll complete this mission.

229
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,270
There's no need to panic.

230
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,510
It's the bird-form blood beast

231
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,750
that's been tamed

232
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,390
by Mr. Chu.

233
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,840
Blood beast?

234
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,910
So Mr. Chu is also a beast-tamer?

235
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,480
This terrifying blood beast

236
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,960
is of at least Grade Three.

237
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,670
Mr. Chu is a beast-tamer of at least
the Heaven level.

238
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,240
Everyone,

239
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,440
this Blood-Claw Blue Eagle

240
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
is a blood beast that I have tamed.

241
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,600
We will

242
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,390
fly to Bloodmist Holy Land

243
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,150
on this eagle.

244
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,270
All right.

245
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,150
Please follow me.

246
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,840
[Looks like there's no chance now]

247
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,240
[to deal with Qin Chen here.]

248
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,390
[I'll have to wait until we arrive
at the Mount of Demonic Ancestors.]

249
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,910
Sit tight.

250
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,630
The eagle will fly above the clouds,

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,440
and if you fall from there,

252
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,270
no one will be able to save you.

253
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,120
[Qin Chen,]

254
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,790
[let's see
if you can still be in luck this time.]

255
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,480
Qin Chen,

256
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,200
let me sit next to you.

257
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,680
I have some questions about cultivation

258
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,200
that I'd like to ask you.

259
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,480
Thank you.

260
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,200
Qin Chen,

261
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,270
keep your hands off Lingshan.

262
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,310
I'll sit here and watch you.

263
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,350
How come everyone's so unfriendly?

264
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,550
Mr. Chu,

265
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,310
please.

266
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,240
Qing,

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,680
let's go.

268
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,440
Sit tight, everyone.

269
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,830
I hope

270
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,920
these talents selected by the Xuan Kingdom

271
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,110
will make their kingdom proud.

272
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,070
I heard that the other four nations
in the northwest

273
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,920
have also produced a lot of talent
over the last few years.

274
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,830
I wonder how we will do

275
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,590
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms

276
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,310
this time.

277
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,510
There're so many talents around

278
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,920
these days,

279
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,790
and no one is really

280
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,270
in a league of his own.

281
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,880
I've been in the Xuan Kingdom for so long

282
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,310
that I'm hardly au courant now.

283
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,480
Mr. Chu,

284
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,680
you're famous in a lot of kingdoms

285
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,550
for your erudition.

286
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,920
If you are not au courant,

287
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,110
then everyone else

288
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,310
must be considered utterly ignorant.

289
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,270
The northwest

290
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
is a remote area

291
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,240
with little vital energy

292
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,640
and a lack of resources.

293
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,440
With your talent,

294
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,030
you would have long reached

295
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,030
the Master level

296
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,680
if you were in the Martial Domain.

297
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,310
And yet you've been stuck at the
Mystery level for so long

298
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,720
without making any progress.

299
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,110
Don't waste

300
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,030
this gift from heaven.

301
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,310
It's time you learned from these young people

302
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,880
and moved forward.

303
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
I'm indebted to His Majesty.

304
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,200
How can I leave?

305
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,400
Please

306
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,750
don't bring this up again.

307
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,310
Fine.

308
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,790
Our hope

309
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,480
of winning this competition

310
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,480
lies in Qin Feng and Prince Wei.

311
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,160
That boy

312
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,310
is indeed extraordinary,

313
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,640
able to breathe normally and sit perfectly still

314
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,830
on this eagle.

315
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,030
Apparently,

316
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,680
he has mastered the art

317
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,070
of controlling

318
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,680
vital energy.

319
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,510
Usually,

320
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,350
people are inevitably nervous

321
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,200
and awkward

322
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,160
during their first flight
on a flying blood beast.

323
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,480
But you don't see

324
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,830
any of that in Qin Feng.

325
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,400
Even Prince Wei

326
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,750
is somewhat nervous.

327
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,030
Be careful, everyone.

328
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,640
The eagle is fast.

329
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,270
If you fall,

330
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,000
I might not be quick enough to save you.

331
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,270
Look at Qin Chen!

332
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,240
That's ridiculous!

333
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,480
What if he falls

334
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,000
because of this recklessness?

335
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,680
But…

336
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,310
how is he able

337
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,310
to be so calm and relaxed

338
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,790
on his first flight on a
flying blood beast?

339
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,030
I see.

340
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,310
He's made a curved shield of vital energy.

341
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,640
When a strong wind blows,

342
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,680
the shield changes its shape,

343
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,110
which means

344
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,030
it can keep him pressed against
the back of the eagle.

345
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,110
I didn't know there was such a trick.

346
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,440
Once the shield of vital energy is there,

347
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,070
the violent winds

348
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,480
won't be able to blow him away

349
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,590
but will instead keep him tightly pressed

350
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,310
against the back of the blood beast.

351
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
The stronger the wind,

352
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,750
the stronger

353
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,030
this force will become.

354
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,640
What's going on?

355
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,750
Sit tight, everyone!

356
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,480
Oh no, he's going to…

357
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,000
When the eagle was struggling,

358
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,590
the air currents around it

359
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,070
were also changing.

360
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,350
To keep steady, he had to change

361
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,000
the shape of the shield accordingly.

362
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,400
It was an extremely difficult process,

363
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,310
and any mistake

364
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,920
could lead to a terrible disaster.

365
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,550
Has that boy

366
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,110
learned some secret technique

367
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,880
that enables him to do that?

368
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,240
[How can it be?]

369
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,790
[Why didn't he fall?]

370
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,000
[With that jolt just now,]

371
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,750
[even I almost fell.]

372
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,830
[How come he's still safely there?]

373
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,480
Which one of you hurt Qing just now?

374
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,640
Qing never loses its temper
without provocation.

375
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,510
Someone must have hurt it

376
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,590
and caused that outburst.

377
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,830
You should come forward and confess.

378
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,510
Otherwise,

379
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,680
once we find you out,

380
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
you'll be in serious trouble.

381
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,920
[I was rather discreet.]

382
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,680
[No one should have noticed.]

383
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,350
[Besides,]

384
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,070
[I never meant to hurt it.]

385
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,880
[My target]

386
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,550
[was Qin Chen.]

387
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,830
I know who did it.

388
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,480
It's him.

389
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,640
Qin Chen,

390
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,750
don't talk nonsense!

391
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,160
To be more precise, he didn't mean
to hurt the eagle,

392
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,030
but he was actually trying

393
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,440
to hurt me.

394
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,070
That's not true.

395
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,880
Don't believe him.

396
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,310
Why are you so anxious, then?

397
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,960
However discreet you were,

398
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,920
you have left traces.

399
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,000
Besides,

400
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,200
we've got Princess Lingshan here.

401
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,110
She only needs to cast back a little

402
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,960
to be able to tell if you did it or not.

403
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,070
Now that I think about it,

404
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,880
there was indeed a jet of vital energy
coming at us.

405
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,400
Is it why

406
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,310
you took measures to block it?

407
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,310
Exactly.

408
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,920
Li Qingfeng,

409
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
Mr. Chu has told us not to be reckless

410
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,270
while we're on the back of the eagle.

411
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,830
Why did you do such a dangerous thing?

412
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,000
Were you trying

413
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,920
to get us all killed?

414
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:25,960
I wasn't.

415
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,480
I…

416
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,750
Enough!

417
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,510
Your personal grudges are
none of my business,

418
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,750
but how could you put everyone's
life at risk

419
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,590
for your own ends?

420
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,960
Prince Li,

421
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,400
you heard that?

422
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,070
Qin Chen…

423
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,030
Chen,

424
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,400
he didn't hurt you just now, did he?

425
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,510
With his ability,

426
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,680
it was impossible for him to hurt me.

427
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,510
Sorry to have frightened you guys.

428
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,240
It wasn't your fault.

429
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,590
It was that reptile's.

430
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
You pleb!

431
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,030
What did you just say?

432
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,750
Enough!

433
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,000
Be quiet now, all of you!

434
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,070
Li Qingfeng,

435
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,790
you're the son of Marquis Wu'an

436
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,200
and one of the most promising young
men of your generation.

437
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,510
Although you're extremely talented,

438
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,920
it's still important for you

439
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,160
to refine your character.

440
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,640
People who are petty

441
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,830
and narrow-minded

442
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,750
can't go far.

443
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,400
Do you understand?

444
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,480
I will be sure to follow your advice.

445
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,550
I hope you mean it.

446
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,480
This should be a warning

447
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,590
to the rest of you.

448
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,640
When we arrive at the Mount
of Demonic Ancestors,

449
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,160
you'll be representing the Xuan Kingdom.

450
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,070
Don't do anything stupid

451
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,200
in front of the other kingdoms.

452
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,720
[Idiot.]

453
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,440
[A few days later]

454
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,830
The Mount of Demonic Ancestors

455
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,070
is the most magnificent mountain range
in the northwest.

456
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,590
It stretches for nearly 100,000 miles

457
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,350
over a huge area and is rich

458
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,440
in vital energy.

459
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,720
Just like a dragon

460
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,110
lying across the five northwestern kingdoms.

461
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,480
It's magnificent!

462
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,790
Every year, countless martial artists

463
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,000
from various kingdoms, including the Xuan,
come here

464
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,310
to go on an adventure.

465
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,270
Some gain a great deal here.

466
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:18,960
Likewise,

467
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,920
many perish here every year.
