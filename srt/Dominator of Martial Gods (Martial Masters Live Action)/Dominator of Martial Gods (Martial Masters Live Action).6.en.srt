Drag him away!

Mr. President!

Please give me another chance!

Mr. President!

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,870
I've realized my mistakes.

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,310
I dare not do it again!

28
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,630
You've done nothing wrong.

29
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,190
Actually, I need to thank you

30
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,960
for bringing him into my bloodline chamber.

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,870
Tell me.

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,590
What's the name

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,840
of that young childe?

Who is he?

35
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,680
I…

36
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't know.

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,520
I just remembered he's called Qin Chen.

38
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,430
Qin Chen?

39
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,190
You did a good job today.

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,680
You'll be the manager from now on.

41
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,240
Yes.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Thank you, Mr. President.

43
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,280
You may go now.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,560
May I ask what's so special

45
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,190
about that young childe?

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
Why do you think so highly of him?

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,710
This latest bloodline instrument

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,430
has a total of six states

49
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,960
and eighteen levels.

50
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,590
The higher the level,

51
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,280
the more intense the detection results will be.

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,000
Now look.

53
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,590
How many array lines

54
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,590
are illuminated in this instrument?

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,470
Eighteen.

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,360
How…

57
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,310
How is this possible?

58
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,190
That's right.

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,560
Eighteen array lines exactly.

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,430
I brought this

61
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,960
back from the Martial Domain.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,590

64

66
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,710
directly activated eighteen array lines

00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,030
though the princess has no feelings for you,

77
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,430
you can take my word for it

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,950
that all women admire the strong.

79
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,680

80
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,190
Don't worry, Mom.

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,120
One hour each for morning and afternoon.

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920

-The princess?
-The princess?

96
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,310
-Let her in.
-The princess.

97
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,310
Tell her the patriarch will be here in a minute.

98
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,920
But isn't he out?

99
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,560
Just do as I say!

100
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,680
Stop talking nonsense!

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,750

106
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
I'll go get my weapon ready.

107
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,510
Come back.

108
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,750
What do you need your weapon for?

109
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
Didn't you just tell me

110
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,750
to attract the princess with my strength?

111
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm going to show her a martial skill

112
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,800
that I just finished honing.

113
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,270

is this.

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
Th-This is…

117
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,600
An aphrodisiac incense.

118
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,120
When she comes in,

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,390
you shut the doors and windows

120
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,720
and light this incense.

121
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,120
When the princess throws herself on you,

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,510
you'll pretend to refuse

123
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,600
and then finish what can't be undone.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,950
But remember,

125
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,360
when the princess isn't emotionally ready,

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,830
don't ever make the first move.

127
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,870
Mother,

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,920
is this incense really that potent?

129
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,240
Of course, it is.

130
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,680
Back then,

131
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,190
your dad was incurably unromantic.

132
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,480
If I hadn't used this incense

133
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,040
to get him into my bed,

134
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
you wouldn't have been born.

135
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,430
Who could have foreseen

136
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,160
someday the remaining incense

137
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,240
would come in handy again?

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Mother,

139
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,390
so it was because of this thing
that you and Father…

140
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,430
Forget about that.

141
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,120
Go seize your chance.

142

Where's your father?

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,390
He'll be here soon.

149
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,430
Why did you close the doors?

150
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,630
It's windy outside.

151
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,000
Too much wind is bad for your health.

152
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Please have a seat.

153
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,750
I was rude to you the other day.

154
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,680
Please forgive me, Princess Lingshan.

155
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,560
Have some water.

156
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,750
You're being too polite.

157
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,480
The incense you're burning smells nice.

158
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
What's its name?

159
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,480
I'll have my maids stock some.

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,680
I…

161
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,120
This…

162
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,600
My mother prepared this.

163
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,830
I'll ask her later.

164
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,750
The color of this censer

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,240
matches your clothes quite well.

166
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,270
Hold it.

167
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,750
Let me take a closer look.

168
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,000
Uh…

169
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,600
Can I put it down now, Princess Lingshan?

170
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,600
Qin Fen,

171
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,360
what's the hurry?

172
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,270
I haven't seen enough yet.

173
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,910
Raise it a little higher.

174
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,550
Princess Lingshan…

175
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay.

176
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,870
This silly kid.

177
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,600
Why is he breathing it all in?

178
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,480
Give the censer to the princess now.

179
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,360
Milady?

180
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,790
What are you doing?
You scared the life out of me!

181
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,670
What's going on, Milady?

182
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,440
Is there

183
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
a thief in there?

184
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,480
You're not needed here.

185
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,390
Just leave.

186
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,910
Please honor your reputation

187
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,550
and don't do anything that disgraces Mr. Qin.

188
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,240
You!

189
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,510
I'm gonna tear your mouth apart

190
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,840
if you keep talking nonsense!

191
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,510
You shameless bitch.

192
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,030
You actually tried to have me drugged!

193
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,750
Princess, please let me explain.

194
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,600
A misunderstanding.

195
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,840
It's a misunderstanding!

196
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,600
Someone help!

197
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:44,910
Princess.

198
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,360
-Someone help!
-Please stop, Princess.

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Fen!

200
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,120
Lingshan…

201
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
Lingshan…

202
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,030
Lingshan!

203
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,630
Lingshan!

204
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,320
Milady!

205
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,790
Oh no, this is bad.

206
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,600
Milady, help me!

207
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,030
Yanzhi!

208
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,320
Bring some water here! Hurry!

209
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,870
Milady!

210
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,030
Somebody help!

211
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,440
Fen, wake up!

212
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,390
It's Mother.

213
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,910
Wake up now, Fen!

214
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,910
Wake up!

215
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,000
Lingshan?

216
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,360
Lingshan.

217
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,910
I'm not Lingshan.

218
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,030
Lingshan.

219
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm not Lingshan.

220
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,150
Lingshan.

221
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:48,960
Lingshan.

222
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
-I'm not Lingshan!
-Lingshan.

223
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Lingshan.

224
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,150
Yanzhi, pour water on him! Hurry!

225
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,750
Father.

226
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,840
I…

227
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,120
What's going on?

228
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
I…

229
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,480
Speak!

230
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,440
Here's the thing.

231
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
The princess just came.

232
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,030
I wanted to bring them together,

233
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,440
so I used a bit of…

234
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,670
That incense.

235
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,320
Who could've thought…

236
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,390
Mother.

237
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,870
You brainless creature!

238
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,080
Have you not caused me enough trouble?

239
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,720
If Lord Kang looks into this,

240
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,510
I'll put you in shackles and send you to him!

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,720
You unfilial son!

242
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,840
Guards!

243
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,720
Flog him thirty strokes!

244
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,360
And lock him up for introspection!

245
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,910
-Yes.
-Yes.

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,670
Mother.

247
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,270
Young Master.

248
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:54,960
Mother.

249
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,080
Mother!

250
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,840
Fen!

251
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,150
Fen!

252
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,320
Fen!

253
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,270
Mother!

254
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,270
Yanzhi,

255
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,030
has my dad left?

256
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,240
Young Master, Mr. Qin has left.

257
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,360
What happened to me just now?

258
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,480
-Young Master, you were…
-Fen!

259
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,600
Fen!

260
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,960
Are you okay?

261
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,030
Mother!

262
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,440
Let me see.

263
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,120
Qin Yuanhong is such a monster!

264
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,480
I can't believe he hit you so hard!

265
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,000
He dared hurt my son!

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
I'll make him pay for this!

267
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,790
Mother, it hurts!

268
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,480
Chen.

269
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,390
Chen.

270
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,550
Don't push yourself too hard.

271
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,750
It might harm your health.

272
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,550
I understand.

273
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,910
Congrats, Marquis Li.

274
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,390
Your powers are growing exponentially.

275
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,390
When you follow Marquis Wu'an into the court,

276
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,670
it'll be a piece of cake

277
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,750
for you to be the prime minister!

278
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,790
When you have the world at your feet,

279
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,840
don't forget your friends here.

280
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,790
Come. Allow me to toast you, Brother Li!

281
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,550
Brother Wei,

282
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,720
thanks for the meal today.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,480
You're most welcome.

284
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,270
It's just a meal.

285
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,720
It's not worth mentioning.

286
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,630
Brother Wei,

287
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
you'd better catch up soon.

288
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,270
I expect to go a few rounds with you

289
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,320
when you've made your breakthrough

290
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,790
to see who's better.

291
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,030
You flatter me.

292
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,480
I'll never be a match for you.

293
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,960
Actually, I'm here today

294
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,480
to ask a favor from you.

295
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,910
I'll cut to the chase.

296
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,870
Brother Li,

297
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,360
I'd like you to teach Qin Chen a lesson

298
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,960
in the Academy Examination.

299
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Qin Chen?

300
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
You mean the useless bastard
from King of Might Residence?

301
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,080
Brother Li,

302
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,910
that guy is not as useless as you think he is.

303
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,750
He is quite vicious.

304
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,720
Just a couple of days ago,

305
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,360
Wei Zhen and I went a few rounds with him,

306
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,910
only to find he'd been hiding most
of his powers all along.

307
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,910
We both got our asses kicked.

308
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,120
So, you know…

309
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,870
We need your help, Brother Li.

310
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,840
Are you saying

311
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,750
Qin Chen has been hiding
his strength all this time?

312
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,720
Very well.

313
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,270
I'll do it.

314
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,480
Are you serious?

315
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
Qin Chen is nothing.

316
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,600
Handling him is easy-peasy.

317
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Thank you, Brother Li.

318
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,100
[Marquis Wu'an Residence in Xuan Kingdom]

319
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,510
Who's there?

320
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,270
Relax.

321
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,790
I'm just here to befriend

322
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,750
Marquis Li of the Capital.

323
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,030
You know who I am,

324
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
but you still intruded.

325
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,310
You probably have a death wish.

326
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,000
Marquis Li,

327
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,440
why don't you decide

328
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,720
after taking a look first?

329
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,400
You're from the Shadow-slay House?

330
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,270
Open it and take a look.

331
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,960
It's a little gift from me.

332
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,510
Take the pill,

333
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,830
and your martial prowess

334
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,000
will rise another notch.

335
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,110
Is this the legendary

336
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,270
Elixir of Slaughter?

337
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,510
Marquis Li, you're quite a cosmopolitan.

338
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,960
Only the top killers of Shadow-slay House

339
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,790
get to take the Elixirs of Slaughter.

340
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,440
Who on earth are you to the Shadow-slay House?

341
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,240
Relax.

342
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,750
I just want to make friends with you.

343
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,000
Friends?

344
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,480
How very ridiculous!

345
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,030
Why would I be friends with

346
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,920
a thief and rascal like you?

347
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,240
If you know what's good for you,

348
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,550
leave as the soonest.

349
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,830
Or, on my command,

350
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,680
the top fighters in my mansion will be all out,

351
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,550
and your death will be certain.

352
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,550
Since I dared come in,

353
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,680
I have my ways to get out.

354
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,960
You're a smart man.

355
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,640
The Shadow-slay House has stood for many years

356
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,030
due to the assistance of a benefactor.

357
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,880
And this man

358
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,790
has extraordinary

359
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,640
power in Xuan.

360
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,030
Now,

361
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,240
your talent has caught our fancy.

362
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,270
Just regard this Elixir of Slaughter

363
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
as a congratulatory gift
for you winning in advance

364
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,070
the champion of the end-of-year examination.

365
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,830
What do you want in return?

366
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,830
No strings attached.

367
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,680
But, this is valid

368
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,590
on the premise

369
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,790
that you win the championship.

370
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,550
If you can't even do that,

371
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,720
then…

372
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,110
Getting the champion

373
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,510
is as easy as picking my own pocket.

374
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,310
I like your confidence.

375
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,310
I hope that you won't let me down.

376
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,880
Killing without traces,

377
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,590
and leaving without shadows?

378
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,830
So this is the legendary Shadow-slay House?

379
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,000
Only I, Li Qingfeng,

380
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,720
deserve to be the champion of Xuan.

381
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,680
Why would I

382
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,110
take this kind of cheating pill?

383
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,750
Father, Master.

384
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,110
Thank you, Master Liang, for your tutoring.

385
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,000
My daughter is making fast progress.

386
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,400
You flatter me, Lord Kang.

387
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
Her Highness is uniquely talented.

388
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,830
That's why she advances so rapidly

389
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,400
with my secret cultivation method.

390
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,750
No matter what,

391
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,480
you deserve all credit for this, Master.

392
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,880
I'd like her to keep learning from you

393
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,240
to become a decent refiner sooner.

394
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,790
By the way,

395
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,110
tomorrow will be

396
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,030
the end-of-year examination of the Star Academy.

397
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,000
I wonder if you'd like to

398
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,000
go and spectate with me?

399
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,030
[The end-of-year examination?]

400
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,830
[If that's the case,]

401
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,510
[Childe Chen will be there, too.]

402
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,480
I have time

403
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,480
for that.

404
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,160
Rest assured, Master.

405
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,240
I will do my best.

406
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,350
I won't let you down.

407
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Good.

408
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,880
Qin Yong,

409
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,880
tomorrow will be the Academy Examination.

410
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,110
Have you finished what I told you to do?

411
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,350
Milady,

412
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,830
he has agreed to be of service.

413
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,920
It's just that…

414
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,310
Just what?

415
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,920
He thought that you were paying him too little.

416
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,310
He wanted another 20,000 silver coins.

417
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,920
Then give it to him.

418
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,160
As long as it helps us

419
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
stop that kid from passing the examination,

420
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,550
twenty thousand silver coins

421
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,720
will be worthwhile.

422
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,110
Yes.

423
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,070
Milady,

424
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,550
we're spending so much effort

425
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,000
on a kid like Qin Chen.

426
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,880
Is it worth it?

427
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,510
If someone finds out,

428
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,270
not only will we face the anger of Star Academy,

429
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,790
but our family's reputation will also be ruined.

430
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,110
Qin Chen

431
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,920
is the blood relation

432
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,960
of that old man after all.

433
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,750
Although we drove them two out

434
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,830
with the excuse of Liang Yu's matter,

435
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,720
as long as that old man becomes emotional,

436
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,160
he'll fetch them back as nothing happened.

437
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,640
But if that boy

438
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,400
is expelled from Star Academy,

439
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,160
things will be different.

440
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,750
However reluctant the old man is,

441
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,920
it'll be too late for him.

442
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,160
I understand.

443
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,270
I want Qin Yuechi and her son

444
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,790
to be gone for good.

445
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,920
Mother,

446
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,350
I promise you.

447
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,240
Even if Qin Chen awakens his bloodline,

448
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,030
I will neuter him of all his powers.

449
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,640
Fen,

450
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
how's it going with your cultivation?

451
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,480
Mother,

452
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,790
don't worry.

453
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,160
I've made a breakthrough.

454
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,350
I can defeat Qin Chen

455
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,960
with a single move.

456
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,440
Chen, time to eat.

457
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,400
Coming.

458
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,350
Smells so good.

459
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,400
Dig in.

460
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,680
Chen.

461
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:19,920
Mother,

462
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,480
you don't have to concern yourself with

463
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,440
the Academy Examination.

464
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,830
I'll definitely pass.

465
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,750
Then you go first.

466
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,310
I'll go see you later.

467
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,680
Okay.

468
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,940
[Drill Ground of Star Academy]

469
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,750
Chen, you came.

470
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,350
Have your wounds recovered?

471
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,590
My injuries are superficial.

472
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,240
Wei Shen,

473
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,480
is that the Qin Chen you mentioned?

474
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,000
That's him.

475
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,160
Interesting.

476
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,030
Hey, Chen.

477
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,350
That guy

478
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,070
is Li Qingfeng, son of Marquis Wu'an.

479
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,270
He's a top student at the academy.

480
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,000
Top student?

481
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,000
Qin Chen,

482
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,160
it surprises me you have the guts

483
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,960
to attend the Academy Examination.

484
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,720
Let's see how arrogant you are

485
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,350
on the bloodline ritual later.

486
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,790
This way, please.

487
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,310
Please.

488
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,270
Master,

489
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,790
that's Marquis Wu'an's son.

490
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,030
Who do you think

491
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,640
will win? He or Lingshan?

492
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,960
Li Qingfeng is most gifted.

493
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,720
It will indeed not be easy for Lingshan

494
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,480
to defeat him.

495
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,440
But,

496
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,920
what my eyes are fixed on is a young friend.

497
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,310
A young friend?

498
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,920
Is he a friend of yours?

499
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,070
He must be extraordinary

500
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,350
to be called a young friend by you.

501
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,400
Are you talking about

502
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,000
Qin Chen, Master?

503
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,590
Lingshan,

504
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,110
if you meet Qin Chen later,

505
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,310
send him my regards.

506
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,960
Yes, Master.

507
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,790
Lingshan,

508
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,510
who's this Qin Chen…

509
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,400
Dad,

510
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,510
he's the son of Mrs. Qin Yuechi
from King of Might Residence.

511
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,510
I see.

512
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,110
[Chen's level of refining]

513
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,110
[even outshines mine.]

514
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,750
[He must have a big secret on him.]

515
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,310
Royal Brother!

516
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,960
Royal Brother!

517
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,310
Royal Brother!

518
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,720
At today's examination,

519
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,960
with niece Lingshan's gifts,

520
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,590
she'll definitely have her moment.

521
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,070
What are you doing here?

522
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,590
The examination of Star Academy

523
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,000
is also a big event in Xuan.

524
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,790
I'm here to visit

525
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,400
and learn.

526
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,440
-This must be Master Liang Yu.
-Not bad.

527
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,400
I heard there'd been a misunderstanding

528
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,640
between you and King of Might Residence.

529
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,000
This one by my side is Marquis An'ping's wife.

530
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,270
Since you're both here today,

531
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,400
allow me to be a peacemaker.

532
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,920
If you have any misunderstanding,

533
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,440
just explain openly,

534
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,920
so there'll be no hard feelings.

535
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,240
Master Liang Yu,

536
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,030
good day to you.

537
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,920
My family juniors were too ignorant before.

538
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,680
If they displeased you in any way,

539
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,510
please kindly forgive them.

540
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,240
Please don't say that, Ms. Zhao.

541
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,030
Your family affairs

542
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,590
do not concern me.

543
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,750
You don't have to explain to me.

544
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,750
To show how sorry we are,

545
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,920
I've disowned Qin Yuechi and her son.

546
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,790
What?

547
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,880
They are no longer our family members.

548
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,000
You said Qin Chen was driven out

549
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,110
because he conflicted with me?

550
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,510
Exactly.

551
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,270
That good-for-nothing actually

552
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,920
dared offend you, Master.

553
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,790
Driving them out of the family

554
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,440
is already us showing mercy.

555
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I believe

556
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,030
he should kneel in front of the Palace of
Instruments for ten days and ten nights!

557
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,880
Just to let you feel relieved.

558
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,920
Master.

559
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,030
I don't want to hear any more

560
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,240
of your family affairs.

561
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,790
Ms. Zhao, please leave me alone.

562
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,920
Master Liang Yu,

563
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,550
I'm trying to make peace with you.

564
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,640
If there's anything that

565
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,030
we dissatisfied you with,

566
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,240
go ahead and say it.

567
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,310
I'll do anything within my capabilities.

568
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,000
Ms. Zhao,

569
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,920
we are not really that close, are we?

570
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,590
Please stop talking like this.

571
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,110
Master.

572
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,720
Lord Qi,

573
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,440
as a kinsman of the emperor,

574
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,680
you shouldn't hang out
with married women so often.

575
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,270
What…

576
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,350
If other people see it,

577
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,270
they will suspect you two
are having an affair.

578
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,310
No.

579
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,160
Eighth Brother,

580
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,110
Master Liang is right.

581
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,070
You'd better be more cautious in the future,

582
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,880
lest you disgrace the royal clan.

583
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,830
You're right to teach me this lesson.

584
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,720
But, Master Liang,

585
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,000
what you said just now

586
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,960
was a bit too harsh.

587
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,720
Was it?

588
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,440
Master Liang,

589
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,720
I'm a lord of the Xuan.

590
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,400
A little respect, please.

591
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,350
Get out of my face now!

592
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,000
Your Highness!

593
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,590
You slapped me?

594
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,160
Royal Brother, he…

595
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,830
Eighth Brother,

596
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,480
go home, please.

597
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,310
Your Highness, let's go.

598
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,110
