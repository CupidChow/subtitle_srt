[Episode 22]

19
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,630
Qiming,

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,280
let's stop here.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
We can just cultivate here.

22
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,430
Someone's here.

23
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,750
Everyone wants to go as deep as possible

24
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,310
into the Bloodmist Holy Land.

25
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,560
Someone is actually walking outwards.

26
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,150
Maybe this person can't stand it
and wants to retreat.

27
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,120
No,

28
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,710
this person's steps are steady,

29
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,430
without any trace of
weakness or stumbling.

30
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,800
It doesn't seem like
he is on the verge of giving up.

31
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,190
On the contrary, it seems like

32
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,430
he is coming towards us.

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,560
Could he be

34
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,910
from the Zhao Kingdom
and the Ghost Immortal Sect?

35
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,310
Watch out!

36
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
Chen?

37
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,830
Chen!

38
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Surprisingly,

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
the three of us have gathered here again.

40
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,600
The fate we've cultivated
from past lives brought us together.

41
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,240
I followed the aura of both of you

42
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,120
to find my way here.

43
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,560
Chen,

44
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,950
can't the array in the Bloodmist Holy Land

45
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,240
block the spiritual power?

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
How could you sense us?

47
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,040
It's a mere Grade Four array.

48
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,800
As long as my spiritual power
is strong enough,

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,510
I can still sense others.

50
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,190
You see?

51
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,600
Chen is worthy of his reputation.

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,560
Alright, no more bootlicking.

53
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,070
Come with me.

54
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,950
Do I have to…

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,070
I…

56
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,830
Oh no.

57
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,510
I do feel much better.

58
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,510
I thought I was going to die.

59
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,950
You shouldn't have been so quiet.

60
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
You should have told me earlier
if you couldn't resist the pressure.

61
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,630
I was just…

62
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,240
trying to keep up the pace with you.

63
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Qiming and I

64
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,950
don't want to hold you back.

65
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,070
Alright.

66
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,480
Then from now on,

67
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,160
follow my way of channeling vital energy.

68
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,510
It seems that

69
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,830
this five-fold concentration

70
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,800
is just right for you.

71
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,430
Going any further

72
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,920
would only burden your bodies,

73
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,870
perhaps resulting in
more harm than benefit.

74
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,750
You two can cultivate here,

75
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,360
and I will go in deeper to check it out.

76
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,190
Chen,

77
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,160
take care.

78
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,390
It's hurting more and more.

79
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,830
This is close to Heaven-level resistance.

80
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,240
Someone is coming.

81
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,240
There should be no one
who went deeper than me.

82
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,510
Let me cultivate here for a moment,

83
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
and then I can keep going.

84
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,200
Recently, I have been
suppressing my cultivation,

85
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,440
not breaking through to the Heaven level,

86
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,030
with the purpose of surpassing my own limits.

87
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,720
Unexpectedly,

88
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,870
after entering the Bloodmist Holy Land,

89
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,240
my physical body
has once again undergone enhancement.

90
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,510
Surprisingly,
someone arrived here before me.

91
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,200
This person

92
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,630
should be Qin Feng,
the top prodigy of the Xuan Kingdom.

93
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,960
Isn't the best of the Xuan Kingdom Zhao Wei?

94
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,550
Of course not.

95
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,750
Zhao Wei is not worthy of that title.

96
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,240
If I hadn't held back

97
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,790
during our previous confrontation,

98
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,790
Zhao Wei would not have escaped death.

99
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,150
Qin Feng

100
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,000
is the true ace of the Xuan Kingdom

101
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
and the eldest grandson of Qin Batian,

102
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,360
the renowned King of Might
of the Xuan Kingdom.

103
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,000
The Zhao Kingdom and the Xuan Kingdom
have been at war for years,

104
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,550
with Qin Batian stationed at the border.

105
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He has slaughtered

106
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,480
over a million soldiers
of our Zhao Kingdom,

107
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,750
and he arrogantly claims himself

108
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,030
as the War God of the Xuan Kingdom.

109
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,960
War God? That's all bull.

110
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,440
Trying to steal my thunder?

111
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,080
You will get yourself killed.

112
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,440
How dare you interrupt my cultivation?

113
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,390
Again!

114
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,320
Wait!

115
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,030
This place

116
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
is the Bloodmist Holy Land.

117
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,840
If the array is accidentally triggered

118
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,390
and transports us out,
it will be troublesome.

119
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,390
Then let's spare this bastard.

120
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,030
When we get out,

121
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,000
he will be doomed.

[The people of the Ghost Immortal Sect]

123
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,840
[are indeed all lunatics.]

124
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,150
Okay,

125
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,080
I pick this spot.

126
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,480
It has only been two hours,

127
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,510
and I broke through from
the peak of the mid-stage Earth level

128
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,440
to the peak of the late-stage Earth level.

129
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,510
My cultivation base
was originally not high,

130
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,750
and I could only hold on
for a little over two hours.

131
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,870
If I could do it again,

132
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
it wouldn't be impossible

133
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,630
to break through to the Heaven level.

134
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,550
Stop.

135
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,150
Everyone can only go into
the Bloodmist Holy Land once.

136
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,480
Once out,

137
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,840
you can't re-enter.

138
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,030
Only one chance…

139
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,670
How was it? What did you gain?

140
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,510
Master,

141
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,910
I have successfully advanced
from the mid-stage of the Earth level

142
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,270
to the late stage of the Earth level.

143
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,630
Let's go.

144
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,870
In the baptism of the Bloodmist Holy Land,

145
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,960
those who come out earlier

146
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,240
often have weaker strength.

147
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,320
The strongest talent from the last baptism

148
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,480
stayed for a full day and a half.

149
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,720
Who will be able to endure

150
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,870
until the end this time?

151
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,750
You all must stay safe!

152
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,200
My body and spirit
have both been enhanced several times,

153
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,750
and my vision has also
improved significantly.

154
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,030
That is…

155
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,390
a Spirit Core Crystal.

156
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,200
Spirit Core Crystals

157
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,870
are the source of Spirit Core.

158
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,880
They should be the origin
of this Bloodmist Holy Land.

159
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,400
Even in the Martial Domain,

160
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,790
the value

161
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,070
of these items

162
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,510
is immeasurable.

163
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,920
Such a large area

164
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,400
should definitely have more than just one.

165
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,790
Annoying.

166
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,200
A mere Grade Four array

167
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,830
won't stop me.

168
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,480
Who's there?

169
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,110
Excuse me.

170
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,030
A man?

171
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,680
I think I got into the girls' area.

172
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,960
You pervert.

173
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,350
How dare you barge into the girls' area?

174
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,310
If I tell you it's a misunderstanding,

175
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,790
would you believe me?

176
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,830
A misunderstanding?

177
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,440
In the Bloodmist Holy Land,

178
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,030
the male and female areas
are separated by an array,

179
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,200
and unless the array
is deliberately broken,

180
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,680
it is impossible to enter the other side.

181
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,510
You must have malicious intentions,

182
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
and you deliberately infiltrated.

183
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,680
I…

184
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,160
Don't you run!

185
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,880
The sword is so fast!

186
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,550
You want to kill me!

187
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,070
So what?

188
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,590
Trying to fight me in here,

189
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,110
aren't you afraid of
being expelled by the array?

190
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,030
The Sealing Array Disk?

191
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,000
Can't believe you own
such a valuable item!

192
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,720
Sword Essence!

193
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,750
And you know how to master Sword Essence!

194
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,310
You already have such strength,

195
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,830
yet you creep on the girls!

196
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,000
So shameless!

197
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,640
Lady,

198
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,350
if you keep fighting me,

199
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,750
your silk dress is about to break.

200
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,480
What?

201
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,920
Trying to leave?

202
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,920
It's not that easy!

203
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,590
Grade Three sealing array?

204
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,640
This woman has so many treasures.

205
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,510
No…

206
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,270
If I waste time breaking the array,

207
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,240
that crazy woman will catch up.

208
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,790
I have to change my direction.

209
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,240
That pervert!

210
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,720
Don't you run away!

211
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,310
I just took one look,

212
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,350
and I didn't even see anything.

213
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,160
Who's there?

214
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,270
Qin Chen?

215
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,400
Why are you here?

216
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,550
Be quiet.

217
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,480
Lingshan, what's wrong?

218
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,510
I'll explain to you later.

219
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,350
Don't tell anyone that I was here.

220
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,920
Why are you blushing?

221
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,270
Nothing went wrong with your cultivation, right?

222
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,310
I… I'm fine.

223
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,510
That's good.

224
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,880
This is the second day.

225
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,110
Given your current cultivation level,

226
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,270
it is already quite impressive
that you have persisted until now.

227
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,000
If you find it difficult to continue,

228
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,960
you should leave.

229
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,960
Zixun, don't worry.

230
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,510
I won't overly push myself.

231
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,070
What's wrong?

232
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,510
Be quiet.

233
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,000
There's someone around us.

234
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,640
[Oh no.]

235
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,590
[Did Zixun find out he's in here?]

236
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,750
Who's there?

237
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,440
Did you two

238
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,400
see an outsider walk by?

239
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,030
An outsider?

240
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,030
Only the two of us are here.

241
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,070
You are the outsider.

242
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,350
Strange woman.

243
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,750
I will follow You Qianxue

244
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,240
to see what she is up to.

245
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,880
You stay here and continue your cultivation.

246
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,550
Qin Chen,

247
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,240
you can come out now.

248
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,830
Has that crazy woman left?

249
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
What did you do to You Qianxue?

250
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,790
Also,

251
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,510
why are you here?

252
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,240
I was focused on cultivating,

253
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,480
but for some reason, I ended up here.

254
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,880
That crazy woman saw me

255
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,550
and started hunting me down
without letting me explain.

256
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,790
Luckily, I came across you, and I…

257
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,440
Since you helped me,

258
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,920
let me do you a favor too.

259
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,550
Uh…

260
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,720
You go ahead and cultivate.

261
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,110
I'll head back.

262
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,070
What the hell am I thinking about?

263
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,680
Earlier, I could barely hold on,

264
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,240
but now I think I feel…

265
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,550
much better.

266
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,200
Could it be…

267
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,070
That damn pervert!

268
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,440
He got away!

269
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,680
He should pray that he won't meet me again.

270
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,400
I should have thoroughly

271
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,270
searched this area.

272
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,750
Consider the remaining Spirit Core Crystals

273
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,440
as a reserve for the remaining talents

274
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,510
of the five northwestern countries.

275
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:23,880
Let's go.

276
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,720
How was it?

277
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,960
I made a breakthrough, Master.

278
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,960
I made a breakthrough.

279
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,550
That's great.

280
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,030
Let's go.

281
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,200
How do you feel?

282
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,480
It worked so well.

283
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,750
They are coming out.

284
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,790
I can tell from their faces that they made it.

285
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,310
Yeah!

286
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,000
That's right.

287
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,830
Good job.

288
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,510
It felt not bad.

289
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,510
His Majesty was too hasty.

290
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,310
Now, 80 percent of the people

291
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,550
in the Bloodmist Holy Land have come out,

292
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,200
but none of the apprentices
of the Xuan Kingdom have appeared.

293
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,960
If Qin Chen and the others perish in it,

294
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,720
it will be troublesome.

295
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,200
King of Lingwu!

296
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,400
I have achieved a lot!

297
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,590
I have broken through
to the early stage of the Heaven level.

298
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,400
Where are Qin Chen and the others?

299
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,880
Have they been out long ago?

300
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,680
You are

301
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,070
the first one out.

302
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,240
Wh… What?

303
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,030
Me?

304
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,440
Am I the first?

305
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,350
With your cultivation,

306
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,920
being able to last more than a day

307
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,830
is already a miracle.

308
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,240
[In the Bloodmist Holy Land,
what is competed is our will.]

309
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,000
[The stronger the will,]

310
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,310
[the longer we can persist.]

311
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,350
[I have clearly held on to the limit,]

312
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,350
[why am I still the first?]

313
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,550
[Damn it.]

314
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,510
Okay.

315
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,480
Go rest.

316
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,110
Yes.

317
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,270
It's been almost two days.

318
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,720
How come so many people haven't come out yet?

319
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,070
According to past patterns,

320
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,960
the longest only persisted

321
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,240
for about one and a half days.

322
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,960
How come so many people
have persisted until now this time?

323
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,720
Especially the Xuan Kingdom,

324
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,830
with six people

325
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,070
who still haven't come out yet.

326
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,880
It's outrageous!

327
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,160
What are you talking about?

328
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,750
Those low-level kids

329
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,480
probably have died in there.

330
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,920
That one is…

331
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,920
The kid from the Xuan Kingdom!

332
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,750
Greetings, King of Lingwu!

333
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,510
Good job.

334
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,680
As long as you are fine.

335
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,110
It's just

336
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,160
two of them lived.

337
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,590
Look how excited Mr. Xiao is.

338
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,480
Did you break through to the Heaven level?

339
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,110
King of Lingwu,

340
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,110
I was lucky, that's all.

341
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,440
This time, the Bloodmist Holy Land Baptism

342
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,110
has also allowed me to break through
to the late stage of the Earth level.

343
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,160
I am only one step away

344
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,350
from the Heaven level.

345
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,880
Great.

346
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,720
Go rest.

347
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,790
Heaven level?

348
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,960
What?

349
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,350
Another one?

350
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,160
King of Lingwu!

351
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,480
Princess Lingshan.

352
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,160
In the past Bloodmist Baptisms,

353
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,880
those who could break through
to the Heaven level

354
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,680
could almost certainly
rank in the top five in the competition.

355
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,680
But this baptism has not yet ended,

356
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,880
and there are already ten of them
reached the Heaven level.

357
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,830
This…

358
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,000
completely breaks the previous record.

359
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,750
Princess Zixun,
early stage of the Heaven level.

360
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,000
Prince Wei,
early stage of the Heaven level.

361
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,200
King of Lingwu.

362
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,790
Prince Wei,

363
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,960
did you see

364
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Qin Feng and Qin Chen
when you were in there?

365
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,680
Qin Feng is still going through
the Bloodmist baptism.

366
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,830
But Qin Chen…

367
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,680
I haven't seen him since the beginning.
