[Episode 21]

19
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,000
Is this…

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,430
Is this Saber Essence?

21
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,790
You've mastered it.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,200
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,920
It's all thanks to you

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,910
that I made a breakthrough

25
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,080
today.

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,400
No need to thank me.

27
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,870
We've been practicing for so long.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,030
Let's go back and grab something to eat.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
[Both Qin Chen and Qin Feng]

30
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,150
[are from the Qin family,]

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,590
[but their personalities
are vastly different.]

32
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,190
[I heard Qin Feng
wants to lay a hand on Qin Chen.]

33

[I won't let him]

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,240
[do anything]

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,630
[that will hurt Qin Chen.]

36
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,750
Chen,

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,030
there you are.

38
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,960
I'd been looking for you.

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,960
I saw this stretch of wood fall down,

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120
and I knew you'd be here.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,800
So?

42
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,710
Am I smart?

43
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,240
What?

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,710
Are you afraid of losing
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms,

45
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,960
so you pack your things
and try to run away?

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,630
Chen, don't make fun of me.

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,870
I worry that you can't sleep at night,

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,840
so I've brought you some snacks.

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,150
Where did you get these?

50
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,280
From many different places.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,870
My home and the camp.

52
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,590
And I saw a fruit tree when I came here.

53
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,680
It is laden with fruit.

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,430
How could you do that?

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,030
A real man doesn't have sticky fingers.

56
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,150
Fine.

57
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,470
You are a real man, don't eat.

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's eat. Don't let him eat.

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,080
Let's eat.

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,870
What do you have?

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
Lin Tian.

62
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,630
Here.

63
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,470
You're being so nice to me.

64
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,910
Tell me.

65
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,870
What's it about?

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,400
The Competition of Five Kingdoms is approaching.

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,710
I hope you can teach me a few tricks

68
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,710
to beat the fellows from the Zhao

69
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,240
in the competition.

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
Even if I can't beat them,

71
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,800
I can

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,030
escape in time.

73
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,310
So,

74
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,960
are you scared?

75
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,840
Scared? Not really.

76
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,030
Well…

77
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,070
Just to be safe.

78
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,000
You can have this.

79
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,000
I got it from home.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,920
By the way,

81
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,310
what are your plans

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
after the Competition of Five Kingdoms?

83
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,600
I plan to go traveling.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,270
I want to be the top saberman

85
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,510
in the northwestern five kingdoms.

86
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,920
Qiming,

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,630
you're from a disadvantaged family.

88
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,680
Don't you want to get married and settle down

89
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,870
after you become famous

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,870
in the competition?

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
A romantic relationship

92
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,360
will distract me from honing my saber skills.

93
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,240
That's too bad, then.

94
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,720
Your family name will end with you.

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,040
You…

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
Chen, what about you?

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,070
[Shaoyu and I were together,]

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,600
[before]

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,310
[you came into the picture.]

100
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,630
I pretended to love you

101
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,040
just so I could use you.

102
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,560
[Being around you made me sick.]

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,190
Shaoyu and I have a deal.

104
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,190
When we become
Martial Emperors of the Nine Heavens,

105
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,560
it'll be the time of your death.

106
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,840
And then

107
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,190
I can go back to Shaoyu
without having to answer to anybody.

108
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,070
Chen.

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Chen!

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
I…

111
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,070
I haven't thought about that.

112
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,870
What about you, Lin Tian?

113
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,360
Me?

114
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,390
My family business is doing well.

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
I have no blood feud with anyone.

116
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,310
So, my greatest wish

117
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,000
is to follow you.

118
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,120
Honestly speaking,

119
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,240
you've helped me a lot.

120
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,750
You stood up for me

121
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,190
and helped me awaken my bloodline.

122
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,040
I even get to participate
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

123
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,920
It's all thanks to you.

124
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,480
So,

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,630
I want to be of help to you.

126
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,430
Don't say that.

127
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,240
One day,

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,510
I'll need your help.

129
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,720
But be honest,

130
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
I'm scared.

131
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm scared that I take too long to grow.

132
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm scared that I can't keep up with you

133
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
and become your burden.

134
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,240
Moreover, I…

135
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,750
Stop being so long-winded.

136
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Mr. Qin is gone.

137
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,800
It's getting late.

138
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,160
Let's head back.

139
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,360
Hey, wait for me.

140
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,190
What's wrong?

141
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,070
Something's wrong with Li Qingfeng.

142
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,560
Be careful.

143
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,270
During the year-end test,

144
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,870
I found that he wasn't right.

145
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,190
Li Qingfeng

146
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,630
must have some secret.

147
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,750
Secret?

148
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,720
You have to beware of him

149
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,190
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

150
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,630
Here.

151
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,600
Take this.

152
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,920
This will probably come in handy then.

153
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,680
Also,

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,070
I'll teach you

155
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,390
a set of mind mnemonics.

156
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,870
If Li Qingfeng

157
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,750
does something strange,

158
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,440
the mind mnemonics
can restrain him completely.

159
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay.

160
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,030
Chen,

161
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,270
look over there.

162
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,910
[Cao Heng, the third prince of the Zhao Kingdom]
I heard

163
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,960
the talents
from the Xuan Kingdom are here.

164
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm curious.

165
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,630
What kind of sad sacks

166
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,480
has come to Bloodmist Holy Land?

167
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,360
Who is making hyperbolic remarks here?

168
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,630
I am

169
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,510
Cao Heng, from the Zhao Kingdom.

170
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,120
No offense.

171
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,510
But in the last Competition of Five Kingdoms,

172
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,200
many of the Xuan disciples

173
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,240
were eliminated from the very beginning.

174
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,320
Later on,

175
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
some even gave up
and admitted defeat directly.

176
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,910
So, I want to see

177
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,030
who you've sent.

178
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,510
Only these several sad sacks from the Xuan

179
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,600
are going to take part in the competition.

180
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,240
This isn't enough for us
to practice our skills.

181
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,440
I can beat

182
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,550
ten of them by myself.

183
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,120
I dare you to say that again!

184
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,080
What?

185
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,840
If I say that again,

186
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,360
what are you going to do?

187
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,550
If you can take one blow from me,

188
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,120
I'll take back what I just said.

189
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,030
How arrogant.

190
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,440
Overlord Fist!

191
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,790
Insignificant skill.

192
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,960
So,

193
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,600
these are the talents from your kingdom?

194
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,750
So weak.

195
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,390
Cao Heng.

196
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,630
You're the Prince of the Zhao Kingdom.

197
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,080
But you brought your men
to our outpost to make trouble.

198
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,550
Are you trying

199
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,480
to declare war on us?

200
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,840
What?

201
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,440
Is he the prince of the Zhao?

202
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,600
General Yan Huai.

203
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,510
I just came to meet

204
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,150
the talents of your kingdom.

205
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,390
Just now, this man here

206
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,840
wanted to challenge me.

207
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,750
But he couldn't even take one blow from me.

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,440
We didn't cause any trouble.

209
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,030
You're courting death.

210
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,480
-General Yan.
-General Yan.

211
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540
[Yuchi Cheng, the number one
martial artist of the Zhao Kingdom]

212
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,120
Yuchi Cheng.

213
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,360
Yan Huai.

214
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,360
This is a duel between the young people.

215
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,630
It's disgraceful

216
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,480
that you step in.

217
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,000
Yuchi Cheng,

218
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
the number one martial artist of the Zhao,

219
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,080
is also known as the God of Killing.

220
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,150
The God of Killing?

221
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,720
Why is he here?

222
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,550
I don't know.

223
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,360
Yuchi Cheng,

224
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,870
you're the number one martial artist
of the Zhao.

225
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,720
And we never interfere with one another.

226
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,320
If you keep provoking us,

227
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,360
I can only

228
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,080
fight it out with you.

229
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,390
It seems that

230
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
there aren't many talents in the Xuan.

231
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,670
This bunch of sad sacks

232
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,910
all look inept.

233
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,150
No wonder

234
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
no one dared to come forward.

235
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,550
And General Yan Huai had to involve himself.

236
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,630
Has the prince of the Zhao

237
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,960
forgotten his manner?

238
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,750
No wonder the Zhao is known
as the land of barbarians.

239
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,360
Prince Wei,

240
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,320
Princess Zixun,

241
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,390
Princess Lingshan.

242
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,480
Your Highness.

243
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
The fourth prince of the Xuan Kingdom,

244
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,240
Zhao Wei?

245
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,870
The Xuan even sends their princesses.

246
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,480
Do they think the Competition of Five Kingdoms

247
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,910
is an excursion?

248
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,270
No wonder the Xuan

249
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,390
is getting worse from year to year.

250
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,120
Look,

251
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,670
these two have stunning figures

252
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,080
and faces.

253
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,200
Good.

254
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,510
You came at the right time.

255
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,000
Since you're the fourth prince,

256
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,480
how about we spar a little?

257
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,670
I'd like to see

258
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,910
what the prince of the Xuan Kingdom

259
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,440
is capable of.

260
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
That's exactly what I have in mind.

261
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,600
Your Highness,

262
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,960
don't bother with that fellow.

263
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,390
You're of noble status.

264
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,960
Don't stoop to his level.

265
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,870
Let me fight.

266
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,270
Let me fight

267
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,630
and meet the so-called talents
of the Zhao Kingdom.

268
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,750
Wei.

269
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,630
Your Highness.

270
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,960
Say no more.

271
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,670
The Zhao people are here
to look for a fight.

272
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,240
I am a prince.

273
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,870
How can I let them look down on us?

274
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,630
Good.

275
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,030
The fourth prince is so brave.

276
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,630
You know this is suicidal,
yet you still step forward.

277
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,750
I admire you.

278
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,440
Elder Ling Zhong.

279
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,840
I didn't expect
that the fourth prince of the Xuan Kingdom

280
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,480
would be so easily provoked into a fight.

281
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,960
[Ling Zhong, elder of the Ghost Immortal Sect]
So, they are the talents of the Xuan

282
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,060
[Nian Wuji, young sect leader]
that Cao Heng wants to test?

283
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,200
[of the Ghost Immortal Sect]
that Cao Heng wants to test?

284
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,150
Nothing remarkable.

285
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,510
In my opinion,

286
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,360
the so-called talents of the Xuan

287
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,510
are all paper tigers.

288
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,790
How can they compare

289
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,630
with you?

290
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,390
Elder Ling Zhong, what you said is very true.

291
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,630
If I saw it correctly,

292
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,150
those teenagers

293
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,390
are also the talents selected by the Xuan.

294
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,390
It seems that

295
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,200
the Xuan Kingdom is short of capable people.

296
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,320
How pathetic.

297
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,720
You'd better

298
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,630
not let me down.

299
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,750
Demon Flame Sphere!

300
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,200
So powerful.

301
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,870
You've blocked my move.

302
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,960
Demon Flame Bloodline!

303
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,600
No!

304
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,790
Your Highness, be careful!

305
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,840
Attack!

306
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,320
Interesting.

307
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,960
This is so powerful.

308
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,360
Prince Wei is as good as he is.

309
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,790
It's a tie.

310
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,720
Incredible.

311
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,480
Yeah.

312
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,550
If I kill

313
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,960
the fourth prince of the Xuan,

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
Zhao Gao, that old geezer,

315
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,870
will definitely be heartbroken.

316
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,360
Your Highness, watch out!

317
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,310
Yuchi Cheng,

318
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,440
you're courting death.

319
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,110
Don't be reckless.

320
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,720
[What a shame. I didn't make it.]

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,030
Your Highness,

322
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,000
are you alright?

323
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,830
I'm fine.

324
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,240
Thank you, King of Lingwu.

325
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,960
Yuchi Cheng.

326
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,310
How dare you!

327
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,350
What?

328
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,350
Xiao Zhan,

329
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,960
do you want to fight me?

330
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,920
Bring it on.

331
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,790
It seems that Mr. Xiao

332
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,590
dares not engage in a fight.

333
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,550
If that's the case,

334
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,160
today's sparring ends here.

335
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,440
The talents of the Xuan Kingdom
are nothing more than that.

336
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,400
I'll teach you a good lesson

337
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,790
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

338
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,110
Let's go.

339
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,070
Your Highness,

340
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,240
why didn't you take them down?

341
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,440
Don't be impetuous.

342
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,270
They have help.

343
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
If you want to challenge us, do it openly.

344
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,440
Sneaking around is contemptible.

345
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,160
This Xiao Zhan is so arrogant.

346
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,920
Does he really think he's invincible?

347
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,830
Young Master,

348
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,000
don't do anything rash.

349
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,550
We need to be cautious.

350
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,270
Xiao Zhan is the number one martial artist
of the Xuan Kingdom.

351
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,270
His martial prowess

352
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,830
has reached its pinnacle.

353
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,590
If you act recklessly,

354
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,030
you'll definitely suffer.

355
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,720
Could it be

356
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,440
that you're also no match for him?

357
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,350
In the Ghost Immortal Sect,

358
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,480
no one except Master

359
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
can compete with him.

360
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,920
If that's the case,

361
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,400
I'll fight them

362
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,400
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

363
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,960
It's the people
from the Ghost Immortal Sect.

364
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,830
Ghost Immortal Sect?

365
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,640
The top sect in the five kingdoms.

366
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,000
They've never involved themselves
in any disputes between the five kingdoms.

367
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,440
What are they doing here?

368
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,270
Don't tell me they've joined hands
with the Zhao?

369
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,160
In the Competition of Five Kingdoms,

370
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
you have to be careful of not only the Zhao

371
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,510
but also the Ghost Immortal Sect.

372
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,200
-Yes.
-Yes.

373
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,750
The Ghost Immortal Sect

374
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,110
is one of the top sects in the northwest.

375
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,200
If they join hands with the Zhao,

376
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,510
the Xuan will be in trouble.

377
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,830
The eight of you,

378
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
come with me.

379
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,440
What is this?

380
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,200
And that?

381
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
These people are
whom the Xuan has selected?

382
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,030
As we all know,

383
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,680
the older you get,
the greater your martial prowess is

384
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,790
and the more benefits you'll get
in Bloodmist Holy Land.

385
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,960
These brats are only

386
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,680
at the early stage of Earth level.

387
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,750
Even if they enter Bloodmist Holy Land.

388
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,590
What benefit can they get?

389
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,350
The King of the Xuan

390
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,000
is senile.

391
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
How audacious!

392
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,400
Xiao Zhan,

393
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,240
how dare you raise your voice

394
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,070
at the prince of the Zhao?

395
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,200
Xiao Zhan,

396
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,920
yelling at a junior

397
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,590
is unbecoming to someone

398
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,030
who's regarded
as the number one martial artist of the Xuan.

399
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,920
Ling Zhong,

400
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,550
this is between the Xuan
and the Zhao Kingdom.

401
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,350
What does it have to do with you?

402
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,550
I'm just speaking out for the innocent.

403
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,790
It seems that the Xuan Kingdom

404
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,720
has made many enemies among the five kingdoms.

405
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,160
If you encounter people from the Zhao
and the Ghost Immortal Sect

406
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,720
in Bloodmist Holy Land,

407
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,160
you have to be careful.

408
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,070
Yes.

409
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,960
The Zhao has teamed up
with the Ghost Immortal Sect.

410
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,270
We're likely to be in danger.

411
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,350
If you meet the Xuan disciples

412
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,310
in the preliminary matches,

413
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,160
kill them all.

414
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,510
I'll give you an extra reward.

415
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,790
Yes, my lord.

416
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,110
With us helping you,

417
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,510
if the disciples from the Xuan
enter the competition,

418
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,160
they'll surely die.

419
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,160
[Among the five kingdoms in the northwest,]

420
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,030
[the You is the strongest,]

421
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,590
[followed by the Xuan and the Zhao.]

422
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,640
[The Wu and Huang]

423
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,720
[are relatively weaker.]

424
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,350
[Apart from that,]

425
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,550
[Sky-reaching Sect, the dominant sect,
and the Ghost Immortal Sect]

426
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,830
[were in the top ten
in the last competition.]

427
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,270
The Sky-reaching Sect is here.

428
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,270
You Qianxue is here.

429
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,260
[You Qianxue, young sect leader
of the Sky-reaching Sect]

430
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,310
You Qianxue,
the daughter of the Sky-reaching Sect leader.

431
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,830
She is that extraordinary rare talent
of the Sky-reaching Sect.

432
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,590
It seems that she is as gifted

433
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,510
as Qin Feng is.

434
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,350
Everyone is here.

435
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,070
Let's get started.

436
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,550
Bloodmist Holy Land is at the entrance.

437
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,160
Men on the left, women on the right.

438
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,640
If you can't bear it,

439
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,790
just come out.

440
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,640
Why do you separate the men and women?

441
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,030
Bloodmist will corrode clothing.

442
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,350
So men and women will be
in two different areas.

443
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,000
[It'll corrode clothing.]

444
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,510
[Is bloodmist]

445
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,070
[the fabled thing in the Martial Domain?]

446
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,640
Lingshan, don't worry.

447
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,110
This is a garment made of premium silk,

448
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,240
which can prevent the corrosion
of bloodmist.

449
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,510
One for each of us.

450
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,350
You men don't need this thing.

451
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,200
Remember,

452
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,200
If you can't stand it
in the Bloodmist Holy Land,

453
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,750
come out right away.

454
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,960
Or else your lives will be in danger.

455
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,790
Yes.

456
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,400
[Grade Four Soul-Trap Array.]

457
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,160
[It seems that there's an array master]

458
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,240
[who's at the peak of Grade Four
in the northwestern five kingdoms.]

459
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,790
In this Soul-Trap Array,

460
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,270
there should be a displacement array.

461
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,110
All martial artists

462
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,550
who get in here are put
in different places,

463
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,590
making it difficult for us
to meet each other.

464
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,880
It's Spirit Core Bloodmist.

465
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,270
Spirit Core Bloodmist

466
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,550
is a powerful mist that can transform

467
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,880
a martial artist's body.

468
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,830
Even in the Martial Domain,

469
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,400
it's a top-class treasure
for tempering the body.

470
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,310
Its value is immeasurable.

471
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,070
It hurts.

472
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,830
This is so painful.

473
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,270
[There are many martial artists nearby]

474
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,510
[who are also absorbing
the bloodmist spiritual energy.]

475
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,510
It hurts so much.

476
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,920
I can't take it anymore. It's killing me.

477
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
No, I can't take it anymore.

478
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,160
I can't go any further.

479
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,200
Relieving pain with vital energy

480
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,070
will prevent the Spirit Core energy
from tempering the body.

481
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,590
It'll do harm rather than good.

482
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,680
One must relax

483
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,000
and allow the Spirit Core energy

484
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,750
to temper the body

485
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,270
through every cell and pore

486
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,510
in order to change the body profoundly

487
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,000
to achieve transformation.

488
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,030
Wang Qiming,

489
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,680
I didn't expect

490
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,590
that we'd be sent to the same place.

491
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,550
What a coincidence.

492
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,440
Well, in that case,
let's practice together.

493
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,350
Maybe we'll run into Chen.

494
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,000
