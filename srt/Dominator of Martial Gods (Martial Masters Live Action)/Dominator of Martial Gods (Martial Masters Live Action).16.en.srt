00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,840
Your Majesty.

192
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,320
Your Majesty.

193
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
In my opinion,

194
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,480
we must ask Dan Pavilion

195
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,240
to give an explanation.

196
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,150
So that they'll know

197
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,870
the national prestige is not challenged.

198
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,630
Right.

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,150
King of Lingwu,

200
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,440
what's your opinion?

201
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,870
Your Majesty.

202
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,320
I think Marquis Qin has a point.

203
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,120
Although Qin Chen won first place
in the year-end exam,

204
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,600
he acts arrogantly

205
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,480
and needs to be taught a lesson.

206
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,790
Have you had enough?

207
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,960
Can you talk business?

208
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,000
But I heard

209
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,750
Lord Qi hit on Miss Xiao

210
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,030
and provoked her.

211
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,240
Is that true?

212
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,840
This…

213
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,510
Brother.

214
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,320
I'm wronged.

215
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,960
Al…

216
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,080
Although Miss Xiao

217
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
is kind of good-looking,

218
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,840
I…

219
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,720
I'm

220
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,550
not so lecherous as to hit on her.

221
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,480
Whether Lord Qi has hit on Miss Xiao

222
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,870
has yet to be identified.

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
We can't take Miss Xiao's word for it.

224
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,840
Concubine Yi.

225
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,670
What do you think?

226
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,510
Lord Qi.

227
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,670
Who do you think is more beautiful,

228
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,550
me or Miss Xiao?

229
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,080
Both are beautiful

230
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
in your own way.

231
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,960
No…

232
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,000
Your Highness is more beautiful.

233
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,320
No…

234
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,870
Brother.

235
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,750
I didn't mean that.

236
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,750
I mean…

237
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,670
What do you mean?

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,750
I mean…

239
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,720
I…

240
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,870
Your Majesty.

241
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,630
In my opinion,

242
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,080
Qin Chen has not only challenged Lord Qi

243
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
but also the royal prestige of the Xuan.

244
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,510
If we let him be,

245
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,790
he would be absolutely lawless.

246
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,270
Nonsense.

247
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,150
The incident results from

248
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,150
Lord Qi's outrageous behavior
toward Dan Pavilion.

249
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,120
You…

250
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,440
Your Majesty, please be wise.

251
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,630
You're smearing me.

252
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm being wronged.

253
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,270
You know perfectly

254
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,120
whether you're wronged.

255
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,630
I…

256
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,870
All right…

257
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,960
Stop it.

258
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,440
Brother.

259
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,750
I'm being wronged.

260
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,150
What the hell did I do wrong?

261
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,720
Brother, you know

262
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,720
I have been fond of Yuechi
since I was young.

263
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,480
When I was 16,

264
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,030
I climbed to the top of the wall

265
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,320
to take a look at Yuechi.

266
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,750
But

267
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
a maid of the Qins
happened to be taking a bath.

268
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,270
Lord Qin Batian

269
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,120
stripped me naked

270
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,840
and kicked me out of their residence.

271
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,870
Since then,

272
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
I have had a reputation as a rapist
in the Capital.

273
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,240
When I was 18,

274
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,030
I asked Father to ask Yuechi for marriage.

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,030
Brother, you said you liked Yuechi too

276
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,550
and beat me up.

277
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,240
Then Yuechi had gone missing.

278
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,120
When I was 28,

279
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,030
Yuechi was back

280
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
as an unmarried mother

281
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,790
with her son.

282
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,960
But

283
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,480
I didn't mind that.

284
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,480
All I wanted was to be with Yuechi!

285
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
However,

286
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
many times

287
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,600
I went to see Yuechi,

288
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,440
and they shut the door on me.

289
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,440
They even called me a lustful prince.

290
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
Once I managed to see Yuechi,

291
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,000
her son kicked me out!

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,550
Afterwards, I was beaten by Liang Yu

293
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,630
and just got beaten by Liu Guang.

294
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,550
I'm wronged because

295
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,750
I haven't even seen Xiao.

296
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,720
How can I hit on her?

297
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,270
Brother, I'm wronged.

298
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,270
You must find justice for me.

299
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,960
I'm 46 years old

300
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,550
and still a virgin.

301
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,790
Tell me.

302
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,240
You tell me.

303
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,150
Among all the officers,

304
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,720
is there anyone more devoted than me?

305
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,240
How did I end up with the name of a rapist?

306
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,200
All right…

307
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,870
Stop it.

308
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,480
What's this place? The royal court.

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
Don't you feel embarrassed?

310
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,870
Go aside.

311
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,510
All right…

312
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,870
Guys.

313
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,840
Let's discuss

314
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,360
how to deal with Dan Pavilion.

315
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,790
Your suggestions

316
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,960
have a point.

317
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,480
Concubine Yi.

318
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,000
Huh?

319
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,320
What do you think we should do?

320
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,510
Dan Pavilion is in a high position and

321
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,510
has deals with other countries.

322
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,630
You want to punish them.

323
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,360
Why don't you let Lord Qi

324
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,030
and Marquis Qin both give their ideas

325
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,720
before you make decisions?

326
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,320
Right?

327
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,320
Qin Yuanhong.

328
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,200
You first.

329
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,550
Your Majesty.

330
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,550
I guess

331
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,510
although Dan Pavilion is in a high position,

332
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,270
they shouldn't ignore the law.

333
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,720
Dan Pavilion should be
severely reprimanded.

334
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,480
Lord Qi.

335
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,870
It's your turn.

336
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,440
I…

337
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,080
Marquis Qin said it right.

338
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,840
They actually ignored the royal prestige.

339
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,390
They must be severely punished.

340
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,000
As long as the King of Lingnan
stops offering them herbs,

341
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,630
they

342
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,790
will be reconciled.

343
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,480
Mm.

344
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,150
In my opinion,

345
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,270
all of you have a point.

346
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,270
All right.

347
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
I appoint you to go to Dan Pavilion.

348
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,030
The one who came up with the idea
will carry it out.

349
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,640
If it's settled,

350
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,160
you'll be rewarded well.

351
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,680
I…

352
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,030
I…

353
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,350
I can only give suggestions.

354
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,480
The implementation
depends on you, Your Majesty.

355
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,960
Imperial edicts are

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,550
announced by the Ministry of Justice.

357
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,550
I think it's better
to ask the ministry to do that.

358
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,550
Lord Qi.

359
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,590
You just suggested

360
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,880
stopping offering herbs to Dan Pavilion.

361
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,310
I think it's a great idea.

362
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,590
Therefore,

363
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,110
I appoint you

364
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,640
to announce the message to them.

365
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,720
Brother.

366
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,480
I thought it over.

367
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,750
Over the years,

368
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,640
Dan Pavilion played a role
in enhancing the national strength.

369
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,960
I think it's proper to give them

370
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,350
a warning.

371
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,240
That will do.

372
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,270
I'd like you to give them a warning.

373
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,160
I…

374
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,680
Bro…

375
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,440
Brother.

376
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,160
I thought it over again.

377
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,030
I think

378
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,270
the royalty has close cooperation
with Dan Pavilion.

379
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,110
It's not worth hurting the relationship because

380
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
of the trivial matter.

381
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,830
I think

382
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,160
we should let go of it.

383
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,790
Qin Yuanhong.

384
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,160
What about you?

385
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,350
Your Majesty.

386
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,160
Qin Fen and Lord Qi misbehaved

387
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,590
and should be punished severely.

388
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,680
Kang.

389
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,270
Yes.

390
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,070
Go to Dan Pavilion with my edict.

391
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,480
Tell Dan Pavilion,

392
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,640
Lord Qi behaved indiscreetly

393
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,480
and disgraced the royalty.

394
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,880
I'll keep him under close supervision

395
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,880
and under punishment.

396
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,750
And

397
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,510
Qin Fen, the son of Marquis of Anping,

398
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,550
stirred up trouble

399
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,830
and disturbed the imperial city,

400
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,110
so he is sentenced to 20 spankings

401
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,310
as a warning.

402
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,750
Yes.

403
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,790
A brilliant decision.

404
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,680
-I'll follow the edict.
-I'll follow the edict.

405
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,070
You can leave.

406
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,480
Yes.

407
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,240
Thank you, brother.

408
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,830
Mom.

409
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,440
Is His Majesty

410
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,110
not going to punish
Qin Chen or Dan Pavilion?

411
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
All right, Fen.

412
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,350
Lie still.

413
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,310
Don't worry.

414
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,310
I'll get even with them.

415
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,550
Your brother is coming back to the Capital.

416
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,640
When he sees you

417
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,310
in bed covered with sores,

418
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,200
he'll definitely avenge you.

419
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,880
Really?

420
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,160
It's great.

421
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,480
Feng will not let it go.

422
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,960
With his martial prowess,

423
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,510
Qin Chen will be dead.

424
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,510
Enough!

425
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,400
Do you want me to be

426
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,310
scolded by His Majesty again?

427
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,750
If you go on like this,

428
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,880
you will destroy the whole family.

429
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,550
Yuanhong.

430
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,000
Fen is so miserable.

431
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,510
Don't you feel sorry for him?

432
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,830
He has not only lost his martial prowess

433
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,030
but also the right
to inherit the title of marquis.

434
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,270
What is he gonna do?

435
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:53,720
Mom.

436
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,790
Stop. Enough!

437
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,270
It hurts.

438
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,350
How can I not feel sorry for him?

439
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,350
Qin Chen is now favored by His Majesty

440
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,790
and also under the protection
of Lord Kang and Dan Pavilion.

441
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,480
Even your uncle spoke for him.

442
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm warning you.

443
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,750
Don't stir up trouble.

444
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,350
If you make trouble again,

445
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,750
I can't keep you safe.

446
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,550
Fen, rest assured.

447
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,590
I won't let go of it.

448
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,680
I swear I'll never let the pest go.

449
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,590
Listen to the imperial edict.

450
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,960
By His Majesty's edict,

451
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,310
Qin Fen, the son of Anping,
stirred up trouble

452
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,110
and disturbed the imperial city,

453
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,270
so he is sentenced to 20 spankings

454
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,790
as a warning.

455
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
That's all.

456
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,750
-No, Yuanhong!
-Mom.

457
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,640
He's badly injured.

458
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,070
Mom.

459
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,200
-Fen…
-Mom, help me!

460
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,160
Help me, Mom!

461
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,480
Fen is badly injured!

462
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,720
-You're killing him!
-Mom!

463
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,400
-Fen.
-Mom!

464
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,750
Fen!

465
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,030
Help me, Mom!

466
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,830
Ms. Qin.

467
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,000
Are you disobeying the edict?

468
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,880
Yuanhong.

469
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,880
You merciless killers.

470
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,640
My poor son!

471
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:32,220
[Qin Residence]

472
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,480
Qin Chen.

473
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,590
I heard Qin Feng is coming back.

474
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,960
You should be careful.

475
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,960
Are you

476
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,350
worried about me?

477
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm not.

478
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,240
Your Bloodline Awakening Solution

479
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,880
is effective

480
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,200
and helped me a lot.

481
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,110
So I don't want to see you get beaten up.

482
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,640
Really?

483
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,830
Are you not worried at all?

484
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,240
What do I have to worry about?

485
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,240
I have nothing against him.

486
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,510
Is he going to kill me?

487
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,160
Are you out of your mind?

488
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,110
He's Qin Fen's elder brother.

489
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,680
Qin Feng has been bold.

490
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,750
If you meet him,

491
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,590
you'd better stay away from him.

492
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,110
You can't stop good fortune

493
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,400
or can't escape bad.

494
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,960
If he wants to see me,

495
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,160
let him come to me.

496
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,270
Your Majesty.

497
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,940
[Qin Feng, the elder son of Qin Yuanhong]

498
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,200
Qin Feng.

499
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,880
Good for you.

500
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,310
Over the years,

501
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,550
you've achieved war exploits for the Xuan.

502
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,510
Not long ago,

503
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,790
you defeated the large enemy force of the Zhao

504
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,590
and made them retreat
by over 150 kilometers.

505
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,110
You've demonstrated our national strength.

506
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,160
I'll give credit to whoever deserves it.

507
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,880
Tell me.

508
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,750
What reward do you want?

509
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,880
Your Majesty.

510
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,440
It's my duty

511
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,440
to pledge my life for the Xuan.

512
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
I want no reward.

513
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,720
Good.

514
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,830
Even so,

515
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,880
you've achieved war exploits on the frontier.

516
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,590
If I don't reward you,

517
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,270
people will talk.

518
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,070
The Zhao casts covetous eyes on our country

519
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
and has attacked us over the years.

520
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,790
Their wild ambition
was thoroughly exposed.

521
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,160
I heard you practiced martial arts

522
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,000
and have distinguished yourself in the army.

523
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,680
So I recalled you

524
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,030
for Bloodmist Holy Land Baptism.

525
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,720
Qin Feng.

526
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,070
Do you have confidence

527
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,640
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms?

528
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,350
Your Majesty.

529
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,550
I will surely win first place for the Xuan

530
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,640
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

531
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,440
Good.

532
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,960
Listen,

533
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
if you win first place,

534
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,110
I'll grant

535
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,720
you Marquis of Champion.

536
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,550
Mr. Meng.

537
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,070
The title of Marquis of Champion
is the first-class reward

538
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,550
for young generals.

539
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,200
The recipient is privileged

540
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,750
to go into the court with his sword.

541
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,720
That's a great honor

542
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,480
and signifies a high position.

543
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,550
Qin Feng is only 20.

544
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,550
If he's granted the title of marquis,

545
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,400
he'll be the youngest Marquis of Champion

546
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,000
of the Xuan in history

547
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,160
and the first 20-year-old

548
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,480
general entitled as a marquis.

549
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,030
Thanks, Your Majesty.

550
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,350
I'll do my utmost

551
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,110
to win first place in the competition

552
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,640
and win honor for the country.

553
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,350
Great.

554
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,880
I'm waiting for your good news.

555
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,030
Your Majesty.

556
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,070
I

557
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,030
have something to say.

558
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,440
Feel free to speak up.

559
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,310
I heard Qin Chen won first place in the test

560
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,510
of Star Academy

561
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,790
and got the chance
to enter the Bloodmist Holy Land.

562
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,960
I don't think

563
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,440
it's proper.

564
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,240
Qin Chen hurt our clansman

565
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,550
to win first place.

566
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,160
How can a heartless man

567
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,480
be qualified to

568
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,480
enter the Bloodmist Holy Land?

569
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,680
Your Majesty,

570
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,590
I implore

571
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,790
that Qin Chen shall be disqualified.

572
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,590
Qin Feng.

573
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,030
I've promised Qin Chen.

574
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,880
A king sticks to his word.

575
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,640
The word, once spoken, can

576
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,750
never be recalled.

577
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
It's the same

578
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,720
when I may grant you Marquis of Champion.

579
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,790
Don't mention this matter again.

580
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,350
Okay.

581
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,200
I know.

582
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,030
You can leave.

583
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,400
Yes.

584
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,160
Brother.

585
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,680
Why did you have to do that?

586
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,480
Dad.

587
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,200
Lingshan.

588
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
What's wrong?

589
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,550
Have you heard of the thing at the court today?

590
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,880
I heard of it.

591
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,310
Qin Feng is so hateful.

592
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,550
He actually requested

593
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,070
that His Majesty disqualify Qin Chen
for Bloodmist Holy Land Baptism.

594
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What a despicable creep.

595
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,830
Luckily, His Majesty

596
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,400
rejected Qin Feng's request.

597
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,310
It seems

598
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,790
that His Majesty
is not happy with Qin Feng.

599
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,160
Not happy?

600
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,590
Do you think His Majesty thinks so?

601
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,480
What do you mean?

602
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:31,070
His Majesty promised Qin Feng
the title of marquis

603
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,270
and rejected Qin Feng's request
to punish Qin Chen.

604
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,680
He didn't forbid it

605
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,590
or say something to soothe him.

606
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,440
Do you know why?

607
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,720
I don't know.

608
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,720
He wants Qin Feng and Qin Chen to fight

609
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,790
so that he can weaken the Qin family

610
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,960
to prevent it from becoming uniquely powerful.

611
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
This…

612
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,400
In that case,

613
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,880
the Xuan would suffer great loss

614
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,790
whether it's Qin Feng

615
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,310
or Qin Chen who is defeated.

616
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,720
Lingshan.

617
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,400
What do you think of Qin Chen?

618
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,830
I won't lose to him

619
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,720
in the next contest.

620
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,070
That's not what I mean.

621
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,070
What do you mean, dad?

622
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,070
Come with me.

623
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,160
Dad.

624
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,750
I know what you mean.

625
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,200
I'm going to practice martial art.

626
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,270
You…

627
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:15,590
You…

628
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,200
Pra…

629
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,000
Pra…

630
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,110
Father, Mother,

631
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,030
