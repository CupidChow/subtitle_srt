Mom.

20
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,120
Could… Could Qin fail the mission?

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,400
Why isn't there news from him for so long?

22
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,870
Fen,

23
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,920
calm down.

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Remember what I taught you?

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,310
Remain calm when faced with major events.

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
Be like your elder brother.

I understand.

I just can't wait.

Qin won't miss it.

34
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,750
To deal with Qin Chen,

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,430
Qin even hired killers
from Shadow-Slay House.

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,870

Have you ever behaved like one?

90
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,630
You've already driven Yuechi and her son out,

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,190
and now you even want them dead?

92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,750
How dare you!

93
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,000
How can you talk to me like this?

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,630
I didn't know

95
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,750
what Qin was doing.

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,430
I'll explain to His Majesty personally.

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,160
You don't have to worry about that.

98
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,390
Great.

99
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,070
You didn't know, huh?

100
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,160
Okay.

101
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,390
I won't say anything else.

102
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,390
If anything happens to Yuechi and Qin Chen,

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,750
I, Qin Yuanzhi, will never let this go!

104
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,360
By then,

105
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,870
don't blame me for disregarding our brotherhood.

106
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,360
And you, Zhao Feng.

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,630
This is our Qin family!

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
You don't have a say as a Zhao!

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,430
You…

110
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,390
Yuanhong, look at him!

111
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,480
How disrespectful!

112
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,600

If I come a bit later,

119
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,720
you'll turn everything upside down, won't you?

120
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,950
Did you actually allow Qin to kill Qin Chen

121
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,560
with killers from Shadow-Slay House?

122
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,720
Have you lost your mind?

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Qin acted on his own.

124
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,240
I had no idea about this at all!

125
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,360
As the patriarch of the Qin family,

126
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,920
someone in your family committed such a crime,

127
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,240
and you didn't know?

128
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,430
Without your acquiescence,

129
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,950
how dare Qin, a little butler of the Qin family,

130
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,190
have the guts to do this?

131
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,680
Qin Yuanhong,

132
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,870
think about it.

133
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,390
If the plan miscarries because of you,

134
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,600
can you take responsibility?

135
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,510
I was being careless.

136
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,270

150
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,030
This is outrageous!

Please judge wisely.

153
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,750

156
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,000

previously on the Academy Examination,

160
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,240
Qin already tried to frame Qin Chen.

161
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,670
Now, he did not only repent

162
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
but also went one step further.

163
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,840
Did you secretly order him

164
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,910
to collude with Shadow-Slay House?

165
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,670
Nonsense!

166
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,320
Qin Chen is my family member.

167
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,670
How can I be so ruthless to my family?

168
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,720
Qin is probably sent by

169
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,440
Shadow-Slay House to hide in my family.

170
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,080
Mr. Chu, what you said is total slander!

171
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,510

172
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,030

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,630
I'm gonna beat you to death!

182

189
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,840
Stop!

190
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,440
This isn't what you should do in this hall!

191
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,720
Let's talk business.

192
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,870
The King of Lingnan,

193
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
what's your take on Qin Chen's case?

194
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,080
Your Majesty,

195
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,150
in my humble opinion,

196
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,960
whether this is related to Yuanhong or not,

197
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,910
we should take Qin Chen seriously,

198
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,750
for he's a young and promising talent.

199
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,390
We must get to the bottom

200
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,480
of this assassination.

201
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,630
Your Majesty, I'd like to investigate this case.

202
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,270
If this is really related to Marquis Qin,

203
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,390
I shall punish him without mercy!

204
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,240
You two, what do you think?

205
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,360
Your Majesty,

206
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,960
since King of Lingwu volunteered

207
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,510
to investigate this case personally,

208
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,440
I'll certainly trust him.

209
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,320
Fine, then.

210
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,510
I'll leave it

211
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,670
to King of Lingwu.

212
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

213
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,670
Chen!

214
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,510
Chen!

215
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,000
Are you okay?

216
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,390
I was worried sick.

217
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,840
I heard that last night

218
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,200
your house was under attack.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,550
Where did you hear the news?

220
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,910
Wait… Chen, you don't know yet?

221
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,870
Lord Kang and Mr. Chu
went to report to His Majesty

222
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,270
before the day broke.

223
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,320
They told him you were assassinated by
the butler of the Qin family last night.

224
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,030
Now His Majesty has given the order

225
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,840
to let King of Lingwu solve this case!

226
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,480
They said if someone had colluded
with Shadow-Slay House,

227
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
he'd not be tolerated.

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,600
Now it's a mess in King of Might Residence.

229
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,440
I didn't expect Mr. Chu and Lord Kang

230
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,630
to make such a fuss.

231
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,320
It's good, though.
Let the Qin family be messy for a while.

232
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,480
Lin Tian,

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,750
why has your cultivation improved again?

234
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,480
Thanks to the cultivation method you gave me.

235
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,670
Now I've become

236
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,480
the pride of the Xuan, so to speak.

237
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,790
But things don't look quite right.

238
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,840
It's nothing. Come with me.

239
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,080
Mr. Qin, what brings you here?

240
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,240
My friend and I would like a bloodline chamber.

241
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,360
May I trouble you with that?

242
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,840
You're most welcome.

243
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,080
How could such a little thing be trouble?

244
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,270
This way, please.

245
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,550
[Why are people at Bloodline Holy Land]

246
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,630
[so welcoming to Chen?]

247
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,550
What's on your mind?

248
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,030
Mr. President has specially told me that

249
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,480
this bloodline chamber is all yours.

250
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,390
No reservation is needed.

251
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,360
If there's nothing else you need,

252
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,030
I will leave first.

253
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,840
Okay.

254
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,240
Lin Tian.

255
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,600
Bloodline Stone?

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,240
Chen, what are you up to?

257
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,270
I've already awakened my bloodline.

258
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,270
Let me help you awaken it again.

259
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,150
Hold the stone and do as I say.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,750
Activate your bloodline to its full later.

261
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,960
Come on down.

262
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
It's actually Nether Fire.

263
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,670
And the form is actually Dark Moon Grey Clouds.

264
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,390
No wonder you progressed so fast

265
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,910
after I gave you the formula.

266
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,360
The form of Dark Moon Grey Clouds
plus Nether Fire,

267
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,960
what a classic match!

268
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,440
Chen,

269
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,750
what I have is the Fire Bloodline.

270
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,600
What Nether Fire? What moon and cloud?

271
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,390
I don't understand.

272
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,000
Your Fire Bloodline is just a mortal one.

273
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,550
What you really have is Dark Moon Nether Fire.

274
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,360
It's a rare bloodline.

275
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,550
Regular Bloodline Masters won't recognize it.

276
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,750
Dark Moon Nether Fire?

277
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,390
Chen, stop pulling my leg.

278
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,870
Chen really has a keen eye.

279
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,870
Little friend, yours is indeed

280
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,080
the rare Dark Moon Nether Fire bloodline.

281
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,150
Chen,

282
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,030
this is?

283
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,870
This is President Dongfang Qing.

284
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,910
Do you believe me now?

285
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,600
Besides,

286
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,240
I dare not joke about your future.

287
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,270
Chen,

288
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,360
I heard that you won the championship

289
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,550
in the Academy Examination.

290
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,390
I'm here to congratulate you.

291
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,720
Thanks, Mr. President.

292
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,910
You must be Chen's friend.

293
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,360
Having such a rare bloodline,

294
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,320
I presume you must be

295
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,830
going to Bloodmist Holy Land with him?

296
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,830
Mr. President, you flatter me.

297
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,480
How can I be compared with Chen?

298
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,790
I didn't even make it into the top ten.

299
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,440
How can I be qualified to go there…

300
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,070
[Chen brought him here to detect his bloodline.]

301
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,160
[He must be important to Chen.]

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,790
[If I can help him get a chance]

303
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,550
[to enter Bloodmist Holy Land,]

304
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,070
[I'll have done Chen a favor of some sort.]

305
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,590
How could it be?

306
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,510
Even if you didn't make it into the top ten,

307
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,920
with such a rare bloodline,

308
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,590
you should be treated as an exception.

309
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,510
As the president of Bloodline Holy Land,

310
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,720
I will explain this to His Majesty

311
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,270
to try to get him a chance

312
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,790
to enter Bloodmist Holy Land.

313
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,240
Chen, am I not dreaming?

314
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,720
I appreciate your help, Mr. President.

315
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,830
If you could

316
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,790
really help Lin Tian get this chance,

317
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,070
I shall be duty-bound to help

318
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,830
Bloodline Holy Land when needed.

319
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,440
Please don't mention it.

320
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,680
I will try my best.

321
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll take my leave first.

322
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm heading for the royal palace

323
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,960
to ask His Majesty to decide this soon.

324
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,680
Please continue. No need to walk me out.

325
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,720
If President Dongfang Qing

326
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,440
can really get you on that list,

327
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,160
it'll be of great help to you.

328
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,070
But before that, you must cultivate

329
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,200
a method that fits your bloodline properties.

330
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,720
If you just cultivate common methods,

331
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,920
you're wasting your gift.

332
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,030
And you'll end up like everyone.

333
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,240
But where do I find

334
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,200
a method that fits my bloodline?

335
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,110
I have thirteen Heaven level methods.

336
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,510
You can pick one.

337
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,200
Chen, you're not having a fever.

338
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,200
Or have you gone insane
after cultivating too hard?

339
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,480
There's not a single Heaven level method
even in the royal palace.

340
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,110
And you have them on you?

341
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,720
Ghost Emperor's Mantra?

342
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,960
No, this one is too evil.

343
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Nether King's Scroll?

344
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,000
Too much damage to the meridians.

345
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,310
I got it.

346
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,510
Scripture of Heavenly Shadows.

347
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,590
This method fits Lin Tian's body perfectly.

348
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,160
Yes.

349
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,400
Lin Tian,

350
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,240
Now I'm going to pass
Scripture of Heavenly Shadows to you.

351
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,550
It's a well-known one

352
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,000
among all Heaven level methods.

353
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,750
And it's one of the strongest

354
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,440
among all Nether methods.

355
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,750
This method has a total of nine stages.

356
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,070
With your gift, advancing to

357
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,400
the first six stages won't be a problem.

358
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,790
But as for reaching the ninth stage,

359
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,590
it'll depend on your luck.

360
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,070
It's really a Heaven level method.

361
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,720
Chen,

362
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,310
I'll keep in mind what you helped me with.

363
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,160
Alright, save it.

364
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,920
Cultivate hard when you go home.

365
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,110
Sure.

366
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,000
Well then… Thank you.

367
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,350
It's this hour.

368
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,720
I gotta head back to Star Academy.

369
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,350
The examination was over.

370
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,480
Why do you still go back there?

371
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Wait, Chen,

372
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
have you forgotten?

373
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,750
Today is the test for Alchemists.

374
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Test for Alchemists?

375
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:58,960
Yeah.

376
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,640
I almost forgot.

377
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,070
You're not interested in being an Alchemist.

378
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,790
Here's the thing.

379
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,480
The Dan Pavilion has promised Star Academy that

380
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,000
all alchemy apprentices

381
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,070
are allowed to take part in
the Dan Pavilion's test for Alchemists.

382
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,000
There's only one chance every year.

383
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,640
I see.

384
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,310
I've taken the test twice.

385
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,000
Now I'm about to graduate,

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,830
but I'm still a senior alchemy apprentice.

387
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,830
If only I could be an Alchemist.

388
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,920
This way, I'll have the chance
to befriend senior management of Dan Pavilion,

389
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,110
which definitely helps a lot

390
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,750
with my family's crude drugs business.

391
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,680
[Alchemist?]

392
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,720
[Now, my cultivation has hit a bottleneck.]

393
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,240
[I need a lot of Dan medicine.]

394
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,550
[Things will be easier if I'm an Alchemist.]

395
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,790
[I can even cooperate with Dan Pavilion.]

396
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
It's getting late. I gotta go.

397
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,270
Chen?

398
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,070
Chen!

399
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,400
I said I'm going.

400
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,750
I'll go with you.

401
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,830
Really, Chen?

402
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,680
Although you're the champion of the examination,

403
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,480
alchemy and cultivation are apples and oranges.

404
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,880
Not to mention…

405
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,070
You failed your alchemy classes.

406
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,310
How can you pass the test?

407
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,550
What's so hard about it?

408
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Alright, let's move.

409
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,480
Or we're gonna miss it.

410
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,550
Qin Chen.

411
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,510
Here you are.

412
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,830
What's this guy doing in here?

413
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,160
Are you here for the test for Alchemists?

414
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,110
Thanks.

415
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,310
Boss,

416
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,790
Qin Chen doesn't even have an apprentice token.

417
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,510
Why is he coming for the test?

418
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,310
This guy…

419
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,270
What's he up to?

420
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,590
How can I help?

421
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,550
We're here for the test for Alchemists.

422
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,200
Give me your apprentice token.

423
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,830
Yours?

424
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,790
I don't have one.

425
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,510
If you don't have it,

426
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,830
why are you here for the test anyway?

427
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,790
He doesn't have an apprentice token?

428
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,720
Go away.

429
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,880
Coming for the test without a token?

430
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,270
Who do you think you are?

431
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,680
Qin Chen,

432
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,680
this test is a serious matter.

433
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,240
You'd better follow the rules.

434
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,510
Who said we couldn't take part in this test

435
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,590
without an apprentice token?

436
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,200
Isn't that obvious?

437
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,680
According to the rules of Dan Tower
in the Martial Domain,

438
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,640
anyone can take part in the test for alchemists.

439
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
The system of alchemy apprentices

440
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,440
is just the rules of local Dan Pavilions.

441
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,550
The Dan Tower never admitted it.

442
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,880
What, can you represent

443
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,270
the highest Dan Tower on the continent?

444
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,110
Not bad. You even know Dan Tower.

445
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,750
But that's all irrelevant.

446
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,880
Nothing works here but tokens.

447
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,880
Leave now.

448
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,440
Or I'll call for security to get you out.

449
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,680
-What the hell?
-You…

450
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,000
What's going on?

451
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,310
Mr. Chen Mu.

452
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,300
[Chen Mu, Grade One Alchemist of Dan Pavilion]

453
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,960
Grade One Alchemist?

454
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,640
We're about to have the test inside.

455
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,590
Why are you making so much noise outside?

456
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,160
Mr. Chen Mu,

457
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,640
this guy doesn't have an apprentice token,

458
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,880
but he insists on taking part in the test.

459
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,070
He's just causing trouble for us, right?

460
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,750
Young man,

461
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,790
learn to walk before you run.

462
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,720
Before the test,

463
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,880
you have to be an alchemy apprentice first.

464
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,720
As per the rules of Dan Tower,

465
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,070
anyone is qualified to be an Alchemist.

466
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,200
You're a Grade One Alchemist.

467
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't you know the rules of Dan Tower?

468
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,880
Shut up!

469
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,000
How dare you talk to Mr. Chen Mu like this?

470
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,240
Mr. Chen Mu, don't worry.

471
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,880
I'll kick him out right now.

472
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,240
Hold on.

473
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,510
Dan Tower does have this rule.

474
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,000
But Dan Tower also said that

475
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,920
nobody must disgrace the Alchemist profession.

476
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,790
It's fine if you're not an alchemy apprentice.

477
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,350
But if you can't even pass the first round,

478
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,070
it'll be a serious violation.

479
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,480
Are you sure you wanna take it?

480
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,920
Of course.

481
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,510
Alright.

482
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Manager Wang,

483
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,110
sign him in.

484
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,700
[Certificate of Alchemist]

485
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,750
Take it.

486
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,110
This is your identity.

487
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,960
Go through there.

488
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,830
Boss,

489
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,880
why would Mr. Chen Mu agree

490
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,480
to let him take the test?

491
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,590
How would I know?

492
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
He's asking for trouble for himself.

493
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,790
He'll definitely come out

494
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,510
like a clown very soon.

495
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,960
Chen,

496
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,110
that guy is called Wang An.

497
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,590
He's been taking this test
for decades. Never quits.

498
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,590
He's sort of a celebrity

499
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,790
in our academy.

500
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,750
Someone

501
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,640
as persistent as this

502
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,550
can't be ordinary.

503
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,350
Qin Chen, are you sure about this?

504
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,720
You're not even a senior apprentice yet.

505
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,240
Are you here to amuse us?

506
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,310
Everyone,

507
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,480
we're all here for the test.

508
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,270
There's no need to talk like enemies.

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,240
Stinky old man, mind your own business!

510
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,920
Chen,

511
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,270
just ignore them.

512
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,440
Stinky old man, let me shut your mouth.

513
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,240
Quiet, all of you.

514
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,880
There will be three rounds for this test.

515
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,590
Round one is a written examination.

516
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,550
Round two is a random test of one of the ten

517
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,350
alchemy operations.

518
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,160
Round three is the real test for Alchemists.

519
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,960
Round one begins now.

520
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,510
Please list the 13 basic methods
of extracting medicine

521
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,110
and their advantages and disadvantages.

522
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,440
The growth habit and
drug properties of Pora Leaves.

523
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,440
What's its function

524
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,030
during the alchemy process?

525
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,350
And write down three Dan medicines

526
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,830
that need Pora Leaves.

527
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,640
Please describe the role of
Firestone ore in alchemy.

528
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,750
Mr. Chen,

529
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,240
the questions in this test is very difficult.

530
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,350
Guess a lot of these apprentices

531
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,350
will go home in disappointment.

532
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,920
Count them unlucky.

533
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,310
These questions were set by Master Liu Guang.

534
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,750
I wonder how many of them

535
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,680
can pass the written examination.

536
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,880
Master Liu Guang is the strictest one

537
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,030
among the Dan Pavilion deacons.

538
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,790
I've glanced through the paper.

539
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,070
[Ouyang Cheng, Grade One Alchemist of Dan Pavilion]
His questions are extremely tricky.

540
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,830
Even if it's us two,

541
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,920
we'll fall into the traps if not careful.

542
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,720
Let alone these new apprentices.

543
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,550
Let's see if they're lucky or not.

544
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,720
Mr. Chen,

545
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,440
isn't that the kid you just criticized?

546
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,000
That's him.

547
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,920
Look what he's doing!

548
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
He's doodling on the paper!

549
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,640
I should drive him out and punish him severely.

550
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,590
I think otherwise.

551
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,240
Even though he writes fast,

552
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,440
he won't doodle to make trouble, will he?

553
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,310
These questions were set by Master Liu Guang.

554
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,920
He's not even an apprentice yet.

555
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,680
How can he answer so fast?

556
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,830
That makes sense.

557
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,400
But according to the rules of Dan Pavilion,

558
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,720
we can't deprive him of his qualification.

559
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,350
Otherwise, I'd have driven him out long ago.

560
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,960
I can't even think of one word.

561
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,310
Why has Qin Chen

562
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,510
been writing this whole time?

563
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,400
Qin Chen never took an alchemy class.

564
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,960
What does he know?

565
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,440
He's probably just doodling.

566
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,680
This is so simple.

567
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,070
Only two questions left.

568
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,310
If you are a Grade One Alchemist

569
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,200
and also a top Earth level martial artist.

570
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,350
[You're looking for crude drugs
in the Mount of Demonic Ancestors.]

571
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,680
[Suddenly, you smell a scent coming from ahead,]

572
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,400
[which gives you the most wonderful sensation.]

573
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,200
[You raise your head
and find that a hundred meters ahead,]

574
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,720
[in a bush,]

575
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,310
[grows a century-old Dragon Incense.]

576
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,400
[And according to your senses,]

577
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,880
[there isn't one single
demonic beast within a few miles.]

578
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,400
[What should you do?]

579
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,790
The next question seems more fun.

580
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,350
You are a Grade One Alchemist.

581
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,070
[When you are training
in the Mount of Demonic Ancestors,]

582
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,200
[your arm was hurt by a white-blade spider.]

583
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,640
[Its toxin has quickly made your arm numb.]

584
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,830
[And it's spreading extremely fast]

585
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,440
[to your heart.]

586
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,030
[But now you don't have the antidote on you.]

587
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,790
[The nearest city is a thousand miles away.]

588
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,310
[What should you do?]

589
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,500
This is truly interesting.
