00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,950
I was so worried.

190
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,710
Do not ever behave recklessly like this,

191
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,680
you hear me?

192
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,470
If you…

193
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,110
If you had died,

194
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,960
I never would've been able to

195
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,280
bear the pain alone.

196
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,630
Yes…

197
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,480
Mother.

198
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,000
Chen.

199
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,910
Chen, are you all right?

200
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,280
Yeah.

201
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,870
Drink this potion.

202
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,390
It'll help your body recover.

203
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,630
[Mother had been known as
the most beautiful woman]

204
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,760
[in the Xuan Kingdom in her day.]

205
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,280
[Secretly admired by countless noblemen
and aristocrats from the Capitol.]

206
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,110
[Matchmakers bearing gifts
were scrambling to get to her.]

207
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,190
[The reigning emperor]

208
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,800
[even wanted to acquire her as his concubine]

209
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,080
[after hearing what a stunner she was.]

210
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,560
[And that was when]

211
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,150
[she decided to run away from home.]

212
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,040
[She vanished into thin air.]

213
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
[Three years later,]

214
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,590
[she returned home]

215
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,760
[with a baby in her arms.]

216
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,430
[Being an unmarried mother]
Miss Yuechi has returned.

217
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,350
Miss Yuechi has returned!

218
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,870
[is seen as a huge embarrassment]

219
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,020
[by all of the Tianwu Continent.]
Miss Yuechi has returned.

220
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,560
Mr. Qin!

221
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,240
[A woman of loose morals, they call it.]
Miss Yuechi has returned!

222
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,320
Miss Yuechi.

223
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,630
[If my grandfather hadn't stood his ground]
What is Miss Yuechi doing back here?

224
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,240
[and took my mother and me in]

225
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,080
[in the name of preserving the bloodline,]
She has a baby with her.

226
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,320
[my mother and I
would have long been kicked out,]

227
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,280
[living homeless on the street.]

228
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,520
Chen,

229
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,870
your bloodline

230
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,150
wasn't awakened this time,

231
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,670
but it doesn't matter.

232
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,760
There might still be a chance.

233
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,910
My bloodline wasn't awakened?

234
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,870
It doesn't matter

235
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,280
if you can't be a skilled fighter, son.

236
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,150
I will always be there

237
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,080
to protect you.

238
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,390
Mother,

239
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,000
don't worry.

240
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,350
I can handle setbacks.

241
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,150
All right,

242
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,800
I'm relieved to hear that.

243
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,150
Miss Yuechi,

244
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,350
took you long enough.

245
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,320
Yanzhi,

246
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,560
Chen just woke up.

247
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,870
He's still weak.

248
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,040
You might startle him.

249
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Huh.

250
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,590
You're awake, Master Chen.

251
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,080
Wonderful news.

252
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,280
What do you want?

253
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,630
Get over yourself, Master Chen.

254
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,080
I didn't come here for you.

255
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,080
Miss Yuechi,

256
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,560
[Yanzhi, a maid at Qin Residence]
I suppose you haven't forgotten

257
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,960
the deal you made with Ms. Zhao?

258
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,520
Chen,

259
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,800
rest well.

260
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,390
I have somewhere to be.

261
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,080
Mother,

262
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,800
where are you going?

263
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,830
I'm coming with you.

264
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,190
Oh, monkey.

265
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,390
I'm not leaving the house.

266
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,150
Go get some rest.

267
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,390
I will

268
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,760
be right back.

269
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,350
Mother,

270
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,040
what have you and Ms. Zhao agreed on?

271
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,910
Fill me in.

272
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
For someone at death's door,

273
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,830
you sure ask a lot of questions.

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,630
I'll be honest with you.

275
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,830
Your mother agreed to Ms. Zhao's request

276
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,760
to meet with Lord Qi today.

277
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,480
Lord Qi

278
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,190
is already in the living room waiting

279
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,390
for your mother.

280
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,590
You'd better not get in the way.

281
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,830
Lord Qi? You mean Zhao Qirui?

282
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,190
What is Zhao Feng up to?

283
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,800
Why is she asking you to see that villain?

284
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,590
You,

285
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,110
get out of here.

286
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,350
What did you just say?

287
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,430
That's a spoiled brat you got there,

288
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,190
Miss Yuechi.

289
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,040
You agreed to meeting with Lord Qi.

290
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,800
You made that promise.

291
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,190
Now you're going back on your word?

292
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,390
That's utter nonsense.

293
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
That unpleasant person

294
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
made several attempts to see my mother,

295
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,560
all of which were declined.

296
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,560
My mother couldn't have agreed to meet him.

297
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,830
Well, why don't you ask her yourself?

298
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,590
Chen,

299
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,320
you have just regained consciousness.

300
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,080
I'd hate for you to overwhelm yourself.

301
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,910
It's…

302
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,150
just a meeting, nothing more.

303
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,350
I'll be fine.

304
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,240
But Mother,

305
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,280
by doing that,

306
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,910
you're tempting fate.

307
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,430
Pretty bold of you to say that.

308
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,390
You slipped into a coma after a duel.

309
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,480
You were literally on your deathbed.

310
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,560
Your mother shamelessly

311
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
kneeled outside Ms. Zhao's room all night,

312
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,520
begging for a wake-up pill.

313
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,520
Ms. Zhao was kind enough to…

314
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,520
Shut your mouth.

315
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,830
Ms. Zhao promised me

316
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,280
she wouldn't tell anyone about it.

317
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,870
[I can't believe
Mother suffered such humiliation]

318
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,590
[to save me.]

319
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,190
Miss Yuechi…

320
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,870
Enough.

321
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll go with you.

322
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,110
No.

323
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,000
We're not going anywhere.

324
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,480
From now on,

325
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,240
I will not let anyone
treat you like a doormat anymore.

326
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,480
As for you,

327
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,560
get out of my face, now.

328
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, please. Being addressed as "Master Chen"

329
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,390
doesn't mean you are my master.

330
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,150
Mind your manners.

331
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
Need I remind you that

332
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,830
you're just a maid here at the house?

333
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,830
Wow.

334
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,870
Are you trying to take me down a peg?

335
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,590
Ms. Zhao already knew
you wouldn't keep your side of the bargain.

336
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,240
Somebody,

337
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,240
take Miss Yuechi to the living room.

338
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,630
We mustn't keep Ms. Zhao and our guests waiting.

339
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,960
Apologies, Miss Yuechi.

340
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,480
Nobody touches my mother.

341
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,080
You…

342
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,000
You're such a piece of human garbage.

343
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,910
Just so you know,
you're not the boss around here.

344
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,350
Get Miss Yuechi to the living room now.

345
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,480
Unless you're ready to bear the consequences

346
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,870
of pissing off Ms. Zhao!

347
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,760
Master Chen,

348
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,040
we're on Ms. Zhao's orders.

349
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,670
If you insist on standing in the way,

350
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,560
I'm afraid we're going to
have to do it the hard way.

351
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
Sure, go ahead.

352
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,280
If you have a death wish.

353
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,480
Let's see which one of you
has the balls to do it.

354
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,830
You silly cocks on your own dunghill.

355
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,800
I could banish you three thousand miles away
in accordance with the household rules.

356
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,590
And you'll spend the rest of your life in exile.

357
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,110
Yanzhi,

358
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,390
Master Chen is part of the Qin family.

359
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,110
If he makes a big thing out of this,

360
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,240
we, as the servants, are in big trouble.

361
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,720
Oh.

362
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Did I hear
someone say something about being in exile?

363
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,870
Ms. Zhao.

364
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,760
This was too simple a task to screw up, Yanzhi.

365
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,350
I taught you better than this.

366
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,150
It's my fault, Ms. Zhao.

367
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm ready to take my punishment.

368
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,430
[Zhao Feng, Qin Yuanhong's wife]
Step aside.

369
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,000
You're embarrassing me.

370
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,760
Absolutely.

371
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,870
[Zhao Qirui, Lord Qi of the Xuan Kingdom]

372
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,040
Yuechi,

373
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,320
it's been a while.

374
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,110
Would you look at that?

375
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,150
My sweet nephew was out for a few days,

376
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,670
and suddenly he's a brave heart.

377
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,830
You threatened to exile my people.

378
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,150
You have a lot of ambition, don't you?

379
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,760
Ms. Zhao,

380
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,040
Chen is still young.

381
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,110
He said things he didn't mean

382
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,960
in the heat of the moment.

383
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,630
Please,

384
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,240
let him off.

385
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,110
Young?

386
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,280
As part of the Qin family,

387
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,910
he should have devoted himself to his studies.

388
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,630
Instead, he got into a fight at the academy.

389
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,350
And not to mention all those mean words he used

390
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,390
to humiliate the helpers earlier.

391
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,870
You broke the household rules.

392
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,670
What should be the punishment for that, hmm?

393
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,760
Chen…

394
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,190
he didn't mean it.

395
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,960
You should be the one

396
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,630
to get punished.

397
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,280
You…

398
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,870
Despite being the lady of the house,

399
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,350
you wink at the servants'

400
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,520
mistreatment of the family members.

401
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,520
So much for the household rules.

402
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,390
You even get involved with

403
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,280
a notorious rake in the Capital.

404
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,150
You call that virtuous?

405
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,430
Uh,

406
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,390
I came today

407
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,390
to visit your mother.

408
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,960
So why do you need to be so rude?

409
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,350
That's ridiculous.

410
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,590
Lord Qi is my brother.

411
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,480
That's right.

412
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,670
Well, uh,

413
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,480
Ms. Zhao's ancestors had royal ancestry.

414
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,560
Her referring to me as her brother;

415
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,630
I don't see anything wrong with it.

416
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,760
I don't think I said

417
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,390
it was you, did I?

418
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,350
Uh…

419
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,320
Now that you mention it,

420
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,560
I'll make this simple.

421
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,630
Even as siblings,

422
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,830
having secret rendezvous

423
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,000
is somewhat of a taboo, no?

424
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,800
Uh…

425
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,760
Ms. Zhao,

426
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,480
as Madam of Gaoming,
a title granted by His Majesty,

427
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,240
you were supposed to be
a role model for other women.

428
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,080
And act with integrity.

429
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,670
If this gets out,

430
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,910
our family could be toppled
from our position in the kingdom.

431
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,320
You…

432
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,590
you're out of your mind.

433
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,350
Somebody,

434
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,520
get him!

435
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,960
You won't lay a hand on him.

436
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,760
Sorry,

437
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,560
Miss Yuechi.

438
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,480
Chen,

439
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,480
how dare you fight back.

440
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,430
You asked for this.

441
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,430
Somebody,

442
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,280
Master Chen will be disciplined
in accordance with the household rules.

443
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,040
He has to be made an example of!

444
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,670
The audacity!

445
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,040
Drop your sword!

446
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,590
Drop my sword?

447
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,870
Chen, no!

448
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,280
Don't worry, Mother.

449
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,590
I've got this.

450
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,520
Don't push your luck.

451
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,320
Right back at you,

452
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,910
Zhao Feng.

453
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,560
What…

454
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,670
Take advantage of my mother again,

455
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,110
and that's what you'll end up with.

456
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,560
Ms. Zhao,

457
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,720
I thought you had made
the arrangements with Yuechi.

458
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,280
Lord Qi,

459
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,350
I can explain.

460
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,320
Save your breath.

461
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,670
Yuechi,

462
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,720
what happened today

463
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,110
was completely unintentional.

464
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,560
I've had feelings for you

465
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,110
for years.

466
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,350
Thought you should know.

467
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,960
Have some self-respect, Your Highness.

468
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,240
Yuechi.

469
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,000
Shut your mouth.

470
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,630
One more step,

471
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,040
and you die.

472
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,630
Qin!

473
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,720
Don't just stand there gawking.

474
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,480
Absolutely.

475
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,800
[Qin Yong, butler of Qin Residence]

476
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,240
Execute him right here and now!

477
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,400
Master Chen,

478
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,880
you might as well give it up

479
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
and throw yourself at the mercy of Ms. Zhao.

480
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,120
You want me to back down?

481
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,880
Go ahead and make me.

482
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,400
Well, okay,

483
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,530
if you insist.

484
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,530
Stop, all of you.

485
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,310
My Marquis.

486
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,200
My Marquis.

487
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,920
Yuanhong,

488
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
you're right on time.

489
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,520
This little punk

490
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,630
has gone rogue.

491
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,920
He hurt not only the guards

492
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,240
but also Lord Qi.

493
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,870
That's it.

494
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,870
Haven't you made enough fuss?

495
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,240
I didn't want any of this.

496
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,350
It's all because of this little…

497
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,760
he…

498
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,110
He is your nephew.

499
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,110
If he is worthless,

500
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,550
then what does that make us?

501
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,200
You need to start behaving
like the lady of the house!

502
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,000
Lord Qi,

503
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,590
I'm sorry you had to witness this.

504
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,280
Their behaviors were extremely inappropriate.

505
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,870
Oh, don't get me started.

506
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,150
See for yourself

507
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,680
what he's done to me!

508
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,310
A Qin had the guts

509
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,680
to assault me!

510
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,000
Sorry, Yuechi,

511
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,760
I didn't mean to scare you.

512
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,070
I hope you're okay.

513
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,790
Yuanhong,

514
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,960
I demand

515
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,280
an explanation

516
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,870
for all this.

517
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,960
Yes, Lord Qi,

518
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,310
I will have an explanation for you.

519
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,070
However, I suppose
you wouldn't want it to get out that

520
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,590
you came to see my sister, or would you?

521
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,790
I have other things to attend to.

522
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,000
I won't keep you any longer, Lord Qi.

523
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,040
Qin Yuanhong, look at you,

524
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,040
being all high and mighty.

525
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,040
I will get even with you

526
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
for what happened today!

527
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,390
Hmph!

528
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,630
Show yourself out.

529
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,000
Lord Qi.

530
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,760
And the rest of you,

531
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,720
get back to work!

532
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,150
-At once.
-Got it.

533
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,110
I…

534
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Out!

535
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,870
Hmph.
