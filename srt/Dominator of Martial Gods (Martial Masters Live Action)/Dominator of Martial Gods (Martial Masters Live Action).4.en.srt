Tell us how this bastard

21
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,280
offended Master Liang Yu,

22
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,200
down to the smallest detail.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,200
Qin Chen,

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,310
why won't you just own up to it?

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,790
The other day,

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,350
I took the Dark Stone of the Underworld,

27
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,950
which had cost Father a fortune,

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,590
to the Palace of Instruments

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,080
and asked Master Liang Yu
to make a magic weapon.

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Master Liang Yu

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
agreed to my request,

32
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,560
but then Qin Chen

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,520
went and irritated him.

34
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,120
If it weren't for Qin Chen,

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,150
our family

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,080
wouldn't have offended Master Liang Yu

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,800
and suffered such a heavy loss.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm afraid

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,470
our family

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,190
won't be welcome
at the Palace of Instruments

41
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,080
from now on.

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,910
Qin Chen,

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,030
do you have anything to say?

44
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,030
I…

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,080
have nothing to say.

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
At this point,

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,360
you're still

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,710
not at all sorry for what you did.

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,520
Does this family mean nothing to you?

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,030
I suggest

51
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,310
we kick this pest out of the family

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,080
so that he doesn't get us into more trouble.

53
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,750
Wouldn't it be rash?

54
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,430
That's a big decision to make.

55
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,560
We should wait

56
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,590
until the old man is back.

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,190
Qin Yuanzhi,

58
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,560
he's stationed at the border

59
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,150
and fighting in the war
with the Zhao Kingdom.

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,150
It'll be several years

61
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,280
before he can come back.

62
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,430
Wait until he's back?

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,710
When will that be?

64
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,310
Qin Chen has already irritated Lord Qi

65
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,470
and then offended Master Liang

66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,120
at his age now.

67
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,430
I suppose you'll even

68
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,680
show disrespect to His Majesty

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,960
in a couple of years?

70
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,080
This degenerate

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,150
is our family's misfortune.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,750
Brother,

73
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,470
it's…

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,430
Qin Chen,

75
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,840
nothing can be accomplished
without norms or standards.

76
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,800
Our family has been able to keep our foothold
in the Xuan Kingdom

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,840
because of our strict family rules.

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,080
I'm giving you a last chance.

79
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,310
Explain it now.

80
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,840
Let's just kick him out.

81
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,960
He hasn't been registered
in our household anyway,

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
so he's not exactly
a member of the family yet.

83
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,240
We've let him freeload here

84
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,190
all these years.

85
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,360
We've been kind enough to him.

86
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,030
Fine.

87
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,400
You all want to kick me out, right?

88
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,750
I'll leave then.

89
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,310
As if I care.

90
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,680
Chen,

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,240
you…

92
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,630
Did you all hear him?

93
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,870
Did you hear this pest's words?

94
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,160
Has he got any respect for our family?

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,190
Now that you've pointed out

96
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
that I'm not exactly
a member of the family,

97
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,680
I see no reason why I should
care about your feelings.

98
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,680
You…

99
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
The Qin family?

100
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,070
Judging from your manner,

101
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,560
this place will probably

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,310
become Zhao Residence very soon.

103
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,270
Zhao Feng,

104
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,240
haven't you wanted

105
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,390
to kick my mother and me
out for a long time?

106
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,360
Let me be frank.

107
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,390
You needn't bother.

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,120
I'm not exactly a member of the family,

109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,680
nor have I ever thought of becoming one.

110
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,360
Don't project your own wishful thinking

111
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,000
onto me.

112
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,720
How dare you!

113
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,430
You should all ask yourselves

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,870
how you've been treating

115
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,240
me and my mother all these years.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,750
My mother

117
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
is supposed to be a lady in this house,

118
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,390
but now even Zhao Feng's servants

119
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,360
have no scruples

120
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,270
about bullying her.

121
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,070
Are you not ashamed

122
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,360
of yourselves?

123
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,240
The other day,

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
when I was badly injured,

125
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,830
none of you showed any concern.

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,120
I can live with all that.

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
However, my mother

128
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,120
was made to kneel
before Zhao Feng's door for a night

129
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,680
and was asked to serve Lord Qi,

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,920
and it was all just for the Dan medicine.

131
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,070
What?

132
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm sure you all know what a bastard

133
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Zhao Qirui is.

134
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
Zhao Feng was clearly

135
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,720
trying to make life hell for my mother!

136
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,800
My mother

137
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,800
is a dear member of your family.

138
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,680
When she was being bullied by this woman

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,950
just for a Grade Two Dan medicine,

140
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,950
did any of you step in?

141
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,040
You…

142
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,680
Look at this pest.

143
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,270
How lawless.

144
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,160
How incredibly lawless!

145
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,160
Brother,

146
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,190
what on earth is going on?

147
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,360
I've only been away for a few days.

148
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,680
How did that happen?

149
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,160
I've already

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,360
scolded Zhao Feng for that.

151
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,950
Lord Qi's incident

152
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,480
was indeed my wife's fault,

153
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,600
but she was just trying to act
in the family's interest.

154
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,720
In the family's interest?

155
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,190
Was making Yuechi kneel outside for a night

156
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,270
also in the family's interest?

157
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,510
Brother,

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
that is…

159
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,720
That is in the past now!

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,000
We're discussing

161
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,360
Qin Chen's offense to Master Liang Yu.

162
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
We have to offer

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,040
a gesture to Master Liang Yu.

164
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,120
A gesture?

165
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,270
What kind of gesture?

166
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,950
Yuechi,

167
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,830
what do you think?

168
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,950
What's the point of asking me?

169
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,270
Chen is right.

170
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,680
Since we're not welcome here,

171
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,430
we should leave

172
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,240
before it's too late.

173
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,560
Yuechi.

174
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,270
Brother,

175
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,750
I know you mean well,

176
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,560
but you've seen
what these people are like.

177
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,120
All these years,

178
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,870
have they regarded us
as members of the family?

179
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,270
Qin Yuechi,

180
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,160
do you even know
what you're talking about?

181
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
Of course, I know what I'm talking about.

182
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,160
Zhao Feng,

183
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,800
Qin Yuanhong,

184
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,270
your selfishness

185
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,360
disgusts me.

186
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,360
You…

187
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
You hate me

188
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,680
because I didn't marry His Majesty

189
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,310
and make you members
of the imperial family.

190
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,270
All these years,

191
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,040
what have you done for the family?

192
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
Isn't the entire family property

193
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,240
a result of my father's hard work?

194
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,000
He's risking his life out there,

195
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,870
and what about you?

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,870
You're trying to use
a woman to climb up the social ladder.

197
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,000
I feel ashamed for you.

198
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,040
You…

199
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,480
We've kept you fed all these years.

200
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,390
Would you have managed

201
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,430
without the family?

202
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,750
Sure enough,

203
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,430
you're both ingrates.

204
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,360
This King of Might Residence belongs
to my father.

205
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,750
What does it have to do with you?

206
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
All these years,

207
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,920
I've earned every bit of our sustenance

208
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,390
on my own.

209
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,440
What contribution did you make?

210
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,550
That's enough!

211
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,790
Chen,

212
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,870
this is no place for us.

213
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,910
Let's leave here.

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,080
All right.

215
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,790
We'll leave this place.

216
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Yuechi.

217
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,120
Wait.

218
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,750
He offended Master Liang Yu

219
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,270
and caused
such a big loss to the family.

220
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,080
Do you want to walk away like that?

221
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,550
In my opinion,

222
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,360
it might be a good idea to tie them up

223
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,150
and deliver them to Master Liang Yu.

224
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,200
Ironically,

225
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,550
I wasn't the one who got kicked out of
the Palace of Instruments that day.

226
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,200
If you really want to please Master Liang,

227
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,550
why don't you

228
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,030
bring your son to him instead?

229
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,670
You…

230
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,960
How dare you!

231
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,510
Qin,

232
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,480
get them under control!

233
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,790
Stop!

234
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,270
Qin Yuanhong,

235
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,030
would you still

236
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,030
let the two of us stay here?

237
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,600
I guess

238
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,200
you too have had enough.

239
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,120
Qin Yong.

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,240
Let them leave.

241
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,550
Yuanhong!

242
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,080
I said let them leave!

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,080
Go to the accountant's office

244
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,910
and get them a banknote
of 500 taels of silver.

245
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,750
No need.

246
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,550
We don't need your charity.

247
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,270
Yuechi.

248
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,870
Yuechi!

249
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,440
Brother,

250
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,360
I'm really disappointed in you!

251
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,510
Yuechi!

252
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,420
[Qin Residence]

253
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,550
Mother.

254
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,390
I'm fine with being wronged.

255
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,870
I'm afraid that
you'll also suffer with me.

256
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,670
Mother.

257
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,360
Trust me.

258
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,320
I won't let you be wronged anymore.

259
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,360
I trust you.

260
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,440
Wait.

261
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,480
Wait.

262
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,120
Yuechi.

263
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,080
Yuechi.

264
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,480
Yuechi, why are you doing this?

265
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,080
Chen is still very young.

266
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,000
Won't you make him suffer a lot?

267
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,390
Won't he suffer if he stays here?

268
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,320
Brother.

269
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,670
Don't persuade me anymore.

270
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,270
I've already made my decision.

271
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,870
You're right.

272
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,150
Yuehong went too far.

273
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,790
After compromising so much
in the Qin family these years,

274
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,390
I feel tired.

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,750
Yuechi.

276
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I've got some money.

277
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,670
Take it.

278
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,670
No, brother.

279
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,600
I can't accept that.

280
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,080
Come on.

281
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,240
Listen to me.

282
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,080
I know you have little savings.

283
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,320
Money is needed
everywhere in the Capital for living.

284
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,480
Tell me.

285
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,120
Where can you

286
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,510
and Chen stay tonight without money?

287
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,080
Take it.

288
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,360
Thank you, brother.

289
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,720
No problem.

290
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,030
We are family.

291
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,870
Just come to me
if you got any problems in the future.

292
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,320
If I'm not around,

293
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
go to meet Ying.

294
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,790
Don't strain yourself.

295
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,150
Got it?

296
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,910
All right.

297
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,480
Uncle Yuanzhi.

298
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,870
Don't be upset.

299
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,510
I'll look after my mother well.

300
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,840
Qin Chen.

301
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,670
Why do I think
you are different from before?

302
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm not.

303
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,670
Maybe it's your illusion, Ying.

304
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,960
Qin Chen is completely lawless.

305
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,270
I told you

306
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,670
to drive him and his mother out.

307
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,750
Look.

308
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,120
Even your younger brother
dared challenge you publicly now.

309
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Let's see how you can manage
this family in the future.

310
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,030
Come on.

311
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,670
Save your words.

312
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,200
The most important thing is

313
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
how to calm the anger of Master Liang Yu.

314
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,720
Go to visit him and apologize.

315
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,480
I've already done that.

316
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,200
Since I got the news about this,

317
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,150
I've already sent people
to visit his residence,

318
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,790
but they haven't got
any chance to meet Master Liang.

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,960
If it doesn't work,

320
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,480
how about letting Fen go to visit?

321
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,030
Me?

322
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,510
Why should Fen go?

323
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,080
As far as I think,

324
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,150
Qin Chen should be tied

325
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,510
and sent to the Palace of Instruments.

326
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,270
Either killing or slashing him

327
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,200
is under Master Liang's command.

328
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,870
Mr. Qin, Madam.

329
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,360
What made you so anxious?

330
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,270
Princess Lingshan is here.

331
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,480
Princess Lingshan?

332
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,790
Princess Lingshan
is the beloved daughter of Lord Kang.

333
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
It's said that she's become
the apprentice of Master Liang Yu.

334
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,750
If we can get the princess to intercede,

335
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Master Liang Yu
will definitely forgive us.

336
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,200
Quickly invite her in.

337
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,720
Yes.

338
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,550
Wait.

339
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,320
What else?

340
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,790
Fen.

341
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,360
Didn't you mention

342
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,390
that you get along well
with Princess Lingshan?

343
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,720
She must be here to meet you.

344
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,080
Yuanhong.

345
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,390
What do you think

346
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,550
if we can build our relationship
with Lord Kang by marriage?

347
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,750
Hurry, invite Princess Lingshan in.

348
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,320
Have someone
arrange a banquet immediately.

349
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,030
Also,

350
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,440
bring up all the best herbs we have.

351
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,080
Yes.

352
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,080
Fen.

353
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,600
Fen.

354
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,510
Fen!

355
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,840
It's your time to show yourself.

356
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,550
Trust me, Mother.

357
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,550
I wonder what secret
is hidden behind Qin Chen.

358
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,670
My master takes him so important.

359
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,200
Your Highness, this way, please.

360
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,960
Your Highness, our apologies

361
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,550
for not welcoming
your gracious presence.

362
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,200
Please have a seat.

363
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,840
Please.

364
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,080
How do you do, Mr. Qin and Madam Zhao?

365
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,440
We're doing good, Your Highness.

366
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,360
I've got no chance to visit your home.

367
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,240
How is Lord Kang?

368
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,030
My father has been very good recently.

369
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,440
Thank you for asking, Mr. Qin.

370
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,600
Lord Kang is a crucial official
of the Xuan Kingdom

371
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
who pays much effort
and spirit to the kingdom.

372
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,200
I wish for him
to take better care of his health.

373
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,550
Servant, bring what I've asked.

374
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,200
Your Highness,
these represent our goodwill.

375
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,390
Please accept it.

376
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,080
Madam Zhao, you're so kind.

377
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,030
Don't mention it.

378
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
It's the first time you have visited us,
and you bring us a gift too.

379
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,030
You must be tired of holding it.

380
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,720
Yanzhi,
help Her Highness to handle it now.

381
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,870
Yes, Madam.

382
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,440
Don't bother.

383
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,150
Madam Zhao,

384
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,200
I want to give this to Qin…

385
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,870
I know.

386
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

387
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,840
He's getting change

388
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,150
and will come very soon.

389
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,360
Your Highness,

390
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,600
how do you feel about our Fen?

391
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Mr. Qin Fen is diligent and hardworking.
He's absolutely extraordinary.

392
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,320
Princess Lingshan.

393
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,940
It has been long since we last meet.

394
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,510
Hello, Mr. Qin Fen.

395
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,590
Since the one
Your Highness is looking for has arrived,

396
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,880
we won't bother more.

397
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,920
Feel free to talk with each other.

398
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,400
Yanzhi,

399
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,350
prepare the banquet.

400
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,310
Yes, Madam.

401
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,350
You must have misunderstood.

402
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm coming

403
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,310
for Qin Chen today.

404
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,880
Qin…

405
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,350
Qin Chen?

406
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,440
Why do you want to meet him?

407
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,920
He has been kicked out of our Qin family.

408
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,110
What?

409
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,110
He has been kicked out of the Qin family?

410
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
Your Highness,
do you come for denouncing him?

411
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Don't worry.

412
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,400
Since Qin Chen
has offended Master Liang Yu,

413
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,350
we've heavily punished him.

414
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,480
Qin Chen and his mother
were driven out of Qin Residence,

415
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,310
showing the Qin family
has drawn a clear distinction from them.

416
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,160
Your Highness,

417
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,000
please explain to Master Liang Yu clearly.

418
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,000
That's right.

419
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,880
If you think it's not enough,

420
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,000
we'd bind Qin Chen back

421
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,680
and send him
to Master Liang for execution.

422
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,590
No.

423
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,640
I came here today

424
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,880
because my master asked me

425
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,160
to send a present to Qin Chen.

426
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,960
Now that Qin Chen is not here,

427
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,240
I have to go.

428
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,350
Please don't go, Princess Lingshan.

429
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,070
The banquet is ready.

430
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,030
How about leaving after dinner?

431
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,350
That's right, Your Highness.

432
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,880
If you just leave like this,

433
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,640
wouldn't the grudge
between Master Liang Yu and us

434
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,920
deepen?

435
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,400
Please praise us more

436
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
in front of Master Liang Yu,
Your Highness.

437
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Our Qin family always wishes to build
a good relationship with Master Liang Yu.

438
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,000
How can a trifle like this

439
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,680
affect our friendship?

440
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,350
Mr. Qin, Madam Zhao,

441
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,070
Qin Chen has never offended my master.

442
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,400
As for the reason that
my master is not kind to the Qin family,

443
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,400
I…

444
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,790
I don't know about the truth

445
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,510
and dare not to guess randomly.

446
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,590
See you.

447
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,310
Your Highness.

448
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,720
Your Highness!

449
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,030
Your Highness.

450
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,920
Father.

451
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,960
Why did you slap me?

452
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,110
Why?

453
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,110
What did Her Highness mean?

454
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,070
How do I know?

455
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,240
You don't know?

456
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,720
What exactly

457
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,200
are you thinking every day?

458
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,310
How did you offend Master Liang Yu?

459
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,240
You wronged me!

460
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,790
I've never offended Master Liang Yu.

461
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,880
Qin Chen.

462
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,160
It must be he who has set some obstacles.

463
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Are you still making excuses?

464
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,960
-Qin Yuanhong!
-Mother!

465
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,110
Why are you being so fierce?

466
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,790
If you slap Fen again,

467
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,000
I won't let you go.

468
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,790
I…

469
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,750
You…

470
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,270
What?

471
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,070
What's the problem?

472
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,790
Without my brother, King of Lingnan,

473
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,110
how could you become a marquis?

474
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,070
What?

475
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,200
Now you're strong enough,

476
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,720
so you dare to slap me too?

477
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
You're hard on your family only.

478
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,030
Beat us to death if you dare.

479
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,000
I must have blinded my eyes

480
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,720
to marry you coward.

481
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,640
Qin Yuanhong, stop there!

482
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,240
Madam.

483
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,680
If you don't have the meal now,

484
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,030
it will get cold.

485
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,000
Have the meal?
You know nothing but eating.

486
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,110
Get out of here!

487
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,960
Yes, Madam.

488
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,240
Wait.

489
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,480
Madam, at your command.

490
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,030
Serve the meal.

491
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,720
Fen.

492
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Since your father won't eat,

493
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,310
let's have it.

494
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,680
Mother, you're the one
who cares about me the most.

495
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,240
Yanzhi.

496
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,200
What's for dinner today?

497
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,550
I'll get prepared right now.

498
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,960
Mother.

499
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,750
Princess Lingshan has left.

500
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,680
Look at your loser's manner.

501
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,000
Your father must scold you
if he sees this.

502
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,440
Mother,

503
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,550
I want Princess Lingshan.

504
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,510
Fine.

505
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
You've got me.

506
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,590
I'll help you.

507
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,110
I don't believe

508
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,960
that I can't nail a young girl.

509
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,030
Mother,

510
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,350
we're at home now.

511
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,920
Although it's a little shabby here,

512
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,640
at least the house is in order.

513
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,510
Let's tidy it up.

514
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,640
All right.

515
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,000
A primary class spiritual medicine.

516
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,480
Mother,

517
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm going out for a while.

518
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
I will be back soon.

519
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,110
It's time to do something
to make a living.

520
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,030
Otherwise,

521
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,350
with the money left,

522
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,240
we can't live long.

523
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,590
Besides,

524
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,550
Chen needs to practice.

525
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,060
It's said that civil costs are low
but military costs are high.

526
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,000
How can he catch up with his classmates

527
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,310
if he has not got enough Dan medicine.

528
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,720
Pills and herbs.

529
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,310
All kinds of top-class herbs!

530
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,000
Boss.

531
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,960
Sir, anything you need?

532
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,440
How much are these packages of herbs?

533
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,750
Thirty silver coins.

534
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,440
Pack them for me.

535
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,160
Sure.

536
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,590
Sir.

537
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,270
Thank you.

538
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,160
Thank you.

539
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,400
See you, sir.

540
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,160
Mrs. Qin, I'm Lingshan.

541
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,790
I give the gift to Qin Chen
under my master's command.

542
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,880
All right.

543
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,160
Chen.

544
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,030
Mother.

545
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,790
This is Princess Lingshan.

546
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,400
She said she's here for you.

547
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,270
Mr. Qin Chen.

548
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,510
I've asked many people

549
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,030
to know that you've moved here.

550
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,110
Princess Lingshan,

551
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,270
why are you looking for me?

552
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,510
Don't keep standing.

553
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,350
Let's talk inside.

554
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,310
Come on.

555
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,440
Please.

556
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,640
We moved here recently,

557
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,160
so the house is still in a mess.

558
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,590
Don't mind us, Your Highness.

559
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,480
I won't, Mrs. Qin.

560
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,720
Right.

561
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,000
Take your time to talk.

562
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,790
I'm going to make some tea for you.

563
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,240
Tell me.

564
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,000
What's the matter?

565
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,400
I followed my master's command

566
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,920
to send you a gift.

567
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,590
Please accept it.

568
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,310
Is your master

569
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,590
Master Liang Yu?

570
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,550
Yes.

571
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,510
Put it there.

572
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,920
Your Highness.

573
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,350
If there's no other business,

574
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,200
I won't keep you here longer.

575
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,350
Well…

576
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,680
I went to Qin Residence
to look for you before.

577
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,720
They told me

578
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,270
that because of my master,

579
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,680
you're driven out of their residence.

580
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,750
So what?

581
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,790
Why didn't you explain it clearly?

582
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,680
If you need help,

583
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,790
my master and I
can explain it for you as well.

584
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,070
Zhao Feng wanted to kick us out
of Qin Residence long ago.

585
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,640
Leaving earlier

586
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,000
makes us more peaceful anyway.

587
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,750
But people misunderstand you more

588
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,030
if you do so.

589
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,750
A clean hand wants no washing.

590
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,440
Why bother explaining?

591
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,070
Therefore,

592
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,510
everything that happened before

593
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,590
must be a one-sided statement from Qin Fen.

594
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
What do you think, Princess Lingshan?

595
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,920
As far as I think,

596
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,030
you're never the loser like Qin Fen said.

597
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,110
I want to apologize to you

598
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,750
for all the prejudice

599
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,000
I've ever had before.

600
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,880
Your Highness, it's not necessary.

601
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,480
You can call me Lingshan, Mr. Qin.

602
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,200
Qin Fen is too much.

603
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,400
He pushed you into such a situation.

604
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,550
Let me tell my master when I'm back

605
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,110
and ask him to state the justice for you.

606
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,960
This is my family business anyway.

607
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,000
Please don't bother, Your Highness.

608
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,640
Your Highness,

609
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
if you don't have anything else,

610
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,310
please go back home.

611
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
All right. I won't bother you anymore.

612
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,110
Princess Lingshan, are you leaving?

613
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,750
You don't even drink the tea.

614
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,310
Don't bother, Mrs. Qin.

615
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,240
You've just moved into the new house,

616
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,440
and I bothered you too much.

617
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,350
I feel so regretful,

618
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,110
so I'm leaving now.

619
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,030
I will visit you on another day.

620
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,110
Chen.

621
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,480
I think Lingshan is good.

622
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,240
How did you offend her

623
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,400
to make her leave with anger?

624
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,310
Mother.

625
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,880
I didn't offend her.

626
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
It's so inconvenient

627
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,070
for her to stay here.

628
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,960
You…

629
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,110
I don't even know how to blame you.

630
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,550
What a silly boy.

631
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,400
It seems

632
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,270
that the attention on the Qin family
is more than one.

633
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,920
Don't be sneaky.

634
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,000
Come out.

635
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,070
My lord

636
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,440
wants to invite you for a chat,
Princess Lingshan.

637
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,790
Please accept our invitation.

638
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,440
How dare you show up by knowing who I am?

639
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,880
What if I'm not going?

640
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,030
I have to be offensive then.

641
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,110
That was fast.

642
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,480
Starry Radiance!

643
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,160
You're undoubtedly
a talent of the Capital, Your Highness.

644
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,070
You truly got excellent ability.

645
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,920
You two

646
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,550
are bullying a young girl.

647
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,640
Don't you think it's too much?

648
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,750
One more is asking for death.

649
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,350
Qin Chen.

650
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,350
Go.

651
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,550
They are here for me.

652
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,110
Kill that brat.

653
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,070
Keep the princess alive.

654
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,640
Magic of Seals.

655
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,030
Speak!

656
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,680
Who sent you here?

657
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,110
