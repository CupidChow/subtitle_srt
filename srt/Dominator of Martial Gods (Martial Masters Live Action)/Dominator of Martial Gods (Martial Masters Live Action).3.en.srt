Qin Chen held you in disrespect,

55
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,190

All right.

191
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,200
This is make-or-break time for me.

192
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,270
To integrate the 12 meridians,

193
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,600
I must break them first.

194
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,080
It doesn't matter

195
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
if you're unable to be powerful.

196
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,030
Mother

197
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,080
will always be there for you.

198
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,670
Those have achieved great powers.

199
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,000
All of them

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,960
have worked much harder than others

201
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,030
before they made greater accomplishment.

202
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,840
I must not stop.

203
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,550
I must not.

204
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,200
I cannot

205
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,720
fail at this point of time.

206
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,120
All my injuries have healed.

207
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,360
What are you doing?

208
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,240
Let go of me.

209
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,200
I should ask you the same question.

210
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,390
Why are you tailing me?

211
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,240
What are you talking about?

212
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,360
I don't understand.

213
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm not tailing you?

214
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,270
Still unwilling to tell me?

215
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,870
I would like to tell you!

216
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,550
I'll tell you!

217
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,390
Master Wei Zhen sent me.

218
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,630
Wei Zhen?

219
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,200
He knew you were here

220
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,960
and took away Lin Tian,

221
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:06,790
so

222
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,790
he asked me to watch you

223
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,270
and let him know

224
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,110
when you came out.

225
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,880
He's a dog with a bone.

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,790
Where's Lin Tian?

227
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,070
I don't know.

228
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,790
Master Wei Zhen took him away.

229
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,500
[Wei Shen, the eldest son of Marquis Wei Qi]

230
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,720
What?

231
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,510
Not convinced?

232
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Look at your delicate body.

233
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,110
How many punches can you take?

234
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,590
What can you possibly get

235
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,920
by serving that loser Qin Chen?

236
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,960
Why don't you switch to my side?

237
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I'll let you

238
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,160
live a luxurious life.

239
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,270
You still think Qin Chen will come for you?

240
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,720
He won't even be able to protect himself.

241
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,110
I heard

242
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,310
you and Qin Chen

243
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,680
live together

244
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,270
and are inseparable.

245
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,880
You must know

246
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
how Qin Chen

247
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,270
suddenly grew so much stronger.

248
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,480
Tell me.

249
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,480
Or you'll be very sorry.

250
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,310
Stop dreaming.

251
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,960
I won't tell you.

252
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,920
You prefer

253
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,350
to play it the hard way?

254
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,640
Well, I'll grant your wish.

255
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,000
Shen.

256
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,030
Qin Chen!

257
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,790
You're Qin Chen.

258
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,270
You know who I am.

259
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
Useless as Wei Zhen is,

260
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,510
he's my brother.

261
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,200
I don't want others

262
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,240
to think I'm a bully.

263
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,000
If you kneel,

264
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,920
kowtow and beg me for forgiveness,

265
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,680
and let Wei Zhen give you a beating,

266
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll let this go.

267
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,640
I'll also kindly forgive you

268
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,110
and let you leave.

269
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,790
Otherwise…

270
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,880
You must have a death wish!

271
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,510
Shen is making his move.

272
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,960
Sword Sacrifice.

273
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,200
With his top Human level of cultivation,

274
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
he can defeat Qin Chen

275
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,310
very easily.

276
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,550
It's unfortunate of you

277
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,310
to have confronted me.

278
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,200
How…

279
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,750
How could this be?

280
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,310
Luckily, your injury's superficial.

281
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,200
Your internal organs
and meridians are fine.

282
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,270
Get up.

283
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,590
Watch out.

284
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,160
Shen!

285
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,400
Why is this happening?

286
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,960
He hasn't even

287
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,110
awakened his bloodline yet.

288
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,920
How come he has such great powers?

289
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,790
I have already

290
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,640
given you a chance.

291
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,880
You think you're my equal

292
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,160
because you've withstood a punch from me?

293
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,750
Today I'll have you know the difference

294
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,880
between you and me.

295
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,030
It's a great impassable chasm.

296
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,240
With Shen's top Human level of cultivation,

297
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,160
it's a piece of cake for him
to defeat Qin Chen.

298
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,270
Formless Fist!

299
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,880
Tear mountains and tame tigers!

300
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,000
Bluff and bluster.

301
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,070
Be gone!

302
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,070
Shen mobilized his chi

303
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,310
to the extreme

304
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
but still

305
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,480
got defeated.

306
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,720
I…

307
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,310
I…

308
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,880
Forget it.

309
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,440
Shen has gotten his attention.

310
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,310
I should leave.

311
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,110
You want to flee?

312
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,550
Don't you think it's too late?

313
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,270
No.

314
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,640
Qin…

315
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,590
Qin Chen.

316
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,110
Master Qin Chen.

317
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,640
I'm begging you.

318
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,480
Please have mercy.

319
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,640
Shen.

320
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,550
Shen.

321
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,000
Shen.

322
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,960
If you hurt my friend again,

323
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,640
I will not let you go.

324
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:04,880
But

325
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,830
do you think I'll let go of you

326
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,070
so easily?

327
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,680
Chen.

328
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,480
It hurts.

329
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,070
Don't talk much when you're injured.

330
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,830
Get well

331
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,720
when you're back.

332
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,790
I guess the two men

333
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,790
won't bother you again.

334
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,830
Mm.

335
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,030
Chen.

336
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,440
What is this?

337
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
It's a formula for cultivation

338
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,400
which can help you heal

339
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,400
and also help you to cultivate.

340
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,110
All right.

341
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,350
Chen.

342
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,880
Huh?

343
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,640
Thank you.

344
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,880
No need for such politeness.

345
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,000
It's so great to have you as my bosom friend.

346
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,680
Come on.

347
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,350
Shen.

348
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,070
Are you okay?

349
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,000
Look what you've done.

350
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,480
Qin Chen

351
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,160
is such a ruthless bastard.

352
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,550
Darn it.

353
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,030
If I see him again,

354
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,240
I swear I'll show him no mercy!

355
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,920
Shut up.

356
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Qin Chen

357
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,440
has a fathomless strength.

358
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,000
If you mess with him again,

359
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,480
I'll break your leg.

360
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,720
Yes,

361
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,400
Shen.

362
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,640
Clear and diffusing.

363
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,680
Concentrating light.

364
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,030
This is a superior Moonstone.

365
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,510
I'm glad I paid good money for it.

366
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,790
If I give it to Qin Chen,

367
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,240
he'll definitely be very happy.

368
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,680
And when he's happy,

369
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,720
he might teach me

370
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,480
some special refining skills.

371
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,160
Master.

372
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,750
What can I do for you?

373
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,240
I asked you

374
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,790
to get acquainted

375
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,960
with Qin Chen.

376
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,270
How's it going between you and him?

377
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Well…

378
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,590
Forget it.

379
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,160
Deliver this Moonstone

380
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,160
to Qin Chen personally.

381
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,240
Tell him

382
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,310
it's a token of my gratitude.

383
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,480
This Moonstone is priceless.

384
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,310
You're really going to give it away like this?

385
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,000
It's none

386
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,240
of your business.

387
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,640
Yes.

388
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,400
Master.

389
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,920
Make sure

390
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,830
you deliver this to him personally.

391
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,000
In addition,

392
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,550
get me some information about Qin Chen.

393
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,110
Yes.

394
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,350
Wait.

395
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,240
What else can I do for you?

396
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Nothing…

397
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,110
You may leave.

398
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,790
Refining skills.

399
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,700
[Qin Residence]

400
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:33,830
Qin Chen.

401
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,790
I can't believe you dared come back.

402
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,240
You need to hide.

403
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,920
Uncle Yuanhong is looking everywhere for you.

404
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,310
What happened?

405
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,640
You ask me?

406
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,270
Did you cause trouble

407
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,640
while I was out?

408
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,030
Did you go to the Palace of Instruments
the day before yesterday?

409
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,550
Yes, I did.

410
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,030
You really offended

411
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,240
Master Liang Yu?

412
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,830
Liang Yu came here?

413
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,720
He didn't.

414
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,680
Qin Fen did.

415
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,310
He said you offended Master Liang Yu
in the Palace of Instruments,

416
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,350
and caused him

417
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,790
to be beaten and scolded.

418
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,400
He even lost the Dark Stone of Underworld

419
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,920
that refines magic weapons.

420
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,350
I thought he made it up.

421
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,310
I can't believe it really happened.

422
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,440
You.

423
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,920
Give me a break.

424
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,680
So it's because of Qin Fen.

425
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,270
He lost the Dark Stone of Underworld

426
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,000
himself.

427
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,680
What does it have to do with me?

428
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,680
Uncle Yuanhong is now searching for you.

429
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,960
The moment you go back,

430
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,160
you'll be interrogated.

431
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,750
Is my mother okay?

432
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,270
Don't worry.

433
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,400
Aunt Yuechi is fine.

434
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,510
But…

435
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,400
Master Chen.

436
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,310
The patriarch is holding a clan meeting.

437
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,590
Please come with me.

438
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:40,920
Qin Yong.

439
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,750
What do you want?

440
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,880
Miss Ying.

441
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,590
This is an order from the patriarch.

442
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,030
I'm just executing it.

443
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,030
You…

444
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,720
Where's my mother?

445
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,440
Miss Yuechi is in the assembly hall.

446
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,350
Lead the way.

447
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,440
This way, please.

448
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,590
Qin Chen offended Master Liang Yu

449
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,400
and brought great trouble to our family.

450
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,110
Given what he did,

451
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,110
if we don't disown him,

452
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,720
how can our family

453
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,400
keep a foothold in the Capitol?

454
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,720
My father is King of Might

455
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,350
with brilliant achievements.

456
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,960
How can we lose our foothold

457
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,750
by offending a refining master?

458
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,790
Zhao Feng, you're

459
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,920
making too big a deal out of it.

460
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:37,790
Qin Chen

461
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,480
offended the refining master

462
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,590
and brought trouble to our family.

463
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,960
He's indeed in the wrong.

464
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
When he gets back,

465
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,310
I'll ask him for the truth

466
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,880
and then make a decision.

467
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,160
Qin Yuechi.

468
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,830
Your bastard

469
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,830
has caused such great trouble,

470
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,720
but you remain indifferent.

471
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,640
If we had known the bastard

472
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,550
was such a troublemaker,

473
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,000
we would've long since disowned him.

474
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,030
Where's Qin Chen?

475
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,790
Why hasn't Qin Yong brought him here?

476
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,590
Mother.

477
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,480
Are you okay?

478
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,590
Qin Chen.

479
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,550
Why don't you

480
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,000
kneel in front of the patriarch?

481
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,510
Patriarch?

482
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,750
Which one of you is the patriarch?

483
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
How dare you!

484
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,350
If I remember correctly,

485
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,550
this should be King of Might Residence.

486
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,750
When did it become
Marquis of Anping Residence?

487
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Did I misremember?

488
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,240
Patriarch.

489
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,240
You guys.

490
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,550
As you've seen,

491
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,550
this bastard even

492
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,640
ignores the patriarch.

493
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,480
He's completely out of control.

494
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,070
I'm afraid he would bring a disaster

495
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,720
to our family.

496
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,750
Qin Chen.

497
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,960
We got you here

498
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,030
because of Master Liang Yu.

499
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,240
Tell us

500
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,070
how you offended him
in the Palace of Instruments.

501
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,680
I have nothing to say.

502
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,400
Because that never happened.

503
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,880
I knew this bastard would deny it.

504
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,110
Fen.

505
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,510
Tell us how this bastard

506
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,830
offended Master Liang Yu,

507
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:41,440
down to the smallest detail.
