19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,070
I've written to your grandpa.

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm not going to

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,350
let this go so easily.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,040
Ms. Qin.

23
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,510
Master Chen.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,280
In no time,

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,710
the final work on repairing the mansion
will be completed.

26
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,950
Thanks, Chief Zuo.

27
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,430
It's just part of my duty.

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,310
But

29
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,280
Lord Kang wants to tell you

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,840
you'd better move
near his mansion in the east of the city.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,360
It's safer there.

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,240
Please convey my gratitude.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,280
I'll take care of my mom.

34
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,630
Thank Lord Kang for me.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Chief Zuo.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,960
Come to me after work.

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
Yes.

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,030
Mr. Qin.

39
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,750
Come in.

40
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,710
Mr. Qin.

41
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,800
What can I do for you?

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,960
Do you remember

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
what I said to you last night?

44
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,680
Are you talking about my meridians?

45
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,280
Sit down.

46
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,120
I'll make a diagnosis

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,310
before giving you a treatment.

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,870
It's fine.

49
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,240
Although your meridians have a big problem,

50
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,430
it's not serious.

51
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,430
I can treat you right now.

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,470
Mr. Qin,

53
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,030
I just got injured.

54
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,960
Shall we wait until it's healed?

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,750
It doesn't matter.

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,560
It's just a minor injury.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
It won't take you long.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,910
Take it easy.

59
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,310
You… What are you doing?

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,710
Taking… Taking off my clothes.

61
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,360
How can I take treatment with clothes on?

62
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm giving you flying needle treatment.

63
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,390
No need to take off clothes.

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,720
It's done.

68

I've finally reached Heaven level!

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
From now on,

70

I wouldn't hesitate

72
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,630

73
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,720

No.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,480
Mr. Qin, you don't understand.

78
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,310
In the past,

79
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
I was the most outstanding talent
in the City Guard.

80
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,630
I was once somebody.

81
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,000
After I failed to reach Heaven level,

82
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
my life hit its bottom.

83
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,070
In the last five years,

84
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,680
I've been looked down upon

85
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,070
in the world.

86
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,630
I thought my life would end like this.

87
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,870
But I didn't expect to see this.

88
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,750
I've reached Heaven Level in my lifetime!

89
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,870
I'm at Heaven Level.

90
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,600
Get up, Chief Zuo Li.

91
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,830
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

92
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,240
Chief Zuo Li.

93
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,630
It's…

94
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,360
getting late.

95
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,190
You may

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,720
go back.

97
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,430
I'll take leave.

98
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
I'll take leave.

99
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,360
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

100
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,870
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

101
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,270
It's wasteful to plant

102
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,480
ordinary spiritual medicine

103
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,560
with the grand spirit-gathering array.

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,160
But it works quite well.

105
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,460
[Three days later]

106
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,390
My lady.

107
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,630
It's very thoughtful of you

108
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,960
to have brought the Biyou fruit

109
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,510
from the You Kingdom in time

110
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,000
to Mr. Qin's place in person.

111
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,080
The Biyou fruit is so large.

112
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,960
It's a real rarity.

113
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,270
I believe Mr. Qin

114
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,790
will like it.

115
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,240
He'll surely like it.

116
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,670
He'll surely like it.

117
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,960
My lady.

118
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,670
Have you sensed anything?

119
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,390
Why is there rich spiritual energy

120
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,630
at Mr. Qin's place?

121
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Chen.

122
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,270
We have guests.

123
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,670
I'm coming.

124
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,120
Miss Xiao.

125
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,480
What did you come for?

126
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,790
Mr. Qin.

127
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,390
I haven't seen you in days,
but you treat me like a stranger.

128
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,240
Aren't you gonna

129
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,600
invite me in?

130
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,550
Chen.

131
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,320
Miss Xiao.

132
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,510
Get to the point.

133
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,440
I came here

134
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,750
to give you a present.

135
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,960
A present?

136
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,240
I heard you're

137
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,750
in need of medicine.

138
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,000
So I found the Biyou fruit

139
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,240
for you by some means.

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
Look.

141
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,270
Mr. Qin.

142
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,030
Are you happy?

143
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,030
Thank you for your kindness.

144
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,270
Mr. Qin, you may not know

145
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,720
The Biyou fruit

146
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,870
is a rare heavenly grass in the Xuan Kingdom.

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,390
An average Biyou fruit
is about the size of a grain of rice.

148
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,200
After decades,

149
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,200
it reaches the size of a pearl.

150
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,440
It usually can't be bought with money.

151
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,790
Mr. Qin.

152
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,960
What do you think?

153
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,320
Liu Guang.

154
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,440
Take the Biyou fruit inside.

155
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,720
Yes.

156
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,120
Oh my!

157
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,960
Liu Guang.

158
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,390
Why are you so careless?

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,510
My…

160
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,440
My lady.

161
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,910
I…

162
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,630
Look at this.

163
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,720
Why are

164
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,510
these Biyou fruits so big?

165
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,120
Look.

166
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,080
They're…

167
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,150
The way these spiritual medicines
are arranged

168
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,480
looks like a spirit-gathering array.

169
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,750
But I haven't seen

170
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,600
such a complex spirit-gathering array.

171
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,390
No wonder the spiritual energy here is so rich.

172
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,670
I haven't introduced this to you.

173
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,270
I was hit by an idea

174
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,390
and planted the medicine days ago.

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,910
What

176
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,200
do you think of it?

177
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,510
They've grown into large ones

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,270
in just a few days.

179
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,720
The Biyou fruit grows up in extreme heat

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
because it needs a lot of sunlight

181
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,870
and lives by absorbing the heat.

182
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,270
The grand spirit-gathering array

183
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,790
has extreme heat,

184
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,790
and I also added

185
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,720
my special inflammatory potion.

186
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,390
This way, the Biyou fruits can grow very fast.

187
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,320
And they're also highly potent.

188
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,440
What do you think?

189
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
Do you want to have a taste?

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,870
No wonder you think nothing of my Biyou fruit.

191
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,840
Compared to yours,

192
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,150
my Biyou fruit

193
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,630
is simply a useless stone.

194
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,630
It's nothing compared to yours.

195
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,960
Miss Xiao.

196
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,630
Anything else?

197
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,390
No…

198
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,870
Mr. Qin.

199
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,440
I'm very sorry.

200
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,000
You've really broadened my horizon.

201
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
I mean it.

202
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,870
Mr. Qin.

203
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,550
You're very sophisticated

204
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,670
and get me confused.

205
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,790
Miss Xiao.

206
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,910
Fen, you've finally recovered.

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
Slowly.

208
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,750
Fen, be careful.

209
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,840
Mom.

210
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,670
Mom.

211
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,270
My martial prowess…

212
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,000
It's okay, Fen.

213
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,840
Although your martial prowess
has been reduced,

214
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,080
you have me.

215
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,550
I can guarantee you a rich life.

216
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,270
Mom.

217
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,080
Can't we do anything to Qin Chen?

218
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,550
Don't forget the thing about Qin.

219
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,600
Are we gonna let it go?

220
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,120
How can I be willing to let go

221
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,440
of that little pest?

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
But what can we do?

223
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,270
Your dad has been punished

224
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,200
by His Majesty because of the incident,

225
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,080
and ordered me not to

226
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,030
make trouble with Qin Chen.

227
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,910
Mom…

228
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,960
Dad forbids us to hurt Qin Chen

229
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,670
but doesn't forbids us
to hurt those around him.

230
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,960
Why is the market so busy today?

231
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,320
Chen, don't you know that?

232
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,960
Recently, Dan Pavilion launched
a new Grade Two Vital Dan.

233
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,120
The price remains unchanged,

234
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,750
but the effectiveness is doubled.

235
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,630
Demand for the medicine

236
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,320
is outrunning supply in the Capital now.

237
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,510
Our family got some medicine

238
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,630
Because my family runs a herb business

239
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,960
and partners with Dan Pavilion.

240
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,200
I managed to get this bottle

241
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,550
from my dad.

242
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,510
Hearing you're back,

243
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,320
I came to

244
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,870
give it to you.

245
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,440
You can keep it yourself.

246
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,440
Are you sure?

247
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,510
It's Grade Two Vital Dan.

248
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Dan Pavilion

249
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,440
got the formula from me.

250
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,480
If I want it,

251
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,000
I can have plenty.

252
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,720
What?

253
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,270
The…

254
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,320
The…

255
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,790
Did you really give the recipe to Dan Pavilion?

256
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,840
Patriarch.

257
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,390
We had cooperated well with Dan Pavilion.

258
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,390
[Lin Fei, Lin Xi's brother]
But they suddenly tore up

259
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,870
the recent agreement this morning.

260
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,080
[Lin Xi, the patriarch of the Lin family]
They've gone too far.

261
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,870
We lost the source of the medicine

262
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,200
and can not make ends meet.

263
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,670
We can't hold on much longer.

264
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,510
I'll think of something else.

265
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,720
But…

266
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,270
Patriarch!

267
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,030
Patriarch, it's bad!

268
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
Why are you so flustered?

269
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,910
Oh my!

270
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,550
Lord Qi came to our store
with the men of Dan Pavilion

271
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,390
and said our medicine was substandard.

272
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,600
They're going to smash up our store.

273
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,600
The Guards have arrived.

274
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,200
What?

275
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,910
You…

276
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,840
Did you really see

277
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,270
the men of Dan Pavilion?

278
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,080
Oh my.

279
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,440
I saw them clearly.

280
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,630
The guy is Supervisor Mu Xun

281
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,150
of the External Affairs Hall

282
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,600
of Dan Pavilion.

283
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,750
Dan Pavilion is going to destroy us.

284
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,630
Patriarch.

285
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,030
What can we do now?

286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,030
What do we do?

287
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,720
Let's go to have a look first.

288
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,120
Okay.

289
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,870
Go…

290
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,880
Get out…

291
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,750
Stop!

292
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,550
You can't…

293
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,680
Mr. Lin.

294
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,000
The Guards received a report

295
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,920
that your store sells substandard Dan medicine.

296
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,550
Now

297
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,830
we're going to demolish your store.

298
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,400
Move aside.

299
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,920
Sirs,

300
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
my family has been respecting the law.

301
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,200
How can we sell substandard Dan medicine?

302
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,880
It's not my place

303
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,680
to say if it's substandard.

304
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,200
Dan Pavilion has identified it.

305
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,590
I'm Mu Xun, the supervisor of Dan Pavilion.

306
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,510
After our identification,

307
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,480
the medicine sold by the Lin family

308
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,790
is substandard.

309
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,750
Lord Qi.

310
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,550
Why are you talking to them?

311
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,270
Smash it up directly.

312
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,590
I've always been impartial.

313
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,790
Mr. Qin Fen,

314
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,680
don't worry.

315
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,920
If they resist,

316
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll smash them and their store.

317
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,720
What do we do?

318
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,680
Patriarch.

319
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,160
Lord Qi is no wonder a royal member.

320
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
You uphold justice

321
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,550
and set an example for us.

322
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm a lord of the Xuan.

323
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,070
I should

324
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,960
find justice for our

325
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,510
citizens.

326
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,550
Lin Xi.

327
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,920
I'll give you half an hour

328
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,160
to move your stuff out.

329
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,070
Otherwise,

330
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,640
none will be kept.

331
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,790
You…

332
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,750
This…

333
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Supervisor Mu Xun.

334
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,070
You and I have been partners for years.

335
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,070
Why do you have to be so merciless?

336
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
All the Dan medicine we sold

337
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,880
came from the External Affairs Hall
of Dan Pavilion.

338
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,920
How can it be substandard?

339
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,510
That was the past.

340
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,920
Our External Affairs Hall

341
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,750
has already stopped cooperation with you.

342
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,790
Your Dan medicine is suspicious

343
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,160
with a questionable origin.

344
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,680
Supervisor Mu Xun.

345
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,000
My Dan medicine

346
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,640
is undoubtedly produced by Dan Pavilion.

347
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,270
You…

348
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,960
Mr. Lin.

349
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,070
Dan Pavilion never did business
with the Lin family.

350
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,550
You know what?

351
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,030
Because of your statement,

352
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,070
I can sue you for defamation.

353
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,000
You…

354
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,400
Smash it up.

355
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,070
Yes.

356
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,030
You can't do this.

357
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,310
-You can't do this.
-You can't do this.

358
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,160
-Move aside.
-Move aside.

359
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,400
-You can't do this.
-You can't do this.

360
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,830
Move aside.

361
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,790
You can't do this.

362
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,550
I must tell you bluntly.

363
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,830
Anyone who obstructs the Guards

364
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,350
will be put into prison

365
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,480
and suffer severe punishment.

366
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,270
Smash it up.

367
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,240
Move aside.

368
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,640
-You can't do this.
-You can't.

369
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,920
Lord Qi, you're so oppressive.

370
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,030
Qin Chen.

371
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,960
Some people know

372
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,550
you're a lord of the Xuan.

373
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
For those who don't know,

374
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,640
they would think some bandits have gotten

375
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,030
into town.

376
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,270
Qin Chen.

377
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,680
I didn't expect to see you here.

378
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,400
What?

379
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,510
Are you going to stop Lord Qi

380
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,680
from performing his duties?

381
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,790
The butcher looked for his knife,

382
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,590
and it was in his mouth.

383
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,920
I didn't expect

384
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,830
to see you here today.

385
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,270
Take him down.

386
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,750
You…

387
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,960
How dare you.

388
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,750
Qin Fen.

389
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,960
It seems you've fully recovered

390
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,720
and become alive and kicking.

391
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,270
Qin Chen.

392
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,750
You have violated the law of the Xuan

393
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,000
by attacking the Guards.

394
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,160
I suggest you

395
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,070
surrender now,

396
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,000
or you'll be doubly guilty.

397
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,270
You said I violated the law.

398
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,200
I think you're in collusion with Qin Fen,

399
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,440
trying to frame up the Lin family.

400
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,160
I…

401
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,030
You're slinging mud at me.

402
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
The Guards received the report,

403
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,550
and Master Mu Xun is our witness.

404
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,720
What we did is completely legal.

405
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,640
How could you say I framed up the Lin family?

406
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,960
Today,

407
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,830
I'll convict you of smearing me.

408
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,880
Right.

409
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,750
Dan Pavilion has verified

410
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,510
you sell substandard Dan medicine
at the price of the best quality.

411
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,880
So we forbid all your business

412
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,880
in the Xuan forever.

413
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,480
No.

414
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,200
What can we do?

415
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,070
This…

416
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,200
Mu Xun.

417
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,160
You bastard.

418
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,000
Who gave you the right
to represent Dan Pavilion?

419
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,880
Master Liu Guang.

420
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,510
Liu…

421
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,070
Master Liu Guang.

422
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,920
You…

423
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:48,830
You…

424
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
Why did you come?

425
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,440
Dad.

426
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,240
I can't believe you would rather be a stooge

427
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,590
of the Zhaos and the Qins than a supervisor.

428
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,440
From now on,

429
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,790
you're not part of Dan Pavilion.

430
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,110
Get out.

431
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,640
Master.

432
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,880
Master.

433
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
I can explain.

434
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,030
This is…

435
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,000
Take the good-for-nothing away.

436
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:25,750
Master.

437
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,680
I was wronged! Master.

438
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,550
I've been wronged! Master.

439
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,880
Please give me a chance.

440
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Master…

441
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,920
Master.

442
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,030
I don't know what Mr. Mu Xun did wrong,

443
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,720
making you so mad at him.

444
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,880
Who are you?

445
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,240
I'm dealing with the internal affairs.

446
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,640
Who are you to cut in?

447
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm Qin Fen,
the second son of Marquis of Anping.

448
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,400
Master Liu Guang.

449
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,160
Could you do me a favor?

450
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,590
You…

451
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,350
This…

452
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,160
He beat me.

453
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Even if Marquis of Anping is here,

454
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,160
he has to speak quite kindly to me.

455
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,790
Who do you think you are?

456
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,880
Lord Qi.

457
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,270
Lord Qi.

458
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,200
Who are you?

459
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm Zhao Qirui, Lord Qi,

460
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,400
the young brother of His Majesty.

461
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,680
About what happened today,

462
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,590
we may have some misunderstanding.

463
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,310
Can you do me a favor?

464
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,350
You…

465
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,790
Lord Qi.

466
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,880
You are the so-called Lord Qi who is idle

467
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,640
and doesn't do decent work.

468
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,640
Bah!

469
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,110
How dare an idle lord

470
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,550
brag himself in front of me?

471
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,160
You…

472
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,720
Even in the presence of His Majesty,

473
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,480
I dare beat you.

474
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,400
You.

475
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,830
You…

476
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,160
Even my father hadn't slapped me.

477
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,110
Lord Qi.

478
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,000
A wise man knows when to retreat.

479
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,270
Let's leave.

480
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,480
Let's go.

481
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,960
We'll see.

482
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,400
Wait and see.

483
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,310
We'll see.

484
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,110
Mr. Qin.

485
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,680
It's my fault
that I didn't manage the pavilion well.

486
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,310
I'm sorry you're mad.

487
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,830
If Young Master Lin hadn't come

488
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,880
to Dan Pavilion to find me,

489
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,750
I wouldn't have known

490
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,440
what was happening here.

491
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,790
I'm very sorry.

492
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm very sorry.

493
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,030
It's okay. Master Liu Guang.

494
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,200
Thanks for your help on this.

495
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,200
You're welcome…

496
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,510
Father.

497
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,350
Come.

498
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,790
This is Master Liu Guang of Dan Pavilion

499
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,640
and also Chen's friend.

500
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,960
Chen's friend?

501
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,750
You must be Mr. Lin, aren't you?

502
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,160
It's a pleasure to see you.

503
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,880
Mr. Qin, Mr. Lin.

504
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,200
On the way here,

505
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,790
Young Master Lin told me the whole story

506
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,160
in detail.

507
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,640
From now on,

508
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,720
as long as the herb is from your store,

509
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,590
Dan Pavilion will buy it up.

510
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,830
Besides,

511
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,550
we'll buy it at twice the market price.

512
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,720
Master Liu Guang.

513
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,030
I very much appreciate it.

514
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,030
In addition to the herb business,

515
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,030
from now on,

516
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,720
your store can get any Dan medicine

517
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,000
you want from Dan Pavilion,

518
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,920
Grade Two Vital Dan in particular.

519
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,680
Really?

520
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,160
Dad.

521
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,400
This is great.

522
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,270
Am I dreaming?

523
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,440
You're not.

524
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,350
Mr. Qin.

525
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,510
Are you satisfied with the result?

526
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,510
Yes.

527
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,830
Mr. Qin, are you occupied?

528
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:50,310
Miss Xiao would like to communicate with you.

529
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,440
I happened to have something to do
in Dan Pavilion.

530
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,110
Let's go.

531
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,720
Dad.

532
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,310
I'll take leave.

533
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,790
It hurts so much.

534
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,510
You, a deacon of Dan Pavilion,

535
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,920
How dare you beat me!

536
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,880
I'm not done with him.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,550
Qin Chen is so hateful.

538
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,110
But

539
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,680
why did Dan Pavilion defend Qin Chen?

540
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,750
How can I know?

541
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,550
Sir.

542
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,480
Sir, please give me a penny.

543
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,680
Here you are.

544
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,270
My bowl!

545
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
My bowl.

546
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,350
My bowl.

547
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,030
What do you want?

548
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,270
I'm the son of Marquis of Anping.

549
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,350
What do you want?

550
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,030
Stop!

551
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm Lord Qi, Zhao Qirui.

552
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,070
You!

553
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,200
Stop it!

554
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,480
Bah!

555
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,160
They're more pathetic

556
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,640
than beggars.

557
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,240
How dare they
claim to be Young Master Qin and Lord Qi?

558
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,750
Let's go.

559
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,790
They dared to provoke our Dan Pavilion.

560
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,960
Do they think we're to be bullied?

561
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,160
I promise the boy will

562
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
be in bed for half a month.

563
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,720
Has Mr. Qin gone?

564
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,960
My lady.

565
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,270
Mr. Qin has gone.

566
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,030
I saw him off in person.

567
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,790
I heard something happened

568
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,590
in the market.

569
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,030
What was happening?

570
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,400
Here's the thing.

571
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,920
Liu Guang.

572
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,790
You did a great job this time.

573
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,960
Zhao Qirui

574
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,830
had the nerve to flirt with me.

575
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,310
You cut off cooperation

576
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,880
with the royalty right now.

577
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,070
They have to give me an explanation.

578
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,640
Flirt with you?

579
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,830
I said he flirted with me.

580
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
What's wrong?

581
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,440
Am I not beautiful enough

582
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,720
to be flirted with?

583
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,720
No…

584
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,750
My lady.

585
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,640
I definitely didn't mean that.

586
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,200
Are we really

587
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,920
going to cut off cooperation
with the royalty?

588
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,880
Do you

589
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,480
have any problems?

590
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,510
No.

591
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,640
No.

592
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,790
Dan Pavilion will run businesses

593
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,720
all over the five kingdoms.

594
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,480
Even the Xuan royalty

595
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,550
will have to beg us.

596
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,350
Yes.

597
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,000
