00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,910
Feng is too reckless.

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,910

57

As the lady of the house,

108
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,680
you should be magnanimous.

109

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,310
But do you know

117
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,870
why His Majesty sides with Qin Chen?

118
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,040
Isn't it because

119
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,160
Qin Chen won first place in the year-end exam
and made great contributions

120
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,830
in the preliminary test
of the Competition of Five Kingdoms?

121
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,070
That's one of the reasons,

122
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,720
but not the main one.

123
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,070
If His Majesty really sided with Qin Chen,

124
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,160
he wouldn't promise Feng
the title of Marquis of Champion

125
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,120
after Feng returned to the Capital.

126
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,360
His real goal

127
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,430
is to make Feng and Qin Chen

128
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,120
fight with each other,

129
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,360

when both of them suffer.

Lone Peak Slash!

189
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,440
Silver Lining!

190
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,150
[No.]

191
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
You two

192
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,150
are courting death.

193
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,750
Wang Qiming,

194
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,120
are you alright?

195
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,960
Still breathing.

196
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,360
Smack!

197
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,870
Surprisingly, you're able to fight back.

198
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,200
I think you two

199
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,750
want to die.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,080
Saber Essence!

201
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,630
Exterminate!

202
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,440
Blast it.

203
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,510
I'll be in danger if I stay here any longer.

204
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,240
I have to find a way to run.

205
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,150
Oh no, he's running away.

206
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,720
Stop him.

207
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,240
Ms. Qin?

208
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,840
Thank you for your help.

209
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't mention it.

210
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,320
You're Qin Chen's friends.

211
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,910
And you're here to protect me.

212
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,390
Of course, I can't let you

213
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,120
come to any harm.

214
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,000
Where is Chen?

215
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,910
He asked us over to protect Ms. Qin.

216
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,870
Where did he go?

217
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,550
Elder Ling Zhong from the Ghost Immortal Sect

218
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,600
has come to the Capital.

219
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,030
It's likely that other martial artists
of the sect are nearby.

220
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,360
If Chen runs into them, he'll be in trouble.

221
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,840
Chen is incredible.

222
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,480
You have nothing to worry about.

223
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,550
You're right.

224
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,960
Chen,

225
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,630
you have to be careful.

226
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,240
I, Zhao Feng,

227
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,790
pay respect to Your Majesty.

228
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,030
I, Qin Feng, pay respect to Your Majesty.

229
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,480
Raise.

230
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

231
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,790
The King of Lingnan,

232
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,150
Qin Yuanhong,

233
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,550
why did you bring Ms. Zhao

234
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,510
and Qin Feng here?

235
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,200
Your Majesty,

236
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,030
it's regarding the case
of Qin Feng killing Nian Wuji.

237
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,790
That's why I bring my sister and Qin Feng over.

238
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Hasn't it been settled?

239
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,080
What else do you want to say?

240
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
According to Qin Feng,

241
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,790
Nian Wuji wasn't killed by him.

242
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,960
This is a severe matter.

243
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,320
And Qin Feng's reputation is at stake.

244
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,550
So I think…

245
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,510
The King of Lingnan,

246
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,440
everyone knows that Qin Feng killed Cao Heng

247
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,830
and Nian Wuji.

248
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,070
Besides, King of Lingwu was there at that time.

249
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,110
With him taking charge,

250
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,400
no one would wrongly accuse Qin Feng.

251
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,440
Your Majesty,

252
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,070
all this is Qin Chen's evil device.

253
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,640
According to Qin Feng,

254
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,270
the real culprit
who killed Nian Wuji and Cao Heng

255
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,160
is Qin Chen.

256
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,920
But Qin Feng is identified as the murderer

257
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,480
due to some misunderstandings.

258
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,590
Nonsense.

259
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,160
The King of Lingnan,
as a nobleman in the Xuan,

260
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,830
you're always impartial to your subordinates.

261
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,440
But you know the Ghost Immortal Sect
is advancing toward the Capital,

262
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,790
and the Zhao is eyeing us covetously.

263
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,270
In order to protect your nephew,

264
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,750
you practice favouritism.

265
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,640
I think you're too old to think straight.

266
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,310
Your Majesty,

267
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,070
precisely because the Zhao is eyeing us

268
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,960
and the Ghost Immortal Sect is trying

269
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,400
to intrude on our capital,

270
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,750
we should investigate the incident
more thoroughly

271
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,240
so as not to wrong the innocent.

272
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,790
Your Majesty, please look into this.

273
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,510
Your Majesty,

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,880
there were many people there on that day.

275
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,720
And the martial artists
from the You could bear witness.

276
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,240
The truth was out.

277
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,270
We didn't wrong anyone.

278
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,830
The King of Lingnan is bending the law
for personal gain.

279
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,000
I hope Your Majesty will look into this.

280
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,440
Bending the law for personal gain?

281
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,110
Lord Kang,

282
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,110
I remember your beloved daughter,

283
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,590
Zhao Lingshan, was also there.

284
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,440
If there is evidence to prove

285
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,200
that the real culprit who killed Nian Wuji
and Cao Heng is Qin Chen,

286
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
your beloved daughter

287
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,920
must be one of the accomplices.

288
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,920
You're afraid that she'll be implicated,

289
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,750
so you assert that Qin Feng is the murderer.

290
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,270
Lord Kang, you're the one

291
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,640
who is bending the law for personal gain.

292
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,880
Nonsense.

293
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,350
Yuanhong.

294
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,830
Your Majesty,

295
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,550
What the King of Lingnan said is very true.

296
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,920
My family is loyal.

297
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,830
How could we bring such a disaster to the Xuan?

298
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,920
My son is definitely not the murderer

299
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
who killed Cao Heng and Nian Wuji.

300
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,920
I hope Your Majesty will look into it

301
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,590
and do justice to my son.

302
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,480
Enough.

303
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,790
King of Lingwu,

304
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
what's your view on this?

305
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,680
Your Majesty,

306
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,030
the witness testimonies and proof

307
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,440
all point to Qin Feng.

308
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,750
But

309
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,830
both Qin Feng and Qin Chen

310
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,680
are heroes of the Xuan.

311
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,440
They shouldn't be punished in this way.

312
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:52,880
Your Majesty…

313
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,030
News!

314
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,200
Your Majesty,

315
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,880
Zuo Li, Chief of the City Guard, has reported

316
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,750
that the Ghost Immortal Sect martial artists
have broken into Qin Chen's residence,

317
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,750
trying to hurt him.

318
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,240
What?

319
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,350
The Ghost Immortal Sect is here already?

320
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,400
Feng.

321
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,830
Are you sure they're members
of the Ghost Immortal Sect?

322
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,510
That is what Chief Zuo Li reported.

323
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,480
It should be correct.

324
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,400
And according to the city guard's informant,

325
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,510
except for the western part of the city,

326
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,070
there is also a Ghost Immortal Sect team

327
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,720
heading toward the east.

328
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
It seems that

329
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,880
they're going

330
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,880
to King of Might residence.

331
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,030
This is outrageous.

332
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,200
The Ghost Immortal Sect is so daring.

333
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,240
How dare they trespass on our capital

334
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,790
and hurt our martial artists?

335
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,640
Do they really think the Xuan is a pushover?

336
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,720
Your Majesty,

337
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,310
please order to kill the intruders

338
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
to uphold the prestige of the Xuan.

339
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,240
Your Majesty,

340
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,160
the Capital is an important place for the Xuan.

341
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,510
We can't let the Ghost Immortal Sect
wantonly trample on it.

342
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,510
If words get out,

343
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,270
it'll tarnish the reputation of our kingdom.

344
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,400
I hope Your Majesty
will issue the order quickly.

345
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,070
This Ghost Immortal Sect

346
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,160
shows no respect

347
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,110
for me.

348
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,160
King of Lingwu.

349
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,510
Yes.

350
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,440
Go to Qin Chen's residence now

351
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,200
to capture the martial artists
of the Ghost Immortal Sect.

352
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,830
Qin Chen is a hero of the Xuan.

353
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,310
No matter what,

354
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
you can't let him come to any harm.

355
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,750
Yes.

356
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,590
Lord Kang.

357
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,400
Yes.

358
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,070
You'll be in charge of the city guard.

359
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,510
Command all city guards

360
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,350
to turn up for duty

361
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,400
to guard the entrances and exits

362
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,350
and maintain the order of the Capital.

363
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,400
Yes.

364
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,200
You two go and see to it now.

365
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,110
Yes.

366
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,920
Your Majesty.

367
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,750
Cut it out.

368
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,350
The Ghost Immortal Sect

369
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,750
has come to our capital.

370
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,790
The top priority

371
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,400
is to guarantee the safety

372
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,680
of the Capital.

373
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,350
Qin Yuanhong.

374
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,590
Yes.

375
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
The Ghost Immortal Sect
has gone to your residence.

376
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,920
You should hurry back and have a look.

377
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,720
As for Ms. Zhao and Qin Feng,

378
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,070
they can stay here.

379
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,790
I will send the Royal Guard

380
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,480
to protect them.

381
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

382
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

383
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,590
Who is it?

384
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,480
Who are you?

385
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,640
So, you're the Emperor of the Xuan?

386
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,160
Who is the daredevil that breaks
into the hall?

387
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,920
I am the leader of the Ghost Immortal Sect,

388
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,350
Nian Shuo.

389
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,550
Guards!

390
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,480
Guards!

391
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,070
Yan Huai, protect His Majesty!

392
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,160
Hurry up!

393
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,400
Protect who?

394
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Protect your Emperor?

395
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,510
I might as well tell you.

396
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,550
Even if you shout your lungs out,

397
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,030
no one will come.

398
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,000
How can this be?

399
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,960
Be careful!

400
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,240
Feng, what are you doing?

401
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
Come back here.

402
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,480
An insignificant Nian Shuo

403
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,590
has the audacity

404
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,640
to intrude into the Palace of the Xuan.

405
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,830
Do you really think we're soft meat?

406
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,070
Zhao Gao,

407
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,510
you're clueless
that you're going to die soon.

408
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,790
This is ridiculous.

409
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,920
I came here today

410
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,550
to take your life.

411
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,440
How dare you!

412
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,480
Nian Shuo,

413
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,680
I, Qin Yuanhong,

414
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,550
will never let you lay a finger on His Majesty.

415
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,200
So, you're Qin Yuanhong?

416
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,350
Zhao Zhen,

417
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,310
isn't he one of yours?

418
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,350
Qin Yuanhong,

419
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,310
take Feng with you

420
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,720
and leave.

421
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,440
You…

422
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,720
Zhao Zhen?

423
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
Zhao Gao,

424
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,270
you've occupied the throne of the Xuan
for so many years.

425
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,880
It's time for you to step down.

426
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,640
Uncle Zhen.

427
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,510
Zhen.

428
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,750
Qin Yuanhong,

429
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,680
what are you waiting for?

430
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,720
Leave.

431
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,590
You…

432
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,310
Uncle Zhen.

433
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,720
Why do you…

434
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,070
Feng!

435
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,830
Feng!

436
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,680
Feng!

437
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,440
Feng, are you okay?

438
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,200
Feng.

439
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,510
I have pills.

440
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,350
Feng.

441
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,480
Nian Shuo, what are you doing?

442
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,750
Why don't you tell me?

443
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,310
This man killed my son

444
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,880
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

445
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,030
How can I let him live?

446
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,200
Swallow it, Feng.

447
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,830
Swallow it.

448
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,750
It was Qin Chen who killed Nian Wuji,

449
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,640
not him.

450
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Even if it wasn't him,

451
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,920
so what?

452
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,160
As far as I know,

453
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,880
He was there

454
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,310
during the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

455
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
In other words,

456
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,830
he had a chance to save my son.

457
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,070
But he didn't do it.

458
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,720
An accomplice like him

459
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,070
deserves to die.

460
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,590
You…

461
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,640
As for Qin Chen,

462
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,160
don't worry.

463
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,830
I will definitely tear him to pieces.

464
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,070
What?

465
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,310
You…

466
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,920
And you, Zhao Zhen,

467
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,440
This brat

468
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,200
is just your nephew.

469
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,590
You…

470
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,590
It's never wise to be soft-hearted
when accomplishing great things.

471
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,960
I don't think you'll stand against me

472
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,750
for this brat.

473
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,510
I'm sorry, Mother.

474
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,640
I have to go first.

475
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,030
No.

476
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,440
Feng.

477
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,960
Hang in there.

478
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,400
You'll be fine.

479
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,880
I won't let anything happen to you.

480
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,070
Feng.

481
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,880
Feng.

482
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,350
Feng.

483
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Open your eyes.

484
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,400
Open your eyes. Look me.

485
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Look at me, Feng.

486
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,480
Feng.

487
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,310
Mother,

488
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,750
I've embarrassed you.

489
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,750
I don't want you to do us proud

490
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,000
or be the number one of the Xuan.

491
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,240
I just want you to live.

492
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,830
I beg you to stay with me.

493
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,110
Mother.

494
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,830
Uncle Zhen…

495
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,790
Uncle Zhen is so conniving.

496
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,110
Stay away from him.

497
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,480
Mmm.

498
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,510
Don't pick on Qin Chen

499
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,200
in the future.

500
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,030
Take good care of Fen.

501
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,510
Mother.

502
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,550
I…

503
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,030
I was wrong.

504
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,920
No.

505
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Feng.

506
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,350
Feng.

507
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Feng.

508
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,030
Feng!

509
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,640
Feng, wake up! Feng!

510
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,440
Feng…

511
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,110
My Feng!

512
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,160
Qin Yuanhong,

513
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,510
why aren't you moving?

514
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,320
