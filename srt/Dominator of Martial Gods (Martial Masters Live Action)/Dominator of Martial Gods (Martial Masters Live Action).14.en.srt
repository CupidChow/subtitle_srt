[Adapted from original work of "Dominator of Martial Gods",
The Universe Part I by Ruo Hong Culture]

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,220
[Episode 14]

19
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,040
Excuse me,

20
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,920
Mr. Chen Mu, what did you just say?

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,150
I meant

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,350
a half fire-gathering array

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
has very weak array fire.

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,190
Even if you can split the fire into three,

25
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,590
you can't put them in a pyramid shape.

26
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,590
I didn't hear clearly. What did you said again?

27
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,870
I…

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,080
[Was he playing me on purpose?]

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Impossible.

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,400
You only activated half of the array.

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,680
The fire was too weak

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,910
to even take shape.

33
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,280
Not to mention fire splitting and overlaying.

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
You're cheating!

35
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,710
Who said
you couldn’t do fire splitting and overlaying

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
with only half of the array lines activated?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
Do you even need someone to tell you that?

38
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,430
This is the common sense every Alchemist has.

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,190
What kind of common sense is that, Li Qingfeng?

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,030
Let me ask you this.

41
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,630
Do you know how many array lines the

42
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,680
fire-gathering array in front of you has?

43
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,710
I'm not an array master.

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,870
How would I know?

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,870
I'm gonna make an exception to teach you

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,630
free of charge this time.

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,120
The array you're looking at is a Grade One array

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,310
consisting of 108 array lines.

49
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
Normal Alchemists

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,360
just need to activate 36 primary array lines

51
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,430
to form stable fire.

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,630
By controlling the number of secondary lines,

53
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,120
you'll be able to control the temperature

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
and form of fire.

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,240
This method can save an Alchemist
a lot of spiritual power.

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,680
For this test, I've totally activated

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,470
36 primary array lines and 18 secondary lines,

58
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,190
because under such circumstances

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,030
the fire created was quite stable

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,360
and very suitable for splitting.

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,360
This is why

62
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,630
I only activated half of the array lines.

63
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,240
This is what I call common sense.

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,590
Total nonsense.

65
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,470
I've been practicing fire control for so long.

66
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,360
But I never heard of anything like you said.

67
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,910
Masters,

68
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,560
he was just trying to

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,560
hide his method of cheating

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,840
by saying this nonsense.

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,870
Well…

72
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,240
Honestly,

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,070
I've never heard of the theory Qin Chen said.

74
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,310
Controlling the temperature and form of fire

75
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,430
by the number of activated array lines?

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,160
This

77
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,830
is indeed a fresh concept.

78
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,070
[Even a three-year-old from Dan Tower]

79
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,920
[in the Martial Domain knows this.]

80
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,070
[But the three official
Alchemists of this Dan Pavilion]

81
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,560
[haven't heard of it?]

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,600
[The Xuan is truly isolated and backward.]

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,560
If you don't believe it,

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,070
you may try by yourselves.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,830
It worked, like he said!

86
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,920
This fire is dim in color

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
and low in temperature,

88
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,480
but its structure is quite stable.

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,190
Even without control with spiritual power,

90
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,190
it doesn't seem to collapse at all.

91
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,120
How come

92
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,920
we didn't know about this theory before?

93
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,950
Actually, activating 18 secondary array lines

94
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,240
can already save eighty percent

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,600
of an alchemist's spiritual power.

96
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,560
Splitting the fire into three is too easy.

97
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,000
I can do five.

98
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,480
Nine.

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
No way.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,950
Nine?

101
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,870
Piece of cake.

102
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,950
This…

103
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,630
H-How is this possible?

104
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,040
This… Could this be

105
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,830
the legendary Method of Nine-Fire Pagoda?

106
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,560
Master Liu Guang.

107
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,800
Master Liu Guang?

108
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,720
Have I passed the second round?

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,510
Pass! Who dare say otherwise?

110
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,390
Well…

111
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,390
Zhao Lingshan,

112
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Wang An,

113
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,720
Li Qingfeng,

114
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,630
and Qin Chen

115
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,160
will take the third round.

116
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,800
Thank you, Master.

117
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,160
The third round is

118
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,040
the refining of Grade One Vital Dan.

119
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,560
Each of you will only have one chance.

120
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,480
Now begin.

121
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,950
Great.

122
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,160
The refining of this Dan isn't difficult.

123
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
I must pass this one.

124
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,270
I lost to you in the year-end
examination for being careless.

125
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,430
This time's victory is mine.

126
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,070
Has he already started refining?

127
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,040
The refining process is complex and changeable.

128
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
You mustn't begin unless

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,920
your preliminary preparations

130
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
have been perfect.

131
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,430
Although Grade One Vital Dan

132
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,480
is a common Grade One medicine,

133
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,720
its refining process isn't simple at all.

134
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,950
Has Qin Chen become arrogant after passing

135
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,360
the first two rounds?

136
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,440
Reckless. Too reckless.

137
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
[I've got plenty of time.]

138
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,240
[With him doing it first,]

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
[I can watch and study his method.]

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,390
What?!

141
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,270
This…

142
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,550
Does Qin Chen think
refining is like cooking, huh?

143
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you think it'll cook by itself
just by throwing

144
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,440
ingredients and condiments in there?

145
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,670
Even if it's like cooking,

146
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,790
adding ingredients and condiments

147
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,550
must be in a certain order.

148
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,480
He's not refining at all.

149
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,390
He's just messing around.

150
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,120
You put so many crude drugs in there.

151
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,670
Careful not to explode the stove!

152
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,790
I thought Qin Chen was a rarest talent.

153
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,080
But he actually knew nothing about alchemy.

154
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,910
The stove may explode any minute.

155
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,080
Everyone be careful!

156
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,550
I smell the scent of medicine!

157
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,030
Could it be…

158
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
Masters,

159
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,480
my refining is finished.

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,360
Did he finish just like this?

161
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
Let me take a look.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,320
This Dan medicine is round and pure white.

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,080
It's as flawless as a piece of art.

164
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,120
Mm.

165
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,030
Very smooth.

166
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,870
And no medicine powder stuck on my fingers.

167
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,390
But why is it pure white in color?

168
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,910
Aren't normal Vial Dan slightly cyan?

169
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,440
Could this be the Top Class Vital Dan?

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,390
Even if it's you and me,

171
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,120
we can't produce twelve

172
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,320
Top Class Vital Dans in one stove.

173
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,200
This isn't Top Class Vital Dan.

174
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,320
I knew it.

175
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,870
How could this be Top Class Vital Dan?

176
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,440
It must be waste medicine
as a result of amateur refining.

177
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,000
It's Premium Class Vital Dan!

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,670
-Top tier Premium Class Vital Dan!
-What?

179
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,000
Premium Class Vital Dan indeed!

180
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm a Grade Two Alchemist.

181
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,480
I've refined over 100 stoves
of Grade One Dan medicine,

182
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,750
but I only succeeded once for this.

183
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,550
How…

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,630
How…

185
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,510
One hour left before the test ends.

186
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
Everyone, please seize time.

187
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,870
Crap.

188
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,270
If not for Qin Chen,

189
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,320
how would I make such a stupid mistake?

190
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,600
I did it.

191
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,630
Congrats.

192
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,360
Thanks!

193
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,510
This Qin Chen

194
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
isn't even an alchemy apprentice.

195
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,150
He passed the first time

196
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,030
he took the test.

197
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,670
Princess Lingshan also passed at the first try.

198
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,000
Now look at me…

199
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,200
I've practiced hard for decades.

200
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,120
If I fail again this time,

201
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,030
this will be my last try.

202
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,550
Maybe

203
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,670
I'm really not meant to be an Alchemist.

204
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,030
Six Inferior Class Grade One Vital Dans.

205
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,720
Two waste Dans.

206
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,750
For Wang An's third round,

207
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,150
it's a pass.

208
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,790
I made it!

209
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,630
I finally made it!

210
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm an Alchemist now!

211
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,720
Thank you, Masters!

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,960
Thank you, Masters!

213
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,150
Alright,

214
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,910
those who passed today

215
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,630
can claim a Grade One Alchemist badge

216
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,630
with your certificate of passing the test.

217
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,000
And you'll be registered in Dan Pavilion.

218
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,600
That's all for today's test.

219
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,320
Thank you, Master Liu Guang.

220
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,320
Qin Chen.

221
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,630
You stay for now.

222
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,360
Qin Chen,

223
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,150
with your peerless talent,

224
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,000
your future is boundless.

225
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,200
Master Liu Guang,

226
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,720
since I've passed the test for Alchemists,

227
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,000
I wonder if I'm qualified

228
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,000
to meet your Pavilion Master?

229
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,030
You want to meet the Pavilion Master?

230
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,670
Our pavilion master is extremely busy.

231
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,480
It's very difficult even for our own Alchemists

232
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,960
to make an appointment.

233
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,870
Is there no other way?

234
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,960
I have something important
to discuss with the Pavilion Master.

235
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,750
I'd like to make a deal with your pavilion.

236
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,750
I'm a Grade Two Alchemist in here.

237
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,120
I guess I'm authorized enough

238
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,720
to make this deal with you.

239
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,360
But this deal is extremely important.

240
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,960
I may need the Pavilion Master to
do it personally.

241
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,550
You haven't met the Pavilion Master.

242
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,150
You don't know how bad-tempered
the Pavilion Master is.

243
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,910
If there's nothing important,

244
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,270
not to mention you, a new Alchemist,

245
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,550
even I will probably

246
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,270
be punished for the disturbance.

247
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,910
If you insist on meeting her,

248
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,840
I can inform her for you.

249
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,150
Okay.

250
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,440
Thanks for informing her of my request,

251
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,120
Master Liu Guang.

252
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,550
Since this is the case,

253
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,600
please go back to Dan Pavilion with us.

254
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,550
Please.

255
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,260
[Dan Pavilion of the Xuan Kingdom]

256
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,670
Pavilion Master,

257
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,480
it's me, Liu Guang.

258
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,750
I've finished testing a new Alchemist today.

259
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,350
He said that he'd like to meet you

260
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,350
to make a deal with us.

261
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,920
It's so important that your decision is needed.

262
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,550
Pavilion Master?

263
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,550
What kind of business a new Alchemist

264
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,920
has to discuss with me?

265
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,640
Liu Guang,

266
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,110
you've worked for long in here.

267
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,790
Why do you disturb me with such trivia?

268
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,790
This person is truly extraordinary.

269
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,590
I've given it much thought.

270
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,590
I think it's best if you meet him.

271
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,400
[Xiao Ya, Dan Pavilion Master]
Tell me about him, then.

272
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,510
What's so extraordinary about this one?

273
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,720
The newly admitted Alchemist

274
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,350
is an eighteen-ish young man.

275
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,270
An eighteen-ish young man?

276
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,640
That's quite uncommon.

277
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,480
He got a perfect score in the first round

278
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,590
of the test, the written examination.

279
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,550
For the second round, fire control,

280
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,720
he pulled off the Method of Nine-Fire Pagoda.

281
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,750
For the third round, the refining test,

282
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,030
he straightly produced twelve

283
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,110
Premium Class Grade One Vital Dans.

284
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,350
Interesting.

285
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm suddenly not occupied now.

286
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,830
Since he wants to discuss business with me,

287
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,200
let's go then.

288
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,590
I'm curious to see

289
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,680
what this genius

290
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,920
looks like.

291
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,720
[It's a woman?]

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,110
-Pavilion Master.
-Pavilion Master.

293
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,790
You are the

294
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,920
newly admitted Alchemist who wants to see me?

295
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Qin Chen,

296
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,070
this is our Pavilion Master, Xiao Ya.

297
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,750
Come on, greet her now.

298
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,680
Greetings, Miss Xiao.

299
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,070
What a young hero.

300
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,680
You're a Grade One Alchemist

301
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
at such a young age.

302
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,960
I heard that you want to do business with us.

303
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,310
I wonder what exactly it is

304
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,830
that requires me to do personally.

305
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,400
There's no hurry, Miss Xiao.

306
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,070
Why don't you let Master Liu Guang

307
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,590
take out the Grade One Vital Dans I refined

308
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,640
to let you evaluate?

309
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,590
Okay then.

310
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,640
Let's see if the Dan medicine you refined

311
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,920
is as good as what Liu Guang said.

312
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,480
Special Class Dan medicine.

313
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,640
Work of nature.

314
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,000
Flawless in every way.

315
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,270
Miss Xiao,

316
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
Would you mind evaluating its efficacy?

317
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,880
It's just Vital Dan.

318
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,750
Are they anything different?

319
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,880
What?

320
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,750
Pavilion Master!

321
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,110
Pavilion Master, what happened to you?

322
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,070
Could there be something wrong with the Dan?

323
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,790
Qin Chen, what did you do to Pavilion Master?

324
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm okay.

325
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,350
Miss Xiao,

326
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,440
I think you've felt it, haven't you?

327
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,550
How did you do that?

328
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,000
I just made some improvements

329
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,350
to the refining methods.

330
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,510
I've optimized the ratio of crude drugs too.

331
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,400
How can changing the refining method

332
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,880
increase the efficacy by one fold?

333
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,640
-What?
-This…

334
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,030
Same materials,

335
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,590
but with double efficacy?

336
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,110
How is this possible?

337
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,030
You guys

338
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,550
have a taste as well.

339
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:14,980
Yes.

340
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,640
-Yes.
-Yes.

341
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,400
How could there be Vital Dans
with such strong efficacy?

342
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,310
The efficacy of one

343
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,960
is more than two common ones.

344
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,400
It it absorbed must faster than common ones.

345
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,750
If this kind of Dan medicine can
circulate on the market,

346
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,110
it's enough to disrupt the entire
Dan medicine market of the Xuan.

347
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,510
Qin Chen,

348
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,310
are you really planning to

349
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,480
let us operate this kind of Dan medicine?

350
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,310
Tell us your idea.

351
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,160
Dan Pavilion will handle all the crude drugs

352
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,830
and refining costs.

353
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,350
I want fifty percent of the profits.

354
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,720
You don't provide crude drugs

355
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,920
or participate in refining,

356
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,400
but you want fifty percent of the profits?

357
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,960
You call this cooperation?

358
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,590
This is a robbery!

359
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,880
Vital Dans' profits are small.

360
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,350
We provide both materials and labor,

361
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,680
and you want fifty percent profits?

362
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,830
This is really too much.

363
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,480
Your Dan medicine is good,

364
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,880
but Dan Pavilion won't necessarily
make too much profit.

365
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,590
Who said there's only

366
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,550
the Grade One Vital Dan in our deal?

367
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,270
What do you mean?

368
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,920
I have an ancient formula

369
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,830
of Grade Two Vital Dan.

370
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,640
I wonder if you're interested.

371
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,920
What did you say?

372
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,680
Here's the formula.

373
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,270
Miss Xiao, you can take a look.

374
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,960
Pavilion Master, is this formula real?

375
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,350
If it is real,

376
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,000
our Dan Pavilion will be rich!

377
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,400
It looks quite authentic.

378
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,510
If this Dan medicine is really
as effective as he says,

379
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,350
once it's put into production,

380
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,400
not only the Xuan Kingdom,

381
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,310
but also the entire Vital Dan market
of the five northwest kingdoms,

382
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,510
will be seriously impacted.

383
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,110
What?

384
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,000
Have you made up your mind, Miss Xiao?

385
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,590
If you're really not satisfied,

386
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,750
let's not waste each other's time.

387
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,590
Hold on.

388
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,640
If this formula is truly

389
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,440
as great as you said,

390
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,310
I can make this decision.

391
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,350
It's just that

392
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,880
the profit share…

393
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,440
As far as I know,

394
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,880
all the Dan medicine markets of the Xuan

395
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,440
are currently controlled by Dan Pavilion, right?

396
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,510
I think

397
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,070
The Treasure-gathering House must want to

398
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,160
join the party very much.

399
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,270
You should know this very well, Miss Xiao.

400
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,400
And a fifty-fifty partnership brings

401
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
considerable profits to you.

402
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,440
Young as you may be,

403
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,750
you know the Dan medicine market so well.

404
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,510
Okay.

405
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,510
I agree.

406
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,310
How clever you are, Miss Xiao.

407
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,830
Aren't you afraid that we'd break the agreement

408
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,920
after we get our hands on the formula?

409
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,350
It's just Grade Two Dan medicine.

410
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,880
Nothing precious.

411
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,480
I believe that

412
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,680
Miss Xiao isn't that type of person.

413
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,880
This formula can disrupt the

414
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,350
Dan medicine market of five kingdoms.

415
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,720
-And this isn't precious?
-What…

416
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,200
I was just kidding.

417
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,030
Dan Pavilion

418
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,400
always honors its words.

419
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,680
Our word is our bond.

420
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,400
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

421
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,030
For this cooperation, apart from this formula,

422
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,830
I'd like to let you help me refine a few Dans.

423
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,000
These are the needed crude drugs.

424
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,000
These are all

425
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,960
crude drugs rarely seen on the market.

426
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,790
And they're big in quantity.

427
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,200
They'll be hard to acquire.

428
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,200
When do you need them?

429
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,880
In about ten days.

430
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,960
When you've collected them all,

431
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,830
just send someone to notify me.

432
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,960
Chen Mu.

433
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,310
Yes.

434
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,030
Ouyang Cheng.

435
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,510
Yes.

436
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,830
Prepare all the crude drugs in this formula

437
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,400
and send them to my refinery room.

438
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,480
Yes!

439
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,830
Liu Guang,

440
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,270
check the background of this Qin Chen.

441
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,510
Yes.

442
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,070
Pavilion Master

443
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,480
must have started refining, I presume?

444
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,830
I wonder if this formula is authentic or not.

445
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,750
Let's wait for a while.

446
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,510
For a stove of Grade Two Vital Dans,

447
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,270
we shall see the results in one hour.

448
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,200
Pavilion Master comes out so soon?

449
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,880
Could the formula be fake?

450
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,310
Who said it's fake?

451
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,790
But we've been waiting here for just a while.

452
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,640
How can you finish refining so fast?

453
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,590
See for yourselves.

454
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,960
This…

455
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,160
How could there be such formidable Vital Dans!

456
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,920
Pavilion Master,

457
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,000
I've checked the background of Qin Chen.

458
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,720
He is the grandson of King of Might.

459
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,920
He didn't awaken his bloodline

460
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,070
until only few days ago.

461
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,830
Then he won the Champion of Academy Examination.

462
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,350
He's now a legendary figure in the Capital.

463
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,680
Whoever is behind him

464
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,440
must be extraordinary.

465
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,350
You mean…

466
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,640
You don't really believe that

467
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,720
a young man like him can possess

468
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,270
such a rare ancient formula, do you?

469
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,310
There must be someone behind him.

470
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,110
Do you mean

471
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,750
King of Might?

472
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,200
Powerful as King of Might may be,

473
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,830
he's just so in the Xuan Kingdom.

474
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,030
The one behind him

475
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,880
is absolutely beyond the level of five kingdoms.

476
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,110
The legend goes that

477
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,110
Qin Yuechi, the daughter of King of Might,

478
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,920
defied an imperial edict

479
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,960
and ran away from her family.

480
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,350
Later, she gave birth to a child unmarried.

481
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,400
The man to whom such a woman lost her heart

482
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,790
can't be a simple one.

483
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,920
Now that I think about this,

484
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,070
he's truly something else.

485
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,200
Come on, move it over there.

486
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,880
Chen, why are you home so late?

487
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,550
-If you come back a little later,
-Be careful.

488
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,310
I'd ask Chief Zuo to look for you.

489
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:03,920
Mom,

490
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,750
this is the Capital, after all.

491
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,720
How can anything happen to me?

492
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,400
You were assassinated just yesterday.

493
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,550
Today you've been missing for a whole day.

494
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,590
How can I not worry about you?

495
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,750
They actually sent killers

496
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,350
to assassinate us.

497
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,160
I've written to your grandpa.

498
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,720
I'm not going to

499
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
let this go so easily.
