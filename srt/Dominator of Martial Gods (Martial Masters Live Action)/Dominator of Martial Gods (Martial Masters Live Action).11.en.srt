[Episode 11]

19
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,350
Who's there?

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,560
Chen.

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,630
Mom, why are you here?

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,630
It's cold outside. Come in.

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,000
Mom.

24
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,430
Why are your hands so cold?

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
You must've been outside for quite a while.

26
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm okay.

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm just too happy

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,470
to fall asleep today.

29
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,030
I suddenly remembered so many things.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,150
When you were three,

31
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,120
you fell into the pond in the mansion.

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,470
When they got you out,

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,190
you were already unconscious.

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,000
I was so worried then.

35
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,710
I took you right away to

36
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,280
Xuanyi Pharmacy to get medicine.

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,870
But

38
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,750
you didn't wake up until the next day.

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,400
Mom,

40
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,960
you remembered it wrong.

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,120
When I fell into the pond, I was already five.

42
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,280
And I lay in bed unconscious for three days.

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,910
You were waiting by my side for three days.

44
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,840
When I woke up, the first thing I saw was that

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,470
you were so tired
that you leaned on the bedside.

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,400
I clearly remember that

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,310
while you were sleeping,

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,800
you cried in your dreams.

49
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,710
I secretly vowed that

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,310
I'd never let Mom drop another tear again.

51
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,560
That's right.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,630
I remembered it wrong.

53
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,960
You had no idea

54
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,560
how scared I was.

55
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,360
Scared of losing you.

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,630
Mom,

57
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,120
you must be too tired lately.

58
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,150
That's why you couldn't remember clearly.

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,870
And I didn't fall into the pond

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,360
accidentally by myself.

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,400
It's Qin Fen

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,910
who deliberately tripped me into it.

63
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,240
Thankfully Ying found it early

64
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,150
and told the servants to get me out timely,

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,190
and that's how I managed to survive.

66
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,750
Zhao Feng and her son

67
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,120
have been despising us since I was little.

68
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,190
That's why I vowed that

69
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,870
I had to be strong

70
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,800
and enter Star Academy through hard training.

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,190
When I was injured by Wei Zhen,

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,190
I suddenly felt like something
had clicked in me.

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,830
I could understand what I couldn't before.

74
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,750
And my bloodline was awakened.

75
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,310
I heard that

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
some people are late bloomers.

77
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,000
They achieve nothing when they're young.

78
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,240
But after a certain event,

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,160
things suddenly make sense for them,

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,630
and their cultivation will advance so rapidly.

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,310
Chen, this might be your case.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,630
I think you're right.

83
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,950
And I'll get stronger and stronger

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,190
to protect Mom.

85
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,270
As long as you're fine,

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,800
I'll be satisfied.

87
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't want wealth or fame.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,270
I just want you to be safe.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,630
Chen,

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
your cultivation just got higher.

91
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,270
[Mom isn't a cultivator.]

92
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,920
[How did she tell that I made a breakthrough?]

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,240
I…

94
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,190
Just felt that

95
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,750
your aura looked different.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's why I took this guess.

97
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,310
But Chen,

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,800
I heard that

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
Bloodmist Holy Land

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,040
is a miraculous place.

101
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,190
The stronger your body is,
the more you'll benefit from it.

102
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,430
I didn't expect that

103
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,190
the Xuan Kingdom would be willing to offer

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,920
the chance of entering there as your reward.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,190
You must take this chance.

106
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,750
Okay, I understand.

107
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,480
But Mom,

108
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,920
how do you know so much about cultivation?

109
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,270
I'm the daughter of Qin Batian,
King of Might, after all.

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,830
I grew up under his influence.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,510
Alright,

112
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,070
I'll leave you to it now.

113
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,360
Rest well.

114
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,510
Take a good rest.

115
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Mom was deliberately saying things wrong.

116
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,240
She must have sensed my changes lately.

117
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
Thank god I gave her a good explanation.

118
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,480
Although Chen looks different from before,

119
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,070
I'm happy as long as he's still my Chen.

120
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,270
This should be the place where

121
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,360
Qin Yuechi and Qin Chen live.

122
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,430
Who would've thought

123
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,070
the daughter of King of Might

124
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,040
actually lives here?

125
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,920
Tonight will be the night they die.

126
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,270
Stay sharp.

127
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,360
I want these two
to disappear in the world tonight.

128
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,680
Nothing can go wrong!

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,430
Yes!

130
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,680
This is…

131
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,510
Why does this mysterious ancient sword

132
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,920
suddenly show itself before me?

133
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,270
This is…

134
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,550
This is my Thunder Bloodline.

135
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,840
[What exactly is this mysterious ancient sword?]

136
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,240
[Why is my bloodline]

137
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,720
[absorbing the power in it?]

138
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,750
What's that noise?

139
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,550
What happened to me?

140
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,080
My spiritual power has become
much more sensitive than before.

141
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,390
Indeed,

142
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,240
cultivating spiritual power is very difficult,

143
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,840
otherwise, Medicine Refiners,
Instrument Refiners,

144
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,960
and Bloodline Masters

145
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,960
won't be so few in this world.

146
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:46,960
Remember,

147
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
Qin Yuechi and Qin Chen

148
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,120
are living in this house.

149
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,390
Wait for my order. As soon as I give a signal,

150
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,320
strike immediately!

151
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,240
Kill them both with confirmed deaths.

152
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,000
Understand?

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,550
Yes!

154
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,320
You two,

155
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,750
go outflank them from the rear door.

156
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,440
You two,

157
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,200
go block the left and right wings.

158
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,030
Where's Shadow Five?

159
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,390
He fell into the well.

160
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,240
I'm here!

161
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,150
Useless.

162
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,240
The rest of you, follow me.

163
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,080
-Move.
-Move.

164
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
What about me?

165
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Where do I go?

166
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,840
Looks like

167
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,480
someone already can't wait.

168
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,750
Luckily, I'm well prepared.

169
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,910
Go.

170
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,390
Including Qin,

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,120
there are eight of them in total.

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,270
Why do I feel that this place is kind of creepy?

173
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,360
So dark.

174
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,550
I can't see the road at all.

175
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,960
Who's there?

176
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,630
What's wrong, Shadow Three?

177
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,440
I feel like someone's with us.

178
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,600
Who else is here

179
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,840
except us?

180
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,440
Are you sure about that?

181
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,550
Stop joking.

182
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,360
Let me sense with my spiritual power.

183
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,200
Guess I was being paranoid.

184
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,240
I know where it is.

185
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,270
It must be the woman in your head!

186
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,440
Three, how can you hit me without reason?

187
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,790
Shut up. Stop calling me Three. It's gross.

188
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,200
Was I really overthinking?

189
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
Let's separate and hurry up.

190
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,550
We may have some time left

191
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,390
for a midnight snack.

192
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,670
It's me alone again.

193
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,440
There's not a single soul in here.

194
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,200
Something's off.

195
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,750
This sword is coated with a black varnish.

196
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,080
No wonder it reflects no light in the dark.

197
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,200
Mr. Qin,

198
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,360
it's getting late.

199
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,440
You

200
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,480
should rest now.

201
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,200
Leave me, please.

202
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
Yuechi,

203
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,960
don't blame me.

204
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,870
I don't have any other choices.

205
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,870
We've already come to this.

206
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,750
There's no return now.

207
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,750
Things developed so fast.

208
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,200
Nobody, even I,

209
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,870
would see this coming.

210
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,630
Who would've expected that this time's target

211
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,510
is actually Miss Yuechi from the Qin family?

212
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,840
King of Might is a formidable one.

213
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,750
When his daughter and grandson are killed,

214
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,150
the Capital will face a storm of blood.

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,080
But it's kinda exciting to think of it, though.

216
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,870
I heard that

217
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,120
Miss Yuechi of the Qin family

218
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,440
used to be the most beautiful woman
in the Xuan Kingdom.

219
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,200
Maybe tonight,

220
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
I'll have a surprise of some sort.

221
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,080
Who's there?

222
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,910
Shadow Four, how come you're here?

223
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,240
Over there.

224
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
What's going on?

225
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,240
No, you're not Shadow Four.

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,870
[Second one.]

227
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,440
[Thankfully, I was prepared.]

228
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,240
[I set up the array in advance]

229
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,960
[and hid my mom's room.]

230
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,790
[Otherwise,]

231
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,200
[my mom and I]

232
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,120
[would've been killed by you.]

233
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,030
[Third one.]

234
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,880
[What's going on?]

235
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,510
[Why is there another one on the ground?]

236
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,680
[Who exactly did this?]

237
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,750
Now.

238
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,830
There's nobody in bed!

239
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,960
Where did they go?

240
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,830
Go out!

241
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,200
Where are the rest of our men?

242
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,030
Why are they so quiet?

243
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,310
Go. To Qin Yuechi's room.

244
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,200
Someone's there!

245
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,790
It's Shadow Three.

246
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,790
Dammit. Who exactly did it?

247
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,480
Could we be ambushed?

248
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,070
Things around us

249
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,680
seem kind of creepy.

250
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
These top killers

251
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,160
were actually killed without making a sound.

252
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,030
Could there be a Heaven Level cultivator here?

253
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,070
As far as I know,

254
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,070
only Qin Yuechi and her son are here.

255
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,350
What exactly is going on?

256
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,830
Who is here?

257
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,480
Come out if you dare.

258
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,880
Considering the character of Madam,

259
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,680
if I failed this mission,

260
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,400
she'll never go easy on me.

261
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,400
Go check in Qin Yuechi's room.

262
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,510
We'll retreat if there's no one in there.

263
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,350
Sir,

264
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,400
there's an ambush ahead.

265
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,310
Who's there?

266
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,000
Seems to be Shadow Four.

267
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,480
Shadow Four, how did you get hurt?

268
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,680
What happened?

269
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Sir, there's an ambush ahead.

270
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,830
No, this person…

271
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,750
You're not Shadow Four.

272
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,070
It's you!

273
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,750
It's actually you.

274
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,070
Mom.

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,590
Mom, how did it go?

276
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,720
Is Qin Chen dead?

277
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,680
Fen, just sleep tight.

278
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,070
When you wake up,

279
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,920
there won't be Qin Chen
and Qin Yuechi in this world.

280
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,030
Bringing so many people here at midnight,

281
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
weren't you being too ceremonial?

282
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,640
Qin,

283
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,680
you actually hid your strength so well.

284
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,030
Do you think you can defeat me

285
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,880
even though you killed them?

286
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,550
Magic tricks will get you nowhere.

287
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,200
Today's the day you die!

288
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,480
Yaksha Soul Body: Star-Picking Fist!

289
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,070
He's strong.

290
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,880
He killed all my men.

291
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,830
This kid is too weird.

292
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,960
I can't underestimate him.

293
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,830
How can't I, a top Earth Level cultivator,

294
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,550
kill a boy like him?

295
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,880
Blood Boost Pill?

296
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,200
Little rascal,

297
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,350
let's see how you'll block this!

298
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,960
Thunder Bloodline!

299
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,590
I've even used Blood Boost Pill,

300
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,550
but I still can't kill him?

301
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,480
If I don't kill him today,

302
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,680
I'll definitely be the dead one some other day.

303
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,590
Who's there?

304
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,920
Killing people in the middle of the night?
Take him down!

305
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,550
Yes!

306
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,830
The Capital City Guards?

307
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,350
How could they be here?

308
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,110
How dare you keep committing crimes?

309
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,750
Go to hell!

310
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,200
He's so strong.

311
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,680
Mr. Qin, I'm sorry

312
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,880
for being late.

313
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,000
You are…

314
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,960
I'm Zuo Li, Deputy Chief of the City Guard.

315
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,590
By order of Lord Kang,

316
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm to guard the west of the city these days.

317
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,440
But I still came late.

318
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,480
Please forgive me, Mr. Qin.

319
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,310
You came just in time.

320
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,400
This man was just trying to kill me.
Take him down.

321
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,640
Guards!

322
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,030
Take this assassin down!

323
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,310
And interrogate him!

324
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,750
Chief Zuo, this guy isn't easy to deal with.

325
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,960
Qin Chen,

326
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,680
whoever is here to help,

327
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,640
can't save you.

328
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,640
You have a death wish!

329
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,590
Chief Zuo was having a hard time.

330
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,030
He isn't the assassin's match at all.

331
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,350
[If Zuo Li loses, things will get tricky.]

332
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,750
[By then, I can only do this by myself.]

333
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,830
[But once I did it,]

334
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,000
[I'll expose more of my hidden strength.]

335
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,510
[This may attract unnecessary attention.]

336
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,790
[I have an idea.]

337
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,960
Chief Zuo, hit his left rib area.

338
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,200
This man's fist moves are flawless.

339
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,480
I couldn't penetrate his defense
even with my full strength.

340
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,240
But now I did it with one blow.

341
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,510
Impressive.

342
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,590
Guide your energy down the diaphragm,

343
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,400
and concentrate it at the Shaoyang meridian.

344
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,350
And try to rotate it like stars.

345
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,680
When I guided my energy as Mr. Qin told me,

346
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,640
I felt my vital energy was circulating smoothly.

347
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,160
What's going on?

348
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,480
[Damn.]

349
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,030
[My Star-Picking Fist is nearly flawless.]

350
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
[But my left rib area was once injured.]

351
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,160
[That's why my fists on the left
weren't as good.]

352
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,160
[But how did he tell?]

353
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,110
[No.]

354
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,200
[Seems like I can't kill him today.]

355
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,480
[If this goes on,]

356
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,160
[I'll be dead in here.]

357
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,110
[I'd better leave first.]

358
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,750
There's no escape!

359
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Do you think you can stop me?

360
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,510
Qin Chen, I'll spare your lowly life today.

361
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,030
I'll kill you some other day.

362
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,830
Where is he?

363
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,400
I'm here.

364
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,240
You can't escape.

365
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,480
How could Qin be defeated so easily

366
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,400
when even Chief Zuo couldn't get the upper hand?

367
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
How unbelievable.

368
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,790
Thanks for your help tonight.

369
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,310
If not for you, gentlemen,

370
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,350
my mother and I could be in danger.

371
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,550
I thank you

372
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,750
for doing this.

373
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,640
You are most welcome.

374
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,750
[If not for Mr. Qin,]

375
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,790
[the few of us]

376
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,310
[could have been killed by Qin.]

377
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,310
[No wonder Lord Kang values him so much.]

378
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,720
[He's indeed a young hero.]

379
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,310
You've helped me today.

380
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,750
I will repay you in the future.

381
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,960
Mr. Qin, please don't say that.

382
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,000
This is simply my duty.

383
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,070
I'm just doing my job.

384
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,070
Please don't decline yet, Chief Zuo.

385
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,030
As far as I can tell,

386
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,550
your meridians

387
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,000
seem to be injured, right?

388
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,510
They should be caused when you were trying to

389
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,640
advance to Heaven Level.

390
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,310
When I have free time,

391
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,070
I can help you treat them.

392
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,160
Mr. Qin, how did you tell?

393
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,550
Back then, Chief Zuo was praised as

394
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,310
the chief who was the most likely
to advance to Heaven Level.

395
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,880
Shame his meridians were damaged five years ago.

396
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,480
His cultivation has never progressed since then.

397
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,070
Nobody could treat him.

398
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,000
Chief Zuo already gave up.

399
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,400
But you're saying that you can treat him?

400
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,920
Mr. Qin…

401
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,550
Mr. Qin, can my condition really be cured?

402
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,030
It's just meridian injuries,

403
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,550
not terminal.

404
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,640
Why can't they be cured?

405
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,880
-I… I don't know how…
-Chief Zuo.

406
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,720
Chief Zuo,

407
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,310
it's getting late.

408
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,160
I will help you with it

409
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,110
when I have free time.

410
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,720
Could you ask your men

411
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,790
to clean this courtyard first?

412
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,480
Yeah, sure.

413
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,790
You guys, clean this courtyard for me.

414
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,590
Yes.

415
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,070
Mom?

416
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,200
Chen, what happened?

417
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,720
Who are these people?

418
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,790
Just now, Qin broke in with these bandits,

419
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,440
trying to hurt you and me.

420
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,000
Luckily Chief Zuo arrived in time

421
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
and took care of them.

422
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,720
It's Zhao Feng again.

423
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,400
How could she be so vicious?

424
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,240
Chen, are you okay?

425
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,830
Mom, don't worry.

426
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,070
I'm fine.

427
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,440
Chief Zuo.

428
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,030
Mr. Qin.

429
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,350
Could it be that

430
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,110
you recognized these people?

431
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,680
They were assassins from Shadow-Slay House.

432
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,350
Shadow-Slay House is a killers' organization.

433
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
They live on assassinations.

434
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,310
Imperial families of the five northwest kingdoms

435
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,750
all want to get rid of them for good.

436
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,440
But this organization is too mysterious.

437
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,310
Nobody knows where their headquarters is.

438
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,510
Those were

439
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,720
just level C assassins.

440
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,550
I heard that

441
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,720
Shadow-Slay House never stops before success.

442
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,310
Mr. Qin,

443
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,590
you have to be careful in the future.

444
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,640
Shadow-Slay House?

445
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,510
They tried to attack the princess, too.

446
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,880
What does this Zhao Feng have to do

447
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,200
with Shadow-Slay House?

448
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,110
[Level C killers from Shadow-Slay House]

449
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,000
[are at least Earth Level elites]

450
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,400
[with deadly skills each.]

451
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,310
[But they were actually wiped out in one go.]

452
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,350
[And they were all killed with one strike.]

453
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
[There wasn't any trace of resistance on them.]

454
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,790
[This doesn't make any sense.]

455
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,160
Mr. Qin,

456
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,590
since the assassins were all killed,

457
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,960
you and Lady Qin

458
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,790
should go rest early.

459
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,310
I'll take my leave.

460
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,480
Mom, go back to sleep now.

461
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,550
I still have something to ask Chief Zuo.

462
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,510
Okay.

463
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,310
Chief Zuo, may I have a word with you?

464
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,240
Mr. Qin, how can I help?
