[Episode 24]

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,310
Mr. Xiao Zhan…

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,310
You two are okay now.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,950
How did you

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,400
get all these injuries?

23
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,590
Cao Heng from the Zhao did this.

24
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,190
If we didn't react fast

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,000
and crush the plates in time,

26
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,710
we would have died in there.

27
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,840
Cao Heng!

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Great.

29
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,590
Prince Heng did great.

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,030
Sadly,

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,710
he hit too lightly

32
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,400
and didn't kill the two losers.

33
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,000
What did you say?

34
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,150
The Trial of Life And Death

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,240
is to rule out the ones who can't survive.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,960
Being eliminated,

37
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,750
you can only blame it on your lack of skills,

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,680
not others.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
If our Zhao people are eliminated,

40
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,280
Instead of

41
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,430
comforting them,

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,240
I will severely punish them.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,840
Crying after being eliminated,

44
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,870
do you think you are a three-year-old?

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,710
What a shame!

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,240
You go back to rest.

47
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,590
Yes.

48
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,710
Yes.

49
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,310
King of Lingwu…

50
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,680
See? How embarrassing.

51
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,400
King of Lingwu.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,030
Your Highness.

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,520
It's only been six hours,

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,960
and so many people of the Xuan

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
have been ruled out.

56
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,840
King of Lingwu.

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,870
Almost all of them are knocked out by

58
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,870
the Zhao people
and those from the Ghost Immortal Sect.

59
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,240
Looks like this
Competition of Five Kingdoms is not peaceful.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,920
The Zhao

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,360
allied with the Ghost Immortal Sect
to target the Xuan people so much.

62
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,800
Then after five days,

63
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,630
how many of them will be left?

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,950
I just hope that

65
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,270
the disputes between the Xuan and the Zhao

66
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,360
will not affect us.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,680
There are so many people transported out.

68
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,000
How many of our apprentices
did not even have time

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040
to crush the jade plate?

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
The first.

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,430
The third.

72
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,360
This trial area is too big.

73
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,920
So far,

74
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,750
a total of eleven people
of the Zhao have been knocked out.

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,360
However, I have not encountered

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,920
those few geniuses of the Zhao again.

77
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,870
Where did those guys go?

78
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,430
Why is she here?

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,190
Pervert!

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,870
I finally found you.

81
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,830
You have nowhere to escape to!

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,630
Qin Chen,

83
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
You took advantage of me
in the Bloodmist Holy Land,

84
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,870
and I will punish you severely,
you philanderer!

85
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,190
I told you,

86
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,680
it was an accident that day!

87
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,950
Why don't you believe me?

88
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,390
Accident?

89
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,870
Do you think I will believe you?

90
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,830
Believe it or not,

91
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,390
it was an accident.

92
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
Moreover,

93
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,480
I really didn't see anything.

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,600
Why do you have to make a big deal out of it?

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,950
Make a big deal out of it?

96
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,560
You ruined my reputation,

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,950
and now you call me fussy?

98
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,430
I won't waste my breath with you.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,040
I won't kill you today.

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,310
You can escape death

101
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,480
but not the punishment.

102
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,070
From now on,

103
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,430
don't think about
practicing martial arts again

104
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,750
so as not to harm others, perv!

105
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,830
Grade Three magic weapon!

106
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,160
You dodged it!

107
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,600
Damn this guy.

108
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,870
Fairy Scattering Blossoms!

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,070
Nice sword skills.

110
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,950
You are doomed

111
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,870
but still have the mind
to evaluate my sword skills.

112
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,560
You are so ignorant.

113
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,120
Sadly,

114
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
you did act like a fairy,

115
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,800
but the blossoms didn't seem to work.

116
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you know?

117
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,040
Even my father

118
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,390
couldn't stop praising this move of mine.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,240
Who does he think he is?

120
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,160
Are you trying to die?

121
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,510
Hurry up and dodge it!

122
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,310
It's about time.

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,750
My Fairy Scattering Blossoms

124
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,310
was cracked by him!

125
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,360
Great opportunity!

126
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,510
He got away!

127
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,240
I got distracted for a moment just now.

128
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
He is unforgivable!

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Speaking of which,

130
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,000
he didn't take the chance to attack me.

131
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,670
Otherwise…

132
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,630
[On careful reflection,]

133
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,200
[although Qin Chen's
finger attack was simple,]

134
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,960
[the Sword Essence contained in it]

135
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,630
[was actually more profound
than the Sword Essence I had mastered]

136
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,630
[after ten years of hard practice.]

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,750
Do you think you can run away?

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,080
Back then, my father also took part in
setting up the preliminary test array

139
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,960
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms,

140
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,390
so isn't it so easy

141
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,120
to track you down?

142
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,200
How did he disappear?

143
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,910
Ugh.

144
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,080
This brat ran away again.

145
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,270
Tracking me?

146
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,550
No way.

147
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,720
Princesses,

148
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,150
it's Chen!

149
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,150
Qin Chen,

150
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,480
why are you here?

151
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,200
Why can't I be here?

152
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Qin Chen,

153
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,670
the Zhao martial artists

154
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,600
are now targeting our Xuan people.

155
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Are you okay?

156
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,630
You don't need to ask that.

157
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,080
If those Zhao people dare to

158
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,480
try to hurt Chen,

159
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm afraid they have now

160
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,910
died under Chen's sword.

161
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,960
Chen,

162
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,320
let's go together.

163
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,910
No one wants to be with him.

164
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,270
Zixun,

165
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,270
now the Zhao people are hunting down

166
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,750
our people everywhere.

167
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,840
We are in dire need of unity.

168
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,150
And

169
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,030
Qin Chen is not what you think.

170
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
I don't think he looks like a good person.

171
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Lingshan,

172
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,550
don't be fooled by him.

173
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,840
Zixun,

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
I have told you so many times

175
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,240
that things are not what you think.

176
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,390
Besides,

177
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,670
Qin Chen is at least
the champion of the year-end test.

178
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,630
With us all together,

179
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,910
our safety will be better guaranteed.

180
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,550
He can even get lost
in the Bloodmist Holy Land.

181
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,720
What can he be capable of?

182
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,030
No, uh…

183
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,200
Qin Chen is already very powerful

184
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,630
to have his current cultivation.

185
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,510
Fine.

186
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,150
Since you all want to,

187
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
let's go together.

188
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,030
Chen,

189
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,670
let's go.

190
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,200
Go!

191
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,630
Come on.

192
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,320
Qin Chen,

193
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,840
don't mind what happened earlier.

194
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,960
Although Zixun is a bit arrogant,

195
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,080
she's not a bad person.

196
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
Qin Chen, what are you doing?

197
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,030
Who is that?

198
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,790
Don't hide anymore.

199
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,960
Come out.

200
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,670
It really surprises me

201
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,080
that you can perceive

202
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,270
my attack.

203
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,960
Damn brat,

204
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,960
it's you again.

205
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,750
You won't get away this time!

206
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,550
Cao Heng, Nian Wuji!

207
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,750
What do you want!

208
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
What do you think?

209
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,320
Your Highness,

210
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
we came across the princesses

211
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
of the Xuan today.

212
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,910
We are so lucky!

213
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,150
Enough!

214
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,910
The princesses of the Xuan

215
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,600
are no objects of your covetousness!

216
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,750
They are only for me

217
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,240
and Mr. Nian to enjoy!

218
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
I apologize, Your Highness.

219
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,320
I spoke recklessly.

220
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,240
However,

221
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,480
after Mr. Nian and I have enough fun,

222
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,510
you

223
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,440
can also try.

224
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,960
Your Highness,
you and Mr. Nian enjoy the big shares,

225
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,600
and we are satisfied with some leftovers.

226
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,630
That's right!

227
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,360
You barbarians!

228
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,030
This one is feisty.

229
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,600
I like her.

230
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,360
You!

231
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,030
Zixun, don't act rashly.

232
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,320
Chen,

233
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,720
we are outnumbered.

234
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,200
Shall we retreat first?

235
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,630
As a last resort,

236
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,720
we can give up the assessment.

237
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
Nian Wuji and Cao Heng are top geniuses,

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,120
especially Nian Wuji,

239
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,670
who has already broken through
to the middle stage of Heaven level.

240
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,870
They came prepared this time.

241
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,000
Everyone, be very careful.

242
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,670
Lin Tian,

243
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,960
put away your jade plate.

244
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,840
The transporting jade plate
should have been deactivated.

245
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,200
What?

246
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,630
They are so arrogant and fearless.

247
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,120
Don't you think it's strange
that they don't care

248
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,630
if we crush the jade plates?

249
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,200
Brat,

250
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
you are quite insightful.

251
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,270
This area has been sealed off

252
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,550
by us with an array.

253
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,240
You

254
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
can no longer be transported out.

255
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,720
No way!

256
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,840
Your Highness,

257
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,600
let's not waste our breath with them.

258
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,790
Capture them first.

259
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,670
Now we can only fight to the death.

260
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,480
When there is a chance,

261
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,150
try to find a way to escape by yourself.

262
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,150
Zhao Lingshan,

263
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,910
I am your opponent.

264
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,790
Cao Heng, you scum!

265
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,240
You are pretty fierce. I like you.

266
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,960
Peerless Sword Seal!

267
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,550
Grade Three Ice Bloodline,

268
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,790
not bad.

269
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,830
Ethereal Spirit Bloodline?

270
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,750
That's right.

271
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,310
It is exactly the Ethereal Spirit Bloodline
of my Cao family of the Zhao,

272
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,070
a Grade Three Bloodline.

273
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,640
Sword Seal!

274
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,750
Meteor!

275
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,640
Shoot!

276
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,310
Damn it!

277
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,960
Lingshan!

278
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,920
I am your opponent!

279
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,480
Watch out, Zixun!

280
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,480
Get out of the way!

281
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,070
Let me do it.

282
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,640
Guys,

283
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,400
attack!

284
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,880
I really didn't expect

285
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,590
you to dodge my Saber Energy,

286
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,920
but

287
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,550
this is the most you can do.

288
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,550
Split Heaven

289
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,070
from Earth!

290
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,070
Thunder Flash!

291
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,440
What?

292
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,920
Guys!

293
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,200
Let's deploy the battle array

294
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,000
and kill Qin Chen!

295
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,440
A battle array?

296
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,200
Brat!

297
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,830
It is your honor to die under

298
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,480
our Five Elements Annihilation Great Array.

299
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,310
Die!

300
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,440
Damn it.

301
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,200
This is not the way to go.

302
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,270
We have to break their array first.

303
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,160
What a powerful battle array!

304
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,030
Our Five Elements Annihilation Great Array

305
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,400
can easily eliminate

306
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,830
Heaven-level experts.

307
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,440
I want to see

308
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,000
how you try to escape.

309
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,720
You people,

310
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,960
go to hell!

311
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,110
Princess Lingshan,

312
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,000
no matter how you resist,

313
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,960
you are bound to die.

314
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,920
It is better to succumb!

315
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,110
You monster!

316
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
I'll kill you!

317
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,240
Make it quick

318
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,960
before too much trouble gets in our way.

319
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,590
A woman like you

320
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,400
dares to try to defeat me?

321
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,680
Kid,

322
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,350
you dare to get distracted
while fighting with us?

323
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,480
It's merely a battle array.

324
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,160
Thunder…

325
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,110
Doom!

326
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh no!

327
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,510
You are dead!

328
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,550
Qin Chen, watch out!

329
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,070
How is that possible?

330
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,030
Nian Wuji is manipulating
flying knives with spirit power.

331
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,160
You can control Tangible Treasures.

332
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,200
I didn't expect you
to be a Bloodline Master.

333
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,070
Not bad, since you know now.

334
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:39,920
Today,

335
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,110
you're going to die!

336
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,000
My flying knives

337
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,590
are invincible
and can penetrate stone and gold.

338
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,550
You dare to catch them with your hands.

339
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,070
You are killing yourself.

340
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,350
What did you do to my knives?

341
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
Dark Nether Iron

342
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,640
is a rare material
for refining Tangible Treasures.

343
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,400
No wonder!

344
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,200
No!

345
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,400
You are also a Bloodline Master!

346
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,110
Is it my turn now?

347
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,790
How dare you steal my Tangible Treasures?

348
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,270
Go to hell!

349
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,480
I am a mid-stage Heaven-level expert.

350
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,790
How could you, an Earth-level small fry,

351
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,750
have such abundant vital energy?

352
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,590
The genius of the Ghost Immortal Sect

353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,160
is nothing but ordinary.

354
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,030
You only blocked one of my attacks.

355
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,160
What are you so cocky about?

356
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,550
You have successfully enraged me!

357
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,110
Thunder Doom!

358
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,590
Let me break your array first.

359
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,480
My father had the array

360
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,000
specially refined by an array master.

361
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Do you think you can

362
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,200
break the array with your weak power?

363
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,960
You are delusional.

364
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,920
No way!

365
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,550
Once the Confinement Array is formed,

366
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,000
even Mystery level masters

367
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,160
can't break it.

368
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,110
How did he do it?

369
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,790
You two crush your jade plates
and leave first.

370
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,790
Zixun,

371
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,880
take mine.

372
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,310
No!

373
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,400
I'm not leaving.

374
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,400
You don't have a jade plate.

375
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,550
Once we are gone, how will you leave?

376
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,440
Chen!

377
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,830
Damn it!

378
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,240
You should leave too.

379
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,070
I'll get out of here

380
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,310
and get help.

381
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,720
Wanna run?

382
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,200
I don't think so.

383
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,070
Stop!

384
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,640
This woman…

385
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,160
Since the preliminary test started,

386
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,550
it has been three days.

387
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,110
Half of the Xuan people are out.

388
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,680
If the remaining ones

389
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,880
are still in the trial, it would be fine,

390
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,480
but if they die in it…

391
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,790
King of Lingwu,

392
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,200
our Xuan people

393
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,400
are being hunted down by
the Zhao people and the Ghost Immortal Sect,

394
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,640
suffering heavy casualties.

395
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,680
I don't know

396
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,680
how the princesses are doing.

397
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,310
With the strength of the princesses,

398
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,000
they should be fine to protect themselves.

399
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,790
I'm just worried…

400
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,550
Lin Tian!

401
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,750
Mr. Chu.

402
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,310
Another one from the Xuan.

403
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,550
Another one from the Xuan Kingdom.

404
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,200
How many of them are out now?

405
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,110
The Xuan people are so unlucky!

406
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,510
They did not only offend the Zhao Kingdom

407
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,830
but also the Ghost Immortal Sect.

408
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,680
How can they survive this?

409
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,960
Xiao Zhan,

410
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,070
how come it's another one of the Xuan?

411
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,400
As far as I can tell,

412
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,400
the people sent out by the Xuan

413
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,070
are all useless good-for-nothing!

414
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,070
Marquis Yuchi,

415
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,440
nearly half of the disciples of the Xuan

416
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,830
have not been eliminated yet.

417
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,440
There will

418
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
definitely be more to come.

419
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,640
Lin Tian,

420
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,590
with your strength,

421
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,200
passing the assessment
should be no problem.

422
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,070
Why are you heavily injured?

423
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,110
What exactly happened inside?

424
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,030
It was Nian Wuji.

425
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,640
And Cao Heng, too.

426
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,240
What?

427
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,400
Princess Zixun,

428
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,440
Princess Lingshan,

429
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,750
and Chen

430
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,590
are still trapped in there now.

431
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,310
Ling Zhong, Yuchi Cheng!

432
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,000
The Ghost Immortal Sect and the Zhao

433
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,790
actually brought
Space Confinement Array into the trial.

434
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,480
This is simply lawless!

435
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,510
Yeah!

436
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,790
How can they do this?

437
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,480
Why do the Zhao and Ghost Immortal Sect

438
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,030
have Array Flags to confine space?

439
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,240
What in the world

440
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,830
is going on!

441
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,640
Everyone,

442
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,160
this was done

443
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,000
by the Young Master himself only

444
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,510
and had nothing to do with
my Ghost Immortal Sect.

445
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,110
How could Nian Wuji, that rascal,

446
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,440
possibly get such an Array Flag?

447
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,920
Your Ghost Immortal Sect
must have deliberately done it!

448
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,030
You wronged me.

449
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,270
The Young Master is talented.

450
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,510
Maybe

451
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,830
he got the Array Flag

452
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,680
from some

453
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,920
ancient relics.

454
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,590
