The Mount of Demonic Ancestors

21

is full of danger,
with many blood beasts living in it.

22

23

With Blood-claw Blue Eagle's help,

25
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,520
it can save us not only a lot of time

Everyone,

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,190

32
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,960

They look unimpressive.

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,470

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,310
It should be those four.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,840
His Majesty is so unfair.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,240
Why can they enter Bloodmist Holy Land?

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,280
I don't know what His Majesty is thinking.

57
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,750

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,670
You…

190
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,790
In that case,

191
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,440
take this!

192
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,550
This…

193
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,940
He's so strong.

194
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,020
-What to do?
-He's so good.

195
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,360
Your Highness,

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,670
two of his ribs are broken.

197
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,870
That was the Saber Essence.

198
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,030
This man has mastered Saber Essence.

199
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,510
Saber Essence is a remarkable skill

200
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,840
even a Heaven-level fighter
may not master.

201
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,630
It represents the pinnacle

202
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,390
of a saberman's skills.

203
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,080
Well…

204
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,750
It should be the embryonic form
of Saber Essence.

205
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,870
But it is not far

206
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
from it.

207
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,150
Who else wants to challenge?

208
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,000
Me!

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,220
[Jiang Zhong, martial artist of the Xuan]

210
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,150
Who do you want to challenge?

211
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,790
Him.

212
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,720
Me?

213
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
This man is Qin Chen,
King of Might's grandson.

214
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,720
King of Might is the War God of the Xuan.

215
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,000
Does Jiang Zhong still want to win glory

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,240
in the army in the future?

217
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,270
There's something you don't know.

218
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Qin Chen

219
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,790
was kicked out of the Qin family.

220
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,000
And he removed

221
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,320
all martial prowess of the second son
of the Qins in the year-end test.

222
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,080
Qin Feng, the eldest son of the Qin family,

223
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,390
challenged Qin Chen to a death battle

224
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,000
as soon as he came back from the border.

225
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,440
Both of them

226
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,000
have fallen out.

227
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,080
No wonder

228
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,320
Qin Feng and Qin Chen

229
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,870
didn't come together.

230
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,000
They even didn't talk to each other.

231
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,960
With that being said,

232
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,510
Jiang Zhong is really smart.

233
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,200
If he defeats Qin Chen,

234
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
he'll help Qin Feng vent his anger.

235
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,910
It'll be beneficial

236
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,150
to his future career.

237
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,790
Overlord Fist!

238
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,790
Quadruple Overlord Fist.

239
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,030
No wonder this fellow is so confident.

240
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,440
But…

241
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,270
How can this be?

242
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,700
-It's incredible.
-It only took one blow.

243
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,300
-How is this possible?
-How are we supposed to challenge him?

244
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,700
-He's too good.
-We're no match for him.

245
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,790
So powerful.

246
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,240
It seems
that the Star Academy students this year

247
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,390
are all exceptional fighters.

248
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,750
Who else wants to continue to challenge?

249
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,840
Even Jiang Zhong was defeated by one blow.

250
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,750
If we fight,

251
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,200
we'll definitely lose.

252
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,790
No one? Great.

253
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,270
You are all young talents
of the Xuan Kingdom.

254
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,630
You should think about

255
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,750
how to survive
the Competition of Five Kingdoms

256
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,440
instead of fighting endlessly
among ourselves.

257
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,510
What?

258
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,510
There are casualties

259
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,910
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms?

260
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,630
Of course.

261
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
At least one-tenth of the participants die

262
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,030
in the preliminary test
of the competition each year.

263
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,120
And half of them are seriously injured.

264
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,550
In the last competition,

265
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,670
a total of 116 young martial artists

266
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,600
from our kingdom entered the competition.

267
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,240
But 17 people died

268
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
in the preliminary test alone,

269
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,320
and 39 were seriously injured.

270
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,720
In the end,

271
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,440
only 19 people made it
to the arena matches.

272
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,360
Though the five kingdoms

273
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,000
are not at war with each other,

274
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,870
there are ongoing conflicts between us.

275
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,960
Take us and the Zhao, for example.

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,240
We clash with each other

277
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,630
at the border every year.

278
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,870
Thousands or even tens of thousands

279
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,910
of soldiers died because of this.

280
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,630
And

281
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,550
not only the five kingdoms

282
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,480
will take part in the competition,

283
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,480
but there are also
some neighboring small kingdoms and sects,

284
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,510
such as the Ghost Immortal Sect,
the Sky-reaching Sect, and so on.

285
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,910
This is like a division of the forces
in the northwest.

286
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,240
The competition results

287
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,630
will also change the beneficial relationships

288
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,320
between the kingdoms.

289
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,750
I thought the Competition of Five Kingdoms

290
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,320
was just a battle for the Bloodmist Holy Land.

291
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,000
Unexpectedly,

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
it's much more complicated

293
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,870
than I thought.

294
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,150
We've wasted a lot of time.

295
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,200
Yan Huai, lead the way.

296
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,080
Yes.

297
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,120
Everyone, please follow me.

298
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,120
Unexpectedly,
the Competition of Five Kingdoms

299
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,360
is so cruel.

300
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,960
I really didn't expect that.

301
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,440
[Military camp of the Xuan Kingdom]

302
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,360
[Military camp of the Xuan Kingdom]
Three days later,

303
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,750
Bloodmist Holy Land will open up.

304
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,670
I'll send someone to notify you then.

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,240
You'll stay here to recuperate

306
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,600
for the next three days.

307
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,080
Two people in one zone.

308
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,390
Chen,

309
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,720
let's go.

310
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,550
Is this place taken?

311
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,670
No, please feel free.

312
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,120
He carries the saber with him
even during practice.

313
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,150
What a saber freak.

314
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,320
Unexpectedly,
Qin Chen has made pre-emptive moves.

315
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,240
I'll have to find another chance later.

316
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,840
I've forcibly suppressed

317
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,000
my abilities for the baptism.

318
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,120
I hope this Bloodmist Holy Land

319
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,030
won't disappoint me.

320
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,310
Someone is practicing.

321
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,440
And the sound of the saber…

322
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,000
Wang Qiming?

323
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,720
If you keep practicing like this

324
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,680
for another ten years,

325
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,110
you may not be able
to master the real Saber Essence.

326
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,070
Who is it?

327
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,750
Qin Chen.

328
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,480
What are you doing here?

329
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,200
Besides,

330
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,790
do you know saber?

331
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,310
I know a thing or two.

332
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,680
If I saw it correctly,

333
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,880
you defeated Zong Qiang
with the embryonic form of the Saber Essence.

334
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,310
And you want to master the real Saber Essence

335
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,310
from this rudimentary form.

336
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,310
But if you continue doing this,

337
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,510
your meridians will all be destroyed,

338
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,310
and you'll go astray.

339
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,200
Nonsense.

340
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,310
I thought you knew something.

341
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,110
Now it seems that

342
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,510
you don't.

343
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,000
If there's nothing else,

344
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,110
you can go now.

345
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,200
Do your Shaoyang

346
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,550
and Shaoshang acupoints on both hands

347
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,960
feel sore lately when practicing?

348
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,240
And they hurt

349
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,960
in the middle of the night?

350
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,270
You…

351
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,790
You must think your fingers hurt

352
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,680
because you've overstained them

353
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,400
after practicing
the saber-drawing technique intensively.

354
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,680
So you've started
taking a lot of painkillers.

355
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
But recently,

356
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,880
even the painkillers don't work.

357
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,720
Your fingers not only feel pain

358
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,960
but also numb.

359
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,720
How do you know?

360
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,920
It doesn't matter how I know.

361
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,030
I only know

362
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,790
if you continue doing this,

363
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
your hands

364
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,070
won't be able to hold the saber
you regard as life.

365
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,270
Fearmongering.

366
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,510
What's your point here?

367
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,400
If you don't believe me,

368
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,350
you can press

369
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,440
the Houzhui and Tianjing acupoints
on your arm.

370
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
These two acupoints are

371
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,750
in the pathway
of the Sanjiao Meridian of Hand-Shaoyang.

372
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,070
Wang Qiming,

373
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,110
your underlying disease
has spread to your arms.

374
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
If you don't treat it,

375
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,720
you'll soon become a cripple.

376
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,790
Since you don't believe me,

377
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,550
I should stop talking.

378
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,400
Wait.

379
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,200
What's the matter?

380
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,960
Mr. Qin,

381
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,750
I beg you

382
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,310
to help me.

383
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,550
I don't want to be a cripple.

384
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
I want to be stronger.

385
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,440
I want to be the number one saberman
in the five northwestern kingdoms.

386
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,480
Wang Qiming.

387
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,750
Since I know the cause of your illness,

388
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,160
I won't sit idly by.

389
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,590
Get up.

390
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,920
Don't move.

391
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,310
[It's so fast.]

392
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,830
[If it was a hidden weapon,]

393
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,270
[I'd be dead.]

394
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,720
It's done.

395
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,400
Is…

396
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,200
Is it done?

397
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,880
[There's a cooling sensation]

398
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,510
[coming from the parts where I was stuck.]

399
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,920
[The soreness is gone.]

400
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,000
[My arms feel great]

401
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,920
[as if I was born again.]

402
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,960
The speed of my slash

403
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,440
has increased by at least 50%.

404
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,510
And the numbness in the fingers is gone.

405
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,350
I've unclogged your blocked

406
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,960
and damaged meridians.

407
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,240
Two days later,

408
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,830
in the Bloodmist Holy Land Baptism,

409
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,720
you can heal your disease

410
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,480
with the power of the Bloodmist Holy Land.

411
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,510
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

412
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,200
If there's anything

413
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,830
I can do for you in the future,

414
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,110
just let me know.

415
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,110
If I hesitate,

416
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,510
I'll be struck by lightning

417
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,400
and die miserably.

418
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,070
I just don't want

419
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,000
to see a talent

420
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,550
go astray.

421
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,270
Also,

422
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,200
Lone Peak Slash emphasizes

423
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,480
one's persistence in his own way,

424
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,640
unshakable like a lonely peak.

425
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,830
However,

426
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,160
turning back at the peak finds the way;

427
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,200
out of the shade of the trees shines the ray.

428
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,680
You are fearless,

429
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,400
but you see no silver lining.

430
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,070
In that case,

431
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,590
how can you master the real Saber Essence?

432
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,000
Silver lining?

433
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,920
Take a good look

434
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
at my Lone Peak Slash.

435
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,880
How much you can understand

436
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,310
depends on yourself.

437
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,680
Not fearing the dead end

438
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,280
can find a way to light.

439
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,240
This is the essence of Lone Peak Slash.

440
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,960
Could it be

441
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
that there's always a way out?

442
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,960
Right.

443
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,960
I was born a commoner

444
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,680
and have suffered a lot since childhood.

445
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,000
Ming, take a break

446
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,110
and eat something.

447
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
Mother.

448
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
Ming.

449
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,160
I…

450
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,160
can't protect you

451
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,880
and your mother.

452
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,070
You have to

453
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,240
protect yourself in the future.

454
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,640
Father!

455
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,590
Father!

456
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,070
Brother, I want this saber.

457
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,960
Okay, I'll snatch it for you.

458
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,550
Give it to me.

459
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,070
Forget it.

460
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,880
What's so great about this worn-out saber?

461
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,720
I'll buy plenty for you.

462
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,400
Let's go.

463
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,960
Okay.

464
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,200
[But I never thought of giving up]

465
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
[and was finally admitted to the Star Academy.]

466
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,240
He carries this battered saber
all the time,

467
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,310
looking so pathetic.

468
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,160
Do you think you're amazing?

469
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,310
[In the academy,]

470
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,790
[I was ridiculed.]

471
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,440
[But I decided]

472
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,070
[to work ten times harder than others.]

473
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,350
Ultimately,

474
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
I won fourth place in the year-end test

475
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,960
and rose to fame.

476
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,790
Doesn't it mean

477
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,400
if one is determined,

478
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,640
he can find a way out

479
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
of a desperate situation?

480
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,480
Is…

481
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,750
Is this…

482
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,200
Is this Saber Essence?
