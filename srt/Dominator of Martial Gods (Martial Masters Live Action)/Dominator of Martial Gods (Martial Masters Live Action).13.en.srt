20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,350
This question setter is not bad.

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,870
The two questions appear to be simple,

22
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,070

23
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,680

"observe the surroundings"

29

If he cheated,

86

He got all the basic questions right.

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,310
These 50 questions cover

90
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,830
almost all aspects of alchemy.

91
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,830
Even we can't get them all right

92
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,680
if we happen to be careless.

93
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,390
But he actually did it.

94
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,160
Let's take a look at the questions
set by Master Liu Guang.

95
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,920
The ones in the front are some basics.

96
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,070
You can answer them by rote learning.

97
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,870
But the comprehensive questions
in the back are different.

98
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,630
Without rich alchemy experience,

99
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,360
you can't answer them correctly.

100
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,160
The century-old Dragon Incense

101
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,310
usually is inseparable from Mirage Beasts.

102
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,680
Its scent can only spread 50 meters.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,680
Smelling its scent from 100 meters away

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,070
means you're already enchanted by illusions.

105
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,600
You must take the Disillusion Pill

106
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,160
and get out of the
illusion range of the Mirage Beast.

107
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,830
It's identical to the standard answer.

108
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,720
Wait, there's more.

109
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
After leaving the illusion range,

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
immediately look for

111
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,600
a herb with three purple leaves.

112
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,040
Putting it in your mouth
will mitigate the impact of illusions.

113
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,000
After having sufficient time,
you'll be able to find the Dragon Incense

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
and leave safely.

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,120
The latter half

116
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,000
isn't included in Master Liu Guang's answer.

117
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,360
A herb with three purple leaves?

118
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,160
Could it be Three-leafed Purple Sun Grass?

119
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,750
It does help to mitigate minor illusions,

120
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,480
and it grows near Dragon Incense.

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,800
But its disillusion effect

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,630
is no match to Disillusion Pills,

123
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,430
nor can it block the
mental impact of Mirage Beasts.

124
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,120
Isn't going back a suicidal move?

125
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,270
He already gave the right answer.

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
This is so unnecessary, isn't it?

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,160
This is like gliding the lily.

128
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,360
Come, let's take a look at

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,960
the next question about the white-blade spider.

130
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,120
Evacuate as soon as you're bitten,

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,510
and look for Spider King Grass nearby.

132
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,720
Smash the grass

133
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,270
and mix it with the spider blood on the blade.

134
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,600
Apply the mix to your wound.

135
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,080
If you can't find the grass,

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,390
pick the spears of Ye Trees nearby instead.

137
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,440
When you find the spider cave, kill it

138
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,270
and take its demonic core out.
Smash the core and swallow it.

139
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,030
His answer to this question is wrong again.

140
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,630
The correct answer should be:

141
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,360
Block your Danzhong, Jiuwei and Xinjue acupoints

142
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,440
and find the Spider King Grass.

143
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,480
Swallow it to slow down the spreading of toxins.

144
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,030
This way, even if the city
is ten thousand miles away,

145
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,000
you can still be cured.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,240
He has completely gone in the wrong direction.

147
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,000
He got the basic questions right
by mechanical memorizing.

148
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,750
When it comes to real knowledge,
his hands are tied.

149
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
He doesn't have any actual experience.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,150
That's the best he can do.

151
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360

letting them pass the test

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,320
will cause serious consequences.

184
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,030
Let me see.

185
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,960
Look at this one.

186
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,200
He can't even tell
Yangju Grass from Youngju Flower.

187
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,630
One is a drug to moisten the lungs,

188
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,200
while the other is a poison.

189
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
If we let people like this pass the test,

190
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
when something goes wrong in medicine making,

191
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,080
whose responsibility will it be?

192
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,000
Now take a look at this.

193
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,080
The extraction of Crime Fruit needs six methods,

194
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,030
but he only wrote five,

195
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,030
leaving out the most important one.

196
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,390
If you can't extract the efficacy,

197
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,840
how can you make Dan medicine?

198
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,480
This one got seventy points.

199
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,030
Seems not bad.

200
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,860
[Paper]

201
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,150
He's right about all the basic questions.

202
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,390
This is the paper of an arrogant kid.

203
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,750
He's not even an alchemy apprentice yet,

204
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,510
but he wants to be a Grade One Alchemist.

205
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,000
If not for the rules of Dan Pavilion,

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,390
I'd have driven him out.

207
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,390
He got the basic questions right

208
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,790
by mere rote learning.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,150
His answers to the latter questions
make no sense.

210
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,750
Now I'm curious.

211
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,620
[Paper]

212
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,200
This is…

213
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Great idea!

214
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,750
He actually thought of using
Three-leafed Purple Sun Grass

215
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,150
to block the attack from the Mirage Beast

216
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,790
and pick the Dragon Incense successfully!

217
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,790
He managed to get out of danger

218
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,870
and get the Dragon Incense!

219
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,670
Killing two birds with one stone,
this is a genius idea!

220
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,510
This…

221
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,750
But Three-leafed Purple Sun Grass

222
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,910
can only undo mild illusion, right?

223
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
What do you know?

224
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,270
The Three-leafed Purple Sun Grass

225
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,240
does help to mitigate minor illusions.

226
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Its effect is less than
one-fifth of Disillusion Pills.

227
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,870
But if it is combined with a Disillusion Pill,

228
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,120
it can boost the effectiveness of the latter
by more than one fold.

229
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,270
This is totally able to
block the attack from the Mirage Beast.

230
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,960
Did he answer this one correctly?

231
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,000
More than correctly!

232
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,600
His answer is even

233
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,200
better than mine.

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,870
Let's take a look at the next one.

235
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,620
[Paper]

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,200
Excellent!

237
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,080
Mixing Spider King Grass with
the white-blade spider's blood on the blade,

238
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,320
or use spears of Ye Trees as a replacement.

239
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,030
Apply it to your wound and then kill the spider.

240
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,510
How did he come up with this?

241
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,870
Look at this…

242
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,360
Master Liu, did he get this one right too?

243
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,320
It's literally perfect!

244
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,200
This…

245
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
The blood of the white-blade spider
is poisonous as well,

246
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,960
but the Spider King Grass

247
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,390
and the toxin in the spider's blood

248
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,720
can react with each other.

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,240
If you apply it to your wound,

250
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,150
you'll be immune to the

251
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,390
toxin for hours,

252
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,360
and your mobility will be recovered.

253
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,320
Apart from that,

254
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,150
the leaves of Ye Trees

255
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,840
have the same effect.

256
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
It's just that they
have a shorter effective duration.

257
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,030
But even so,

258
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,750
the toxin inside the body
still hasn't been cleared.

259
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,720
And isn't swallowing the spider's demonic core

260
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,030
a suicidal move?

261
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,630
What do you know?

262
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,750
The white-blade spider kills only by its toxin.

263
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,670
As long as you are immune to

264
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,720
its toxin,

265
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,270
even if you're a Human level cultivator,

266
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,510
you'll be able to kill it.

267
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Also, swallowing Spider King Grass with the core

268
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,510
can eliminate the remaining toxin in the body.

269
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,670
This way,

270
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,200
not only can the toxin be cleared,

271
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
but you'll also be able to kill the spider

272
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,600
and get the materials from it.

273
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,080
His answer is better than mine

274
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,150
over ten folds!

275
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,120
This…

276
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,150
You actually gave him zero points!

277
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,030
Are you stupid?

278
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,750
Genius! How can there be such a way out

279
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,870
when encountering a Fire Lion?

280
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,080
I didn't even think of this idea

281
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,200
when I designed the question.

282
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,910
And this one.

283
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,440
Decomposing the toxin of a silver-ring scorpion
with Cinder Weed.

284
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
How… How did he come up with it?

285
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,870
When I was designing every question,

286
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,960
I had a fixed answer for it.

287
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,000
But this person is capable of solving them

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,630
with even better solutions.

289
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,270
This is enlightening!

290
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,750
Knowledge is boundless.

291
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,150
This is true as ancient wise men say.

292
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,200
Genius!

293
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,200
Let me see

294
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,360
what his name is.

295
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,300
[Qin Chen]

296
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,840
Qin Chen?

297
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,240
Why does it sound familiar?

298
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,200
Where is he?

299
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,840
Call him in right now.

300
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,510
Let him take the second round.

301
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm curious to see

302
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,360
how good he is when it comes to practices.

303
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,270
Oops.

304
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,320
Before you came,

305
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,440
we'd already sent men to announce the results.

306
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,080
I'm afraid that Qin Chen has already left now.

307
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,360
What did you say?

308
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,000
Come out with me right now!

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,390
See if he's still here.

310
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,630
If he's gone,

311
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,910
see how I'm gonna punish you!

312
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,110
Mentor Ouyang and Master Chen Mu
have gone over the papers.

313
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,440
Your results will be published now.

314
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,030
Wei Zhen.

315
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,070
It's me, Shen!

316
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,680
I told you I was

317
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
gifted in alchemy!

318
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,310
Quiet.

319
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,750
Wei Shen.

320
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,000
Thanks.

321
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,750
Zhao Lingshan.

322
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,680
Li Qingfeng.

323
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,000
Wang Qiming.

324
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,960
Wang An.

325
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,070
Thank you heavens,

326
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,880
for letting me pass the examination!

327
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,310
This Wang An didn't become

328
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,720
an apprentice until in his thirties.

329
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,960
He took this test

330
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,070
every year for the last thirty years.

331
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,200
Guess he had done this a hundred times.

332
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
But he still didn't make it.

333
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,640
Those who passed,

334
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
please get ready and come in with me.

335
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,200
Hold on.

336
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,920
Why am I not on the list?

337
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,680
It means you didn't pass the examination.

338
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,200
This is impossible for me.

339
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,790
Impossible?

340
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,070
Qin Chen, who do you think you are?

341
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,750
Alright,

342
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,240
if your name wasn't called,
you didn't pass the examination.

343
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,880
If you still keep badgering me,

344
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,160
forgive me for not being polite.

345
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
Qin Chen,

346
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,160
do you think the test for Alchemists

347
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,310
is that easy to pass?

348
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,830
Ridiculous.

349
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,480
We're going in now.

350
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,310
Masters.

351
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,640
Who's Qin Chen?

352
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,680
I am.

353
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,310
Are you Qin Chen?

354
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,400
Master Liu Guang,

355
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,680
Mr. Chen Mu signed him in.

356
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,240
He didn't piss you off, did he?

357
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,030
You're indeed a young genius!

358
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,680
Good!

359
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,200
Great!

360
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,110
Seems like

361
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,720
the future of our Dan Pavilion of the Xuan
is secured.

362
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,350
Good!

363
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,110
You seven follow me in

364
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,510
for the second round.

365
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,510
Everyone, please.

366
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,680
Chen, you're so good at hiding yourself.

367
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Well…

368
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,720
How did Qin Chen pass?

369
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,680
Wait.

370
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,790
Wait, why did I fail again?

371
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,480
[Alchemy Examination Hall]
Round two is a random test of

372
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,400
one of the ten alchemy operations.

373
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,590
This round will test

374
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,830
your fire control abilities.

375
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,240
Fire control abilities? How?

376
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,350
Didn't it use to be medicine discrimination?

377
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,310
Fire control is the least possible one to test.

378
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,000
The ten alchemy operations include

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,510
medicine discrimination, medicine extraction,

380
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,920
heating up the cauldron, medicine control,
fire control, Dan condensation, etc.

381
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,440
Medicine discrimination is the
most well-known one to the public.

382
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,160
It's also the most basic skill

383
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,070
an Alchemist must have.

384
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,960
Tests in the past usually were this one.

385
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,070
I didn't expect that Master Liu Guang
would choose fire control for the test.

386
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,790
As is known to all,

387
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,680
the ability to control fire

388
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,000
is the premise for an Alchemist to make

389
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,440
high-quality Dan medicine.

390
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,790
If you can't even do a good job in this detail,

391
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,830
how can you call yourself
an authentic Alchemist?

392
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,750
First one, Wei Zhen.

393
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,680
Show us your fire control ability.

394
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,240
There are many types of Dan fire,

395
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,160
including array fire, true fire, demonic fire,

396
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,830
earth fire, heaven fire, etc.

397
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,000
Array fire and demonic fire
are acquired postnatally.

398
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,480
They are external fire.

399
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,550
But the fire formed by
the vital energy of the Alchemist

400
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,550
is true fire.

401
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,310
It belongs to internal fire.

402
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,350
Alchemist apprentices
who haven't specially cultivated

403
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,270
fire methods

404
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,750
won't be able to form true fire.

405
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,790
Mastery of array fire is the most basic
requirement for an Alchemist.

406
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,880
Is this your fire control ability?

407
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,200
Split the fire in front of you into three

408
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,880
and display them in a pyramid shape.

409
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,480
You came for the test without the most basic

410
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,000
fire control ability.

411
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,680
Next.

412
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,790
As we know,

413
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,200
fire control seems to be testing

414
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,270
the Alchemist's ability to control fire,

415
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,790
but actually, it's testing how strong

416
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,920
the Alchemist's spiritual power is
and how careful he can be.

417
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,350
This is a

418
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,200
very complex and tedious process.

419
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,270
It has high requirements for spiritual power.

420
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,480
You guys can forget about it.

421
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
Just let me be the one

422
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,310
to show you how it's done.

423
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,790
What's going on?

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,350
Come on, burn!

425
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,000
Wait…

426
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,750
You failed.

427
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,550
Next, Wang Qiming.

428
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,480
You can leave now.

429
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,480
Looks like saber suits me better.

430
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,880
Isn't Master Liu Guang too strict?

431
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
If this goes on,

432
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,000
who can possibly pass?

433
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,750
Next,

434
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,720
Zhao Lingshan.

435
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,750
Split!

436
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,790
Not bad.

437
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,720
Good.

438
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,350
Someone finally did it.

439
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,830
Not bad. You passed.

440
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,750
Thank you, Masters.

441
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,400
Next, Li Qingfeng.

442
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,590
Fire splitting is the most basic skill
of fire control ability.

443
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,270
It's what an Alchemist must have.

444
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,000
Master Liu Guang's test
is actually straightforward.

445
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,750
As long as you understand the properties of fire

446
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,400
and how the fire-gathering array works,

447
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,640
plus a little control of spiritual power,

448
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,270
you'll be able to finish the test.

449
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,720
Three fireballs forming a triangle is the

450
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,030
most basic one in fire structures.

451
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,350
It's not hard

452
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,640
for a true Alchemist

453
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,480
with Grade One spiritual power

454
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,200
to create five fireballs.

455
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,030
Five?

456
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,920
He's literally a genius.

457
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,680
Splitting the fire into five

458
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,880
and controlling them with such ease,

459
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,400
he's got excellent ability.

460
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,400
Not bad for you.

461
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,240
You passed.

462
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,030
Thanks, Master Liu Guang.

463
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,350
[He's able to do that]

464
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,200
[not because of strong spiritual power.]

465
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,240
[What he awakened should be a fire bloodline]

466
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,270
[that's naturally sensitive to fire.]

467
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,720
[Also, he cultivated fire methods.]

468
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,510
[His internal vital energy features fire.]

469
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,160
[That's why fire control]

470
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,440
[is much easier for him than other Alchemists.]

471
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,000
[No wonder he can pass.]

472
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,880
Next, Wang An.

473
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,510
Wang An,

474
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
you passed.

475
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,720
[Three actually passed!]

476
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,550
I thought the second round
would be quite challenging.

477
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,830
But three out of six actually passed.

478
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,550
This is unexpected.

479
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,790
Next,

480
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,270
Qin Chen.

481
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,750
Qin Chen,

482
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,920
let me see

483
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,750
how capable you are.

484
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,070
You only activated half of the array?

485
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,400
How can you pass the test

486
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,550
without activating the fire-gathering array?

487
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,000
Qin Chen, you're not an alchemy apprentice,

488
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,350
so activating half of it is already good enough.

489
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,030
You may need it for cooking when you go home.

490
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,960
Now you know

491
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,400
who the real genius here is?

492
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,240
Qin Chen, you can leave now.

493
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,030
You can't split the fire into three

494
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,640
with only half of the array activated.

495
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,920
So…

496
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,470
[Dan Pavilion is an organization formed
by all Alchemists on the Tianwu Continent.]

497
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,560
[Martial artists can buy Dan medicine in it
to improve power or cure illnesses.]

498
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,660
[Highly respected, It's based in the Martial Domain
and has branches in all kingdoms.]
