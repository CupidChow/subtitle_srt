[Episode 28]

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,950
I searched through the residence

20
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,040
but couldn't find Marquis Wu'an.

21
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,950
What?

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
Marquis Wu'an escaped!

23
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,400
I failed the task.

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,200
Please punish me.

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,750
All right.

26
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,430
Have you found anything else?

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,430
I found this thing in Marquis Wu'an Residence

29
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,800
that came from Shadow-slay House.

30
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,190
In addition,

31
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,030
I found many weapons and poisons that came

32
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,960
from Shadow-slay House.

33
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,240
As far as I'm concerned,

34
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,430
Marquis Wu'an

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,910
is the leader of Shadow-slay House.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
Marquis Wu'an
instigated Li Qingfeng's murder but failed,

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,240
so he escaped.

38
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,080
All right, get up.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you, your Majesty.

40
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,800
What do you guys think?

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,960
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,910
I think

43
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,430
King of Lingwu has told the truth.

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,800
Marquis Wu'an must be
the leader of Shadow-slay House.

45
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,960
I don't think so.

46
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,030
Marquis Wu'an went missing

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,840
right after Li Qingfeng died,

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,710
which is too strange.

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
As far as I'm concerned,

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,960
someone must have secretly helped him.

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,310
I suggest a full investigation.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,360
Lord Kang, what do you mean by that?

53
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,120
Marquis Qin, what do you think?

54
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,000
You…

55
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,400
Stop!

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
This is embarrassing.

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
The King of Lingnan, what's your opinion?

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,430
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,280
I think

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,270
whether Marquis Wu'an is the leader
of Shadow-slay House or not,

61
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,040
whether he's missing or absconding,

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,830
he has something to do
with Shadow-slay House.

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,190
It's still early.

64
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,000
Marquis Wu'an must be in the Capital.

65
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,040
If we send more men to search the Capital,

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,240
we'll definitely find some clues.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,480
Okay. Take my order
to search through the Capital.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,430
Make sure to find Marquis Wu'an.

69
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,190
Yes, your Majesty.

70
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,120
King of Lingwu.

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,830
Yes.

72
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
I grant you Capital Commander's Seal.

73
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,600
Zhao Jing will assist you.

74
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,600
I want you to dispatch more soldiers

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
to find Marquis Wu'an,

76
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,160
even if you turn the Capital upside down.

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,950
I

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,750
must see him

79
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,430
dead or alive!

80
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,390
I'll take the order.

81
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
I've been wanting to come to Dan Pavilion.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,950
I've arranged the things

83
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,950
as you ordered, my lady.

84
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm so happy.

85
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,870
Mr. Qin, congrats.

86
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,360
You're so beautiful, fairy.

87
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,240
Fairy?

88
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,000
You're interesting, young man.

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Miss Xiao.

90
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,120
This is my friend, Lin Tian.

91
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,720
Wang Qiming.

92
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,270
He's my friend too.

93
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,800
This is Xiao Ya, Pavilion Master.

94
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,720
Pa…Pavilion Master?

95
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,160
It's nice to meet you, Pavilion Master.

96
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,270
I didn't mean to be impolite.

97
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,720
Don't mind what I said.

98
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160
No.

99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,600
I do mind.

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
I'm kidding.

101
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,270
Please.

102
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,600
Chen.

103
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,240
Is there anything
between you and Pavilion Master?

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Miss Xiao is just my partner.

105
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,830
I get it.

106
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,950
Mr. Qin.

107
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,830
Liu Guang told me

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,920
you visited me for something important.

109
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,070
Exactly.

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,830
I hope you

111
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,510
do me a favor
and prepare something for me.

112
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,800
Tianjing Sand, Pora Leaves,

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,190
Blood-grained Fruit.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,830
Those are spiritual medicine of Grade Four.

115
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,950
Mr. Qin.

116
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,240
What are you going to refine?

117
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,310
You'll know that

118
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,560
as long as you collect the three.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,830
Liu Guang.

120
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,040
My lady.

121
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,190
Collect them.

122
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,190
Yes.

123
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,510
My lady, Mr. Qin.

124
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,870
The medicine is ready.

125
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,920
They're in the Master's refining room.

126
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,800
Mr. Qin, let's go.

127
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,040
Tian, Qiming.

128
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,750
You stay here.

129
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,790
I'll come back soon.

130
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,870
Okay.

131
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,790
I'll look around

132
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,200
the secret Dan Pavilion with Qiming.

133
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,240
Master Liu Guang, come with me.

134
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,030
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

135
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,670
I'll assist you and my lady.

136
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,910
Qiming.

137
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,000
Master Liu Guang

138
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,550
is a Grade-Two Alchemist

139
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,440
and the deacon of Dan Pavilion.

140
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,550
Even princes and dukes

141
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,960
should call him master.

142
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
Why is he so excited

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,270
to refine with Chen

144
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,320
as if he has won a lottery?

145
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,910
Let's start.

146
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Miss Xiao.

147
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,870
Are you letting me lead the refining?

148
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
I'm a Grade Three Alchemist.

149
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,030
It's hard for me
to extract the drug properties

150
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
of the Grade-Four medicine.

151
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,080
Don't you believe me?

152
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,080
Anyway, you need to tell me
what you want to make.

153
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,670
Bloodmist Spiritual Liquid.

154
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,440
The crystal.

155
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,240
Did you get it from Bloodmist Holy Land?

156
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,240
You entered the deepest part of the land!

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,030
How could it be?

158
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,240
Even a Mystery-level

159
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,550
martial artist
can't go through the Corrosive Force.

160
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,000
In fact, the Corrosive Force
in the depths isn't very strong.

161
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,480
I felt a slight pain.

162
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,270
A slight pain?

163
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,510
All right. Start the refining.

164
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,240
Why are you in such a hurry?

165
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,480
What happened?

166
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,480
Your Majesty.

167
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,910
There's an urgent message from the front.

168
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,150
My spy discovered a million soldiers

169
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,630
of the Zhao at the national border.

170
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,510
They're approaching the frontier.

171
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,750
A million.

172
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
What did you say?

173
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,600
A million soldiers!

174
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,670
Your Majesty.

175
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,000
The Zhao has been
at war with us for years at the border.

176
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,630
The troop number had been
tens of thousands at most.

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,510
A million soldiers!

178
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,750
Is the Zhao betting the whole country on this?

179
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,670
What do they want to do?

180
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,270
Are they going
to fight to the death with us?

181
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,960
Your Majesty, I think

182
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,080
the Zhao wants to avenge their loss

183
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,000
in the preliminary test
of the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

184
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,550
In the competition,

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,670
the talents of the Zhao lost out heavily,

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,000
and their third prince perished.

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,320
Although Cao Heng was the third son,

188
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,840
he had the great favor of the Zhao Emperor.

189
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,790
It's said he wanted Cao Heng
to succeed to the crown.

190
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,150
Your Majesty.

191
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,320
Cao Heng and Nian Wuji
were not killed by my son.

192
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,870
It's true, your Majesty.

193
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,120
Qin Yuanhong.

194
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,840
Cao Heng and Nian Wuji were killed by Qin Feng.

195
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,390
The five kingdoms
have reached a final conclusion.

196
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,150
Who else could it be

197
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,390
if it wasn't him?

198
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,120
Your Majesty, Cao Heng and Nian Wuji
were killed by Qin Chen.

199
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,670
I believe my son did not lie to me.

200
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,510
Qin Yuanhong, at this point,

201
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,120
You are still denying it.

202
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,510
I…

203
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,750
Enough!

204
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,720
Marquis Qin.

205
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,720
Did you hear that?
Do you want to disobey His Majesty?

206
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,630
I…

207
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,000
Have you had enough?

208
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,720
King of Lingwu.

209
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,270
Qin Batian, King of Might,

210
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,390
is the Supreme Commander at the border.

211
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
Has he sent any messages?

212
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,550
His Majesty.

213
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,600
The message

214
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,120
came from my spy at the border.

215
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,000
We haven't received any messages

216
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,270
from King of Might.

217
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,910
This…

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,030
Mr. Qin Batian didn't send any messages.

219
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,910
Crazy…

220
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,870
Qin Batian is
the Supreme Commander at the border.

221
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,440
He actually hasn't sent any messages

222
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,670
about such a big thing!

223
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,600
Your Majesty, the Zhao

224
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,360
is very likely to attack our border with a rage.

225
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,480
You shall make decisions early.

226
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,720
I got a message that many martial artists

227
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,720
from Ghost Immortal Sect
have slipped into Lingnan

228
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,240
and are coming straight to the Capital.

229
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm afraid they'll arrive in the Capital soon.

230
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,840
What does Ghost Immortal Sect want to do?

231
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,080
Is it because of Nian Wuji's death?

232
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,550
This…

233
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,720
King of Lingwu, Lord Kang.

234
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,550
Yes.

235
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,120
Yes.

236
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,600
Take my order.

237
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,840
Put the Capital on alert.

238
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,080
Send a message to Qin Batian.

239
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,440
Ask him what happened at the border.

240
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,870
Also, send my word to him.

241
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,360
What has he been doing there?

242
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,630
Does he still want

243
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,390
the title of King of Might?

244
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,080
Such a big thing has happened at the border,

245
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
but he didn't send a word!

246
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,270
I'll take the order.

247
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,120
This…

248
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,390
Mr. Qin.

249
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,720
Bloodmist Spiritual Liquid has

250
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
an incredible effect.

251
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,870
Master Liu Guang.

252
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,320
Please protect Lin Tian
and Wang Qiming for me.

253
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,840
Okay.

254
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,960
Miss Xiao.

255
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,150
Could you prepare
another cultivation room for me?

256
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,390
Mr. Qin.

257
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,550
Why don't you go to my cultivation room?

258
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,670
Please.

259
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,150
Mr. Qin.

260
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,670
This is my cultivation room.

261
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,030
You can cultivate here.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Would you like me to accompany you?

263
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,670
It's not necessary, Miss Xiao.

264
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,590
I'd like you to protect

265
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,270
Lin Tian and Wang Qiming.

266
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,510
Cultivate well.

267
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,590
I'll go out.

268
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,880
What is the magic

269
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,030
of this mysterious ancient sword?

270
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,070
Thunder Seal.

271
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,200
Mr. Qin, have you finished your cultivation?

272
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,350
Miss Xiao.

273
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,590
I want to ask you a favor.

274
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,270
What's the favor you need?

275
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,270
It is quite crucial.

276
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,440
Thanks for the trouble, Miss Xiao.

277
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,000
Your concern is mine, too.

278
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,160
I'll arrange it immediately.

279
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,920
Thank you, Miss Xiao.

280
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
My lady.

281
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,550
What did Mr. Qin say?

282
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
Mind your own business.

283
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,270
I'm going out for a while.

284
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,920
I…

285
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,160
Protect them.

286
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,590
I…

287
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,440
I…

288
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,000
Your Highness.

289
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,240
Qin Chen asks to see you.

290
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,790
Qin Chen.

291
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,680
Is he alone?

292
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,440
Yes.

293
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,680
Take him in.

294
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,270
Keep it a secret.

295
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,880
Yes.

296
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,200
It's good to see you, Your Highness.

297
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,480
You're welcome.

298
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,270
Qin Chen.

299
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,440
What brought you to my residence?

300
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,790
There's one thing I don't get.

301
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,000
So I came to ask you for advice.

302
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,160
You're a hero of the Xuan.

303
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,880
Make yourself at home.

304
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,510
Sit down.

305
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,510
Thank you.

306
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,440
This is the best tea, Futu Airy Tea.

307
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,160
It's produced in Futu Mountain.

308
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,440
One crop per ten years.

309
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,350
It is the top-notch tea among the five kingdoms.

310
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,350
Have a taste.

311
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,590
As I've known,

312
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,070
Futu Mountain is in the region of the Zhao.

313
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,200
Futu Airy Tea is

314
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,720
for the exclusive use
of the royalty of the Zhao.

315
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,030
Your Highness, I wonder

316
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,790
how you got the nice tea.

317
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,310
The ambassadors of the Zhao

318
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,510
gave His Majesty the tea

319
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,030
as a gift days ago.

320
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,000
His Majesty bestowed

321
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,310
some of it on me.

322
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,550
Go ahead.

323
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,000
What did you come here for?

324
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,640
To be frank,

325
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,590
I came for Li Qingfeng's accidental death.

326
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,240
Li Qingfeng's death is an accident.

327
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,310
You were at the scene too.

328
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,480
What else do you want to know?

329
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,680
Is it really an accident?

330
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,350
What else?

331
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,110
Li Qingfeng
had been cast the ban of incantation.

332
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,920
Once the incantation is cast,

333
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,720
it's hard to remove it.

334
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,960
Li Qingfeng suddenly died.

335
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,200
I guess someone must have triggered

336
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,440
the fatal art of the ban to kill him.

337
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,920
I didn't expect you

338
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,590
to know much about the ban of Shadow-slay House.

339
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,480
You flattered me.

340
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,440
It's said that when the performer casts the ban,

341
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,480
he must be very close to the victim.

342
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,000
Only General Yan Huai

343
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,030
Prince Wei, you, and I

344
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,310
were at the scene.

345
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,680
Qin Chen, what do you mean?

346
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,350
I heard that His Majesty
asked you to find the truth.

347
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,790
You investigated the facts

348
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,790
and asserted Marquis Wu'an
is the leader of Shadow-slay House.

349
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,400
Your Highness, don't you think

350
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
it's not logical?

351
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,790
Do you mean

352
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,750
I killed Li Qingfeng

353
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,680
and then framed Marquis Wu'an?

354
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,200
Since I dared to come here alone,

355
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,240
I don't think you're the murderer.

356
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,960
Qin Chen, how dare you be.

357
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,480
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

358
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,440
If you were the murderer,

359
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,200
you would have attacked me already.

360
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,830
You're a quick-witted young hero.

361
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,550
I didn't expect you to be so bold.

362
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,200
I was wondering

363
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,590
if it was you who killed Li Qingfeng.

364
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,200
It turns out

365
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,680
it was definitely Yan Huai.

366
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,750
General Yan Huai.

367
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,160
Why did he do that?

368
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,920
After returning to the Capital,

369
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,400
Yan Huai was transferred
to be Deputy Commander of the Royal Guard

370
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,880
because he did well in guarding
the Mount of Demonic Ancestors.

371
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,790
He patrols the palace.

372
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,000
His goal is the palace, right?

373
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,680
I'm not sure yet.

374
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't want to arouse his suspicions now.

375
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,480
In addition,

376
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,480
the men of the Ghost Immortal Sect

377
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,200
will arrive in the Capital recently.

378
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,350
You're one of the suspects
in the killing of Nian Wuji.

379
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,510
You must be careful.

380
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,720
The Ghost Immortal Sect.

381
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,550
Thank you for your warning.

382
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,440
If nothing else,

383
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,960
you can go back.

384
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,310
See off Qin Chen.

385
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,110
I'll take leave.

386
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,240
Young Marquis Qin, please.

387
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,510
What a bold

388
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,790
young man.

389
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,070
Wasn't he afraid I was the murderer?

390
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,100
New-born calves are not afraid of tigers.

391
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,920
Yan Huai.

392
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,270
My lord.

393
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,030
Xiao Ya, Pavilion Master of Dan Pavilion,

394
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,750
President Dongfang Qing of Bloodline Holy Land,

395
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,880
and Dean Chu Weichen of Star Academy

396
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,110
ask to see you.

397
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,000
What did they

398
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,440
come to my residence at night for?

399
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,240
Miss Xiao said

400
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,830
they were invited by Marquis Qin.

401
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,590
I can't believe

402
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,440
I was deceived by the young man.

403
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,590
I thought he was bold enough

404
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,960
to enter the tiger's cave alone.

405
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,920
Let the masters in.

406
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,920
Yes.

407
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,790
Mom.

408
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,270
Chen.

409
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,000
You're waiting for me at this late hour.

410
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,680
Are you hungry?

411
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,030
I'll make you something to eat.

412
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,960
Don't bother.

413
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,680
I have something to do.

414
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,270
You go to sleep.

415
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,720
It's done.

416
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,830
Chen.

417
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,110
Eat some food.

418
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,830
Mom.

419
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,750
I said I didn't need it.

420
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,110
Eat it.
