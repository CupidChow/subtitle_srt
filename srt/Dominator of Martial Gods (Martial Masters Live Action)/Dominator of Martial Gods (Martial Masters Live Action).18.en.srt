[Episode 18]

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,150
This is too much.

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,910
Qin Feng

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,960
is such a moron.

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,800
Can't believe he's still there
on the life-and-death platform.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,190
My Lady,

24
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,280
um,

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,520
should we tell

26
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,030
Mr. Qin the news?

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,360
No need.

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,360
I bet

29
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,840
that doesn't bother him in the slightest.

30
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,000
If Qin Feng insists on waiting,

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,680
so be it.

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,120
It's too trivial a thing

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,150
to interrupt Mr. Qin's cultivation.

34
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,470

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,240

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,510

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,040
I've made a breakthrough.

54
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,750
Aw, Mr. Qin,

55
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,360
you are growing

56
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,680
to be more and more masculine.

57
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,750

I think

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,190
I should go.

61
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,390
What's the hurry?

62
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,870
It's not like

63
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,750
I bite.

64
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,630
Mr. Qin,

65
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,510
let me show you out.

66
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,630
Qin Chen did not strike me as

67
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,680
a sissy.

68
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
I was expecting to see him

69
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,750
get humiliated by Qin Feng.

70
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,680
Can't believe I wasted a whole day

71
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,600
waiting for something that never happened.

72
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,950
Shen, isn't that Qin Chen?

73
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,240
Who?

74
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,630
Qin Chen.

75
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,800
No way.

76
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,870
He's actually bold enough
to walk alone at night.

77
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,360
Looks like

78
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,830
this isn't his lucky day.

79
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,950
With this many guards on our side,

80
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,950
teaching him a lesson will be a breeze.

81
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,070
Let's go.

82
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,720
Move.

83
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,390
Catch up.

84
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,870
Who is it,

85
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,120
lurking in the shadows?

86
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,790

You two got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

90
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,510
You little prick.

91
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,550
I was bedridden for days, all thanks to you.

92
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,630
Tonight I'm going to

93
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,390
settle your hash.

94
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,790
He can be a bit of a handful.

95
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't let him slip away.

96
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,150
Don't worry, Master Zhen.

97
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,000
He can't escape tonight.

98
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,910
Not

99
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,750
from me!

100
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,790
Are you all right?

101
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,550
What just happened?

102
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,670
He's a tough nut.

103
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,510
Be careful.

104
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,000
Did you two come here to give me a hard time?

105
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,030
This punk needs to be taught a lesson!

106
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,270
Get him!

107
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,440
Just in time to give
this Undying Holy Body a test run.

108
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,200
Got him!

109
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,600
What?

110
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,320
That's impossible.

111
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,150
What a waste of time.

112
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,550
H-how…

113
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,550
how is this happening?

114
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,870
Wh-what do you want?

115
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,320
You're cornered.

116
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,630
Th-this is the Capital.

117
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,840
What are you doing?

118
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,080
I'm calling for help.

119
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,910
That's right.

120
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,320
Go ahead.

121
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
You can scream all you want.

122
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,960
No one will hear you.

123
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,270
Qin Chen.

124
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,960
I-I mean,

125
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,960
Mr. Qin.

126
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,480
Mr. Qin,

127
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
we've done nothing to hurt you.

128
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,080
Let's just talk this out, please.

129
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,720
Here, take all my belongings.

130
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,270
Yeah, you can take it all.

131
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,030
I'll let you two off this time.

132
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,750
But…

133
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,080
sparing your lives doesn't mean

134
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
you will be exempt from punishment.

135
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,120
Mr. Qin.

136
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,600
Snap out of it!

137
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,750
Keep your eyes open

138
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,240
while on patrol!

139
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,630
Yes, Chief!

140
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,120
It's only been a day,

141
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,720
and yet Mr. Qin's aura

142
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
seems to have become stronger.

143
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,390
That's odd.

144
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,870
Shen.

145
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,390
Master Shen.

146
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,030
Here.

147
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,200
Master Zhen, are you all right?

148
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,670
Come on.

149
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,960
Master Shen.

150
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,080
Master Zhen,

151
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,720
we should report this to the police.

152
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,150
The hell we will!

153
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,600
What are you, a total idiot?

154
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,750
This would spread
like wildfire through the entire Capital!

155
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,510
Haven't I been humiliated enough?

156
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,600
He has become stronger.

157
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,870
It's terrifying.

158
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,720
One of these days,

159
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,910
I'll make him pay!

160
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
I told you

161
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,240
not to mess with Qin Chen,

162
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,240
did I not?

163
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,870
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

164
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,600
I-if you…

165
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,270
if you ever cross him again,

166
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,510
I swear I will break your legs!

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,840
But you rushed to him before everyone else…

168
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,150
I beg your pardon?

169
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,270
Nothing…

170
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,200
We're heading home!

171
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,080
Get up!

172
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,440
Easy,

173
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,840
Master Shen.

174
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,150
Mother,

175
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
why are you still up?

176
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,390
Chen, I see you've broken through.

177
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,840
My new powers are hidden deep.

178
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,270
Mother, how did you know I had a breakthrough?

179
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,390
Because you are my blood.

180
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,000
No changes in you

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,870
escape my eyes.

182
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,630
You got in a fight, didn't you?

183
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,600
No matter how good a fighter you are,

184
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,390
my advice is to stay out of trouble.

185
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,750
Don't worry about me,

186
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,790
Mother.

187
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,390
I know where to draw the line.

188
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,790
I fight back

189
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,870
in self-defense

190
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,270
only when I'm offended.

191
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
Well,

192
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,030
since you put it that way,

193
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,790
I'll say no more.

194
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,440
Good night, Mother.

195
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
Mother.

196
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,440
Fen.

197
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,270
Feng…

198
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,390
Not again, Fen.

199
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,120
This is all Qin Chen's fault.

200
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,670
Feng,

201
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,030
Mother,

202
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,630
look at me…

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Aw, Fen.

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,480
You guys have to avenge me.

205
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,720
Don't worry,

206
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,440
Fen.

207
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,360
I will give that little bastard hell.

208
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,270
Just get plenty of rest. Take your time.

209
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,440
Don't worry yourself, Fen.

210
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I got some healing Dan medicine

211
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,360
from your uncle.

212
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,240
You'll feel better before you know it.

213
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,030
No.

214
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,440
Come on.

215
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,550
No, Mother.

216
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,510
Just one.

217
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,550
I prefer to rest at home.

218
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,790
Speaking of which,

219
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,080
that little jerk didn't show his face

220
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,270
despite getting chewed out like that.

221
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,790
What a coward.

222
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,510
Mother,

223
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,790
I hadn't bargained on him
being one to eat humble pie.

224
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,600
Feng,

225
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,630
what if you challenge him again tomorrow?

226
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,320
Surely

227
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,550
he will…

228
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,630
He doesn't like challenges.

229
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,270
No amount of provocation

230
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,360
can lure him out.

231
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,080
So?

232
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,600
Are we supposed to just let it go?

233
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,480
You know,

234
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,870
you should be happy.

235
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,150
He's intent
on heading to the Bloodmist Holy Land.

236
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,790
The Mount of Demonic Ancestors
is a dangerous place to be.

237
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,360
Anything could happen.

238
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,790
For example,

239
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,600
getting ripped apart by demonic beasts.

240
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,480
You mean…

241
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
How wonderful.

242
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,310
I'll be waiting for good news, Feng.

243
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,960
Feng,

244
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,310
I'll leave you

245
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,510
to avenge your brother.

246
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm leaving

247
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,160
for the Bloodmist Holy Land tomorrow.

248
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,830
I'm Gang Lie, Deputy Commander
of the Royal Guard of the Xuan Kingdom.

249
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,550
[Gang Lie, Deputy Commander of the Royal Guard of the Xuan]
On King of Lingwu's orders,

250
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,440
I'm here to escort Qin Chen to the palace.

251
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,750
Chen,

252
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,680
stay safe.

253
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,070
Mother,

254
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,720
I will come home safely.

255
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,110
You have my word.

256
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,590
Chief Zuo.

257
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,310
Mr. Qin.

258
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,880
You will have control over this place

259
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,880
while I'm away.

260
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,790
Absolutely, Mr. Qin.

261
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,350
With me in charge,

262
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,510
Ms. Qin will be

263
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,920
in good hands.

264
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,270
Thanks, Chief Zuo.

265
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,510
It is an honor

266
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,110
to serve you, Mr. Qin.

267
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,790
I am who I am today because of you.

268
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,350
There's no way

269
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,350
I'll let you down.

270
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,160
[Isn't he a city guard?]

271
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,510
[His Majesty is the reason]

272
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,240
[where he is today.]

273
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,510
[Extending such courtesy to Qin Chen,]

274
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,920
[showing absolutely
no gratitude to His Majesty,]

275
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,350
[that is just ridiculous.]

276
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,550
We should go. You don't want to be late.

277
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,030
Goodbye, Mother.

278
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,310
Mr. Qin!

279
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,920
I'll be here waiting for you

280
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,640
when you get back!

281
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,720
[A fighter at Heaven level?]

282
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,550
[Since when
did the Deputy Chief of the City Guard]

283
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,000
[become so strong?]

284
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,920
Commander Gang,

285
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,350
shall we?

286
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,590
Have you no patience?

287
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,640
Well, look who we got here.

288
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,750
Commander Wu.

289
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,590
[Wu Tao, Deputy Commander of the Royal Guard of the Xuan]
I heard you were sent to

290
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,790
pick up a commoner in West Town.

291
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,720
Know who's in this carriage?

292
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,160
Princess Lingshan, Lord Kang's daughter.

293
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,680
Move out of the way.

294
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,350
You cannot afford

295
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
to hurt Her Highness.

296
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,240
Nice carriage.

297
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,240
How dare you force your way rudely

298
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,920
toward Her Highness's carriage?

299
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,960
I know Princess Lingshan.

300
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,680
You knowing Her Highness

301
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,590
doesn't mean she knows you.

302
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,000
Back way.

303
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,750
Don't make us get ugly.

304
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,750
Stop.

305
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,590
Your Highness.

306
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,440
Your Highness,

307
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,070
this man right here

308
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,310
approached your carriage in a forceful way.

309
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,720
We were just going to secure him.

310
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,070
He's a friend of mine.

311
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,240
You're all dismissed.

312
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,310
Your Highness, isn't your carriage

313
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,310
a little too large

314
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,550
for you to ride alone?

315
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,200
Do you mind if I join you?

316
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,030
I could keep an eye on you

317
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,680
on the road.

318
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,160
Don't stand there gawking.

319
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,750
We ought to be on our way.

320
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,440
Your Highness,

321
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,200
I'll have the man removed!

322
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,590
Commander Wu,

323
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,200
we'll resume our journey.

324
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,590
Uh…

325
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,750
I could get used to this.

326
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,720
You…

327
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,440
Loosen up, Your Highness.

328
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
You own this carriage.

329
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:28,680
Come,

330
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,640
have a seat.

331
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,000
That's my bed.

332
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,400
So?

333
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,270
It's big enough

334
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,480
for two.

335
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,640
Be generous, Your Highness.

336
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,960
I won't bite.

337
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm not afraid of you.

338
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,070
Well,

339
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,640
you do you.

340
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,790
I'm a little tired.

341
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,790
I'm going to take a nap.

342
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,480
Wake me up when we arrive at the palace.

343
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,750
Geez.

344
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,780
[Room of Talent, Royal Palace of the Xuan]

345
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,880
It's been a while, Prince Wei.

346
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,960
Your martial prowess

347
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,400
has sharply increased.

348
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,720
Crown Prince Qingfeng.

349
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,000
[Prince Wei, fourth son of Emperor of the Xuan]
You won second place on the exam.

350
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,590
And you'll be entering the Bloodmist Holy Land
to receive baptism.

351
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,830
You've got a bright future ahead.

352
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,400
You flatter me, Your Highness.

353
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,270
Compared to you,

354
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,110
I am small and insignificant.

355
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,540
[Princess Zixun,
sixth daughter of Emperor of the Xuan]

356
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,830
Wei,

357
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,310
who is this guy?

358
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,590
He will be the one representing our kingdom

359
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,000
in the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,350
Yet he describes himself as
small and insignificant.

361
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,550
Is he implying that

362
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,000
our kingdom selected some good-for-nothings?

363
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
You must be

364
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,590
Princess Zixun.

365
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,030
Manners, Zixun.

366
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,920
This is Marquis Wu'an's son,
Crown Prince Qingfeng.

367
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,200
He is simply showing humility.

368
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
Let's just take it easy, okay?

369
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,550
Some people are such hypocrites.

370
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,110
They think highly of themselves

371
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,550
but say things to make someone seem humble.

372
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,830
And that one over there,

373
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,270
I bet he's an introvert.

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,590
Seriously, why would Father pick these two

375
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
for the Bloodmist Holy Land Baptism?

376
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,920
Zixun,

377
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,480
you should know it's not our place

378
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
to question Father's judgment.

379
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,310
Prince Wei.

380
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,590
Princess Zixun,

381
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
I couldn't agree with you more.

382
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,790
Qin Feng.

383
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,270
These good-for-nothings

384
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,550
can act all high and mighty
while here in the Capital.

385
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,000
But if they do enter the competition,

386
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,200
people might think

387
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,110
our kingdom is rich with dead losses like them.

388
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,070
Prince Wei,

389
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,070
Princess Zixun,

390
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,200
it's been so long.

391
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,240
I hope you're doing well.

392
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,270
Mr. Qin, long time no see.

393
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,160
[Wei and Qin Feng]

394
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
[had the same level of prowess at that time.]

395
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,400
[On a year-end exam,]

396
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,880
[the two of them fought hundreds of rounds.]

397
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,240
[Ultimately, Qin Feng was declared the winner.]

398
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,000
[Wei did not take the defeat well.]

399
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,350
Where's Qin Chen?

400
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,200
Is he not here yet?

401
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,440
So these are the geniuses

402
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,030
who will be going to the Bloodmist Holy Land

403
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,030
with Qin Chen?

404
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,720
Totally overrated.

405
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,400
You…

406
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,110
You're just a few years older than me.

407
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,240
Oh, a lowly commoner.

408
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
I dare you to say that again!

409
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,590
A commoner becomes ambitious enough
to want to get physical.

410
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,550
Guess I've been away from the Capital

411
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,920
for too long, hmm?

412
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,110
Qin Feng,

413
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,160
this is the palace!

414
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,070
Relax, Your Highnesses.

415
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,350
I simply wanted

416
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,720
to test these geniuses from Star Academy.

417
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,270
Turns out they are nothingburgers,

418
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,030
just like I expected.

419
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,000
Somebody

420
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,510
help Wang Qiming out of the room.
He needs a breather.

421
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,000
That won't be necessary.

422
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,590
Thank you, though, Your Highness.

423
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,960
It's Lingshan.

424
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,830
You…

425
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,030
Who are you?

426
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,920
Why would you be in Lingshan's carriage?

427
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,200
We've reached the palace already, huh?

428
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,960
But I haven't gotten enough sleep.

429
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,790
Qin Chen?

430
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,350
Finally.

431
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,200
What's wrong with him?

432
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,640
Lack of sleep?

433
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,270
You pervert.

434
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,640
How could you do such a disgusting thing

435
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,270
to Lingshan?

436
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,880
Zixun,

437
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,400
stop it.

438
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,640
This is Qin Chen.

439
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,880
He's supposed to go to

440
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,200
the Bloodmist Holy Land Baptism with me.

441
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,400
He's Qin Chen?

442
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,310
Lingshan,

443
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,240
what if he's lying to you?

444
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,590
All men are dogs,

445
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,160
you know.

446
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,750
Zixun, it's not what you think.

447
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,110
I met him on the way.

448
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,070
He was dead on his feet,

449
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,640
so I offered him a lift.

450
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,510
Did he get in your carriage
halfway through the trip?

451
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,240
He…

452
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,000
he didn't do anything to you, or did he?

453
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,350
Qin Chen,

454
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,790
be a man

455
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,070
and quit hiding behind Lingshan.

456
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,240
Grow a pair!

457
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,270
Princess Lingshan,

458
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,790
whom might this cuckoo be?

459
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,640
She is the Emperor's sixth daughter.

460
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,920
Do you mean she's a princess?

461
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,750
He calls her a cuckoo?

462
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,680
He has some nerve.

463
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,480
Qin Chen!

464
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,240
How dare you treat
Princess Zixun with such disrespect?

465
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,920
Apologize to her now!

466
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,030
It's you.

467
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,070
What does it matter to you anyway?
