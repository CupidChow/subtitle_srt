Everyone,

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,400
greetings to you.

29
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,400
Qin Feng has resounding fame

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,080
in the Xuan Kingdom.

31
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,560

on you in the future.

35
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,190
I won't

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,400
let you down.

37

Uncle Yuanzhi, greetings to you.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,840
Don't stand on ceremony.

39
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,080
I heard that Ying

40
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,680
has been very close to Qin Chen lately.

41
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,800
Qin Chen hurt Fen

42
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,080
and turned his back on us.

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,030
He is the sinner of our family.

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,150
Ying, I hope you'll keep your distance
from him in the future

45
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,470
so as not

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,680
to tarnish the reputation of our family.

47
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,840
Qin Feng,

48
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,360
what do you mean?

49
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,030
Qin Chen is also the blood of our family.

50
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,030
You are the eldest son.

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,470
How can you be so cold?

52
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,280
Qin Chen left our family voluntarily.

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,680
How can he be regarded as one of us?

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,360
You…

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,240
He's made an enemy of me

56
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,310
by hurting Fen.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,160

58
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,120
as an elder,

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
how can you confuse right from wrong

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
and defend an outsider?

61
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,360

63
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,590

66
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,310

Fen, don't worry.

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,390

Feng,

79
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,750
you're only 20 years old,

80
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,270
and you've reached the peak of Earth level.

81
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,310
But Feng,

82
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,560
you still have to be careful.

83
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,190
Qin Yuechi and his son

84
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,430

I'm relieved, then.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,510
He's just rubbish.

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
There's nothing to worry about.

what are you going to do?

96
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,310
Challenge him to a fight in the Capital.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,190
If he dares to say yes,

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,720
I'll make him a cripple
and lose the qualification

99
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,040
to enter the Bloodmist Holy Land

100
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,160

102
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:45,950
this is Ninth Tier Pill,

103
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,630
an effective medicine for healing.

104
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,190
After taking it,

105
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,870
you'll recover

106
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
from your injuries soon.

107
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920

Qin Chen

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,480

My master Qin Feng thus announced

115
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,120
that three days later,

116
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,430
he'll fight Qin Chen
on the life-and-death platform in the Capital.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,950
If Qin Chen has the courage, do come and fight.

Before the duel starts,

119

I, Qin Feng,

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,280
will fight without using my hands.

134
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,830
He's so arrogant.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,950
Three days later,

136
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
I'll wait here

137

and see if Qin Chen

138
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,190
will take on my challenge

139
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,560

You mustn't agree to Qin Feng's challenge.

145
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,830
He is immeasurably powerful.

146
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,390
He said that

147
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,000
just to make you accept his challenge.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160

Qin Feng returned to the Capital

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,270
Oh, that's it?

154
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,870
If he wants to challenge me, just let him.

155
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
I don't have time to fight him.

156

Any news about Qin Chen?

161

Qin Chen has not responded

162
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,750
or agreed to fight.

163
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,960
He's been practicing at home these days

164
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,870
without going out.

165
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,910
A man his age is red-blooded.

166
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,120
He's unlikely to ignore my provocation.

167
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,960
It seems

168
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,240
that he's practicing hard at home these days

169
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,750
to prepare to battle against me.

170
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,480
Let's go.

171
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,910
Yes.

172
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,120
I'll wait for him
on the life-and-death platform.

173
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,480
Get out of the way!

174
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,480
My brother, Qin Feng, is here.

175

Look, there he is.

176
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,390
Geez, he really comes.

177
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,440
With Qin Feng's capability,

178
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,750
defeating Qin Chen is a walk in the park.

179
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,480
If Qin Chen has the nerve to come,

180
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,630
he'll definitely embarrass himself.

181
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,120
Open your eyes later

182
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,630
and see how my brother

183
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,910
is going to teach Qin Chen a lesson.

184
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,790
Mr. Qin.

185
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,270
Many people

186

are waiting for you
at the life-and-death platform.

187
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,390
Miss Xiao,

188
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,840
you're quite concerned
about the Qins' family matters.

189
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,150
Even an outsider like me

190
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,270
finds your family matters

191
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,240
quite interesting.

192
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,910
Is everything I want ready?

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,790
Liu Guang.

194
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,870
Bring over the medicinal herbs
that Mr. Qin wants.

195
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,840
Mr. Qin, have a look.

196
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,150
Did I miss anything?

197
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,550
So, Mr. Qin?

198
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,720
Is everything correct?

199
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,960
Miss Xiao,

200
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,550
I don't think this is appropriate.

201
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,720
What a boring man.

202
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,030
[Is he a man?]

203
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,870
[A stunningly beautiful woman]

204
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,790
[is right in front of him.]

205
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,000
[Yet, all he sees is the herbs.]

206
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,600
You have all the ingredients you need.

207
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,390
I wonder

208
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,670
what kind of pill you want to make?

209
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,270
Grade Three Body Establishment Pill,

210
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,000
Body Condensation Pill,

211
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
and Body Boost Pill

212
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,200
I know Body Establishment Pill.

213
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,590
After taking it,

214
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,000
it can strengthen
a martial artist's meridians and body.

215
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,440
While Body Condensation Pill

216
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,870
is a kind of pill
that condenses one's physical strength.

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,510
As for the Body Boost Pill,

218
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,750
it's the first time I've heard of it.

219
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,240
Body Boost Pill

220
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,280
can speed up a martial artist's cultivation.

221
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,200
But it's extremely dangerous

222
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,550
as it can cause

223
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,480
the martial artist's meridians to burst.

224
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,000
Why do you want to refine these three pills?

225
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,240
Well,

226
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,960
it's none of your concern.

227
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,870
Just help me refine them.

228
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,550
I can give you

229
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,630
the Body Establishment Pill today.

230
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,080
Though I know the recipe

231
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,030
for Body Condensation Pill,

232
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,030
I've never refined it before.

233
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,960
As for the Body Boost Pill,

234
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,440
I don't even know the recipe.

235
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,630
How am I supposed to refine it?

236
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,910
Miss Xiao, don't worry.

237
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,750
Just prepare me an alchemy room,

238
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,120
and I'll guide you.

239
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,960
Mr. Qin.

240
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,870
Miss Xiao is a Grade Three Alchemist.

241
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,510
You, a Grade One Alchemist,

242
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,200
want to guide her to refine a pill.

243
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,200
This…

244
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,960
It doesn't matter.

245
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,630
Since Mr. Qin is so confident,

246
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,600
let's go straight to my refining room.

247
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,660
[The alchemy room in Dan Pavilion]

248
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,870
First, summon three cauldrons.

249
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,000
What?

250
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,150
Three cauldrons?

251
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,360
One is enough.

252
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
One cauldron?

253
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,910
It'll take ages.

254
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,270
It is faster to refine three pills
at the same time.

255
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,440
Mr. Qin,

256
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,030
with my cultivation prowess,

257
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,390
I won't be able to refine the pills

258
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
in three cauldrons at the same time.

259
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,840
I told you I'll guide you.

260
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,600
You just need to do as I say.

261
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,910
Miss Xiao.

262
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,270
Set up the fire-gathering array

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,840
to heat up the cauldrons.

264
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,960
Next,

265
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,840
put the ingredients
for Grade Three Body Establishment Pill,

266
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,000
Body Condensation Pill,
and Body Boost Pill

267
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,960
into the three cauldrons respectively.

268
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,390
Put in all the ingredients?

269
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,440
The cauldrons will probably explode
with so many ingredients

270
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,670
reacting in them.

271
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,670
Mr. Qin, are you sure?

272
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
I don't like

273
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,000
to repeat myself.

274
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,790
[Forget it.]

275
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,390
[Mr. Qin insists on doing this.]

276
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,080
[I can only listen to him.]

277
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,790
Well…

278
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,390
The flame temperatures of the three cauldrons

279
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,510
are completely different.

280
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,510
How on earth did he do this?

281
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,510
What fire control technique is this?

282
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,150
This…

283
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,320
This…

284
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,320
Miss Xiao.

285
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't daydream when refining a pill.

286
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,390
Quickly control the array.

287
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,350
Oh no.

288
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,440
The cauldrons are going to explode.

289
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,160
Mr. Qin,

290
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,350
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,480
Who told you to stop?

292
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,680
Control the reaction of the herbs now.

293
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,750
But we failed.

294
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,640
Who said we failed?

295
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,960
What has just happened?

296
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,920
Why did they stabilize all of a sudden?

297
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,880
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

298
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,440
Mr. Qin,

299
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,160
what kind of alchemy technique did you use?

300
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,480
I can't figure it out.

301
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,000
It's very simple.

302
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,350
I'll show you later.

303
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,680
Focus on refining the pills first.

304
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,440
Very simple?

305
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,350
The eruption

306
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,640
is an overreaction caused by losing the balance

307
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,720
of the medicinal herbs

308
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,070
during the fusion process.

309
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,400
Alchemists must not inject

310
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
their spiritual power to reverse the fusion

311
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,550
at this point.

312
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,830
Instead,

313
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,270
they should guide

314
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,440
the medicinal herbs back
to the fusion process

315
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,110
based on the properties of the herbs.

316
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,030
As for

317
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,030
the fire control technique, it is simpler.

318
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,000
Any one of the refining arrays

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,070
consists of 108 basic array lines,

320
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,160
including

321
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,590
36 main array lines

322
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,350
and 72 supplementary array lines.

323
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,080
These basic array lines
are integrated with each other

324
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,510
to form a complete refining array.

325
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,110
By manipulating
the 72 supplementary array lines,

326
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,000
one can adjust the flame's temperature

327
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,960
and intensity in any part of the array.

328
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Your control over the fire array lines

329
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,440
is too rough.

330
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,750
And you didn't grasp

331
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,720
the alchemy theories at all.

332
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,750
In the field of alchemy,

333
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,400
you're not even at the beginner level.

334
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,830
A real Alchemist

335
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,110
must subtly integrate their spiritual power

336
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,510
into the refining process
based on understanding the herbs

337
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,440
instead of forcibly interfering with them.

338
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,790
During the refining process,

339
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,920
every bit of spiritual power

340
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
must be used wisely.

341
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,440
[This is totally different
from my previous refining.]

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,240
[Mr. Qin's refining]

343
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,310
[is at master level.]

344
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,160
Condense!

345
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,550
Surprisingly, we made it.

346
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,480
Three kinds of Grade Three pills

347
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,680
are successfully refined

348
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,920
in separate cauldrons at the same time.

349
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,640
This…

350
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,960
This is a miracle.

351
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,270
The end products are junk.

352
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,680
They're of such low purity.

353
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,160
What are you rejoicing at?

354
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,110
These 20 pills

355
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,550
are full and round

356
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,400
with a refreshing fragrance.

357
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,240
And there are pill veins on them.

358
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,720
Each is of superior quality.

359
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,750
Yes, Mr. Qin.

360
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,830
These are superior-quality pills.

361
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,680
Just superior?

362
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,550
They would be thrown away

363
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,160
in the past.

364
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,310
Now,

365
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,240
I can only purify them.

366
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,000
The pills have taken shape.

367
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,790
How to purify them?

368
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,310
Well…

369
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,880
This technique…

370
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,200
The pill veins

371
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,680
and the integration of the medicine

372
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,680
have improved to at least 90% of the best.

373
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,440
It's not as good as the Premium Class Vital Dan.

374
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,680
But it's much better than before.

375
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,830
I've got the pills.

376
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,720
Miss Xiao, please prepare

377
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,310
a cultivation room for me.

378
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,960
Mr. Qin, why don't you go
to my cultivation room?

379
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,240
Mr. Qin, please.

380
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,550
Mr. Qin.

381
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,350
This is my private cultivation room.

382
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,480
Feel free to use it.

383
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,590
I'll get started.

384
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,200
It's so hot.

385
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,640
When will Qin Chen come?

386
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,320
Even if he doesn't want to fight,

387
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,630
he should come and tell everyone.

388
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,400
That's right.

389
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,590
Qin Chen will definitely come.

390
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,030
Qin Fen.

391
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,110
Look at you.

392
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,270
You'd better go home and rest.

393
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,750
Li Qingfeng,

394
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,440
compared with my brother,

395
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,720
your prowess is far inferior

396
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,720
to his.

397
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
[If Qin Chen calls himself a man,]

398
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,960
[he's unlikely to ignore my provocation.]

399
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,830
[When he comes,]

400
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,160
[I'll only need to provoke him a little]

401
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,200
[and he'll definitely jump on stage
to fight me on impulse.]

402
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,510
[Then…]

403
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,510
It's so hot.

404
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,680
Let's chill at home

405
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,590
and come back later.

406
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
I can't wait any longer.

407
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,790
It's too hot.

408
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,480
I can't stand it.

409
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,750
Why don't you come
to Qin Chen's residence with me

410
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,920
and drag

411
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,920
that coward out?

412
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,590
Come with me.

413
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,510
Let's go.

414
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,440
Come on.

415
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,000
Let's go.

416
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,640
Let's go.

417
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,790
Let's go.

418
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,350
Get out of the way.

419
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,510
Let's go.

420
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,590
What's going on?

421
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,350
Who breaks in?

422
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,720
We came to find Qin Chen.

423
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,160
Tell Qin Chen to come out!

424
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,830
I am Wei Zhen, son of Marquis Wei Qi.

425
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,070
We're here

426
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,550
to find Qin Chen.

427
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,550
Chief Zuo,

428
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,440
please tell Qin Chen to come out.

429
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,680
I don't care who you are.

430
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,720
This is a private residence.

431
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,720
Step back now.

432
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,030
Zuo Li.

433
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,160
What are you doing?

434
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,160
Whoever crosses the line,

435
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,110
I'll detain them all,

436
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,960
No matter who they are.

437
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,480
How dare you!

438
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,960
You're just a Deputy Chief

439
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,200
of the West Town City Guard.

440
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,830
Do you think you rule the place?

441
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,200
Wait.

442
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,680
I am Qin Fen,
the second son of the Qin family.

443
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,830
I wonder

444
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,200
if Chief Zuo Li

445
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,510
can do me a favor.

446
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
I don't care which family you're from.

447
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,440
Those who cross the line

448
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,880
will be killed without mercy.

449
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,200
I was slapped again?

450
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,510
A bunch of insolent pricks.

451
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,000
Beat them up.

452
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,350
What's going on?

453
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,110
What's going on?

454
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,110
How dare you attack the City Guard.

455
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,550
Detain them!

456
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,790
Yes!

457
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,400
Chief Zuo,

458
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,030
why don't you let them go?

459
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,070
Who do you think you are?

460
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,640
You framed Mr. Qin.

461
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,880
Even the Emperor can't persuade me.

462
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,480
Heaven… Heaven level.

463
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,510
Heaven level.

464
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,550
He reached Heaven level.

465
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,240
Didn't Zuo Li fail to break through back then

466
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,030
due to a hidden disease?

467
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,750
How come…

468
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,720
A Heaven-level martial artist
at the age of thirties.

469
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,550
Li Qingfeng,

470
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,480
did Zuo Li really reach Heaven level?

471
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,550
If you don't believe it,

472
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,440
go and find out yourself.

473
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,720
I think

474
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,110
Zuo Li not only reaches Heaven level,

475
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,510
but he is also very close

476
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,270
to the mid-stage of Heaven level.

477
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,510
You have a death wish.

478
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,590
Chief Zuo,

479
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,200
we didn't mean to offend you.

480
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,720
Please simmer down.

481
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,200
Get lost!

482
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,590
Let's go.

483
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,920
Let's go.

484
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,590
I'll say this once.

485
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,350
Get out of here

486
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,750
within five breaths.

487
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,350
Or don't blame me for being ruthless.

488
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,510
Why it's always me?

489
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,840
Why isn't he here yet?

490
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,280
For sure, he doesn't dare to come.

491
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,820
He should have come long ago.

492
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,110
Out of the way.

493
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,960
Step aside.

494
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,960
We've been waiting from morning till noon.

495
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,720
Who would know Qin Chen never showed up?

496
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,000
Haven't you embarrassed yourself enough
at Qin Chen's place?

497
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,040
You still come here.

498
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,350
I don't know what Qin Chen did.

499
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,160
Even a Heaven-level martial artist
is loyal to him.

500
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,720
I'm telling you.

501
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
From now on,

502
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,350
stop provoking Qin Chen.

503
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,880
Or I will break your leg.

504
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,590
Didn't you run the fastest
when we went to his place?

505
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,270
I…

506
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,440
Keep talking rubbish
and see how I'll deal with you.

507
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,510
Let's go home.

508
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,790
Come.

509
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,550
