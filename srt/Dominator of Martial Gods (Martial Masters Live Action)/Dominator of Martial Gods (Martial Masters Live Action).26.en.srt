is inside this cave?

Oh no.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,070
We must go in there now!

What are you doing?

I don't want you to be cold.

Someone is coming.

what happened to you.

43
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,120
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

44
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,360
Zixun, what are you saying?

45
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,360
I was attacked by
Nian Wuji's Formless Soul Poison,

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,000
and Qin Chen

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,680

Is that so?

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
Are you sure

50
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,750
that he didn't do anything to you?

Zixun!

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,750
Get dressed well.

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm glad you are okay.

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,710
Well…

55
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,080
Where are Nian Wuji and the others?

56
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,190
Why are you here?

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,630
Nian Wuji and Cao Heng

58
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,680
have died.

Did they die?

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,560
since Nian Wuji and Cao Heng died,

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,630
the Zhao and the Ghost Immortal Sect
would certainly not let this go.

70
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,160
What happened today

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,040

except among us.

Whoever goes against it

74
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,430
will be executed!

75
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,160

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,360

the Xuan

82
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,680
has lost over 70 participants this time,

83
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,950

last time, the Xuan

87
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,600
only had

88
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,680
19 people last to the end.

89
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,040
Seems like this year,

90
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,560
their result will be even more pathetic.

Princess Zixun,

92
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,160
and Qin Chen,

93
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,190
don't let anything happen to you.

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,750
Xiao Zhan,

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,750
hurry up and check it out.

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,360
Maybe another two from the Xuan.

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Zuo Tian, Wang Feng!

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Why are you two out?

General…

100
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,510
It was Zhao…

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,000
Zhao…

102
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,870
Zhao…

103
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,120
Yuchi Cheng,

104
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,270
can't you even recognize

105
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,310
your people from the Zhao?

106
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,870
Don't get too carried away!

107
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,480
Zhou Luo!

108
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,630
What's wrong with you?

109
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,160
I…

110
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm fine.

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,920
Yuchi Cheng,

112
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,870
this is the karma of the Zhao.

113
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,190
Xiao Zhan,

114
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,430
don't get too excited.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
The Zhao

116
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,390
is just

117
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,560
losing a few participants.

118
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,800
Compared to the Xuan,

119
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,240
we are way ahead of you.

120
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,040
Ling Zhong,

121
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,270
maybe

122
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,040
the next one out
is from your Ghost Immortal Sect.

123
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,310
Ridiculous.

124
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
Our Ghost Immortal Sect

125
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,160
is not as useless as

126
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,510
the Xuan.

127
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,000
Ling Xiao!

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
Why are you out?

129
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,600
What…

130
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,560
What on earth happened in there?

131
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,270
People are being sent out

132
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
one after another.

133
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,600
Could there be

134
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,720
a brawl happening inside?

135
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,000
-He's right!
-A brawl?

136
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,780
-Yes.
-Right.

137
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,560
Indeed.

138
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,480
How surprising!

139
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,600
He is from the Ghost Immortal Sect!

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,750
Xiao Zhan!

141
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,680
Just you wait!

142
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,680
This is not right.

143

The Ghost Immortal Sect apprentices

144
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,680
and the Zhao people

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,680
are knocked out in a row.

146
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,560
Looks like

147
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,240
something has happened in there.

148
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,240
I'll have a doctor treat them.

149
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,560
When they wake up,

150
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,190
we will find out

151
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,480
what exactly happened in there.

152
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,270
Doctor, hurry up!

153
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,750
You must bring him back to life.

154
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,360
How do you feel?

155
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,360
What happened in there?

156
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,600
Tell me!

157
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,790
Sir,

158
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,270
it was Prince Zhao Wei from the Xuan.

159
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,510
He brought people

160
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,320
to surround our Zhao people.

161
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,960
What?

162
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,440
The Xuan still has the power to fight back!

163
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,320
What about Prince Heng and Nian Wuji?

164
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,080
Why didn't those two worthless ones

165
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,440
stop their attacks?

166
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,720
We haven't seen

167
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,600
Prince Heng

168
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,270
and Nian Wuji for a long time.

169
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,630
These two useless guys

170
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,510
must have gone somewhere to mess around.

171
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,910
How many attackers from the Xuan?

172
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,000
I…

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,960
I didn't see clearly.

174
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,870
Trash!

175
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,840
A whole bunch of you!

176
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,000
Save him, still.

177
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,150
Time is up.

178
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,000
The test is over.

179
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,440
Li Qingfeng is out.

180
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,120
Go look for the prince and princess!

181
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,670
Yes!

182
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,630
Your Highness.

183
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,080
Princess.

184
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,870
Stop Li Qingfeng!

185
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,240
What is going on?

186
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,000
Li Qingfeng tried to
kill me in the trial area.

187
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,510
If it wasn't for Wang Qiming,

188
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,360
I'm afraid

189
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,080
I would have died in there.

190
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,080
Really?

191
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,000
Yan Huai!

192
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,000
Capture this man.

193
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,440
I will interrogate him later.

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,390
Yes,

195
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,120
Your Highness.

196
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,630
King of Lingwu.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,240
It…

198
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,600
Princess,

199
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,510
we are still at the competition.

200
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,960
Let's talk about it when we get back.

201
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,030
Let's go.

202
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,870
How are these brats

203
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,480
still alive?

204
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,120
Prince Heng and Nian Wuji are so useless!

205
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,200
They can't even do such a small thing!

206
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,960
No!

207
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,960
They should have come out a long time ago.

208
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,480
Yuchi Cheng.

209
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,120
Why are

210
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,270
Young Master and Prince Heng

211
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,150
still inside?

212
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,480
Go…

213
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,240
go look for them!

214
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,240
Don't panic.

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,150
Let me find them.

216
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,390
Did you find them?

217
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,000
No.

218
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,270
Look more carefully!

219
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,150
No.

220
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,150
Still no.

221
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,870
Is there

222
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,790
something wrong with the array?

223
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,080
Yes.

224
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,510
It must be the array.

225
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,480
Looks like

226
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,200
the Zhao and the Ghost Immortal Sect

227
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,390
lost many talents.

228
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,840
In the last Competition of Five Kingdoms,

229
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,960
the Xuan lost the most people.

230
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,670
But the table has turned this time.

231
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,840
Not only

232
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,440
their ordinary participants
didn't make it,

233
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,630
but also talents
like Cao Heng and Nian Wuji

234
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,870
were still trapped inside.

235
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,910
Could they be

236
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,320
dead already?

237
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,270
Not possible.

238
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,270
They are high-level pros,

239
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,150
with jade plates even.

240
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,000
Who would be able to kill them?

241
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,150
Even if they did encounter danger,

242
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,910
they could teleport.

243
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,270
Are they talking about Cao Heng and Nian Wuji?

244
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,150
They have died already.

245
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,030
We saw their bodies.

246
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,240
What?

247
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,480
What did you say?

248
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,720
Yuchi Cheng!

249
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,630
What are you going to do to my You people?

250
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,910
Wei Tianming!

251
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
He said our Prince Heng of the Zhao had died.

252
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,750
I

253
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
just wanted to make sure.

254
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,360
What did you see?

255
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,320
Make it clear to him.

256
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,390
Here's what happened:

257
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,200
The day before yesterday,
when we were practicing,

258
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,270
we suddenly heard the sound of fighting nearby,

259
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,270
so we rushed over.

260
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,360
However, when we arrived there,

261
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,440
the battle was already over.

262
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,910
We saw the bodies of
Cao Heng and Nian Wuji on the ground.

263
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,320
No way.

264
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,510
That's not true.

265
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,870
It's not possible.

266
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,200
Are you sure they were Prince Heng
and Young Master Nian?

267
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,270
Yes!

268
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,960
And they all saw them too.

269
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,240
I saw them too.

270
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,790
They were indeed Cao Heng

271
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,630
and Nian Wuji.

272
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,550
There were other martial artists

273
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,150
from the Zhao
and the Ghost Immortal Sect there.

274
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,630
How…

275
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,870
How is that possible?

276
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,240
Right,

277
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,000
where is Qin Feng?

278
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,200
He is right there.

279
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,200
What happened to his arm?

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,360
Who injured him?

281
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,670
Qin Feng.

282
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,240
Qin Feng!

283
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,240
Your arm!

284
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,790
I came across a despicable blood beast
in the trial area.

285
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,440
It snuck up on me
while I didn't pay attention.

286
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,440
Qin Chen,

287
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,030
am I right?

288
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,550
Maybe

289
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,240
Heaven thinks

290
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,720
your heart is evil

291
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,750
and wants you to
behave humbly from now on.

292
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,510
This time, all thanks to you, Qin Chen,

293
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,030
so the Xuan could
go through the test so smoothly.

294
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,680
If you didn't

295
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,920
contrive to kill Cao Heng and Nian Wuji,

296
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,550
I'm afraid

297
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
the Xuan would suffer a heavy loss.

298
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,110
Chen!

299
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,400
Qin Chen did it…

300
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,110
What?

301
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,680
Qin Feng, what nonsense are you saying?

302
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,480
I saw it with my own eyes.

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,110
Princess Lingshan,

304
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,830
you were there too.

305
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,030
Did you forget?

306
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,680
You…

307
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,920
Get him!

308
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
You bastard!

309
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,880
I'll kill you!

310
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,790
Get back!

311
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
Xiao Zhan,

312
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,720
your Xuan kid

313
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,240
dares to kill the prince of the Zhao!

314
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,070
I will kill this evil bastard today,

315
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
even at the cost of my life.

316
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,270
Stop it!

317
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,640
Who do you think you are

318
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,030
to try to stop me?

319
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,590
Get lost!

320
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Qin Chen, you rascal!

321
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,400
Go to hell!

322
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,480
Chen!

323
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,270
Be careful!

324
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,070
You're courting death!

325
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,000
Stay back, you all!

326
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,920
Stop it!

327
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Wei Tianming,

328
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,920
this brat murdered
Prince Cao Heng of the Zhao.

329
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,920
Today,

330
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,160
I must kill him!

331
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,550
Wei Tianming,

332
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,000
stay back.

333
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,440
If this brat does not die,

334
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,200
how can my Ghost Immortal Sect
keep a foothold in the Northwest?

335
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,920
The Competition of Five Kingdoms is over,

336
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,480
And all parties shall not attack afterwards.

337
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,030
This is the rule set down back then.

338
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,200
Who dares to disobey?

339
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,960
You…

340
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,200
Who said that Cao Heng and Nian Wuji

341
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,030
were killed by me?

342
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,510
In the trial area,

343
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,200
you fought Cao Heng and Nian Wuji,

344
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,270
plus what Qin Feng said.

345
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,030
Who else could it be if you weren't the killer?

346
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,110
Only idiots like you two

347
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,790
would believe Qin Feng.

348
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,240
-You!
-What!

349
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,000
What do you mean!

350
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,480
The whole the Xuan kingdom knows

351
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,110
that Qin Feng has grudges against me.

352
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
Moreover, he kept saying that

353
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,000
he saw me poisoning them with his own eyes,

354
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,030
indicating that he was ambushed at the scene.

355
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,640
Also,

356
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,310
in terms of strength,

357
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,550
Qin Feng is more like the murderer.

358
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,270
Among the five kingdoms,

359
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,830
except You Qianxue,

360
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,310
only Qin Feng

361
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,550
has the ability to kill Cao Heng and Nian Wuji.

362
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
Qin Chen,

363
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,200
don't you try to quibble!

364
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,790
Cao Heng and Nian Wuji
were unable to gather vital energy

365
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,680
after being poisoned by you

366
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,680
and were killed by your sword.

367
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,110
This friend here, please describe

368
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,590
how Cao Heng and Nian Wuji looked
after they died.

369
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,030
I…

370
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,640
Don't worry, just tell the truth.

371
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,830
The corpses of Cao Heng
and Nian Wuji were tragic.

372
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,640
They should have experienced
a fierce battle.

373
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,960
As for whether they were poisoned or not,

374
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,830
I don't know.

375
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,440
You heard him, everyone.

376
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,350
Cao Heng and Nian Wuji

377
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,270
died of a battle.

378
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,400
However,

379
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,030
my meager cultivation

380
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,440
made it difficult

381
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,440
to escape from the two.

382
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,000
[Damn it.]

383
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,920
[In order to make it more convincing,]

384
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,240
[I deliberately said
that the two died of poisoning.]

385
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,070
[Now there is trouble.]

386
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,030
After poisoning,
you naturally tried your best to buy time,

387
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,510
and when the poison took effect,

388
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,000
you made your move to take their lives.

389
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,030
What's wrong with that?

390
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,310
Qin Feng,

391
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,960
you still don't realize it.

392
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,070
You kept saying that
you were at the scene at that time,

393
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,440
but you just stood by
when Princess Lingshan

394
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,270
and I were in danger.

395
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,960
After Princess Lingshan
and I narrowly escaped,

396
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,550
Cao Heng and Nian Wuji were killed

397
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,030
after a fierce battle.

398
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,400
And you,

399
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,200
Qin Feng,

400
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,240
coincidentally, injured your arm.

401
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,030
I don't care whether
the people here believe it or not.

402
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,480
Anyway, I think this

403
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,350
may be too much of a coincidence.

404
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,680
I think

405
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,590
Qin Chen's words make sense.

406
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,270
Yeah!

407
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,240
Hey, friend,

408
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,590
did you think of anything?

409
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
No, no, nothing.

410
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,510
Spit it out!

411
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,790
Does it have anything to do
with Prince Heng's death?

412
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,960
Yuchi Cheng,

413
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,680
what are you going to do this time?

414
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,070
Nothing,

415
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,960
just trying to figure out
how Prince Heng died.

416
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,640
Wei Tianming,

417
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,720
if your disciples of the You conceal the truth,

418
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,070
I would definitely not spare you!

419
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,960
Just tell him.

420
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,160
I saw

421
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,680
a piece of cloth on the ground.

422
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,030
The cloth

423
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
looked just like
what Qin Feng was wearing before.

424
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,000
Qin Feng!

425
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,000
I understand now.

426
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Qin Feng

427
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,720
must be hiding at the scene

428
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,960
and watching the two sides fight.

429
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,480
After Qin Chen and Princess Lingshan
made a narrow escape,

430
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,830
he secretly killed them.

431
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,720
At that time, the two geniuses
must have been exhausted.

432
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,960
How could they resist

433
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,310
Qin Feng's sneak attack?

434
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,790
Fortunately, the two
had extraordinary martial prowess,

435
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,750
and before dying,
they desperately injured Qin Feng.

436
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,790
This battle was really tragic.

437
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,920
Don't believe his crap!

438
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,830
That's not what happened.

439
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,400
You said I killed Cao Heng and Nian Wuji,

440
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,550
but how did you escape the fight?

441
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,440
Luckily, I had a trans-space talisman

442
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,510
so Princess Lingshan and I could get away.

443
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,720
After using the trans-space talisman,

444
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,510
the space fluctuation
did not fade for a long time.

445
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,720
If you do not believe me,

446
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,510
you can inspect the scene

447
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,310
to see if there are any traces

448
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,790
of using the trans-space talisman.

449
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,240
You!

450
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,640
Everyone,

451
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
let me explain.

452
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,790
Qin Feng!

453
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,510
How dare you kill Prince Heng!

454
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,200
Young Master…

455
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,510
Was he really

456
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,830
killed by you?

457
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,590
Qin Chen!

458
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,310
You are so vicious.

459
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,110
It was you who killed them,

460
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,440
but you framed me.

461
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Qin Feng,

462
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,640
the real vicious one

463
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,160
has always been you.

464
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,790
Although

465
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,480
you were heartless to me today,

466
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,440
I cannot be unjust to you.

467
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,400
Life and death are determined

468
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,110
by destiny in the life and death test.

469
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
The Zhao and the Ghost Immortal Sect,
you bully the weak with your power

470
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,640
and break the rules.

471
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,350
How can I stand by and do nothing?

472
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,510
If you two want to kill Qin Feng,

473
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,200
you have to step over my corpse first.

474
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,310
There are no cowards

475
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,310
in the Xuan Kingdom.

476
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,480
At this point,

477
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,680
Qin Chen is still speaking up for Qin Feng.

478
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,640
His grace and generosity are admirable!

479
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,790
Though falsely accused,

480
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,270
he still considers the overall situation

481
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,440
and repays resentment with virtue.
He is truly righteous

482
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,070
and admirable!

483
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,270
Look at Qin Chen, and then Qin Feng.

484
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,270
These two have an enormous difference!

485
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,350
You despicable Xuan people!

486
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,160
Even killing all of you

487
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,480
wouldn't be enough to avenge Prince Heng!

488
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,510
Young Master wouldn't die for nothing.

489
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,200
Wei Tianming!

490
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,350
Why would you still stop me!

491
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,750
The five together made the rules

492
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,110
of the Competition of Five Kingdoms.

493
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,680
If you two stubbornly
persist in doing the wrong thing,

494
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,590
don't blame me for being ruthless.

495
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,680
You!

496
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,400
Fine!

497
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,480
The Zhao Kingdom

498
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,510
will never let today's matter be over.

499
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,110
Qin Feng,

500
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,550
your life

501
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,240
shall be taken

502
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,790
by our Ghost Immortal Sect!

503
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,310
Just you wait!

504
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,510
Looks like

505
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,270
the Five Kingdoms are going to
be plunged into turmoil again.

506
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,790
Everyone,

507
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,440
the Trial of Life And Death ends here.

508
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,720
Half a year later

509
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,960
will be the arena contest.

510
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,110
I will await your arrival

511
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,550
in Ancient Southern Capital.
