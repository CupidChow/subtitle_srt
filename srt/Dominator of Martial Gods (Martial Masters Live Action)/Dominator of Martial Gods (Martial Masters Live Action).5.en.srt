00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,790
You're younger than my little brother,

189
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,280
so I guess it's appropriate

190
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,430
to call you that.

191
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,400
All right.

192
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,190
Please prepare a bloodline chamber for me.

193
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,310
Young man,

194
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,190
today's host for the bloodline ritual
is Master Chen Fan.

195
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
Master Chen Fan

196
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,520
is helping others awaken their bloodlines.

197
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
You may need to wait for a while.

198
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,000
I think you made a mistake.

199
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,880
I'm not here for Master Chen Fan.

200
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,910
I just need you to prepare

201
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,280
a bloodline chamber for me.

202
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,670
Bloodline chamber?

203
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,120
You're not trying

204
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,400
to awaken your bloodline
by yourself, are you?

205
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,310
The awakening ritual is very complicated.

206
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,590
If anything goes wrong,

207
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,120
it could do serious damage to your body

208
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,280
or even endanger your life.

209
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,240
You don't need to worry about all that.

210
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,000
I just want

211
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,670
to study the awakening ritual.

212
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,590
Nothing dangerous will happen.

213
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,640
If this is the case,

214
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,190
please follow me.

215
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,880
It's 500 silver coins
for 2 hours in a chamber.

216
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,670
Would you please sign here?

217
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,980
[Bloodline chamber]

218
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,000
Manager Liu,

219
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,760
this batch of bloodline instruments

220
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,040
was delivered here

221
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,550
by the president from the Martial Domain.

222
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,430
It's said that

223
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,760
[Li Wenyu, Bloodline Hold Land's chief deacon]
the bloodline practitioners over there

224
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,430
all use advanced instruments like this.

225
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,710
[Bloodline instrument]

226
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,320
[Bloodline instrument]
The operation

227
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,880
[Liu Tong, Bloodline Hold Land's manager]
of this instrument is complicated.

228
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,400
Even Mr. President himself is still studying it.

229
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,310
It would be best if you kept a good watch.

230
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,190
If anything goes wrong,

231
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,400
I'll hold you accountable.

232
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,280
Yes.

233
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,400
Deacon Li,

234
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,760
you can rest assured.

235
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,120
I'll give this order to my men right away.

236
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,000
I promise that

237
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,430
not even a mosquito

238
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,670
can fly into this room.

239
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,280
That's good then.

240
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,910
The president
still needs me for something.

241
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,910
I'll get going now.

242
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,040
Please.

243
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,950
They say this bloodline instrument

244
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,790
can detect bloodline concentrations

245
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,000
as low as one in ten thousand.

246
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,190
How impressive.

247
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,310
Manager Liu!

248
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,240
Is Manager Liu here?

249
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,830
I'm right here.

250
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,190
What's the fuss about?

251
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,910
When Master Chen Fan
was awakening bloodlines for someone,

252
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,710
the bloodline instrument malfunctioned.

253
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,400
Please go check now.

254
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,950
What?

255
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,520
Master Chen Fan is hosting

256
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,790
the ritual
for all youngsters coming today.

257
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,950
If something goes wrong,

258
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,950
it'll definitely affect
the holy land's reputation.

259
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,950
Come on.

260
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,520
Take me there now!

261
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,190
Yes.

262
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,830
This is the bloodline chamber.

263
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,310
All right.

264
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll use this chamber then.

265
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,400
Well…

266
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,070
Who could have thought

267
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,590
they had such an instrument here
in the Xuan Kingdom?

268
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,640
This is literally help from heaven.

269
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
Awakening yourself

270
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,350
is like a surgeon
operating on his own body.

271
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,240
It's a forbidden act.

272
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,550
Ordinary bloodline practitioners

273
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
will never dare to do things like this.

274
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,310
Not even a hint of Bloodline Power was felt.

275
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,760
Do I have no bloodline in me at all?

276
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,760
I don't believe it.

277
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,040
This is impossible.

278
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,440
Bloodlines are inherited

279
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,590
from both parents.

280
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,310
In ancient times,

281
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
everybody had bloodlines in them.

282
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,920
But even when inherited bloodlines

283
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,830
become thinner over time,

284
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,440
something like the zero bloodline

285
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,790
will be impossible.

286
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,240
I don't believe it.

287
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,760
I can't have no bloodline at all.

288
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,680
Right.

289
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,920
Spell of Blood Inhibition.

290
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,460
[Dongfang Qing,
Bloodline Hold Land's President]

291
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,680
I don't have the slightest clue

292
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,350
about how to use
this advanced bloodline instrument.

293
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,200
What should I do then?

294
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,490
An enemy attack?

295
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,330
What…

296
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,810
What…

297
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,400
What the heck is going on?

298
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,680
A thunder calamity?

299
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,360
Which top cultivator

300
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,810
is triggering the heavenly thunder

301
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,590
as if mobilizing a thousand troops?

302
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,430
Come on, get ready for war!

303
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,080
Hold on.

304
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
It's not an enemy attack.

305
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,560
This thunder anomaly

306
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,480
is coming from the downtown direction.

307
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,960
Who exactly is it?

308
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,040
[King of Lingwu of the Xuan Kingdom, Xiao Zhan]
He's causing a resonance inside me.

309
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,390
My vital energy is flowing with it too.

310
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,350
Go and investigate in the city now.

311
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,830
Do be careful on this mission.

312
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,350
Yes.

313
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,910
Dean!

314
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,320
Dean.

315
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,320
Dean,

316
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,280
[Star Academy's dean, Chu Wei Chen]
look at this strange weather.

317
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,760
Stop making a fuss.

318
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,910
I saw it.

319
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,670
This is

320
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,830
a once-in-a-century anomaly.

321
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,480
What is this?

322
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,240
Such mighty power.

323
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,870
Could it be that
a formidable martial cultivator

324
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,280
just passed by our kingdom?

325
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,320
Why am I seeing such dim lightning?

326
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,040
Could my bloodline
be the weakest grade one?

327
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:56,720
No.

328
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,150
However, considering the intimidating vibe

329
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,590
it gave off just now,

330
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,280
it can never be mediocre.

331
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
In terms of power alone,

332
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,110
although it's only grade one,

333
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,150
it's way more powerful than
ordinary grade three bloodlines.

334
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,560
How strange.

335
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,720
How strange.

336
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,240
Young man,

337
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,720
it has already been two hours.

338
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,480
Two hours passed so soon?

339
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm really sorry,

340
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,390
but your time is up.

341
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,960
All right.

342
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,590
I'm done.

343
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,350
That's good.

344
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,590
Would you please

345
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,960
come with me for registration?

346
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,910
What are you guys doing here?

347
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,590
Who let you enter this chamber?

348
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,390
You're just a small attendant.

349
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,910
Who permitted you

350
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,870
to lead people in here?

351
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,110
Manager Liu,

352
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,590
the door of this chamber

353
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,350
was open just now.

354
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,720
I thought it was public,

355
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,670
so I didn't overthink.

356
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,560
Didn't overthink?

357
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,670
Do you know whose chamber this is?

358
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,960
It's the bloodline chamber
of Mr. President!

359
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,590
The president?

360
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,320
How dare you let other people in?

361
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,960
And you!

362
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,670
The president?

363
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,110
You fiddled
with Mr. President's instrument!

364
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,040
How audacious!

365
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,720
Someone!

366
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,520
Arrest him!

367
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,110
-Yes!
-Yes!

368
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,480
Don't move.

369
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,110
I won't escape.

370
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,870
Are you all right?

371
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,320
I'm sorry.

372
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,670
I didn't know that this chamber

373
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,800
belonged to Mr. President.

374
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,110
I've implicated you.

375
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,390
Don't worry.

376
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,000
This has nothing to do with you.

377
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
It's all my fault.

378
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,720
Don't worry.

379
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,040
It's going to be all right.

380
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,630
What exactly is going on here?

381
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,520
Deacon Li, it's them two.

382
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,870
Liu Tong,

383
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,800
is this the promise you gave me?

384
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,080
Deacon Li,

385
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,720
it has nothing to do with me.

386
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,630
It's their…

387
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,870
It's all their fault.

388
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,590
The door of this chamber was wide open,

389
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,720
and no one said it was a restricted area.

390
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,670
If someone is at fault,

391
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,110
it'll be your Bloodline Holy Land's fault.

392
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:58,960
You!

393
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,870
You broke
the president's bloodline instrument!

394
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,800
I just used it.

395
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,800
I didn't break it.

396
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,390
I…

397
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,910
What happened in the awakening chamber?

398
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,240
Do I have to come personally?

399
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,350
President.

400
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,110
Mr. President,

401
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,630
Liu Tong didn't watch closely

402
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,960
and let both of them get into

403
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,590
your new bloodline chamber.

404
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,240
I've specifically told you

405
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,720
never to let
anyone irrelevant enter this chamber.

406
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,110
You can't even do this?

407
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,000
If anything goes wrong

408
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,320
with this bloodline instrument,

409
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
you know the consequences.

410
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,590
Well…

411
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,350
Mr. President…

412
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,520
Who was it?

413
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Who turned on this bloodline instrument?

414
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,110
Well…

415
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,480
Mr. President, it's him!

416
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,110
It's this guy

417
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,390
who broke your bloodline instrument.

418
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,280
And her!

419
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,630
She brought this man in here.

420
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,350
The two of them deserve to die!

421
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,390
Was it you

422
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,720
who entered this chamber

423
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,720
and touched my bloodline instrument?

424
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,080
That's right.

425
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,040
The door was open.

426
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,240
Nobody told me that

427
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,760
I couldn't use this chamber.

428
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,560
You're still denying it.

429
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,910
Do you think you can walk in
because the door is open?

430
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,670
Do you know
how complicated this instrument is?

431
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Can you understand it?

432
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,830
Since you can't,

433
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,320
why did you touch it?

434
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,000
This is literally vandalism!

435
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,670
I suspect that

436
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,720
someone with ulterior motives sends you!

437
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Mr. President,

438
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,910
I suspect that

439
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,150
they are spies sent from the Zhao Kingdom.

440
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,590
You'll accuse me of any crime

441
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,080
to save your life.

442
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,480

443
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,110
Silence!

444
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,720
You're making a fool of yourself!

445
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,720
Sir,

446
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,630
may I ask whose disciple you are?

447
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,560
I'm Dongfang Qing,

448
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,800
the president of Bloodline Hold Land
of the Xuan Kingdom.

449
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,520
Today, being able to meet you

450
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,800
is really fortunate for me!

I'd prefer not to mention my mentor.

456
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,720
Is there anything else?

457
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,520
Well,

458
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,630
you just turned on
this bloodline instrument.

459
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,110
Could you help us turn it off?

460
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,670
I've just had this instrument,

461
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,430
and I don't really know how to operate it.

462
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,520
I'd like you to show me, please.

463
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,240
That's easy.

464
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,000
How did you turn it on?

465
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,520
Could you tell me, please?

466
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,110
I'll teach you only once.

467
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,590
Keep it in mind.

468
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,670
Do you need me for anything else?

469
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,760
No.

470
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,040
Li Wenyu,

471
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,480
walk this young man out.

472
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:03,830
Hold on.

473
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,150
Let me walk you out personally.

474
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,590
Will this lady be punished?

475
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,040
You must be joking.

476
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,720
Of course not.

477
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,110
Please.

478
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,080
All right.

479
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,720
Drive Liu Tong out of Bloodline Holy Land.

480
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
From now on,

481
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,320
he's not to enter here again.

482
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,830
Mr. President,

483
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,390
it really has nothing to do with me!

484
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,280
Do you know why I punish you?

485
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,520
It's fine if you only failed your duty,

486
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,870
but when you discovered the negligence,

487
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,870
instead of repenting,

488
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,150
you tried to resort to sophistry

489
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,800
and deny it.

490
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,350
In the end, to escape punishment,

491
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,870
you accused others
of things they didn't do.

492
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,630
If I keep letting you
stay in my holy land,

493
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,760
that will truly disgrace it!

494
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,430
Mr. President!

495
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,390
please give me another chance!

496
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,390
I'm already showing mercy
by not killing you.

497
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,520
And you still want me to spare you?

498
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,110
How shameless!
