Zhao Lingshan is reserved and restrained,

71

72

Their cultivation levels are evenly matched;

73
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,600

being from a commoner background,

78

known for its deadly effectiveness.

189
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,790
The punches flow like rushing river waters,

190
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,670
relentless and continuous,

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,520
aiming to overpower
and eliminate enemies on the battlefield.

192
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,480
Chen,

193
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,760
you must be careful.

194
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,910
What a formidable and dominant punch!

195
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,670
It's worthy of the name
that Qin Batian, the God of War,

196
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,710
created the lethal military technique.

197
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,070
If Qin Chen can't withstand that,

198
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,480
he will die or be disabled.

199
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,550
It's unbelievable that Qin Fen

200
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,590
would use such a technique
against his own brother.

201
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,070
Such swift footwork,

202
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
could it be the legendary Phantom Step?

203
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,950
Seems a little different.

204
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,430
He is so young,

205
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,670
but has cultivated his footwork to such a level.

206
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,310
I had no idea that Star Academy

207
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,670
had such a genius among us.

208
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,360
I don't believe I will lose!

209
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,710
Red Flame Bloodline!

210
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,480
Your time is up.

211
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,040
How is that possible!

212
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,310
Madam!

213
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,240
That's mine…

214
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
What…

215
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,910
Qin Fen lost!

216
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,160
What should I do…

217
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,480
Chen won!

218
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,760
Qin… Qin Chen is the winner!

219
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,830
Seriously?

220
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,480
Qin Chen won?

221
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,430
Qin Fen,

222
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,360
that attack you just suffered

223
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,310
was me avenging Lin Tian.

224
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,400
Actually, you are the only one that's the loser.

225
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,880
Without the Qin family,

226
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,640
you are worthless.

227
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,360
No!

228
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,160
I haven't lost!

229
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,120
I will never lose!

230
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,550
Chen!

231
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,760
How dare you!

232
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,790
Heart-Crushing Palm!

233
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,590
I…

234
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,070
Fen!

235
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,360
Young Master!

236
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,760
My Energy Pool…

237
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,790
I did this on purpose

238
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,720
because I knew you would sneak attack,

239
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,160
which gave me a chance to ruin your cultivation.

240
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,160
You did this to yourself.

241
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,920
You…

242
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,440
Qin Chen, you…

243
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,920
Young Master!

244
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,680
Young Master!

245
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,440
Help…

246
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,520
Help me…

247
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,550
Fen!

248
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,790
Fen!

249
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,960
How do you feel, Fen?

250
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,790
Mom!

251
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,920
My cultivation…

252
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,480
My cultivation is all gone!

253
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,000
Qin, kill him!

254
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,310
Kill this bastard!

255
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,870
Yes, Madam.

256
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,310
Kill him!

257
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,870
What is going on?

258
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,760
Stop it!

259
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,040
Why did Master Liang Yu step out to help?

260
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,830
Why is he helping?

261
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,720
Master!

262
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,240
You dare to hurt Chen!

263
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,630
Get lost!

264
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,070
Chen,

265
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,310
are you alright?

266
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm fine.

267
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,280
Great.

268
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,070
Thank you, Master Liang Yu.

269
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,520
Don't mention it.

270
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,870
It's the least I can do.

271
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,040
Luckily, I came at the right time.

272
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,960
Chen,

273
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,070
I'm relieved that you're okay.

274
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,830
Qin,

275
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,000
who gave you the audacity

276
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,520
to make a move in the arena?

277
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,630
You Qins are foolishly bold!

278
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,480
Everyone,

279
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,280
I admit that I acted impulsively earlier.

280
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,960
However, Qin Chen

281
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,790
injured my son

282
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,280
and destroyed his cultivation.

283
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,200
He will never be able

284
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,790
to practice martial arts again.

285
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,200
Shouldn't all of you

286
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,240
be held accountable as well?

287
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,920
You have the nerve to say that!

288
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,920
If it weren't for Qin Fen's malicious intentions

289
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,790
and sneak attack after the match ended,

290
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,920
how could things have ended up like this?

291
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,720
From what I can see,

292
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,110
you fail to appreciate
Chen's mercy in sparing his life.

293
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,960
Instead, you harbor resentment and malice.

294
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,680
It is truly venomous of you!

295
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,240
You!

296
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,070
Mother…

297
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
[Didn't they say that Qin Chen offended
Liang Yu at the Palace of Instruments?]

298
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,280
[But now…]

299
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,110
Qin Fen conducted a sneak attack
after the match ended,

300
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,720
which caused him to lose all his cultivation.

301
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,680
This is a self-inflicted consequence.

302
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,920
You all disregarded the reasons

303
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,830
and disrupted the rules of the Star Academy.

304
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,390
Fen! Fen!

305
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,000
Considering that

306
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
this incident did not
result in serious consequences,

307
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,960
I urge you to take Qin Fen and leave quickly.

308
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,760
As for you,

309
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,000
I will spare you for now.

310
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
If it happens again,

311
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,110
I will punish you severely.

312
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,200
Alright.

313
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,110
Fine.

314
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,150
Qin Chen,

315
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,240
the pain you inflicted upon my son today,

316
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,150
I assure you,

317
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,480
I will repay it upon you
a thousandfold in the future.

318
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,630
Let's go.

319
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,310
Qin Chen,

320
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,760
are you okay?

321
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,350
I'm fine.

322
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,720
Thank you, sir.

323
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,760
As long as you are okay.

324
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,720
Since you are fine,

325
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,960
prepare for the rest of the test well.

326
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,680
Yes.

327
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,680
But sir,

328
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,350
I want to report Mentor Ge Hong.

329
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,920
It is true that Ge Hong's failure
to intervene in time and stop Qin

330
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,350
was somewhat negligent.

331
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,150
Ge Hong!

332
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,150
Yes, sir.

333
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,720
The upcoming matches

334
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,390
have nothing to do with you anymore.

335
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,870
Go back and reflect on your actions.

336
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,480
It was my negligence

337
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,790
for not intervening in time.

338
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,590
Mr. Chu,

339
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,630
I would like to report

340
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,110
the incident of Mentor Ge Hong
conspiring with the Qin family

341
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,520
to deliberately trap me.

342
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,240
Qin Chen,

343
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,790
I did panic

344
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,870
and failed to act in time,

345
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,630
but you said that I colluded with the Qin family

346
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,630
is absolutely false!

347
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,480
Even though you are eloquent,

348
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,110
you can't conceal the truth.

349
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,960
Mr. Chu,

350
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
I suggest detaining Mentor Ge Hong now

351
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,590
and conducting an investigation.

352
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,280
Qin… Qin Chen,

353
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,200
I won't be civil with you anymore

354
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,960
if you continue to talk nonsense!

355
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,150
Qin Chen,

356
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,440
you claim that
Mentor Ge Hong tried to set you up.

357
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,870
Where is the evidence?

358
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,150
Mr. Chu,

359
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,590
all you need to do is check the tablets,

360
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,310
and then you will understand the truth.

361
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,310
Mr. Chu,

362
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,870
you must trust me!

363
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,790
If I have no grudges or conflicts with Qin Chen,

364
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,590
how could I possibly hurt him on purpose?

365
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,310
Bring the tablets over.

366
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,110
Qin Chen,

367
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,920
falsely accusing a mentor of the academy
is a serious offense.

368
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,110
Do you understand that?

369
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,310
I understand the gravity of the situation,

370
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,590
and I am willing to accept the consequences.

371
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,110
[Qin Chen, Qin Fen]

372
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,830
Ge Hong,

373
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,630
what are these?

374
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,110
Mr. Chu,

375
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,240
I have no idea.

376
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,760
I don't know why

377
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,310
there are marks on their tablets!

378
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,310
It's also possible that there was a mistake

379
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,200
during the preparation process.

380
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,830
Mentor Ge Hong, you are so smart.

381
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,870
The dean hasn't said anything yet,

382
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,110
but you already know

383
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,040
there are marks on Qin Fen's tablet and mine.

384
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,040
You…

385
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,870
I…

386
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,630
Guards!

387
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Detain him.

388
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,440
-Yes.
-Yes.

389
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,630
Mr. Chu!

390
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,520
I was wronged!

391
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,830
You wronged me, Mr. Chu!

392
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,240
Qin Chen,

393
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,110
if I find out

394
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,070
there is collusion between them,

395
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,720
I promise

396
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,720
I'll make things fair for you.

397
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,200
Okay.

398
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,150
I'd like to trust you, Mr. Chu.

399
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,790
Chen,

400
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,630
let me walk you out.

401
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,040
It's getting more interesting.

402
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,200
Chen,

403
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,310
I'm glad you are okay.

404
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,000
Master Liang,

405
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,390
what else can I help you with?

406
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,480
No,

407
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,760
nothing.

408
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,480
It's just… seeing you

409
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,200
getting unfair treatment,

410
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,680
I feel indignant.

411
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,350
Thanks a lot

412
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,390
for helping me today.

413
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,480
You are welcome.

414
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,000
Don't mention it!

415
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,870
It is my great fortune

416
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,070
to have the opportunity to serve you.

417
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,000
Then I will take my leave for now.

418
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,790
Alright!

419
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,070
Chen, take care!

420
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,480
Master.

421
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,040
Has Qin Chen left?

422
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm going back.

423
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,480
Everyone,

424
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,720
for the rest of the matches,

425
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,870
if anyone here dares to intervene,

426
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,440
I don't care who you are

427
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,720
or what background you have,

428
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,200
I won't let you off the hook.

429
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,070
No tolerance!

430
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,350
I heard that Qin Chen
was not favored by the Qin family,

431
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,590
but I never expected that
they would go this far.

432
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,480
[This time, I have left a good impression]

433
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,200
[in Chen's mind.]

434
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,040
[In the future, if I encounter
any difficulties in refining,]

435
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,960
[I won't worry about finding solutions.]

436
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,520
Liang.

437
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,920
Master?

438
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,760
Master Liang?

439
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,150
Are you alright?

440
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,110
Yes.

441
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,920
I'm great.

442
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,240
Next up,

443
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,110
in the final match of the quarter-finals,

444
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,280
we have Zhao Lingshan
facing off against Wei Shen.

445
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,720
Master!

446
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,830
Lingshan is up!

447
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,590
Princess Lingshan,
please enlighten me with your techniques.

448
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,830
Let's start.

449
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,590
Formless Fist!

450
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,520
Tear mountains and tame tigers!

451
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,390
Thanks for letting me win.

452
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,720
Now, I announce

453
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,630
that the finalists of our grand tournament

454
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,870
are as follows:

455
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,040
Li Qingfeng,

456
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,520
Wang Qiming,

457
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,790
Qin Chen,

458
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,350
and Zhao Lingshan.

459
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,240
The top genius of the Star Academy

460
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,870
is only me, Li Qingfeng.

461
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,760
That's not necessarily true.

462
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,280
Let's see who stands superior in the arena.

463
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,390
That's right.

464
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,760
Only when skilled experts face off

465
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,280
can true geniuses be nurtured.

466
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,240
Round one:

467
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,280
Zhao Lingshan versus Qin Chen!

468
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,040
Master, what do you think…

469
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,760
Lord, no need to worry.

470
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,680
Although Lingshan will be stopped
in the quarter-finals,

471
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,280
it was only because
she is facing off against Qin Chen.

472
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,830
With a different opponent,

473
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,720
the outcome might be different.

474
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,150
Then I'll just tell Lingshan

475
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,200
to give in.

476
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,040
Lord,

477
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,520
what are you doing?

478
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,040
Master Liang, didn't you mean

479
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,870
my daughter should lose?

480
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,440
No, I…

481
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,760
I will never ask you to do something like that.

482
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,720
What I mean is,

483
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,040
when Lingshan is going against Qin Chen,

484
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,440
she has no chance to win.

485
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,790
That's not possible, is that?

486
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,240
If no one interferes,

487
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,590
Lingshan is bound to win.

488
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,310
Lord,

489
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,440
just watch.

490
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,440
Qin Chen, were you okay?

491
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,110
Thank you for your concern, Princess.

492
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,830
However, you should be cautious.

493
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,350
I won't show any mercy in our match.

494
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,150
Me neither.

495
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,240
Since you are a master of swordsmanship,

496
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,680
out of respect,

497
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,520
I won't use any weapons.

498
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,920
Are you sure about that?

499
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,440
Please enlighten me.

500
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,680
Then,

501
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,720
take this one!

502
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,070
Another one!

503
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,070
Great force!

504
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,830
Chop!

505
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,520
This is the Sword Essence!

506
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,830
Sword Essence is an extremely profound skill
within the art of swordsmanship,

507
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,680
one that even I haven't fully mastered.
