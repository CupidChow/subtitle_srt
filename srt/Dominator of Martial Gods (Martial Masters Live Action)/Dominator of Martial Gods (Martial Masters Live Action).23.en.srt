20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,150
I haven't seen him since the beginning.

21

24
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,680
Nonsense!

25
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,360
Chen would never die in there!

26

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,390
Where is that pervert?

52
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,310
The Soul-Trap Array is still on!

53
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,190
Is the Bloodmist Holy Land Baptism

54
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,310
still not over?

55
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,270
As long as all alive apprentices

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,190
have left the Bloodmist Holy Land,

57
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,360
the Soul-Trap Array
will certainly shut down.

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,750
Since it is still on,

59
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,510
it means someone is still in there.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
Who could be in there?

61
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,830
Qin Chen hasn't come out yet.

62
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,000
It must be Chen.

63
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,360
He is still in there.

64
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,190
Could the person be that pervert?

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,190
He went through the array

66
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,630
and came to the area where I cultivated,

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,830
so it is possible

68
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,480
that he can hold on until now.

69
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,480
It's been more than three days.

70
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,870
Why is he still in there?

71
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,430
Yeah!

72
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,190
Right!

73
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,430
Could it be that the array is broken?

74
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,510
The power in the Bloodmist Holy Land
is extremely violent.

75
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,190
It is already extremely rare for ordinary people

76
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,480
to soak in it for one day.

77
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm afraid that even a blood beast

78
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,120
with a strong physical body

79
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,240
can't stand staying three days in there.

80
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,600
Inform the Array Master Union of Five Kingdoms,

81
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,480
and ask them to send someone over to check.

82
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,510
Yes.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,950

85
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,240
Yeah.

86
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,560

87

88
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,560

89
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,070
Am I mistaken?

90
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,830
What did I say?

91
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,190
It must be Chen!

92
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
How is that possible?

93
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,310
It really is that pervert!

94
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,600

95

96
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,120

in the Bloodmist Holy Land]

97
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,390
[than Qin Feng and the others,]

98
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,360
[but his cultivation level
is still so low.]

99
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,040
[What is going on?]

100
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,750

Qin Chen,

102
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm glad you are back safe and sound.

103
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,510
Sorry, everyone.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Actually,

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
on the second day,

106
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
my cultivation was over.

107
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,310
But for some reason,

108
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,510
I was not transported out by the array.

109
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,750
It might be broken.

110
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,830
I was lost in there too.

111
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,040
It took me two days to find the exit.

112
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,270
Forgive me, guys.

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,360
No wonder.

114
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,040
It turns out the array was malfunctioning.

115
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,510
Otherwise, how could he have lasted so far

116
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,950
with his low cultivation level?

117
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,870
Looks like
there's nothing much to see now.

118
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's go.

119
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,830
Go.

120
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,040
Alright, let's get out.

121
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,160
Next will be the preliminary test.

122
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,480
You all must be careful.

123
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,750
How many people can
make a breakthrough during this baptism?

124
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,750
They're out.

125
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,080
I heard the one who lasted the longest

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
in this baptism was Qin Feng from the Xuan.

127
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,840
He broke through to
the mid-stage of Heaven level

128
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,270
and broke the previous record.

129
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,120
But I heard that

130
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,270
Qin Chen lasted the longest.

131
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,240
Qin Chen?

132
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,750
You don't know the truth.

133
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,870
Qin Chen's cultivation
was over on the second day.

134
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
Turns out

135
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,550
he was lost in there.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,510
Huh?

137
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,240
That's why he came out on the fourth day.

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,000
Lost?

139
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,870
In the history of the Bloodmist Holy Land,

140
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,510
he was the first one
who got lost in the array.

141
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
What a liar!

142
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,910
This person must have done

143
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,870
some shady things
in the Bloodmist Holy Land.

144
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,550
According to what he said,

145
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,750
he went out on the second day.

146
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,030
But I clearly saw him

147
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,030
in the high-level area on the second day.

148
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,240
Chen,

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
did you really get lost in there?

150
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,960
Would anyone believe me

151
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,510
if I said that I cultivated in there

152
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,270
for four days?

153
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,840
Indeed.

154
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,200

It emphasizes gradual progress.

159
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,200
Breaking through the Heaven level
is actually nothing at all.

is the most important.

[his hope of breaking through
to the Master level in this life]

188
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,320
[is less than 30%.]

189
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,320
This year,

190
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,150
many young martial artists
from the Northwest

191
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,240
participated in the
Competition of Five Kingdoms.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,630
The competition has two rounds.

193
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,440
The first round
is the Trial of Life And Death.

194
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,440
Half a year later,

195
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,200
there will be the final arena contest.

196
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,910
Now I announce
the rules of the first round,

197
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,000
the Trial of Life And Death.

198
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,600
In the vast mountains
and forests behind me,

199
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,870
there are many dangers.

200
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Each of you

201
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,840
can get a jade stone.

202
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,200
The task of Trial of Life And Death

203
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,910
is to survive in the mountains
for more than five days

204
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,390
and

205
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,960
keep your own jade stone.

206
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,270
After five days,

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,320
those who lose the jade stone

208
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,790
or are eliminated

209
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
will lose the qualification

210
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,960
to participate in the final test.

211
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,720
And

212
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,480
the more jade stones you get,

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
the higher your ranking will be.

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,270
Don't forget

215
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,080
that the assessment is only based
on jade stones, not people.

216
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,870
That is to say,

217
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,510
each of you

218
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,390
can plunder the jade stones from others.

219
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,750
In the Competition of Five Kingdoms,

220
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,390
you not only need to
guard against nature's dangers

221
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
but also against

222
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,840
other martial artists.

223
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,120
[Humanity]

224
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,750
[is much more dangerous
than anything else in this world.]

225
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,320
To ensure your safety,

226
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,550
you can get a transporting jade plate

227
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
before entering the trial area.

228
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,870
When encountering life-threatening danger,

229
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,870
just crush the jade plate,

230
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,840
and you will be transported out,

231
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,870
but

232
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,910
you will fail the assessment.

233
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,000
This should be the transporting jade plate

234
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
uniformly made by array masters.

235
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,270
[These jade plates are too elementary.]

236
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,240
[There is an interval
of at least one breath's time]

237
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,320
[from activation to transmission.]

238
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,240
[This gap]

239
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,150
[is enough for some strong people
to kill their opponents.]

240
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
No wonder even possessing
a transporting jade plate,

241
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,960
many people still die
in the trial every year.

242
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,790
Everyone,

243
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,630
although

244
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,910
His Majesty has high hopes for you,

245
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,240
I only have one requirement for you:

246
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,840
come back alive.

247
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,270
Go.

248
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,600
Start entering the array.

249
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,590
Just now, the array took

250
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,720
a total of three breaths to activate,

251
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,200
and the array lines
circulated about twice.

252
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,110
I should have been transported

253
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,960
more than 150km away.

254
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
You are from the Xuan.

255
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,070
How unlucky of you

256
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,030
to fall into my hands.

257
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,550
You are from the Zhao Kingdom.

258
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,440
Demon Flame Skill,

259
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,350
Fire of Ten Thousand Demons!

260
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,790
Scared silly

261
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,160
by my strength, huh?

262
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,160
What?

263
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,070
The third prince of the Zhao Kingdom,
your strength

264
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,110
is not so impressive.

265
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,640
I gave you a chance to hit me just now,

266
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,790
but now it's my turn.

267
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,680
You're courting death!

268
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,000
Who is this guy?

269
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,160
Best to retreat for now!

270
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,790
God is helping me.

271
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,160
I found Prince Wei so soon.

272
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,750
It saves me a lot of trouble.

273
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,000
Your Highness!

274
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,200
Wait for me!

275
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,400
Great!

276
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,830
I feel relieved

277
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,790
to meet Your Highness here.

278
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,880
The Zhao Kingdom
is too rampant this time.

279
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,200
They allied with the Ghost Immortal Sect

280
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,110
and took the opportunity
of the Competition of Five Kingdoms

281
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,680
to hunt down
the people of the Xuan Kingdom.

282
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,270
For real?

283
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,350
I saw many people of the Xuan Kingdom

284
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,510
being surrounded and killed
by the Zhao and Ghost Immortal Sect.

285
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,400
Unfortunately, at that time, I was alone

286
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,350
and unable to save them rashly.

287
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,350
The people of the Zhao Kingdom
are really hateful.

288
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,070
We must speed up

289
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,550
and defeat them!

290
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,240
Yes.

291
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,030
Who's there?

292
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,270
Your Highness, it's me.

293
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,160
[Damn it!]

294
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
[Why did he show up here?]

295
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,880
[What a nuisance!]

296
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,960
I happened to overhear

297
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,310
what you said just now.

298
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,310
Since this is the case,

299
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,400
let's act together

300
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,510
to prevent sneak attacks by the Zhao
and the Ghost Immortal Sect.

301
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,920
Sounds good.

302
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,310
That's not helpful.

303
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,440
Us three moving together is too big of a target.

304
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,550
Furthermore,

305
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,270
Wang Qiming's strength is weak.

306
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,350
Him following us

307
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,590
may become a burden.

308
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,400
Your Highness,

309
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,640
now that the Zhao and the Ghost Immortal Sect

310
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,550
strongly intend to kill,

311
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,790
it is better for me to be with you.

312
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,830
This way,

313
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,750
you will be safer.

314
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,680
Your words make sense.

315
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,790
Now that the Zhao Kingdom is eyeing us,

316
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,240
it's quite dangerous
for Wang Qiming to be alone.

317
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,750
Then let's go together,

318
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,720
so we can take care of each other.

319
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,680
Remember to follow me.

320
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,790
[Damn it.]

321
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,920
[He ruins my plans.]

322
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,960
[However, with Wang Qiming's strength,]

323
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,000
[I don't think he can cause much trouble.]

324
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,350
[Since you are eager to die,]

325
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,510
[I will fulfill your wish.]

326
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,550
What's going on?

327
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,550
Your Highness, don't panic.

328
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,350
This is the Xuanqing Holy Spirit Array,

329
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,310
a defensive array.

330
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,920
I have seen it before.

331
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,510
As long as we do not launch an attack

332
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,720
and wait quietly for a moment,

333
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,270
this array will automatically lift.

334
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,310
The Xuanqing Holy Spirit Array?

335
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,590
How come I have never heard of it before?

336
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,070
Wang Qiming,

337
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,200
you are lowborn.

338
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,160
There are a lot of things you haven't seen.

339
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,480
Prince Wei,

340
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,790
let's get out of here.

341
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,680
Then I will attack first.

342
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,510
Li Qingfeng,

343
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,790
what the hell are you doing?

344
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,440
Wang Qiming,

345
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,310
I wanted to let you live,

346
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,200
but you are eager to die,

347
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,350
so you can't blame others.

348
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,310
Li Qingfeng,

349
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,110
what the hell do you want?

350
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,590
Don't panic, Your Highness.

351
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,480
I just want to ask you

352
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,790
a few small questions.

353
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,480
I promise

354
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,550
I won't hurt you

355
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
if you cooperate with me.

356
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,590
But before that,

357
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,350
I need to take care of this unlucky guy.

358
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,550
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

359
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I advised you not to follow,

360
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,400
but you insisted on coming to die.

361
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,400
Then don't blame me.

362
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,590
Li Qingfeng,

363
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,550
why are you doing this?

364
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,160
Of course, I have my reasons.

365
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,310
How can a lowly man like you understand?

366
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,350
You said that

367
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,680
you want to ask His Highness some questions.

368
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,720
This means that only the royal family

369
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,510
can answer what you want.

370
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,550
Could it be that

371
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,830
you want to know
some secrets of the imperial palace?

372
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,510
The more you know, the faster you'll die.

373
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,790
Cut the crap.

374
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,880
Just go to hell!

375
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,590
Heavenly Pole Breaking Cloud Array Disk?

376
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,790
How did you get such a treasure?

377
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,160
Chen noticed something wrong with you
a long time ago.

378
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,680
Damn it, Qin Chen again!

379
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,310
Chen gave me this.

380
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,070
It can lift various confinements.

381
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,110
Hurry up and take it, Your Highness.

382
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,680
How did your strength improve so fast?

383
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,070
Times have changed.

384
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,310
Li Qingfeng,

385
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,720
I have said that

386
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,240
sooner or later,

387
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,350
I will definitely defeat you.

388
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,480
Do you think you can defeat me?

389
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,880
It's just your wishful thinking.

390
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,070
Sky-crumbling Blow!

391
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,880
Saber Essence!

392
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,030
Shatter the sky!

393
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,440
No! Watch out, Qiming!

394
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,640
Dragon Roar of the Nine Heavens!

395
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,750
Saber Essence!

396
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,680
Eliminate!

397
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,590
How is that possible?

398
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,480
Your cultivation is at nothing
but early-stage Heaven level.

399
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,270
How could you suppress me?

400
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,200
Li Qingfeng,

401
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,350
I advise you to surrender immediately.

402
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,310
Today

403
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,790
you can't get away.

404
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,640
Great Escape Method!

405
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,030
He got away!

406
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,880
That's fine.

407
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,720
His jade plate was cut off by me.

408
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
I guess he won't be able to
leave this mountain in advance.

409
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,200
Alright.

410
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,350
When the preliminary test is over,

411
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,640
we can report this to
King of Lingwu and others.

412
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,920
We will be able to capture

413
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
this traitor at once.

414
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,550
Cao Heng,

415
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,960
don't you go too far!

416
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,830
Go too far?

417
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,400
I have said that

418
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,110
all of you Xuan people must die.

419
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,440
Cao Heng,

420
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,550
Prince Wei won't spare you!

421
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,160
These two

422
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,310
ran away pretty quickly.

423
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
It is easy to complete

424
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,960
the trial in five days.

425
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,720
The most important thing is

426
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,720
to uproot

427
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,030
the people

428
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,200
of

429
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,240
the

430
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,070
Xuan Kingdom.

431
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,000
Oh, Qin Chen,

432
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,240
do you think I can't find you

433
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,790
once you hide in the jungle?

434
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,680
Go.

435
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,790
Qin Chen,

436
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,270
the Mount of Demonic Ancestors

437
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,160
will be your burial ground.

438
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,720
There are people out already, so fast.

439
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,550
Zong Qiang and Jiang Zhong.

440
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,590
You two…

441
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,310
