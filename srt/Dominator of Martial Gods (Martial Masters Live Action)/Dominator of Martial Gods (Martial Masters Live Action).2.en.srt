[Episode 02]

19
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Qin Chen,

20
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,280
you've got some nerve.

21
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,200
You actually dared assault people.

22
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
The sword has no eyes.

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,350
Put it away.

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,360
Yuechi,

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
are you still blaming me?

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,630
My Marquis,

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,560
I dare not.

28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,910
When you left home

29
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,360
and became an unmarried mother,

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,470
you greatly impacted on our family.

31
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,630
As the patriarch,

32
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,120
I had no choice but to…

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,190
I don't blame you.

34
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,240
I brought that

35
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,710
upon myself.

36
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,150
It's all water under the bridge.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
Let's put it behind us.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,910
For what happened today,

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,520
I'll let it slide for now.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,470
But in half a month,

41
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,280
it'll be the test of Star Academy.

42
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,080
You…

43
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,360
must achieve bloodline awakening before that,

44
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,910
so the dignitaries in the Capital will know

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,910

51
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,630
I'm fine.

Mother.

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,680
Are you hungry?

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,630
Let me cook you something.

55
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,630
Okay.

Here you go.

59
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,270
Slow down a bit.

Chen.

61
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,240
Your uncle is the Commander of Imperial Guards

62

and the Marquis of Anping.

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
He's a hard-hearted man.

64
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,560
He didn't punish you this time.

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,070
It's not like him.

66
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,480
Are you saying

67
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,000
on the surface he let up on me,

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,510
but in fact, he's waiting
for me to fail the Academy test,

69
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,040
so he'll get a better reason to punish me?

70
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,000
You've grown a lot.

don't worry.

73
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,040
I'll awaken the bloodline

74
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,430
and pass the Academy test.

75
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,510
I have faith in you.

76

83

84

Mother,

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
even if you wanted
to leave the Qin family right away,

86

91
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,430
My martial prowess seems
to have improved in my sleep.

92

In your sleep?

93

Qin Yuanhong,

94
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
what's wrong with you?

95
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,390
You actually defended that bastard

96
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,430
and shamed Lord Qi

97
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,390
in front of so many people.

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,520
Tell me.

99
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,190
Why did you do that?

100
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,160
I should be the one

101
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,430
asking you that question.

102
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,360
What have you been doing
all day long in this house?

103
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
Me?

104
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,800
I've been trying to chuck Qin Yuechi out
as soon as possible,

105
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,600
lest that bastard

106
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,480
takes over our family's property in the future.

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,680
But you,

108
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,630
you let that bastard off the hook.

109
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,390
I knew it.

110
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,560
Everyone in your family is a rogue.

111
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,560
What kind of nonsense is that?

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,310
Nonsense?

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,070
Qin Yuechi did something so shameful.

114
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,360
But your father, instead of chucking her out,

115
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,480
let her and her son stay.

116
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Now that brat also bears the surname Qin.

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
He's a threat to Feng's status
and claim to the family property.

118
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,750
Am I

119
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,920
not right?

120
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,630
You knew Father cared about Yuechi,

121
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,430
but you still brought Lord Qi home today.

122
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,600
You know what Father is like.

123
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,240
If he finds out what happened today,

124
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
you'll be a goner.

125
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,680
Don't tell me

126
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,560
you're going to let that bastard

127
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,120
continue staying here?

128
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,920
That's why I told you to bear with it.

129
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
Qin Chen has not even

130
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,480
awakened the bloodline yet.

131
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,480
He'll definitely fail

132
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,390
the Academy test.

133
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,680
And when he does,

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
I, as the patriarch, will chuck him out.

135
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,630
And Father will have nothing to say.

136
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,240
But you,

137
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,430
you keep messing around.

138
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,630
You are so short-sighted.

139
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,040
Oh, I see.

140
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,190
So,

141
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,070
this is your plan.

142
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,720
What else do you expect?

143
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,240
You woman,

144
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
do nothing

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,120
except for ruining my plan.

146
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Right.

147
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,550
All the men of the Qin family excel
in martial arts.

148
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,440
If that bastard fails the Academy test,

149
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,840
we'll kick him out,

150
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,790
and the old man will have nothing to say.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,150
Qin Chen,

152
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,630
let's see how much longer you can be smug.

153
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,360
I must become stronger

154
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,630
as fast as I can for Mother's sake.

155
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,030
First of all,

156
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,320
I need to awaken the bloodline.

157
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,840
Madam,

158
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,790
he's been staying in his room

159
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,600
without going out.

160
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,790
Do you want my men to keep watching him?

161
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,150
No need.

162
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,000
What could he possibly achieve

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,720
in just half a month?

164
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,750
This time,

165
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,030
that boy

166
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,390
will definitely be kicked out
of the Qin Residence.

167
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,390
I'm unable to awaken the bloodline.

168
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,030
There are only two possible reasons.

169
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,670
Either

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,240
the vigor in my body is too weak,

171
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,000
or

172
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
there's something wrong with my body.

173
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,020
[Qin Chen's consciousness.]

174
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,150
[This is the ancient sword]

175
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,910
[I got in the Forbidden Place.]

176
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,630
[Legend has it that
it's passed down from Heaven.]

177
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,000
You must be staying in seclusion

178
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,200
to study

179
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,550
the divine weapon you brought back
from the Forbidden Place.

180
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,480
Hand it over

181
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,910
and I'll spare your life.

182
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,840
[This is what Feng Shaoyu]

183
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,910
[and Shangguan Xi'er want.]

184
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,390
All the vigor in my body has settled.

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,200
To awaken the bloodline,

186
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
my only choice

187
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,510
is to shatter and reshape it.

188
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,260
[Qin Residence]

189
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,150

190
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,080
Mother.

191
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,910
I'm going out.

192
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,670
I'll be back soon.

193
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,670
Stay safe.

194
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,840
And don't cause any more trouble.

195
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,780
[The Palace of Instruments
of the Xuan Kingdom.]

196
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,870
I finally got here.

197
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,790
The materials for refining Heavenly Needle

198
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,080
are precious and rare.

199
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,600
There's no telling

200
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,270
if I can find any here.

201
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,040
Normal people will tremble with fear

202
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,760
when they come
to the Place of Instruments.

203
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,070
This man is young

204
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,200
and exudes an imposing aura.

205
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,630
He must be from a prominent family.

206
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,630
Childe,

207
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,550
welcome to the Palace of Instruments.

208
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,790
How can I help you?

209
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,510
I want to buy some materials
for refining a weapon.

210
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,200
May I ask

211
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
if you have any here?

212
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Childe, you must be joking.

213
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,080
For what's not available here,

214
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,910
you might not be able to find it elsewhere

215
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,350
even if you search through the Xuan.

216
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,340
[Weapon-refining materials]

217
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Childe,

218
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,750
I'm afraid you have made some mistakes.

219
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,790
I've been here for over four years,

220
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,360
but most of the materials on this

221
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
are unknown to me.

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,790
The Xuan Kingdom is indeed a remote land.

223
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,680
I've replaced several top-tier materials

224
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,270
with common ones,

225
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,440
but they still don't have them.

226
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,270
I can't shatter my vigor and rebuild it

227
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,840
without the Heavenly Needle.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,790
Childe,

229
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,870
what did you say?

230
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,510
Oh.

231
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,670
Nothing.

232
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,000
I'll change some of the materials.

233
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,390
Do you have a writing brush and ink?

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,570
Yes. Childe, this way, please.

235
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,060
[Zhao Lingshan, Lord Kang's daughter]

236

238

Princess.

239
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,910
Mr. Qin Fen, greetings to you.

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,720
Princess.

241
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,960
[Qin Fen, Qin Yuanhong's second son]
What brings you

242
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,120
to the Palace of Instruments?

243
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,480
My father sent me
here to visit Master Liang Yu.

244
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,550
What a coincidence.

245
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm also here to see him
for something important.

246
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,030
Why don't we go together?

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,550
After you.

248
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,000
Whoops.

249
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,270
Isn't this Qin Chen?

250
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,600
I heard you haven't even
awakened the bloodline yet.

251
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,440
What's this about?

252
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,270
You can't be a warrior,

253
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,120
so you decide to be a refiner instead?

254
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,440
Mr. Qin Fen,

255
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,030
is he also from the Qin family?

256
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,630
Princess Lingshan,

257
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,320
he is my aunt's son,

258
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,630
also the illegitimate child of my family.

259
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,910
I see.

260
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,670
Qin Chen,

261
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,750
this is the Palace of Instruments.

262
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,480
You're not supposed to be here.

263
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,270
Do you have these materials?

264
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,820
[Dark Stone of Underworld]

265
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
What materials?

266
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,750
Let me have a look.

267
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,620
[Dark Stone of Underworld]

268
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,750
Dark Stone of Underworld?

269
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,480
This thing is worth a thousand gold coins.

270
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,600
Can you afford it?

271
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,390
And what are all these scribbles?

272
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,080
You also know Dark Stone of Underworld?

273
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,080
I…

274
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,150
Why can't I know it?

275
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,480
Prepare to have your horizons broadened.

276
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,320
My father bought this
from Skyhigh Auction House

277
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,640
for 38,000 silver coins.

278
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,040
He's going to have Master Liang Yu

279
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,920
refine a magic weapon for me.

280
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,110
Open your eyes

281
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,750

284
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,510
You haven't even awakened the bloodline

285
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
and you make a spectacle of yourself here.

286
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,720
You're a disgrace to our family.

287
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,350
You're sounding more and more

288
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,960

289
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,000
You…

290
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,830
How dare you talk to me like that?

291
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,750
Mr. Qin Fen,

292
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,510
please stop it.

Fighting is strictly prohibited.

296

I'm here to petition you

306
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,880
to forge a magic weapon for me
with Dark Stone of Underworld.

307
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,440
What kind of magic weapon?

308
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,270
A three-foot sword.

309
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,880
Dark Stone of Underworld
is a top-class refining material.

310
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,200
A tiny piece of it will be enough.

311
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,270
My father said

312
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,270
whether the refining

313
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,320
will be successful or not,

314

316
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,880
Okay.

317
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,550
I'll do it.

318
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,000
Thank you, Master Liang Yu.

319

Lord Kang and I are friends.

326
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,510
He said in the letter

327
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,550
that you want to be my apprentice.

328
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,680
Yes.

329
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,750
I want to be a refiner.

330
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,680
I don't care

331

what background my apprentices come from.

332
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,200
I only care about their talents.

If you're not qualified,

334
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,110
even though you're Lord Kang's daughter,

335
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,000

00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,440
Very well.

338
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,640
Come with me.

339
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,640
What are you doing here?

340
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,510

Your martial arts skills

343
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,200
are good enough.

If you pass the spiritual power test,

345
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,160
I'll apprentice you.

Yes.

350
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,350
The most important thing

351
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,480
for becoming a refiner is spiritual talent.

352
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,550
Only with strong spiritual power

353
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,720
can one engrave various inscriptions on weapons

354
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,030
and turn normal weapons

355
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,440
into magic weapons.

356
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,920
Your spiritual power is strong enough.

357
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,270
You can stop.

358
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,030
Next up is the spiritual talent test.

359
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,920
Integrate your awareness

360

into this crystal.

361
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,270
Not bad.

you'll be my ninth apprentice.

366
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,110
I'm honored, Master.

367

to accompany you here.

372
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,640
If you have finished your small talk,

374
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,200
may leave now.

375
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes.

376
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,480

378
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,550
Qin Chen, are you crazy?

379
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,720
How dare you call Master by his full name?

380
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,590
Master, my brother doesn't know the rules.

381
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,240
Please forgive him.

382
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,160
You haven't been a refiner for long, right?

383
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,070
Qin Chen.

384
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,720
I won't hold it to you

385
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,200
because you're young.

386
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,750
Now,

387
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
get out of the Palace of Instruments.

388
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,160
To become a refiner,

389
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,440
you have to forge a magic weapon.

390
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
Unless I'm very much mistaken,

391
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,830
your assessment back then

392
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,000
required you to forge a magic weapon
with fire attributes.

393
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,750
How do you know that?

394
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,880
Not only do I know

395
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,800
you forged a magic weapon with fire attributes,

396
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,550
but I also know

397
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,110
your days are numbered.

398
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,270
Qin Chen.

399
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,920
Stop talking nonsense.

400
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,640
Or I will tell my father

401
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,790
and have you and your mother disowned!

402
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,960
Master Liang,

403
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,590
please don't be angry.

404
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,030
We're leaving now.

405
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,400
You want to leave?

406
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,240
It's too late.

407
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,790
Liang Yu,

408
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,110
I'm the only one who can detoxify your poison.

409
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,640
If I were you,

410
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,160
I wouldn't have attacked.

411
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,240
How do you know that I'm poisoned?

412
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,590
When you mobilize your vital energy,

413
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,590
your Tianmen

414
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,830
and Zhongshu acupoints

415
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,070
will hurt, right?

416
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,400
You…

417
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,960
You…

418
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,350
What a pity.

419
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,110
A refining genius

420
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,590
is going to have all his meridians ruined

421
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,920
and lose his life.

422
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,110
Who the hell are you?

423
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
Master, are you okay?

424
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,720
Leave us.

425
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Did you not hear me?

426
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,400
Leave us!

427
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,960
What exactly did you mean

428
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,350
just now?

429
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,440
The main material you used
to refine the magic weapon

430
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,550
in your assessment is Red Flame Stone.

431
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,110
In order to reduce the heat
of Red Flame Stone

432
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,590
and enhance its ductility,

433
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,030
you added Green Demonic Stone

434
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,640
during the refining process.

435
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,200
Am I right?

436
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,680
Green Demonic Stone is the main material
for making demonic poison.

437
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,030
It's not resistant to heat.

438
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,070
In order to pass the test,

439
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,400
you actually resorted to that.

440
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,030
It's unscrupulous.

441
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,590
How can you be worthy of the title
of Refining Expert?

442
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

443
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,070
It's arrant nonsense.

444
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,280
Demonic poison is not deadly.

445
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,920
So, you don't care.

446
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,030
But you take many detoxifying pills

447
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,240
to counteract the poison.

448
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,480
The main ingredient of detoxifying pills

449
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,790
is the Ethereal Flower
which is cold in nature.

450
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,240
It can't help you get rid of the poison.

451
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,030
Furthermore, it'll solidify
the poison in your body.

452
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,720
Surely you know that?

453
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,880
I forgot.

454
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,550
You're just a refiner,

455
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,550
not an alchemist.

456
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,270
[This lad got it right.]

457
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,480
[To get rid of the poison,]

458
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,270
[I bought a super detoxifying pill
at a high price.]

459
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,200
[But after I took it,]

460
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,880
[the demonic poison didn't decrease.]

461
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,030
[Instead, the meridians
all over my body started aching.]

462
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,720
But since you refuse to cooperate,

463
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,790
why should I be a busybody?

464
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
You have over half a month to live.

465
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,920
Do prepare for your funeral.

466
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,880
Wait.

467
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,000
My young friend,

468
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,070
can you really detoxify my poison?

469
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,920
Didn't you say I'm scaremongering?

470
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,590
I failed to recognize your talents.

471
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,550
Please forgive me.

472
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,400
If you trust me, I can help you.

473
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Lead the way.

474
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,310
Where to?

475
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,590
Surely you have your own refining room?

476
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,790
I want to forge something.

477
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,200
This way, please.

478
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,400
I wonder what you want to forge.

479
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,310
Where did you get this diagram from?

480
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,520
Don't worry about that.

481
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,400
Just forge it for me.

482
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,680
[The ink is still wet.]

483
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,310
[Could it be a copy of some handed-down work?]

484
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,920
[No.]

485
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,550
[Even if it's a copy,]

486
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,160
[judging from the skillful brushwork,]

487
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,480
[it must be the work of a master.]

488
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,790
[The level of details is amazing.]

489
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,000
[It's flawless.]

490
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,440
How long do you have to read it?

491
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,160
The intricacies of this needle

492
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,720
are well beyond my imagination.

493
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,680
To forge it, you need to find a refining master.

494
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,110
I'm afraid I can't help you.

495
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,000
You don't need to worry about that.

496
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,590
I will guide you.

497
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,070
You?

498
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,960
What materials am I to forge it with?

499
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,640
Just use Dark Stone of Underworld
you just got.

500
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Marquis of Anping's son asked me

501
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
to refine a magic weapon with it.

502
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,920
If I use it,

503
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,920
how am I supposed to explain to them?

504
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,240
You should be able to figure something out.

505
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,200
Besides,

506
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,920
you should know
whether to forge a Heavenly Needle

507
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,350
or a magic weapon.

508
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,920
How do I know I can trust you?

509
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,200
Stay calm and don't rush.

510
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,350
Avoid Jiuwei acupoint when you circulate the qi.

511
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,480
The pain in your meridians will disappear
within a short time.

512
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,750
I do feel much better now.

513
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,160
But this

514
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,200
will only relieve your pain temporarily.

515
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,270
After you complete the task,

516
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,720
I will tell you how to detoxify the poison.

517
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,720
Stop wasting time.

518
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,640
Let's get started.

519
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,030
It's too slow.

520
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,640
Sprinkle some talcum powder
on Dark Stone of Underworld.

521
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,750
Talcum powder?

522
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,400
What good will it do to sprinkle that
on Dark Stone of Underworld?

523
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,160
Won't it contaminate the Stone

524
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,550
and turn it into a piece of scrap?

525
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,960
Just do as I say.

526
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,550
You can remove the impurities later.

527
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,000
This is what you ask me to add.

528
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,000
If Dark Stone of Underworld is spoiled,

529
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,880
don't pin the blame on me.

530
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,720
What are you waiting for?

531
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,000
Remove the impurities.

532
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,640
