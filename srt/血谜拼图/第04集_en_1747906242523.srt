00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
last episode

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,320
presidency

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,640
Open the door!

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,500
You're dead if you do this to your friends!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Open the door!

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,200
Settling search

7
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,160
1. Can Kang Tting-ok escape by using a special skill

8
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,620
2. If so, can Kang Tting-ok easily escape?

9
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,880
Kang Tting-ok hasn't come home since yesterday

10
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,580
so please cut his production from now on

11
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,000
He could avoid the road

12
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,480
Let's request for location tracking and check the route.

13
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,980
Yes.

14
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,720
Let's move to the last place where Kang Chimok's phone is turned off.

15
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,220
Yes.

16
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,680
Let's find Kang Chimok's car first.

17
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,160
I'll look over there first.

18
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:24,720
Yes, this is Yang Jong-ho from Han River Police Station.

19
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,760
Yes, we request cooperation from the singer team.

20
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,460
Violence, impulsiveness, addiction, precision, planning, emotional dissection, high self-control.

21
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,520
Lee Mi-young and Yoon Dong-hoon are on the opposite sides of the suspect profiling of the murder.

22
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,440
It's the second car, right?

23
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,080
Yes.

24
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,300
Can you turn it around quickly?

25
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,520
There's no scene where it comes out again.

26
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Do you want me to show you more?

27
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,960
What's behind the rest stop?

28
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,960
There's a mountain behind it.

29
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,200
There's nothing.

30
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There's no black box, navigation, or SD card.

31
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There's nothing.

32
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's nothing.

33
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There's nothing.

34
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's nothing.

35
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There's nothing.

36
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's nothing.

37
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's nothing.

38
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There's nothing.

39
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There's nothing.

40
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There's nothing.

41
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There's nothing.

42
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There's nothing.

43
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There's nothing.

44
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There's nothing.

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There's nothing.

46
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's nothing.

47
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There's nothing.

48
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There's nothing.

49
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There's nothing.

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There's nothing.

51
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There's nothing.

52
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's nothing.

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's nothing.

54
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's nothing.

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There's nothing.

56
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There's nothing.

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There's nothing.

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There's nothing.

59
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's nothing.

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's nothing.

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think it's not a suicide.

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not a suicide.

63
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And it's direction is to Seoul.

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's the way back from somewhere.

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is the first time I've ever planned.

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's why I erased all the records.

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wait a minute.

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,660
Caught selling shares a long time ago.

69
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,940
Are you ok?

70
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,360
Gaenam whistle

71
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,240
I found it below the bridge

72
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,000
Gaenam whistle

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,040
and I saw it on the CCTV in front of my house.

74
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Anyway, I fell off the highway at 23 o'clock last night.

75
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,280
It's the direction of Yeongpyeong Lake,

76
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,740
and I got on the highway again from the direction of the lake.

77
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,540
It's 0229 a.m.

78
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,940
And finally, I entered the rest area where you are now.

79
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,480
I stayed in the direction of the lake for over 3 hours.

80
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,200
It's a problem if it's not fishing.

81
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,540
Let's go to Yeongpyeong Lake first.

82
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,640
Choi San, you join us here.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,540
There's no fishing spot here.

84
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:01,540
There's no fishing spot here.

85
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,740
Yes, we have the information about using a credit card.

86
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,740
The last place I wrote was Yeongpyeong Y Hotel.

87
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,320
Huh?

88
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,780
This is the Holy Land of Unwanted People.

89
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,620
I'm late on the weekly shift, so I don't know much about last night's guests.

90
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,820
Then, can you confirm that there was a name Kang Chimok among the guests who came yesterday?

91
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,940
Wait a minute.

92
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,380
Oh, yes, here it is.

93
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,180
Really?

94
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,440
You reserved for a night.

95
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,480
But you already checked out last night.

96
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,780
What number is that?

97
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,880
What are you doing?

98
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,380
Excuse me.

99
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,720
I'm a police officer.

100
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,680
Can I take a look around for a second?

101
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,020
Are you already cleaning up?

102
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,020
No, I just came in.

103
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,620
I'll take a look around.

104
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,020
What's going on?

105
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,920
Who else did you kill besides Lee Mae-young?

106
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
I think the bastard is out, but where did you hide the body?

107
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:04,920
After checking, the body was in the cure circle at 9 o'clock last night, and the CGTV was already abandoned because the removal was the principle.

108
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,920
It's not even a week, but it's been a week.

109
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm sorry.

111
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm sorry.

112
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
I'm sorry.

115
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,960
It's not even a week, but it's been a week.

116
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,460
Is privacy that important these days?

117
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,460
If you checked in at 9 o'clock, it means that someone else checked in in advance.

118
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,960
Did you talk to the night shift worker yesterday?

119
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,460
I was going to tell you, but last night, there was a lot of noise from the music on the fifth floor, so there was a lot of noise.

120
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,460
Music?

121
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:42,460
So I'm thinking about going up, but at 2 a.m., a man in red pants went out in a hotel lobby in a carrier.

122
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,460
Carrier?

123
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
Red carrier.

124
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,460
Red carrier and red pants?

125
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,460
Kang Chimok also wore red pants yesterday.

126
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,460
The man who was in the car was also in the car.

127
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,460
The man who was in the car was also in the car.

128
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,460
The man who was in the car was also in the car.

129
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Ikso!

130
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
Ikso!

131
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,460
Kang Chimok must have come because his emotions were extreme.

132
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,460
He must have been in a fight.

133
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:32,460
There are no traces of physical fight, either on the wall or on the floor.

134
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,460
Kang Chimok suppressed the opponent at once.

135
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,460
How did he suppress the victim?

136
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,460
Violence, impulsiveness, and addiction.

137
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,460
Kang Chimok is not the type to prepare this in advance.

138
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,460
I don't have a head or hands.

139
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
It won't be easy to find the identity.

140
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Let's look around the hotel and the basement.

141
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Did you hide the rest of the parts here?

142
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,460
I'll see if it's here.

143
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
It's getting blurry.

144
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
Yes.

145
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Let's move the mountain from this side.

146
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
Yes.

147
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,460
I thought it was the scenery, but it didn't move.

148
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
I'm sorry.

149
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
I'm sorry.

150
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,460
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
I'm sorry.

152
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,460
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,460
I thought it was the scenery, but it didn't move.

155
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,460
There's no scene where it doesn't come out.

156
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
The criminal and I have similar tastes.

157
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
I bought it because it was pretty.

158
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
Red carrier.

159
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Are you playing a player in case I ask?

160
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,460
You know it's another brand, right?

161
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
Anyway, it's not Kang Chimok.

162
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,460
It means that it wasn't Kang Chimok who killed Lee Mi-young.

163
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,460
It means that it wasn't Kang Chimok who killed the man in the carrier.

164
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Both.

165
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Kang Chimok, who is the enemy of your team, how is it?

166
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Defeat due to violence, multiple changes, and even non-conformity of職.

167
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
He's a low self-control person.

168
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:37,460
The culprit of the Lee Mi-young case this time was very systematic and planned so that there was no evidence left at the scene.

169
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,460
Besides, he's a high self-control person who controls his emotions.

170
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
The temperature is very low.

171
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,460
But Kang Chimok?

172
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
Isn't the temperature too high?

173
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,460
You're talking about the temperature.

174
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,460
In the clear motive, Lee Mi-young's car even had fingerprints.

175
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,460
Do you remember the last image of Lee Mi-young on CCTV?

176
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,460
The shoulders that were so full of excessive movement, the two hands tight on the handle, and the unstable eyes.

177
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,460
It was like feeling extreme fear.

178
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,460
Like a beginner driver who just got his driver's license.

179
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,460
Like a beginner driver.

180
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,460
Lee Mi-young is a tough person enough to run a bar alone at a young age.

181
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:30,460
It's impulsive, but Kang Chimok, who looks like he's going to kill himself, is not responding to the situation.

182
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:37,460
It was a situation where someone unfamiliar who had never seen before in his life would not know what to do to himself.

183
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,460
Like he's scared because he doesn't know what's in that deep water.

184
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,460
So it's not Kang Chimok who killed Lee Mi-young.

185
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,460
You said you weren't both.

186
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
Then who's the dead body in the carrier?

187
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
Isn't that Kang Chimok?

188
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
What are you talking about?

189
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,460
That stupid dead body.

190
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,460
I think that's Kang Chimok.

191
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,460
You said Kang Chimok was wearing gloves at the rest stop on CCTV.

192
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,460
Why did he drive his car with gloves on?

193
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,460
Is that Kang Chimok?

194
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
Are you sure?

195
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,460
What's the evidence that the person in the CCTV isn't Kang Chimok?

196
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,460
Gloves?

197
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
That's all?

198
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,460
I'll know if I compare Kang Chimok's DNA and that dead body.

199
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
Good job.

200
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,460
I'll go first.

201
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Yes, yes, I see.

202
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,460
I'll call you back.

203
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,460
The dead body without a head in the reservoir is similar to Kang Chimok's DNA.

204
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
Wow, this is a real accident.

205
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Then he killed Lee Mi-young and was killed by a slaughterhouse.

206
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
Does this make sense?

207
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,460
Does this make sense?

208
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,460
I was attracted by the story, but I'm embarrassed.

209
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,460
Is it true that Kang Chimok killed Lee Mi-young?

210
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,460
Young-ha, what's wrong with you?

211
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,460
The evidence is out.

212
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
Why are you shaking the foundation?

213
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,460
I can't be 100% sure of that.

214
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,460
What's going on?

215
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,460
I'm so pissed off.

216
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,460
Come on.

217
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,460
Let's check again to see if the man on the CCTV at the rest stop is Kang Chimok.

218
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Yes, sir.

219
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,460
The best way to find out is to meet the staff at the store.

220
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,460
Yes, sir.

221
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,460
If you just leave it after eating, I'll erase it tomorrow.

222
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,460
Ma'am.

223
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
Huh?

224
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Have you ever heard of Lee Mi-young and Kang Chimok?

225
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460
No, I've never heard of them.

226
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,460
What about them?

227
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,460
What kind of person was my uncle?

228
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,460
I think he was different from what I know.

229
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
I don't know.

230
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
What about when your uncle suddenly changed?

231
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,460
What do you mean suddenly?

232
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
No, then it's okay.

233
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,460
When I was left alone,

234
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,460
right after my parents died in a car accident,

235
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I changed.

236
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Like someone else.

237
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,460
And then I stopped being a cop.

238
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,460
I'm going.

239
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,460
The sofa is still soft.

240
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,460
I thought I'd buy one of these.

241
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,460
I thought I wouldn't have to sit there anymore.

242
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
What's going on?

243
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,460
It started again.

244
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
That dream.

245
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
I remembered everything.

246
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
I knew it wasn't me.

247
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
Why did I dream again?

248
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,460
Because I couldn't find the answer that night.

249
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Is that why you can't sleep?

250
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,460
I couldn't sleep, so my eyes were too swollen.

251
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Or maybe it's because I ate ramen yesterday.

252
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,460
It's not an ultimate answer that In-ha is not the culprit.

253
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
It's not.

254
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,460
Why did that happen that night?

255
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,460
Who killed my uncle?

256
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,460
I think we should try to find the answer first.

257
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
I asked you something obvious.

258
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
I'm going to find the answer.

259
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Oh, but the dream is a dream.

260
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,460
When can I sleep?

261
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,460
When you feel safe even when you sleep.

262
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,460
Can you prescribe some sleeping pills?

263
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,460
Then I can't sleep.

264
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
I have to meditate.

265
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,460
Oh, you know the sushi restaurant at six tomorrow, right?

266
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,460
Should Mr. Hwang come with me?

267
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
I'll ask him.

268
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,460
Is it really my husband?

270
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
Is it really your husband?

271
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,460
It matches the DNA from Kang Chimok's razor.

272
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,460
I just said I'd be late.

273
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
That can't be true.

274
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
I'm sorry.

275
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
This man.

276
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,460
Please look at it again.

277
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,460
You really don't know who it is?

278
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
I don't know.

279
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,460
I thought it was my husband.

280
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,460
It's the same as the husband's clothes I wore that morning.

281
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
I don't know.

282
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,460
I don't know the staff at the store.

283
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,460
The price of the CCTV is so bad.

284
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,460
But he must know Kang Chimok.

285
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Of course he knows.

286
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Hey, there's no way he got a call and went all the way there.

287
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Look.

288
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
If you look at the contents of the cell phone,

289
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,460
Kang Chimok got a call at 21 40.

290
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,460
The call time is only 47 seconds.

291
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,460
He got a call from near the house and moved.

292
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,460
But what did he say to get there?

293
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,460
I think he booked the hotel in the name of Kang Chimok.

294
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,460
Or he must have gone straight to the hotel at the store, not home.

295
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
And the check-in time is not right.

296
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,460
This is also part of the rest area CCTV.

297
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,460
He had to disguise himself as Kang Chimok and escape.

298
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,460
First of all, I see a good relationship in the form of a damage to the body.

299
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,460
I'll meet the people around me.

300
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,460
The movie and I are in a relationship of money.

301
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,460
It's all about money. Money.

302
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,460
What should I do?

303
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,460
You check all the CCTVs around the rest area.

304
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
There are a lot of things.

305
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
If you go in, there's a place where it comes out.

306
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,460
Analyze it carefully.

307
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Okay.

308
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
If anything happens, report it right away.

309
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
Yes.

310
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,460
CCTV, CCTV.

311
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,460
You're a CCTV.

312
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Good morning.

313
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,460
Have a cup of coffee.

314
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,460
Oh, my God.

315
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
Every time.

316
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,460
Thank you.

317
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Why?

318
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
Tell me. What is it?

319
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
You know.

320
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,460
The puzzle didn't come.

321
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,460
It's not Kang Chimok.

322
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,460
What's in Kang Chimok?

323
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Can't you sign?

324
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,460
But why?

325
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,460
You said you didn't know.

326
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Why do you have to know that?

327
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,460
Do you feel like a competitor to me?

328
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,460
I do.

329
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,460
Do you know Lee Mi-young?

330
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,460
It's the first name I've heard.

331
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,460
I think it's a pretty common name.

332
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
There's nothing to worry about.

333
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,460
Who is it?

334
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,460
Oh, my God.

335
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
Who are you?

336
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Oh, hello.

337
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,460
I'm Yoon In-ha, the criminal analysis team at Seo Il-jung.

338
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
I have a few questions to ask.

339
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
Can I go in?

340
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
It's a little awkward, isn't it?

341
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,460
I'm not sure if I can get rid of it because I'm not used to it.

342
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,460
When did you hear about Lee Mi-young from your husband for the first time?

343
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
You know, Lee Mi-young.

344
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Oh, I'm not trying to die.

345
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
I just have some questions.

346
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,460
I didn't think my husband would have no woman because he was old.

347
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,460
That didn't even matter.

348
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Do you know how much the apartment I gave to Mi-young was?

349
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,460
That's exactly what I asked.

350
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,460
I was sad all the time when I was selling my newlyweds.

351
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,460
That's when I first heard the name Lee Mi-young.

352
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,460
What about other stories?

353
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,460
Have you ever heard of anything like that?

354
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
It's different?

355
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,460
I don't think so.

356
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,460
But why do you keep asking about the dead woman?

357
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Did you hear from your husband?

358
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,460
Lee Mi-young's dead?

359
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,460
No.

360
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
I heard it from the police yesterday.

361
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Yeah.

362
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,460
But how did you know I was that woman?

363
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,460
I lied because I was afraid you'd be bothered.

364
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
It's best to know that.

365
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,460
Because you're a profiler.

366
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
Really?

367
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
I wanted to do that, too.

368
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Would you like a cup of coffee?

369
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460
You've been at the store all the way from work.

370
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,460
You left before lunchtime.

371
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,460
It must have been around 1130.

372
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
When did you come back to the store?

373
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
It's past 7.

374
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,460
With three members who played golf together.

375
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
Golf members?

376
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,460
Yeah.

377
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Did anything happen?

378
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
Or the atmosphere?

379
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
Oh, it's piled up.

380
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,460
The golf members went and the owner was a little excited.

381
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
He threw it on the wall of the bottle and it was a mess.

382
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,460
Why?

383
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
I don't know.

384
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
I'm a person like a fire.

385
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
It's a secret.

386
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Because you're one personality.

387
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Did you meet any golf members or people you met after coming to the store?

388
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
No, I didn't.

389
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,460
He called a taxi right at 9 o'clock and left.

390
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
Oh, he called a taxi?

391
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,460
Yeah.

392
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
How about coffee?

393
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
I learned it for free.

394
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
It's not bad.

395
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,460
It's like the first barista breathing in six months.

396
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Oh, my God.

397
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,460
It's been six months since I learned it.

398
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,460
Oh, it's similar to me and tomorrow.

399
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460
Oh, really.

400
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,460
I'm sorry.

401
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
I'm sorry.

402
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
I'm sorry.

403
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,460
I'm sorry.

404
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,460
I'm sorry.

406
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
I'm sorry.

407
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
I'm sorry.

409
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,460
I'm sorry.

410
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,460
I'm sorry.

411
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,460
Oh, really.

412
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
What else do you see?

413
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,460
You liked being alone.

414
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
You used the same room with your husband, right?

415
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460
Yeah.

416
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,460
I can't sleep if someone's next to me.

417
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,460
I really hate it when someone is breathing next to me when I sleep.

418
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,460
If the distance is too short, there's always a problem.

419
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
Right?

420
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,460
So I used the room separately from the beginning of my honeymoon.

421
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
My husband didn't understand.

422
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,460
He liked doing everything together.

423
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,460
When did Profiler get his own room?

424
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Since I was born.

425
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,460
I lived well at home.

426
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,460
Both my parents were doctors.

427
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,460
I envy you.

428
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
What?

429
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
I've been in the room since I was born.

430
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,460
I became a profiler.

431
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
I'm sorry.

432
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
I'm sorry.

433
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
What happened?

434
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,460
I've lost someone before.

435
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,460
You can see that?

436
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,460
I was under police investigation and I wasn't nervous at all.

437
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,460
I think I'm used to the situation of death.

438
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
That's amazing.

439
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,460
I shouldn't lie to Profiler.

440
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:38,460
I was 13 years old when the house was on fire.

441
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,460
My grandmother and sister died then.

442
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,460
Do you know that the next day was the day I moved?

443
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:59,460
There were two rooms in the new house, but my room was not there.

444
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05,460
But I think you've lost someone before.

445
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,460
That's right.

446
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:12,460
My parents died in a car accident when I was in elementary school.

447
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,460
But why did you think that?

448
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,460
Just.

449
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
I had those eyes.

450
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Just like me.

451
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,460
Thank you for your cooperation.

452
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,460
Are you leaving already?

453
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,460
I had so much fun today.

454
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:49,460
I hope we meet again.

455
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,460
Hi, everyone. How have you been?

456
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
Manager Yoon.

457
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
I missed you.

458
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,460
I missed you, too.

459
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,460
If you missed me, you should have seen it.

460
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,460
It doesn't smell like anything I've never smelled before.

461
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Didn't you go home yesterday?

462
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Oh, this is a cake I haven't seen.

463
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,460
Where is it from?

464
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,460
It's a strawberry cake.

465
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
I was just looking at the data.

466
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
The case was fun.

467
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
It's fun, but it's terrible.

468
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Don't be like In-ha.

469
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,460
What's wrong with me?

470
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,460
Let's get started.

471
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,460
I'm the culprit of this case.

472
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,460
Let's ask.

473
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,460
Do you know the victim?

474
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
Yeah.

475
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,460
That's why you lost your body.

476
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Because you're suspected right away.

477
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,460
But you caught it in a day.

478
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
You must have been hurt.

479
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
No, not yet.

480
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:22,460
The police are looking for that man who was on CCTV, not me.

481
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,460
Then what's the relationship with that guy?

482
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,460
Did you refuse?

483
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
It's not a request.

484
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,460
I just thought that guy wouldn't betray me.

485
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Who asked you to kill him?

486
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
I did.

487
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
Why? Because of money?

488
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460
Money doesn't matter.

489
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,460
I just wanted to clear it up in front of my eyes.

490
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
Why did you want to clear it up?

491
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
That's how I lived.

492
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,460
This isn't the first time.

493
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
That's right.

494
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,460
So I know how the police will come out.

495
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,460
I've been to that hotel before.

496
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,460
Is there a name for the government?

497
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
No way.

498
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,460
Then how did you call the hotel?

499
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,460
I stimulated him.

500
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
He's with me.

501
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,460
So he couldn't stand the anger.

502
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,460
He's talking.

503
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,460
He's just shaking.

504
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:40,460
He can't stand anyone touching his own.

505
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:49,460
You're a woman.

506
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,460
How did you kill him?

507
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,460
He knocked on the door.

508
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
He opened the door.

509
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,460
I went behind him and fell down.

510
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:14,460
Then I turned over 20 plastic bags and dragged them to the bathroom.

511
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,460
I ordered everything.

512
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,460
How did you feel when you killed him?

513
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:34,460
I couldn't breathe in front of me anymore.

514
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:44,460
I was really, really happy.

515
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Wait a minute.

516
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,460
It's different from the typical characteristics of a female killer.

517
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:59,460
Most of them use poison or drugs to kill because of physical conditions.

518
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,460
The law and motivation have changed.

519
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,460
I'm more bold and active in identifying evidence.

520
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:12,460
I used sleeping pills and weapons together when I saw my ex-husband's murder at a pension in Gapyeong.

521
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,460
I couldn't find any traces of the dead body.

522
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:28,460
How can I catch me?

523
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,460
Kang Chimok's wife said that day that Kang Chimok didn't come home.

524
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:43,460
I said I was late, and I didn't come home that day.

525
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:49,460
I know that I shouldn't do that.

526
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:54,460
But I was so angry that day that I didn't go into the parking lot and just put it in front of the house.

527
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,460
If you catch me, I'll just report it right away.

528
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:07,460
That's why I just took it just in case.

529
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:52,680
I don't feel like the

530
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
No way.

531
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
1025...

532
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Wow!

533
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
It's open!

534
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Oh, you're a fan of Agatha Christie.

535
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
You're not my type.

536
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,680
It's a little weird to talk about the real story.

537
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,680
I'm going to meet you again tomorrow.

538
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
I'm sorry.

539
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
I'm sorry.

540
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
I'm sorry.

541
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
I'm sorry.

542
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
I'm sorry.

543
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
I'm sorry.

544
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
I'm sorry.

545
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
I'm sorry.

546
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
I'm sorry.

547
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
I'm sorry.

548
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
I'm sorry.

549
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Hi, Karen.

550
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Are you here?

551
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
What are you doing here?

552
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
I didn't answer the phone.

553
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680
What?

554
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
I bought pizza.

555
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Don't you have honey at home?

556
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
I'll eat it with dough.

557
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
I'm sorry.

558
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Why did you use the password 1025?

559
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Isn't the profiling over yet?

560
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,680
I'm done.

561
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
It's your turn now.

562
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
How did you know the password?

563
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,680
You know this is a death-strike, right?

564
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,680
I thought we would have the same mind.

565
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
It's our house 1025 shop.

566
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
The day my uncle died.

567
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,680
It's your first and only secret case.

568
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,680
There are more things we're similar than you think.

569
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
Was the father of the deceased a police officer?

570
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,680
There's no such thing as a person.

571
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,680
I'm sorry, but this time, I got it wrong.

572
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
My father is not a police officer.

573
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
Really?

574
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,680
But why are you wearing a police uniform?

575
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,680
Did you watch the movie Red Earth?

576
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
No.

577
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,680
When you were filming that, you played a strong detective.

578
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,680
My father learned it.

579
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
It wasn't famous.

580
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,680
No wonder you said you were handsome.

581
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
Your mother must have liked it.

582
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,680
Why do women usually kill their husbands?

583
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Money, domestic violence, and depression are one of the three.

584
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,680
It's generally true.

585
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
I met with Kang Chimok's wife.

586
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,680
Why are you?

587
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,680
I was curious if you had heard about Lee Mi-young from Kang Chimok.

588
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
But it was a little weird.

589
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,680
When my grandmother and sister talked about their death, they didn't look sad at all.

590
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,680
When I said I didn't have a room, I even saw a sad expression and an angry expression.

591
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
Your room?

592
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
Why are you talking about the room all of a sudden?

593
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,680
And I didn't ask about my husband's death.

594
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,680
I think I can't stand being curious.

595
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,680
I didn't ask if there was anything in the investigation or anything.

596
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Why?

597
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Because I know the answer.

598
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,680
That's why I don't get a regular reaction as a child.

599
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
I don't think you know that.

600
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,680
Did you react normally as a child?

601
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,680
That's why we bought a similar carrier.

602
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,680
I'll ask Seoyoung to come to the interview tomorrow.

603
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
Why is the conclusion so obvious?

604
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,680
I haven't even been confessed yet, what kind of interview are you going to do?

605
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
She doesn't confess.

606
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,680
Oh, like you?

607
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,680
I'm not confessing, I'm confessing.

608
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I'm going to ask for a job tomorrow.

609
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Let's see what you say.

610
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,680
And I told you not to talk informally.

611
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,680
Oh, I ordered coffee.

612
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,680
Start.

613
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,680
Who is this man?

614
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
I don't know.

615
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,680
You have to find that.

616
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,680
You don't tell me you don't know anymore.

617
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,680
You said your husband didn't come home on the day of the incident, right?

618
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Yes.

619
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,680
Then how can I explain this?

620
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,680
I guess I fell asleep early that day and didn't know.

621
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,680
I die once I fall asleep.

622
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,680
After the call from your husband, Seoyoung's cell phone was off all day.

623
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
Until the next morning.

624
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Where were you?

625
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,680
I was at home.

626
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,680
I kept sleeping.

627
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,680
But am I the suspect?

628
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,680
Why do you think so?

629
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,680
I've seen this kind of scene a lot in movies.

630
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,680
When my husband died, my wife was the first to be suspected.

631
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,680
Is there a reason to be suspected?

632
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,680
Of course.

633
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Isn't that why you called me?

634
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,680
Have you ever met another man besides your husband?

635
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
Yes.

636
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,680
All three or four.

637
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,680
Wow.

638
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,680
That's amazing.

639
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,680
You had a special person among them.

640
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,680
What about the sportsman?

641
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,680
He broke up with me a month ago.

642
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,680
So I can't be his colleague.

643
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,680
That's not normal. You even gave me information first.

644
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,680
Is it that man's doing?

645
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,680
Did I have a heart of gold because I wanted to break up?

646
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,680
What's the reason for saying that?

647
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,680
I just thought so.

648
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,680
I've asked if you can take that position without your husband.

649
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,680
Would you like to meet him if you're okay?

650
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,680
Yes, that's right.

651
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,680
I broke up with him a month ago.

652
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,680
But the woman wasn't that much.

653
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,680
Anyway, she's a married woman.

654
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,680
It's a little too serious.

655
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,680
It's just a lot of fun.

656
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,680
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

657
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,680
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

658
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,680
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

659
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,680
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

660
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,680
It's just a lot of fun, right?

661
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
You must have hurt your hand.

662
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,680
Can I see it now?

663
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,680
Oh, yes.

664
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,680
I often get hurt because I fall down when I play tennis.

665
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:42,680
But ask Yang-hee about this.

666
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,680
I once said that.

667
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,680
I was really upset that I couldn't get a job without my husband.

668
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,680
Yes.

669
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,680
It's time for the next lesson.

670
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:05,680
I'll go now.

671
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,680
How did you hurt your hand?

672
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,680
They're accomplices.

673
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,680
Seoyang and Noh Jae-ho were in the same class in high school.

674
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,680
I don't think there was any exchange all the time.

675
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,680
I think Seoyang and Noh Jae-ho met again while he was in the tennis club a year ago.

676
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,680
There was a rumor in the club.

677
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,680
I've been on the phone with two people.

678
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,680
All contacts were cut off a month ago.

679
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,680
I can call you a couple of times, but there's nothing.

680
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,680
It's a little unnatural like a anesthetic.

681
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,680
But I was trying to give you a life insurance, but there wasn't a common life insurance.

682
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,680
What are you talking about?

683
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,680
If the life insurance is dead, it will all be inherited from Seoyang.

684
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,680
If you calculate it, you'll have a few hundred million left, except for the debt.

685
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,680
And the profit from the store is said to be two or three thousand won a month.

686
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,680
If the life insurance is gone, both of them are in a win-win situation.

687
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,680
But there must be a reason.

688
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,680
If Kang Chi-mook recently found out about their relationship.

689
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,680
It's going to be a mess.

690
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,680
I heard you're not a joke.

691
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,680
I think you said you were going to kill them both.

692
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,680
Yes, I think so, too.

693
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,680
If the two people who were so pressured decided to kill Kang Chi-mook.

694
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,680
Kang Chi-mook, who was angry at Noh Jae-wook's phone call, can run right away.

695
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,680
There's enough motivation and resistance, but there's no definite water.

696
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,680
We need to be confessed.

697
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,680
It's like a strategy to push each other.

698
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,680
We need to be balanced.

699
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,680
It was on CCTV on purpose. It's an idea of Seoyang.

700
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,680
It's also a body in a red carrier that stands out.

701
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,680
The personality of the criminal is reflected in the evidence, the person and the manipulation.

702
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,680
Seoyang is very familiar with disguise.

703
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,680
Then who will be more vulnerable?

704
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,680
Who will confess first?

705
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,680
How much do you know about Seoyang?

706
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,680
I know a lot because I'm in high school.

707
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,680
And I met him as a reason.

708
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Until a month ago.

709
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,680
Did Seoyang ever talk about his family?

710
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,680
Yes.

711
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,680
My parents died when I was young.

712
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,680
My grandmother and sister lived together.

713
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,680
Didn't you say that both grandmother and sister died after that?

714
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,680
I did.

715
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,680
But why is this?

716
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,680
How did you say you died?

717
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,680
I said there was a fire at home.

718
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,680
He wasn't home.

719
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,680
You were just saying that you weren't home?

720
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
It was a defense.

721
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,680
I didn't catch the criminal.

722
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,680
At that time, Seoyang was 13 years old, so no one doubted it.

723
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,680
Elementary school students lost both grandmother and sister at the same time.

724
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,680
You must have felt sorry for them.

725
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,680
There was someone who was doubted at that time.

726
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,680
Like Noh Jae-wook.

727
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,680
A 15-year-old middle school student who lived next door.

728
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,680
Do you know what happened to that middle school student?

729
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,680
Do I have to know?

730
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,680
He's missing.

731
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,680
I haven't found him yet.

732
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,680
You should know this, too.

733
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,680
It could happen to you.

734
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,680
You know that Seoyang is in the next room, right?

735
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,680
Seoyang is claiming that Noh Jae-wook killed her husband.

736
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,680
It's so funny.

737
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
How can this be?

738
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,680
Really?

739
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,680
You've been suspecting a profiler for 10 years as a murderer?

740
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,680
Yes, I told you.

741
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,680
I'm sick of it.

742
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,680
There's no evidence that I killed him.

743
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,680
There's no evidence that you didn't kill him, either.

744
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,680
Yes.

745
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,680
But do you know that?

746
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,680
You know the carrier that was picked up from the reservoir?

747
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,680
It was similar to my carrier.

748
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,680
What kind of carrier?

749
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,680
And this carrier found in the reservoir.

750
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,680
It was found to be the same product as the carrier that Seoyang bought three months ago.

751
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,680
It even has a card.

752
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,680
That carrier.

753
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Where is it now?

754
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,680
I think I've done everything I can.

755
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,680
Then can I go home now?

756
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Noh Jae-wook.

757
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,680
Don't you think it's safer to just stay here?

758
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Seoyang was next to me when I ran away.

759
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,680
I think I've seen a person alive among those who are related to Seoyang.

760
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,680
No one has been alive among those who are related to Seoyang.

761
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,680
Your parents, grandmother, and sister.

762
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,680
What will happen to Noh Jae-wook?

763
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,680
Actually, I was supposed to meet you after today.

764
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,680
Yang-hee.

765
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,680
Yang-hee.

766
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,680
I found the bag.

767
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,680
The victim of the murder of the soil in Yeongpyeong was arrested after several years of discovery.

768
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:00,680
Surprisingly, the wife who cried over her husband's death at the time of the incident was a murderer.

769
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,680
The police are investigating the exact motive for the murder of Ahn Hye-seo.

770
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,680
This is what reporter Park Ji-hoon said.

771
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,680
The police arrested Ahn Hye-seo and Nae-yeon Nam Noh for the crime of murder and death.

772
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:22,680
At 6 p.m. yesterday, the local newspaper was told that Ahn Hye-seo and the criminal Noh were the victims.

773
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,680
It's only been a few days since the body was found.

774
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,680
They were also accused of killing the body and killing the victim.

775
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:38,680
The police are investigating the crime of murder and the new release.

776
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:46,680
Another shocking fact is that the murder of the victim and the murder of the woman in the whiskey bar are related.

777
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,680
The police are investigating the crime of murder and the murder of the woman in the whiskey bar.

778
00:55:52,680 --> 00:56:02,680
The police are investigating the crime of murder and the murder of the woman in the whiskey bar.

779
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,680
What is this?

780
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,680
Bone.

781
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Oh, this is a good one. The neck is different.

782
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,680
I'll use it well.

783
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,680
I bought it in the style of a famous detective, but it looks really big.

784
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,680
It's weird.

785
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,680
I'll try it on.

786
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,680
How is it? Did you go to the detective?

787
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,680
It's an accident.

788
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,680
Oh, I just changed my mind.

789
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,680
I gave it to you as a gift.

790
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,680
I'm a man, so I just saw it.

791
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,680
We can give it to you as a gift. Do you have anything you want?

792
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,680
I don't have anything I want, but I have something I want to say.

793
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,680
Do it. The case is closed and I got a gift.

794
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,680
The case is not over yet.

795
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,680
It's not Seoyang or Kang Jin-mok who killed Lee Mi-young.

796
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,680
What are you talking about?

797
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,680
Then think about it.

798
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,680
Why?

799
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,680
Oh, you don't like the hat?

800
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,680
So who do you think you are?

801
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,680
What do you mean?

802
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,680
You said that it wasn't even Kang Jin-mok who killed Lee Mi-young. Who do you think you are?

803
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,680
I don't know that yet.

804
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,680
I think everyone around me except you is a suspect.

805
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:07,680
You know that, so you're not talking about it, are you?

806
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,680
Yes.

807
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,680
I'm sorry.

808
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,680
I used a stopwatch because I had a similar taste.

809
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,680
My parents died of an accident when I was young.

810
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,680
I thought I was used to the disguise like that girl in the West.

811
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,680
That's not it. In my eyes, In-ha is too transparent.

812
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,680
When I held Seoyang's hand, I remembered a movie I watched when I was young.

813
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,680
In the movie, the main character talks like this about the killer he was investigating.

814
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,680
He grew up in one house, he went out the back door, and I came out the front door.

815
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,680
It's important that In-ha came out the front door.

816
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,680
Seoyang didn't kill her husband because she wanted to live with her lover because of money.

817
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Seoyang wanted a bigger house and a bigger space.

818
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,680
So she got married, but she was invaded by her husband.

819
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,680
Seoyang was just being invaded by her husband, so she just removed the hindrance.

820
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,680
As if she killed her grandmother and sister when she was 13.

821
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,680
It's too hard. I'll find the answer.

822
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,680
What kind of sleep is this?

823
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,680
I'm done with work today. I'm drinking beer today.

824
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,680
I'm going to work.

825
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,680
Thank you.

826
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,680
I'm going to work.

827
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,680
I'm going to work.

828
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,680
I'm going to work.

829
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,680
I'm going to work.

01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,680

01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,680
I'm going to work.

01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,680
I'm going to work.

834
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,680
I'm going to work.

835
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,680
I'm going to work.

836
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,680
I'm going to work.

837
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,680

838
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,680

01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,680
I'm going to work.

842
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,680
I'm going to work.

843
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,680
I'm going to work.

844
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,680
I'm going to work.

845
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,680
I'm going to work.

846
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,680
I'm going to work.

847
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,680
