1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,920
(The characters, groups, background, events, etc. of this play
This is purely fictitious, please be informed)

2
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,037
No. 5802, Unique City

3
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:41,124
It is the only connection between the three victims.

4
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,431
The last owner of this house was Lee Mi-young

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,111
The previous owner was Jiang Zhimu

6
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:38,973
The first owner of this house was Do Run-su

7
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,319
When Du Runxiu first started selling the unique city

8
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,571
Purchased 13 houses

9
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,367
No. 5802 is one of the 13 households.

10
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,746
Currently, the remaining 12 households are under the name of his family.

11
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,543
Why did he give this house to Jiang Zhimu?

12
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,381
Where exactly does this story begin?

13
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:38,718
Blood Puzzle

14
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,973
Jiang Zhimu and Li Meiying are in a relationship of marriage
It is normal to transfer the house

15
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,228
But Du Runxiu transferred the house to Jiang Zhimu
There must be a reason.

16
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,231
Is it because of vested interests?

17
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,318
No. 5802, Unique City
No lawsuits or accidents involved

18
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:00,031
The strange thing is that they all completed the transfer in a short period of time

19
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,325
After Du Runxiu bought the house

20
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,494
Transfer to Jiang Zhimu within two months

21
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,955
The house was transferred to Lee Mi-young within a month.

22
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,873
As if it was agreed

23
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,292
What kind of agreement would allow them to transfer the house?

24
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,837
Yoon Dong-hoon, Lee Mi-young, Kang Ji-mok

25
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,091
You said that the three of them might be the criminals.
Rather than the victim

26
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,550
If Do Run-su is included

27
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,053
The four of them committed a crime together

28
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,722
The reward for crime is to make three other people

29
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,100
How about getting the unique city number 5802?

30
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,400
But why only my uncle?

31
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,278
Not getting paid?

32
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,072
Why didn't this matter have anything to do with him?

33
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,450
He was the victim in the first case.
There must be a reason.

34
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,454
The intersection should be Han River Police Station

35
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,541
The only city is within the jurisdiction of the Han River Police Station

36
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,585
Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon
Served as the Chief of Han River Police Station for one year

37
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,797
Is it Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon?

38
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,758
Covering up the case related to the One City?

39
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,262
He covered up a crime.

40
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,895
If it's to help cover up a crime

41
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,441
He should be paid more generously.

42
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,280
What was my uncle paid for?

43
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,661
A case involving four people.

44
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,290
Do Yoon-soo's Jigsaw Puzzle

45
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:36,002
There is a clown
Trampling the sand castles built by the children

46
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,005
Jiang Zhimu's is someone dancing with armbands

47
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,468
Lee Mi-young's is someone whispering to someone

48
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,387
Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon's Jigsaw Puzzle

49
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,473
Someone shot at the doll.

50
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,730
These pictures on the puzzle

51
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,066
Can it correspond to any criminal behavior?

52
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,325
I think...

53
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,704
My head hurts

54
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,165
I need a cup of coffee, do you want some?

55
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,418
I want hot latte
Switch to oat milk and add two parts condensed

56
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,962
I said my head hurts, what do you mean?

57
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,422
I'll order takeout.

58
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,257
No thanks, there's a nice cafe up ahead

59
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,134
Let's go out for a walk.

60
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,011
I want to take a walk

61
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,482
- Welcome
- Hello

62
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,610
I want a cup of hand-brewed coffee

63
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,822
And a latte, hot latte, and...

64
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,283
Switch to oat milk

65
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,245
And add two parts of concentrated

66
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,454
good

67
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,039
A cup of hot hand-brewed coffee

68
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,918
A hot latte for oat milk
Two portions of concentrate, right?

69
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,628
Sorry for bothering you

70
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,420
Why did you turn off the light?

71
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,551
Because you snore loudly

72
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,306
I don't snore.

73
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,270
You should help me put on some clothes at a time like this

74
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,898
There's a reason you've been single for ten years.

75
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,983
You don't understand women

76
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,777
I even ran errands to buy you coffee.
You actually said this

77
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,655
The room temperature is 27 degrees Celsius now.

78
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,782
Some people sweat.

79
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,577
The coffee here is delicious

80
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,831
So sleepy

81
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,416
Shall we go out for a walk?

82
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,343
Very sweet

83
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,471
You came here early in the morning.
It's definitely not to buy me coffee.

84
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,014
What do you want?

85
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,807
Chief Police Officer Yun Dong-hoon

86
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,520
What kind of policeman is he?

87
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,980
Dongxun? Why are you asking about him?

88
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,817
I know he's someone you admire.

89
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,822
There are many things I am curious about.
Including his murder

90
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,370
But what you said

91
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,873
That sounds weird.

92
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,125
You sound like

93
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,045
It seems that Dongxun died because he made a mistake.

94
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,426
(Yin Yiluo, calling)

95
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,180
After all, human hearts are unpredictable.

96
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,015
The human heart is unpredictable?

97
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,521
Jin Hanquan, your true nature is revealed again

98
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,273
Just like when you asked me

99
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,857
Do I have that?

100
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,776
Isn't there? Brat

101
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,365
What kind of person is Brother Dongxun?

102
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,494
He's a different kind of policeman.

103
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,372
After all, he is the youngest director.

104
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,999
The superior must like him very much.

105
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,917
Of course I like it

106
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,796
He is very good at handling cases and has the demeanor of a police officer.

107
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,131
So why did he resign?

108
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,092
Rather than saying he resigned

109
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,970
It's better to say that he was kicked out in order to calm public opinion.

110
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,515
The area was in chaos at the time.

111
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,977
Hey, you know it too

112
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,604
Central Japan Serial Murder Case

113
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,648
Every Monday when it rains, someone gets killed
Stockings on the face

114
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,026
That case happened within the jurisdiction of the Han River Police Station.

115
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,904
Until three female students died

116
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,282
We found out it was the same criminal.

117
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,200
Five people died in the end

118
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,788
At that time, things were in turmoil
Dongxun will be kicked out

119
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,124
His ending was terrible.

120
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,443
Are we going to talk about the place that can make you fall asleep today?

121
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,278
Do you still want to keep it a secret?

122
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,114
It's not really a big secret.

123
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,868
But there's nothing to say
I had already said it.

124
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,705
I have thought about

125
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,626
The reason you can sleep in such a dirty place

126
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,254
Well, there is a behavior called hoarding disorder

127
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,715
Once you own something, you can't throw it away

128
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,386
That is also considered a mental illness

129
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,099
What kind of person is he?

130
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,730
Letâ€™s talk about my uncle today.

131
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,152
I used to think

132
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,863
Maybe my uncle

133
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,741
Not the kind of person I know.

134
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,120
After all, we can't satisfy everyone.

135
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,708
How could you think that?

136
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,209
Last time you asked me

137
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,586
Trying to follow my uncle's choice

138
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,798
I'm going to do what you said now.

139
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,926
actually

140
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,387
I chose to turn a blind eye

141
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,306
Because I don't know what to see

142
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,975
Something pops up

143
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,769
Because I'm scared

144
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,273
sometimes

145
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,901
People feel tired just by keeping their eyes open.

146
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,781
You are like me
Are there things you want to ignore?

147
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,117
Of course, I am human too.

148
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,369
What's the matter?

149
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,206
My privacy is also a secret

150
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,634
(Second Consultation Room)

151
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,179
Hello

152
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,181
Hello

153
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,349
My friend

154
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,435
Work Here

155
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,772
This is the only police-designated hospital nearby.

156
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,650
yes

157
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,068
yes

158
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,873
Did you see Lee Mi-young's car on the day of the incident?

159
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,334
right

160
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,338
The reason I remember...

161
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,426
Because of the Porsche Panamera
It's my dream car.

162
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,262
So I will pay attention to it when I meet it on the road

163
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,142
But she stepped on the accelerator at a red light

164
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,354
She knew the police were watching

165
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,692
It was nearly 10pm and there were no cars on the road.

166
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,110
So I didn't follow.

167
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,993
If I had stopped that car...

168
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,833
If I did that
Maybe that wouldn't happen.

169
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,879
This has always bothered me.

170
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,132
Why do you think she was under the police's nose?

171
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,803
What if you violate the rules by running a red light and stepping on the accelerator to the floor?

172
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,139
What?

173
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,474
That's right

174
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,601
She ran the red light on purpose.

175
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,728
Lee Mi-young saw the patrol car

176
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,815
I tried my best to send out a distress signal.

177
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,738
Do you remember anything else?
Or did you see anything?

178
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,740
Especially the back seat of the car

179
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,953
No

180
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,164
Because the window film is very black

181
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,794
Anyway, thank you

The result will not change

187
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,455
Why don't you answer the phone every time?

188
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,041
You're so embarrassed to say that to me
Then why didn't you answer the phone before?

189
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,501
I can't win you at all

190
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,837

00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,823
I thought he stopped being a cop because of me.

194

My uncle, a respected policeman

195
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,625
What case was covered up?

196
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,377
After all, human hearts are unpredictable.

197
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,132
The crimes he covered up and the cases he shielded
Maybe not a few

198
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,847
But can you do it?

199
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,476

I have to do that.

No, I'm asking if you can do it.

00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,709
Um

205
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,339

220
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,938
Why do you think Dongxun died?

221
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,196
This is it

(The Mingcheng Daily defamation lawsuit)

223
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,076
The victim's family members reported to Mingcheng Daily

224
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,037
and the journalist responsible filed a defamation lawsuit

225
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,498
The case was closed after three months with no suspicion

226
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,004
The plaintiff is the Central Region serial murder case

227
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,964
The brother of the last victim

228
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,635
This case happened to be the case of Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon

Reasons for quitting the police job

230
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,934
So this defamation case
This must be the last case he covered up.

231
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,311
Let's investigate this defamation case first.

232
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,188
If our reasoning is correct

233
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,274
That should be it.
Because Chief Detective Yoon Dong-hoon covered up the case

234
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,777
The victim whose life was ruined is killing people

235
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,655
The other party is the victim
He is also the culprit in the Jigsaw murder case.

236
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,741
- Let's go
- etc

237
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,662
I have something to tell you

handkerchief?

239
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,921
It was just an ordinary, old handkerchief
The kind that old men would use

240
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,008
Cui Suanyou, who arrived at the scene first, saw
Then it disappeared

There's no handkerchief either.

242
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,140
Only I, Cui Suan and Team Leader Liang know about this

243
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,017
maybe

244
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,854
The perpetrators or accomplices are among us

245
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,649
But why are you saying it now?

246
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,734
Please, that's because you...

00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,236
Do you believe them?

248
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,448
- What?
- Do you believe in Cui Suan?

249
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,119
Of course I believe

Where is Liang Zhenghu?

251

Anyone in the Han River Police Station could be the criminal

You can even doubt me

253
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,210
But the criminal is definitely not Zheng Huge

254
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,630
Can you do it?

255
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,048
What can be done?

256
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,468
Can you look them in the face?

257
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,762
Can you serve as a normal Jin Hanquan guard?

258

Don't you understand me yet?

00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,397
What? Are you going to take off your hat and get mad again?

262
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,859
I say again, don't take your hat off in front of me

285
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,693

00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,823
but

360
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,243
I don't know yet
Who among us took the handkerchief?

361
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,704
Would it be too hasty to make the case public like this?

362
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,291
And most importantly

363
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,042
Yin Yiluo Guard

364
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,004
I once asked you if she could be trusted.

365
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,007
Do you know everything about Yin Yiluo?

366
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,175
How many things do you know?

367
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,177
What does that mean?

368
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,597
You're asking like this, I guess you don't know

369
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,516
Go ask Yin Yiluo yourself.

370
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,144
Also, I will not accept your annual leave application

371
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,105
After all, you are investigating the murder case of Du Runxiu.

372
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,650
You don't need to come to work for the time being, just continue your investigation

373
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,570
But if you find anything, report it to me immediately.

374
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,668
(Director Xuan Haojin, calling)

375
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,176
Sit down

376
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,637
I'll stand and listen.

377
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,888
good

378
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,432
You don't even have the right to sit down.

379
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,811
You can't even catch the murderer of Du Runxiu.

380
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,941
Still busy investigating ten years ago
The case of Yangxi Police Station?

381
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,612
Are you free?

382
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,406
What are you thinking about?

383
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,618
Explain clearly so I can understand

384
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,039
I can't tell you yet

385
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,749
What?

386
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,129
Should I report this to my superiors?

387
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,632
Why is it you who decides?

388
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,384
Say it

389
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,015
I think the murder of Do Yoon Soo
It's related to the murder of Li Gangxuan ten years ago

390
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,894
And also with Lee Mi-young, Jiang Zhimu
It's related to the murder of Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon

391
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,984
I also think that the center of all this may be

392
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,653
Our Han River Police Station

393
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,281
What is the clue?

394
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,659
What made you think that?

395
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,205
I'll find it out

396
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,792
Hey, stinky guy

397
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,088
Then you should find it first and then tell me this.

398
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,549
I will go find it

399
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:57,193
Those boxes contain evidence from early 2010.

400
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,530
I'm not sure if there is one. Please look for it.

401
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,614
good

402
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,210
- Lee Gang Hyun murder case?
- right

403
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,842
yes

404
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,679
The case ended in suicide.

405
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,598
But I actually feel something is wrong

406
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,685
He died in a plastic bag

407
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,645
I think it's a bit strange

408
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,440
People who want to commit suicide don't usually do it that way.

409
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,525
Why wasn't a facial autopsy conducted at that time?

410
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,236
Itâ€™s not that we donâ€™t test, but that we canâ€™t test.

411
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,405
His family members strongly opposed

412
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,700
Lee Gang Hyun

413
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,579
After divorcing his wife
He lived with his son for a long time.

414
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:54,042
He suffers from severe depression
So I can't live without alcohol and sleeping pills

415
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,462
The day before the incident

416
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,507
He told his best friend that raising a child alone is tiring

417
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,759
He also said he wanted to die

418
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,637
Suicide motives are very strong

419
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,727
Senior, do you still remember
Was that the puzzle piece that was at the crime scene?

420
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,858
puzzle?

421
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,706
Found it

422
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,751
I remember

423
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,214
Strangely enough, there is a puzzle piece
Neatly placed next to the corpse

424
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,507
Like someone put it there on purpose

425
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,845
Although I was investigating the case
Often find a variety of things

426
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,138
But Lee Gang Hyun's son said that it was not his property

427
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,307
I was wondering why there was a puzzle

428
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,769
How to say it?

429
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,479
The picture above

430
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,065
Makes people feel very uncomfortable

431
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,359
What happened to that picture?

432
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,946
It shows a man holding a camera.

433
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,783
His eyes are funny.
It was sewn together with something like thread.

434
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,453
That picture is weird.

435
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,665
Looks like a child's drawing

436
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,709
It looks like an adult's painting.

437
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,596
Do you remember anyone at the time of the incident?
Or do you feel something is strange?

438
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,433
Let me think

439
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,185
The person who knows the case best?

440
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,065
Aren't you affiliated with the Han River Police Station?

441
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,776
- right
- Then you should know Liang Zhenghu

442
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,778
Yes, we are in the same group.

443
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,530
He's so close to you.

444
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,949
Zheng Hu should be the person who knows this case best.

445
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,203
What? What does that mean?

446
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,917
Liang Zhenghu was originally in charge of this case.

447
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,586
But he was suddenly transferred to the investigation headquarters of the headquarters

448
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,713
That's why the case was handed over to me.

449
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,965
In fact, the cases are all investigated by the Zhenghu

450
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,844
I just followed my superior's instructions to close the case.

451
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,014
Oh, but it was much better then.

452
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,642
Don't quit your job as a police officer.

453
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,769
This society is more difficult than imagined

454
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,689
Are you really talking about the Han River Police Station?

455
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,817
Is this Chief Inspector Liang Zhenghu, the leader of the Serious Crime Unit 2?

456
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,611
right

457
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,171
Did you find anything?

458
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,341
In the surveillance camera near the scene where Do Yoon-soo died

459
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,969
I finally got the back door of Kaineng Building

460
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,553
Beer house surveillance camera images

461
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,722
Didn't they say that was broken?

462
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,100
The store owner was unwilling to cooperate because it was too much trouble, so he lied.

463
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,602
I threatened to shut down the store.

464
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,687
They told the truth

465
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,480
Did you capture anything?

466
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,232
I didn't capture any special footage.

467
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,651
As you can see, the quality is terrible.

468
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,613
I heard you told Jin Hanquan
The disappearance of the handkerchief at the crime scene

469
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,203
In addition to the handkerchief

470
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,997
Do you remember anything else?

471
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,793
For example, someone who was behaving strangely at the time

472
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,630
Because the scene was a mess.

473
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,174
That's all I told Guard Kim.

474
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,469
So what should I do now?

475
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,598
How could the handkerchief disappear?

476
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,987
(Jin Hanquan: Team leader, I have something to report)

477
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,131
How can you drink in broad daylight?
It's working time now

478
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,675
You are here

479
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,270
What do you want to report?

480
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,189
elder brother

481
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,276
Do you know when I think you are the most handsome?

482
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,032
You go to the orphanage every month.
Being a volunteer is really cool.

483
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:39,285
But you grew up there.
So it's normal to do this.

484
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,331
What are you talking about? Report first.

485
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,416
before

486
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,169
When you first became the team leader

487
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,589
You said you had to go to the victim's funeral

488
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,467
I also asked why you went there
Do You Recall?

489
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,347
This is how you answered me

490
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,643
You said you were going to apologize

491
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,814
You said the criminal police's duty is to protect the people

492
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,024
But you couldn't do it

493
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,903
And you have to promise that you will catch the criminal.

494
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,405
I felt

495
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,158
You are the most handsome

496
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,454
I think solving cases is fun.

497
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,624
Because I like mystery novels and detective movies
That's why I became a policeman.

498
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,585
But your starting point is different

499
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,257
I've never seen a police officer with such a strong sense of mission as you.

500
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,925
I thought

501
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,136
"People like you should be police officers"

502
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,013
Because you are a very warm person

503
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,725
Because Liang Zhenghu is justice in the world

504
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,394
I really thought so.

505
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,021
That's why I call you Batman.

506
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,692
What exactly do you want to say?

507
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,944
But why didn't you tell me?

508
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,490
You are the detective in charge of the Lee Gang Hyun murder case

509
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,534
A puzzle piece appeared in that case

510
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,372
That was the first Jigsaw murder.

511
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,710
You obviously know everything, why didn't you tell me?

512
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,516
Did you take the handkerchief?

513
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,937
Hanquan

514
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,063
Is that you?

515
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,773
Why would I do that?

516
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,527
Otherwise I can't explain why you didn't tell me

517
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,117
Why do you think I didn't tell you?

518
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,952
I have no idea

519
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,830
I asked you before

520
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,000
Do you know Yin Yiluo well?

521
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,877
How much do you know?

522
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,009
Mokdong Apartment 212

523
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,345
That is the resident number where Lee Gang Hyun died.

524
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,305
That day

525
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,808
Do you know who is at No. 314, the floor above his house?

526
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,191
Lee Gang Hyun's son, Lee Sun Wook

527
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,943
And his son's friends

528
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,695
Jo Seul-gi, Oh Young-hoon

529
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,115
And Yin Yiluo

530
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,329
It was winter vacation.

531
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,041
They are at the home of a friend of Li Gangxuan's son
Group Math Tutoring

532
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,461
Classes are from 9pm to midnight

533
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,799
Monitor screen display
At 12:05 a.m. they all went home.

534
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,302
But there is no sign of Yin Yiluo

535
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,471
Why?

536
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,391
She claimed she was unwell
I went home early at 11pm

537
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,435
But Yin Yiluo did not leave the apartment at that time.

538
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,689
The time she was caught on camera

539
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,442
It was one hour later at 12:23 am

540
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,325
Lee Gang Hyun's death date
It is estimated to be between 10 pm and midnight.

541
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,246
On the day of the incident, only Yin Yiluo
The alibi is unclear

542
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,457
But I can't see her

543
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,585
Because Chief Inspector Yoon Dong-hoon stopped me

544
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,213
According to Chief Police Officer Yun Dong-hoon

545
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,925
That day, Yin Yiluo was in a bad mood and went to the top floor.

546
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,970
Then stay there until the tutoring is over.

547
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,141
Do you think this makes sense?

548
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,269
I also want to continue investigating the murder of Lee Gang Hyun

549
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,938
But I was suddenly transferred to the Investigation Headquarters of the General Office.

550
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,776
Then eight months later

551
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,572
Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon was murdered

552
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,656
Same

553
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,701
Yin Yi-ra's alibi is not clear

554
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,749
Can you still trust Yin Yiluo in this case?

555
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,924
That's why I can't tell you

556
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,559
As long as we find the accomplices hidden among us

557
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,730
The truth will come out then.

558
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,001
Lee Gang Hyun's residence is No. 212

559
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,379
Ten years ago that day

560
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,632
The place where I have a tutor is No. 314

561
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,969
Hey, damn, arenâ€™t we all chaebols?

562
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,890
I don't have much money.
They can't do this to me, can they? Damn it.

563
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,892
Hello

564
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,353
Damn, I can reveal more explosive news

565
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,189
Damn, even if they say I'm a has-been reporter

566
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,941
But you know me damn well, right?

567
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,653
I'm Lee Gang Hyun, damn it

568
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,698
As long as I make up my fucking mind and turn over a new leaf

569
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,369
If they start writing news again, they will all be doomed

570
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,413
Damn it, I'm not going to die on my own, get it?

571
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,706
Stop laughing, go to hell

572
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,834
Hello

573
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,961
I'll show no mercy, damn it

574
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,130
Did you hear that?

575
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,134
8:55pm, five minutes before the tutoring session starts

576
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:32,263
Nothing unusual happened that day.

577
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,601
Zhejin, I always talk to you about money
I really feel sorry

578
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,148
But please say a few good words for me.

579
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,482
What?

580
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:47,695
If I knew it would turn out like this
Of course I won't sell it, damn it.

581
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,405
Just help me once.

582
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,783
Hey, just once!

583
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,580
Hey, when we had our glory days together

584
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,416
But it can be a relationship of life and death

585
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,085
We are like comrades on the battlefield, hey...

586
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,087
Hello?

587
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,361
"Glory Days"

588
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,323
What I saw at that time

589
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,867
This is the last sight of Lee Gang Hyun

590
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,829
We have learned that the variance is npq, and q is equal to 1 minus p

591
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,666
Okay, take the positive square root of
The standard deviation is obtained

592
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,959
Then letâ€™s look at the topic

593
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,129
What is the mean and standard deviation of 2x minus 5?

594
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,049
How do you write the average of 2x minus 5?

595
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,885
To write 2x minus 5

596
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:57,264
But it can be rewritten as twice 2e times x minus 5

597
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,016
So what is the result?

598
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,102
If we move 5 over...

599
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,814
Because I was feeling depressed during the tutoring class
So I went to the top floor

600
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,443
If my memory serves me right, by then

601
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,071
Nothing special happened

602
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,157
It was very cold that day

603
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,369
What music am I listening to?

604
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,206
That was the music I often listened to when I was in high school.

605
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,518
Then I saw someone

606
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,020
Enter the apartment from the main entrance

607
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,360
Who is it?

608
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,759
That was the first time the criminal killed someone.

609
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,387
The killing method is almost perfect

610
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,973
The first time you commit a crime, you should be nervous.

611
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,019
But the criminal did not make a stupid mistake.
Or leave clues at the scene

612
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,273
The only thing that can fail for a prisoner is

613
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,109
The puzzle didn't get attention.

614
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,865
If you clear out the shochu bottles and sleeping pills

615
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:42,286
The case would not be covered up as suicide.
Looks like a perfect crime.

616
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,496
That was the criminal's mistake.

617
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,260
I?

618
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,181
Liang Zhenghu asked you if the prisoner was me?

619
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,602
Why would he doubt me?

620
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,230
Wood Cave Apartment 314

621
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,075
What were you doing when Lee Gang Hyun died?

622
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,496
That day

623
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,165
I'm on the top floor

624
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,167
I really don't want to read

625
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,670
If I go home, my uncle will definitely complain about me.

626
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,546
So I just spent my time on the top floor

627
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,301
Don't you believe me 100%?

628
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,055
When you are in the document library
Why didnâ€™t you say you knew Lee Gang Hyun?

629
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,432
You must know your friend's father.
How could I not know?

630
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,018
You didn't tell me about the handkerchief.

631
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,813
- What nonsense? I told you about the handkerchief.
- You said it later.

632
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,690
That's because you never answer the phone.

633
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,276
Anyway, I told you

634
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,529
Then why didn't you tell me later?
Do you know Lee Gang Hyun?

635
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,241
Everyone has things that they are embarrassed to say.

636
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,035
I don't even know about the illegal tutoring classes I took in high school
Do I have to tell you everything?

637
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,413
If it's related to the case, of course you have to tell me.

638
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,583
What about Liang Zhenghu?

639
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,878
Why did he know about Lee Gang Hyun's murder?
But you said nothing?

640
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:18,006
Why did I mention the puzzle?
He ignored what I said?

641
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,051
Because he doesn't trust you, he thinks you're a criminal.

642
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,636
Just forget it if you don't tell me

643
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,388
Why didn't he even tell you?

644
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,890
He should have enough time to tell you.

645
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,359
Think carefully about who you should trust.

646
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,803
(Call record details)

647
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,974
(Wu Zhejin)

648
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,814
Wu Zhejin

649
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,152
Wu Zhejin

650
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,910
Yi Luo, you are at home

651
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,662
Aunt

652
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,748
Do you know Wu Zhejin?

653
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,959
Who? Wu Zhejin?

654
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,342
I've heard of this name
But I don't know what he looks like.

655
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,287
(Yin Yiluo: Decide who you want to believe quickly)

656
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,498
(If you have made a decision
You have to believe me anyway.)

657
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,430
Look here

658
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,266
1.2

659
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,854
(Jeju International Airport)

660
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,719
You will send gifts to my uncle, right?

661
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,680
Every festival, and my birthday

662
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,183
No wonder I think your name is familiar

663
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:20,606
Because I heard Director Yin
She loves her niece very much.

664
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,359
Also, those aren't gifts.

665
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,612
It's the phone bill

666
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,949
Many problems can be solved with just one phone call

667
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,873
That was a very long time ago.

668
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,084
Is that the reason you came all the way here?

669
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,629
How is that possible?

670
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,257
There is a person named Li Gangxuan

671
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,554
Are you familiar with it?

672
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,899
How do you know Gang Hyun?

673
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,194
Are you really Director Yoonâ€™s niece?

674
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,283
(I donâ€™t think this should be sent.)

675
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,243
(Letâ€™s talk about it when we meet)

676
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,330
(What are you doing?)

677
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,176
(Dialing, Yin Yiluo)

678
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,934
Hello?

679
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,936
This is Miss Yin Yiluo's cell phone.

680
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,940
Hello?

681
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,692
thisâ€¦

682
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,402
Isnâ€™t this Yin Yiluoâ€™s cell phone?

683
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,237
Yes, that's right.

684
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,364
This is the Jeju Police Station

685
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,366
What is your relationship with Miss Yin Yiluo?

686
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,494
I am a colleague of Yin Yiluo's guard.
What happened?

687
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,288
This is hard to explain.

688
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:04,793
Guard Yin Yiluo was
We are staying at the Jeju Police Station.

689
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,462
What happened? Was she sent for backup?

690
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,964
It's not like that

691
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,341
She is a murder suspect.

692
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,719
What?

693
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,116
Miss

694
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,161
Miss!

695
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,998
What are you doing there?

696
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,129
Hello

697
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,757
I asked you what you were doing there.

698
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,591
Subtitle translation: Zhang Xinru
