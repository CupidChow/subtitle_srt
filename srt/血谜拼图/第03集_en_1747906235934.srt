00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

6
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hello, I'm Yoon In-ha, a Seoul City Office of Criminal Analysis, who has been involved in the Lee Mi-young case since today.

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Where should I put the money?

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What are you doing now?

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's the boss's order.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm Yang Jung-woo, the second team leader.

11
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, I look forward to your kind cooperation.

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

13
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

15
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I need a little while, please.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going to put the money in the box.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you have something to say to me?

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I do.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's try.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's your purpose in coming here?

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Huh?

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you afraid we'll find out something?

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You've never doubted yourself, have you?

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Doubt yourself.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That way, you can find the answer.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Did you come all the way here just to talk about that?

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No way.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why did I come here?

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What's certain is that Hyun-ok, Taedong-soo, and Lee Mi-young, and even my uncle who died 10 years ago, are all related.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But why did you take it out?

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I remember it finally.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What?

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What do you mean you remember?

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was with the criminal.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
In the living room 10 years ago.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's a long story, right?

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I was really worried that I might have killed him, but I wasn't.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You remember it after 10 years?

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't you want to believe that you remember it?

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You must have been very anxious because of the situation.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't care even if I remember it.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't care?

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't care?

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You keep your mouth shut and you're gonna be treated like a son to me.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not your senior anymore.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't want to.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You don't want to?

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why not?

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm older than you and much older than you.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you really a punk?

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You want to know the reason?

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You didn't see the scene?

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's just a normal case.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why is the profiler doing this?

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why haven't you caught the culprit yet?

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I got a grant and sent it down from the main office to catch the culprit as soon as possible.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Are you done?

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's time to come here.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go find a clue.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why do I have to be friends with the boss at this time?

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't understand if the person who is best friends with the boss is destroyed in our team.

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're a jerk.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But does the detective know that he's profiling himself?

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You'll know soon.

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll know soon.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, I have that much sense.

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But why did you choose him as your partner?

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
First of all, he's very persistent.

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't let go of it once I get hooked.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you open this lid, people change.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Like this.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Lid?

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, that lid.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, but does it make sense?

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I remember it now.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Am I really PTSD?

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If you remember it after 10 years, you'll be happy.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And...

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But I've never been wrong about the diagnosis.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But why haven't you remembered it yet?

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I feel guilty.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why am I?

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Because I didn't look back.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because I didn't look back?

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What would have happened if I had looked back then?

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Would the culprit have killed me?

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Wouldn't it have been?

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But I can sleep a little.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm glad.

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm glad I didn't call you.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Of course, that's included.

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But do you believe me?

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I remember. I believe you.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can't believe my memory 100%.

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's go.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I asked you to share the investigation, but you didn't look at the data.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Where did you go?

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, you must have gone to lunch.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's not a serial murder, but you're from the resource.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're not going to go out, are you?

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's do what we used to do.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll share the information about the case.

129
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do I have to do that?

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mr. Kim.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can just match it up.

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why are you so sharp?

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We're going to catch the culprit anyway.

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Stop it.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What haven't we found yet?

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The reason why the culprit only took the card.

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll start over from there.

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll ask for a second inspection by the National Security Service.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll ask if there's anyone who's not at home.

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sure there's something you had to take home.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Chan is looking for what kind of string the culprit is.

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Question.

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's not a question.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I heard it while I was picking up the black box.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
A 50-year-old man said that the place where the victim parked was the place where he parked himself.

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But from today, when I parked there, the tire was screwed on and the wheel was broken.

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
At first, I passed it over, but if I parked it right there, the car was broken.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There was no CCTV in the square area, so I was angry that I parked it somewhere else.

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's strong.

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It must be a coincidence.

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No.

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You've been working hard for a long time.

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Team leader, I'll go into the Seoul City Hall and check the CCTV of the apartment parking lot again.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I think something will come out.

155
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

160
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm going to check the CCTV.

168
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What are you doing in a stranger's seat?

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I think Kim Han-seung is T.

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What do you mean?

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I mean, Kim Kyung-hee.

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He's not T. He doesn't have empathy and doesn't give his heart to the people around him.

173
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know. I think he's good.

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Do you have an F?

175
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Did you hear that I followed Kim Han-seung for 10 years?

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Did you say that's right?

178
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Kim Han-seung, the victim's accomplice, investigated it.

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you.

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What the hell is this?

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's T.

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Stop, stop.

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Should I zoom in on this part?

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Can you turn the screen a little brighter?

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll try to go one frame ahead of you from here.

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The only CCTV that was missing from Lee Mi-young's movements was the culprit.

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The culprit definitely got in the car here.

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But why did he take the time?

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why didn't he kill him right away?

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, you knew he was in the car and killed him here.

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He's a perfectist. He's like you, close to the river.

193
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The culprit decided on the crime scene in advance and moved right here to the parking lot.

194
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If I had to bring Lee Mi-young here, I would have thought about where she was hiding.

195
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The variable is small and the range is short.

196
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Where is the easiest?

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know.

198
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's not a car.

199
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's just two spaces.

200
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's near the whiskey bar where Lee Mi-young parked without CCTV.

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The culprit must have waited there quietly, waiting for Lee Mi-young to get in the car.

202
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Calmly, maintaining calm.

203
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
One minute, five minutes, ten minutes.

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And Lee Mi-young got in the car.

205
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It was a perfect opportunity.

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Now all you have to do is kill him.

207
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But the culprit waited again.

208
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
35 minutes until he came here.

209
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There must be a reason why he didn't kill him until he came here.

210
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The woman in the puzzle says something in her ear.

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Is there a relationship with the words?

212
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What did the culprit say to Lee Mi-young for 35 minutes?

213
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What else did Lee Mi-young say to the culprit?

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Was the answer important or was this place important?

215
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What was important?

216
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You have to ask the culprit.

217
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What is this?

218
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I couldn't say hello properly then.

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let's just eat and go.

220
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What are you talking about?

221
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Who is this?

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Hello, mother.

223
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You remember me, right?

224
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Can I eat something before I go?

225
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
My son is coming with me today.

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Mom, it's okay. Don't open the door.

227
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I was curious about you.

228
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Nice to meet you.

229
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Do you eat a lot?

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But it's a little bland.

232
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I like stimulating things.

233
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's why I'm going to the cooking class.

234
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So when he comes home, he almost orders delivery.

236
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So you don't eat?

237
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You said you don't have to worry about it.

238
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I didn't know you were coming to eat with me.

239
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He's trying to profile me.

240
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I noticed.

241
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Have you ever brought your girlfriend home?

243
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There's nothing to answer.

244
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's a very private question.

245
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Is that also profiling?

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm interested in Kim Han-sem.

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I've been following him for 10 years.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Really?

249
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll have to answer well.

250
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I've met my girlfriend outside, but I've never brought her home.

251
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What about friends?

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Have you ever brought your friend?

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is this your first time?

254
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I have a friend who asked me to bring her food.

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
In-ha is the second.

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Who is that friend?

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Mom, don't answer that.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It was when I was in high school.

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
One day, I brought my friend.

260
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But I've never heard of her.

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Something was wrong.

262
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
She said one thing while eating.

263
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's true.

264
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Mom, I'm going.

265
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Come on out.

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What do you mean?

267
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Han-semi said that the curry made by her mom tastes like black bean sauce.

268
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
She doesn't believe me, but you eat and tell me.

269
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So I brought her home.

270
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
She still comes to eat sometimes.

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't let go of her if I hold her hand once.

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I've had a good meal.

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, you didn't even eat it all.

274
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You just said anything, right?

275
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Why did you do that?

276
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Why did you say curry tastes like black bean sauce?

277
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's not that kind of character.

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You wanted to protect her.

279
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So you put your friend by your side every day, saying something you don't like.

280
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
She was my sick friend.

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
In many ways.

282
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Hey, curry guy.

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'd like you to hold my hand.

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's been 10 years since the puzzle came to me.

286
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I just remembered that there was a criminal behind me that day.

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I asked you.

288
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Why am I the first to find out?

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Why did you send me a puzzle?

290
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You still don't know the answer?

291
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The criminal knows me.

292
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's why I profiled you.

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Because I'm not the criminal.

294
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And because the criminal knows me.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I needed someone to trust.

296
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Now it's your turn.

297
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You profile me.

298
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Watch and observe.

299
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Until you're sure.

300
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
At least.

301
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
At least attack.

302
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:36,640
The criminal will only do what the

303
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:46,640
The culprit was already breaking Lee Mi-young's daily life.

304
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Why was it Lee Mi-young?

305
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,640
And why was it my uncle?

306
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:16,640
The culprit was already breaking Lee Mi-young's daily life.

307
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:26,640
The culprit was already breaking Lee Mi-young's daily life.

308
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,640
How did you find this?

309
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
It's amazing.

310
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
I'm a doctor. A complete doctor. A doctor of CCTV.

311
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
I couldn't find this even if I hit it.

312
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
What about the second test result? Did you find anything?

313
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
I found a fingerprint. It's a fake fingerprint.

314
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Really? Where did you find it?

315
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,640
The victim's car. The driver's seat headrest.

316
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,640
I think I missed it in the first test. I couldn't analyze it right away, so I sent it to the evidence room.

317
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
Then I think it'll be over sooner than I thought.

318
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
What about at home? Did you find anything at home?

319
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Nothing came out at home.

320
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,640
If nothing came out at home, it doesn't matter if it's a resident card.

321
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
I found it.

322
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Then why did you take it?

323
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,640
I know. And why did you kill Han Ju-bi as soon as you got on the car and bring him to The One City?

324
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Maybe that'll make it a case.

325
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Here's the profile report.

326
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
It's only been a day, but it's already out.

327
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,640
He is a person with a high level of criminal knowledge and a very detailed plan.

328
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,640
He is a person with close self-control.

329
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
It is confirmed that it is similar to the murder of Yoon Dong-hoon 10 years ago.

330
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
It's a pre-announced serial murder.

331
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Yes.

332
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Does this make sense?

333
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I mean, a serial murder by chance.

334
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,640
And the evidence of crime is a puzzle.

335
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
They're not kidding.

336
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,640
But isn't this two puzzles real?

337
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Puzzle.

338
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Puzzle.

339
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Whether it's real or not, there was no puzzle at the scene of this case, and there's no evidence that it's related to this case.

340
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,640
I mean, why did you make this puzzle?

341
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,640
I don't know. I don't know exactly.

342
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,640
And if the puzzle didn't come to me, I wouldn't have known it was serial.

343
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:10,640
But if the ten crimes are the same, can we see it as the same criminal?

344
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
No.

345
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Sometimes the criminal has a unique characteristic, so it can be answered with only one decisive signature.

346
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,640
The murder of Yoon Dong-hoon 10 years ago.

347
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Both of these cases occurred in the victim's private space when the victim was alone.

348
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,640
The victim was selected in advance and was monitored and monitored for a long time to find a crime scene without CCTV.

349
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,640
The criminal, who finished the preparation, waited for the perfect opportunity with patience.

350
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,640
And he ended the murder in the shortest time with minimal attack.

351
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,640
It doesn't mean he killed for pleasure.

352
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Then the criminal had a deep resentment for the victim.

353
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Interestingly, this criminal ended the murder without showing his emotions as if he was a virgin.

354
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,640
These characteristics suggest the possibility of serial crime in these two cases.

355
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
The puzzle is a score.

356
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Do you think I'm making a mistake?

357
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Yoon Kyung-hee knows everything and respects analysis. But you should do it.

358
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,640
And above all, both puzzles are made of the same product with the same air.

359
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
What do you think, Kim Wan-seung?

360
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Do you think the same as the people here?

361
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Is it important to me? You're already sure.

362
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Did you come here to catch your uncle's criminal?

363
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,640
You don't believe this, do you?

364
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,640
You don't believe this, do you?

365
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm still not sure.

366
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,640
Did you come here to work?

367
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
If you want to go, can I just send you?

368
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,640
I didn't say I'd come first. Anyway, yes.

369
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,640
So you came to see your uncle and Lee Mi-yeon?

370
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Yes.

371
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I understand your feelings.

372
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Hey, man. This is not the United States.

373
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,640
Some crazy guy sends a puzzle and kills people.

374
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
That's a stone.

375
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,640
If you do that, everyone here hates you.

376
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Just send it to the profile.

377
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
If you know, just leave it.

378
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,640
Hey, Yoon In-ha.

379
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Everyone, erase the report from your head.

380
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Of course. I'll do as I always do.

381
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,640
When did we start investigating the profile?

382
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
Who was Lee Mi-young?

383
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Let's forget the perpetrator for a moment and look at the victim properly.

384
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,640
This is not a provocative crime or a crime.

385
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
There is a reason.

386
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
There is a reason.

387
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,640
As Yoon In-ha said, the motive and the desire for the culprit to risk his life.

388
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
That makes sense.

389
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,640
We need to know who Lee Mi-young is to get the answer.

390
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Sorry to keep you waiting. Is this your first time at our hospital?

391
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,640
I didn't make a reservation, but can I consult you?

392
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Yes, please write down the personal information and the question mark here.

393
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Yes.

394
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:07,640
I'm going to talk about the reactions.

395
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Where is your brother in the Philippines?

396
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
He's not back yet?

397
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
Did you get a call?

398
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,640
I called him on the phone, but I don't think he's been living with his family for a long time.

399
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
He didn't say he was coming in.

400
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
There must be a reason why he hung up on his father.

401
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Lee Mi-young's father hasn't called yet?

402
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Yes, his phone is off and he's not answering his home phone.

403
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I think you should go see him in person.

404
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
I'll go.

405
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
To Tongyeong?

406
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,640
Yes, please write down the address in the text. I'll be back.

407
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Our team's ace, Kim Ah-semi, is full of energy.

408
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
Good luck.

409
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Do I have to go with you?

410
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
It's an accident.

411
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,640
I'll drive. I can't even rest on the weekend.

412
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
You're a fool.

413
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
You're a fool.

414
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Why do you keep following me? Where did you go?

415
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
I'll help you.

416
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Where are you going?

417
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Aren't you going to see Lee Mi-young's father?

418
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
And you.

419
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,640
I told you to watch me and observe me. Why don't you do it?

420
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
You didn't even read my greeting card.

421
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
It's your specialty to help a difficult friend.

422
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Do you think I'm a curry friend?

423
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
Let's go. We don't have time.

424
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm going to the camping.

425
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
I want to go camping.

426
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I don't want to go because I'm not there.

427
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Someone doesn't want to go.

428
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,640
I'll go camping first.

429
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
I'll solve the case.

430
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,640
San-ha, wait.

431
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
Yes, sir.

432
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Just go camping.

433
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Take a rest.

434
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
I'm going to the camping.

435
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
I'll drive.

436
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
I'll drive.

437
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Hey, I told you about the case.

438
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
Why are you suddenly focusing on the victim?

439
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Do you know that Lee Mi-young's father's daughter was murdered?

440
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
You don't know.

441
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
You don't know.

442
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Why didn't Lee Mi-young contact her family?

443
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
I think she's been dating since middle school.

444
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
It's been a while since I left my house.

445
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
I'm sorry to ask you a question.

446
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
Yes.

447
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
Is this Lee Do-won's house?

448
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Yes, it is.

449
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
No matter how hard I press the bell, it doesn't work.

450
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm sorry.

451
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm sorry.

452
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
I'm sorry.

453
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
I'm sorry.

454
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
I'm sorry.

455
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
I'm sorry.

456
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
I'm sorry.

457
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm sorry.

458
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
I'm sorry.

459
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
I'm sorry.

460
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
I'm sorry.

461
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
No matter how hard I press the bell, it doesn't work.

462
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,640
There's no one in that house right now.

463
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
Did she move?

464
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Is there any way to contact her?

465
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Well, I know her phone number, but I don't think she'll answer my call.

466
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
She went to the nursing home a while ago.

467
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,640
I don't know if you can cook.

468
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Are you in a bad shape?

469
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
You didn't know.

470
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
It's Lee Do-won's dementia.

471
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,640
So he doesn't say a word for a day.

472
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
This way.

473
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
You go in first.

474
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm here.

475
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Oh, my God.

476
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
You're wearing a padded jacket again.

477
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,640
How are you today?

478
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Someone from Seoul came to see you.

479
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Hello, sir.

480
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,640
I'm here for your daughter, Lee Mi-young.

481
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Can I talk to you?

482
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Sir.

483
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,640
I think he drank too much today.

484
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Dad.

485
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,640
What are you doing?

486
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Dad, I'm here, Mi-young.

487
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Did you wait a long time?

488
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Hey, that's right.

489
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,640
Yeah.

490
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
Did you give this to me?

491
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
I read it every day.

492
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
I'm hungry.

493
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
I'm hungry. What do you want to eat?

494
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Black bean noodles.

495
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,640
You liked black bean noodles.

496
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,640
You still remember that I like black bean noodles.

497
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,640
Sir, can you go out and talk to me?

498
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,640
When did Lee Do-won come here?

499
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,640
It hasn't been long since he came here.

500
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,640
He came in about two months ago.

501
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Two months ago?

502
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Yeah.

503
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,640
I thought you came here alone.

504
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Did you bring your guardian with you?

505
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Wait a minute.

506
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,640
The person who came with me...

507
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,640
This person came to take care of you.

508
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,640
He said he was my cousin from the same neighborhood.

509
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
From the same neighborhood?

510
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Yes.

511
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Thank you.

512
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,640
I'm sorry I'm late.

513
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Have I ever talked about Yoon Dong-hoon?

514
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
Yoon Dong-hoon?

515
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
Do you remember?

516
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
No.

517
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
No.

518
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,640
You broke up with him, didn't you?

519
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
You didn't break up?

520
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
I broke up.

521
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,640
You remember everything.

522
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Do you remember his name?

523
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
No.

524
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Then what didn't you like the most?

525
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
His face.

526
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
His face?

527
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
He doesn't look good.

528
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
Every time I see him.

529
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,640
I saw that you didn't have any relatives.

530
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
Is there a special reason?

531
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Min-hee went out to her house when she was in the third grade.

532
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,640
After I got married, I couldn't sleep.

533
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,640
But I ran away.

534
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Didn't you ever visit your father after that?

535
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,640
I came to visit him once in seven years.

536
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
It was winter.

537
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,640
I bought an expensive padded jacket for my cousin.

538
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Why did you come all of a sudden?

539
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
I brought a man with me.

540
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
He said he was going to get married.

541
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
A man?

542
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Yes.

543
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,640
But he didn't like it.

544
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,640
He said it was a reward for Min-hee's catch.

545
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
Do you remember his name?

546
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
It's been a long time.

547
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
I don't know.

548
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Was his job a police officer?

549
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
No.

550
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,640
He said he was going to run a business.

551
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
Oh, right.

552
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,640
He said that Min-hee was too different.

553
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
He said he didn't like it.

554
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,640
What are you doing there?

555
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Oh my gosh.

556
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Let's find it together.

557
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,640
What?

558
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
The man that Lim Young-hee brought.

559
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
What's that?

560
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
It's a secret.

561
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
What's that?

562
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
It's a secret.

563
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
What's that?

564
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
It's a secret.

565
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,640
What's that?

566
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,640
It's a secret.

567
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,640
The man that Lim Young-hee brought.

568
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
How did you know?

569
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,640
If he brought it home, there would be a trace.

570
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,640
But that's almost 20 years ago.

571
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Is there any trace left?

572
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
He said he brought it just once.

573
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Just once?

574
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,640
But why did he say it's every time he sees it?

575
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Every time he sees it.

576
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Because it's a photo.

577
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
Isn't this a tattoo?

578
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,640
I think this is a tattoo made by the Yakuzas.

579
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
These days, even the average person does this kind of tattoo.

580
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Oh, really?

581
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,640
But I don't know his name, I don't know his picture.

582
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
How did you find this person?

583
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Just like that, I don't know if he's Japanese or Chinese.

584
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
I'm sure he's a Japanese.

585
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
I'm sure he's a Chinese.

586
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
I'm sure he's a Japanese.

587
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm sure he's a Japanese.

588
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
I'm sure he's a Japanese.

589
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
I'm sure he's a Japanese.

590
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
I'm sure I've seen someone.

591
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
Check the surroundings first.

592
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Yes, sir.

593
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Here, take a look.

594
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
What did you talk about with Lee Min-young's father?

595
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
Did you talk about that man?

596
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Does Lee Min-young's father remember today?

597
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,640
When will I know that my daughter is dead?

598
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
Does it hurt less now?

599
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Does it hurt less after time passes?

600
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
It'll hurt the same.

601
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,640
There's a physical time that you have to handle.

602
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
It doesn't matter now or later.

603
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,640
It's a good thing it's a dementia.

604
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Karenam.

605
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
Uncle died.

606
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,640
What do you think I spent time?

607
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,640
If you're sure you're not the culprit, I'll think about it.

608
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
If you're sure you're not the culprit, I'll think about it.

609
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,640
That's a relief.

610
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
You have a plan to think about it.

611
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,640
But why did Lee Min-young's father change so much?

612
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,640
That's not a matter of course.

613
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,640
You must have regained your mind.

614
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
No, it's not that.

615
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Lee Min-young's father said his daughter came back as a different person after seven years.

616
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
His cousin said the same thing.

617
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Lee Min-young came back as a completely different person.

618
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Why did he become a different person?

619
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
I'm sorry.

620
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,640
I ordered margarita.

621
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,640
I never thought that you would be a different person from what I know.

622
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,640
What kind of person was he?

623
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,640
When do we become different people?

624
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,640
It's not bad to be a different person.

625
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,640
I'm sorry.

626
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,640
I'm sorry.

627
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,640
It sounds like it's bad to be a different person, In-ha.

628
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,640
We all become different people.

629
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,640
Just like when In-ha was 19 and now she's different.

630
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,640
We go through some events and meet some people.

631
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,640
What's important is what we do as a different person.

632
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,640
If you want to know about an uncle that you don't know well,

633
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,640
wouldn't you be able to know if you follow his choice?

634
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,640
What?

635
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
Hello?

636
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,640
Hello, I'm Kim Han-seop from Hangang-seop. I'm sorry for calling you this early.

637
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,640
No, it's nothing. What's wrong?

638
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,640
I just sent you a picture. Have you seen that man?

639
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,640
Wait a minute. I'll take a look.

640
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,640
You've called a lot.

641
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,640
Yes, I'm sorry.

642
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,640
You can think that he's about 20 years older than the picture.

643
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,640
This person.

644
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,640
Have you seen him?

645
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,640
Yes.

646
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,640
I'm sure of it, Lee Seol-ah.

647
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,640
He came a month after he opened his business.

648
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,640
He said he knew her since he was young and that he was happy.

649
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
I ordered the most expensive whiskey here.

650
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,640
But a month ago, it's been a long time since I went.

651
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,640
It's probably the first time since then.

652
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,640
The person was 180 degrees different.

653
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,640
I asked my sister to lend me some money.

654
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,640
Didn't you open this store with the money I gave you?

655
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,640
The apartment was originally yours.

656
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,640
He was just talking nonsense.

657
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,640
I couldn't stand it, so I tried to report it.

658
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,640
My sister said it was done.

659
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,640
The more you touch it, the more you're a bastard.

660
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,640
Do you remember the name?

661
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,640
Yes.

662
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,640
When my sister didn't see it, she gave me a business card.

663
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
She told me to come over for dinner sometime.

664
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,640
Here.

665
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,640
I found it because she said she was coming.

666
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,640
Yes, sir.

667
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,640
The notice of surveillance came out.

668
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,640
75 years old, Kang Chi-mok.

669
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Seoul-si, Yongsan-gu, Hannam-dong, number 127.

670
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,640
We're on our way to the business area now, so go to Noh Kyung-hee and Ja-taek.

671
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,640
What's going on?

672
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,640
I'm a police officer.

673
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
Where did you find it?

674
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,640
Excuse me. I'll check it out.

675
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,640
Excuse me.

676
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
I'm a police officer. Please cooperate.

677
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
Is Kang Chi-mok here?

678
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,640
Oh, the boss?

679
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,640
You didn't come out today.

680
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,640
I'll check it out.

681
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,640
I'm sorry.

682
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
I'm sorry.

683
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,640
I'm sorry.

684
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,640
You didn't come out today.

685
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,640
I'll check it out.

686
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,640
You already noticed and ran away.

687
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,640
Look for it.

688
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,640
You can't open it here.

689
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640
What are you doing?

690
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,640
Yes, sir.

691
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,640
I didn't come home yesterday.

692
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,640
Yes, yes.

693
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
Yes, I see.

694
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,640
I'm in a hurry.

695
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,640
Can I use the bathroom?

696
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,640
Yes, sir.

697
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,640
I'm sorry.

698
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
I'm sorry.

699
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,640
I'm sorry.

700
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,640
The End
