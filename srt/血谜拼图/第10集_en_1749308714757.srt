2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,172
Mr. Quan Shangfan

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,007
Mr. Quan Shangfan!

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,432
What happened? Jin Hanquan

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,018
-Jin Hanquan
- Doctor, here.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,478
- Cardiac arrest
-Jin Hanquan

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,771
- Please move aside
- Cardiac arrest

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,731
- Perform CPR now
- Give me adrenaline

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,067
- Show me the time.
- This is for you

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,152
Take a look at the EKG

11
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:28,946
No change in heart rhythm

12
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:36,471
Blood Puzzle

13
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,349
In addition to medical staff
No one really entered the ward.

14
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,768
We still didn't get to see the criminal's true face this time.

15
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,731
We have exposed the puzzle
Someone will surely provide information or clues later.

16
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,274
Let's go to DBC first.

17
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,415
The courier was sent to me

18
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,667
We also investigated who the sender was, but...

19
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,961
This express delivery was registered online

20
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,797
Then this puzzle and cash
Was it placed in a designated location?

21
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:11,923
right

22
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,426
Thank you for your cooperation

23
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,303
Thanks

24
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,274
Did you know that the day after Do Yoon-soo was murdered
Where is Brother Zhenghu?

25
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,943
city of one

26
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,447
There is no trace of this in his communication records.

27
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,574
But in the base station's location tracking records

28
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,202
Zheng Huge's cell phone
Appear within a 200-meter radius of the One City

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,623
I called him and told him
Du Runxiu's cause of death was insulin overdose

30
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,541
The location where he answered the phone

31
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,877
In the City of One

32
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,381
Just after Du Runxiu's death

33
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,299
The day after he hid the handkerchief

34
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,842
That's right

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,428
Why would he go there?

36
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,309
Could it be the owner of the handkerchief?
Were you in the One City at that time?

37
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,816
The result was a long circle

38
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,235
We are back in the One City.

39
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,736
prisoner

40
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,449
I know Quan Shangfan likes hunting.

41
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,993
Even prepared a shotgun in advance

42
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,913
The killing mode is exactly the same as before

43
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,665
Why didn't the crime succeed?

44
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,251
The prisoner didn't even fire another shot.

45
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,715
The criminal has no reason at all
Leave the target alive and leave.

46
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,512
It seems that Liang Zhenghu is the variable

47
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,266
The prisoner never expected Liang Zhenghu to intervene

48
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,271
He's definitely not an accomplice.

49
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,565
Why?

50
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,984
Didn't the criminal kill both of them?

51
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,504
The prisoner did not want Liang Zhenghu to die

52
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,756
The prisoner intended to let him live.

53
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,637
It seems that the criminal was because of Liang Zhenghu

54
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,430
I didn't kill Quan Shangfan completely.

55
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,769
What is the relationship between the prisoner and Liang Zhenghu?

56
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,980
(Puzzle: DBC News Department)

57
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,732
Are the test results out yet?

58
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,068
The cause of death was poisoning caused by highly toxic substances

59
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,361
There should be someone

60
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,114
The infusion medicine was replaced with a highly toxic substance

61
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,537
The criminal must be disguised as a medical staff
Natural access to the injection room

62
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,872
Then the medicine was replaced

63
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,084
The criminals know how to kill people.

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,630
The prisoner is a person with medical knowledge

65
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,425
We first obtained the medical staff of Yangchuan University Hospital

66
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,177
- List and photos
-good

67
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,389
Someone must have seen someone who is not in the photo.

68
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,183
Then cross-check with the person on the surveillance camera

69
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,434
good

70
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,358
Is Dr. Huang here?

71
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,194
He just went out

72
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,865
Did Dr. Huang see patients two days ago?

73
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,033
Our hospital was closed until yesterday.

74
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,414
I don't know when he will come back.

75
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,040
He doesn't answer the phone.

76
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,042
I'll go in and wait for him first.

77
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,420
He did say he would be back soon.

78
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,751
"H"?

79
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,588
Is this the initials of Dr. Huang’s English surname?

80
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,400
Have medical knowledge

81
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,653
And the people around Yin Yiluo

82
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,906
And the City of One…

83
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,950
Except you, the people who came to Jeju Island to see me

84
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,577
There are four in total

86

93
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,567
Jigsaw puzzle on the news

94
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,111
Please say

95
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987
that…

96
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,041
Sir, do you have any information about puzzles?

97
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,794
May I ask what is your reason?

98
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,880
Do you think it was sent by a murderer?

99
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,465
Sir, I will come to your place now...

100
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,926
Hello?

101
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,313
What's wrong? Is there anything wrong?

102
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
This way!

103
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,585
This is where he made the call.

104
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,336
You know what to do, right?

105
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,547
Check the surrounding surveillance cameras first

106
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,049
- Go find it now
-good

107
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,925
- Let's go

00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,470
I'll start searching from here, you go over there

109
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,221
Let's start over there.

110
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,265
Hey, report to me immediately if you find anything.

111
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,476
-OK
- Search carefully

112
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,519
There must be surveillance cameras over there.

113
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,877
「H」

114
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,990
Hwang In-chan knows the criminal's information

115
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,203
Because he drew the picture on the puzzle

116
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,163
Do you mean he is a criminal?

117
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,458
He even called the investigation headquarters himself.

118
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,169
Asked if the murder case was really related to the puzzle

119
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,421
If he were a criminal, he wouldn't say that.

120
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,382
If Hwang In-chan

121
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,427
Is it painted for someone else?

122
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,971
"For others"?

123
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,850
We have always believed
The picture was drawn by the prisoner himself.

124
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,770
So I came to Hwang In Chan's house to check

125
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,606
Hey, how can you go to his house by yourself?
We should go together!

126
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,026
Not here anyway

127
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,861
This is not right

128
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,499
This place is the same as Team Leader Liang Zhenghu's home.

129
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,252
It's not the prisoner's residence.

130
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,102
I have been here since Lee Mi-young's murder

131
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,229

The one who told me what happened that night ten years ago

134
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,654
It's Hwang In Chan and Lee Seung Su

00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,952
I am Yin Yiluo, please take care of me

136
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,453
Nice to meet you

137
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,914
I often hear Dr. Huang mention you.

138
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,212
When I sink

139
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,257
The one who pulled me up

140
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,095
Dr. Huang and I happened to have a seminar in Jeju
So I came directly here

141
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,892
Before I came here, I listened to Dr. Huang.
Share a story about a patient's darkening

142
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,520
Have you decided to go dark?

143
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,355
And more than anyone

144
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,899
I still need people who know me.

145
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,445
What about the dream? Will you have that dream again?

146
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,196
Now I feel weird if I don't have that dream

147
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,533
I enter the password for the entrance door

Step on this puzzle piece

149
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,172
Suddenly the lights flickered and I walked in

150
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,966
Then I saw my uncle lying on the ground

151
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,302
I only dream about this place every time

152
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,851
Something must have happened in between.

153
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,396
You're not a criminal.
This is not the final answer you want.

154
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,107
Why did that happen that night?

155
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,735
And who killed your uncle is the answer you want

156
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,654
You should try to find the answer

157
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,655
That was more than ten years ago.

158
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,910
Shengshu asked me to draw a picture for her

159
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,039

Just a normal painting

161
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,338
But Shengshu

162
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,299
It's impossible to kill someone.

163
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,598
She couldn't possibly do that to Yi Luo.

164
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,529
What does this puzzle piece mean?

165
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,886
I don't quite understand the meaning of the painting.

166
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,971
She just told me to draw like this

167
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,809
Is it really Shengshu?

168
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,279

00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,895
Is it possible that Councillor Kim

184
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,440
The next piece of the puzzle?

185
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,942
(Personal data)

186
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,903
(Former Director of Hangang District Office)

187
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,698
(Former Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism)

188
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,284
You know, when I was doing criminal profiling on a criminal,

189
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,745
Is the residence what I imagined it would be like?

190
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,584
I imagine a room
A house as neat as a hotel

191
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,879
Nothing but built-in furniture

192
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,507
I imagine a place with only the bare necessities.

193
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,342
That's the exact opposite.

194
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,139
It means she has been hiding herself well.

195
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,062
We must find out Li Shengshu's true identity

196
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,400
That's how we can find out her whereabouts.
And who are the other victims?

197
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,904
I have to meet Hwang In Chan

198
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,034
How do you know the picture on the puzzle was drawn by me?

199
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,870
Each of your paintings has the same initials hidden in it.

200
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,414
Why are you helping her?

201
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,666
You live with her
Do you really know nothing?

202
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,628
I don't know anything

203
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,379
I really don't know anything

204
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,256
You should be able to see it too.

205
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,052
We even live in completely separate spaces.

206
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,513
And I...

207
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,432
Then why do you
Live and work with her?

208
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,810
Do you really like her?

209
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,853
Other reasons do not make sense.

210
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,863
From our first year of preparatory period

211
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,907
Until now

212
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,371
Shengshu has always been the only one
A friend who knows my secret

213
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,086
Since you have been doubting me
I'll tell you, I...

214
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,093
I…

215
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,476
I am different from ordinary men. I am a sexual minority.

216
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,730
right

217
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,736
My relationship with Shengshu is not what you think

218
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,282
In conclusion

219
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,660
Shengshu and I

220
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,997
Trained together in the same hospital

221
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,376
She took the initiative to invite me after the opening of the Unique City

222
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,670
She is the co-dean

223
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,800
Why did she open her business in this place?

224
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,678
I didn't ask her

225
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,891
I took it for granted that it was north of the Han River

226
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,434
The most expensive and best apartment

227
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,478
That's why she chose to open her business there.

228
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,397
Did you listen to Dr. Li Shengshu?

229
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,902
Have you mentioned Detective Liang Zhenghu?

230
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,987
Liang Zheng...

231
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,032
Liang Zhenghu...

232
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,159
I haven't heard her mention it.

233
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,287
but

234
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,791
When we were in medical school
The police came to see her several times.

235
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,795
That was the first time I saw someone come to see her

236
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,965
And because the other party is a policeman

237
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,968
So there were some rumors in the hospital.

238
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,430
For example, the other person is her ex-boyfriend

239
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,059
Otherwise, the patient will sue her.

240
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,436
Anyway, rumors are everywhere

241
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,731
Around that time

242
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,984
Shengshu took a year off from school

243
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,486
Take a leave of absence?

244
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,695
Why?

245
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,364
I don't know the reason

246
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,908
So is there anyone who might know the reason?

247
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,370
You are close to Dr. Li Shengshu

248
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,413
Or someone who knows her well?

249
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,212
Shengshu has no friends

250
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,342
The person closest to Shengshu

251
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,969
It's Yi Luo

252
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,563
Nannally Police?

253
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,400
There is a patient named Nanali

254
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,194
Is she a police officer?

255
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,737
Nannally Police?

256
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,367
She said she went to the same junior high school as Shengshu

257
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,662
She came to our hospital not long ago.

258
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,500
But she said it was a bit awkward to seek counseling from classmates

259
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,044
So I was the one who provided counseling for her.

260
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,929
I came to you to ask you something.
About Li Shengshu

261
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,764
Like what she was like before.

262
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,559
Or has it been involved in any incident?

263
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,568
Shengshu and I are not that familiar with each other.

264
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,072
We were in the same class when we were in the second grade of junior high school.

265
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,992
But because she doesn't talk much

266
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,952
Temperament and unique

267
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,662
So it's a little hard to get close to.

268
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,832
But I remember one thing

269
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,127
When teaching outside the school

270
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,422
Students who did not attend off-campus teaching

271
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,257
Stay in school to study

272
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,552
It was probably just me and Shengshu at that time.

273
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,971
Only two people stayed in school

274
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,931
That was our first chat.

275
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,269
I asked her if it was for studying.
I don't participate in off-campus teaching

276
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,483
She said she didn't want to go to the amusement park.

277
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,402
Amusement park?

278
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,570
right

279
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,782
She said she was lost at an amusement park when she was seven.

280
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,284
Because her mother abandoned her

281
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,244
She has been raised in a resettlement facility ever since.

282
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,167
I was actually a little surprised at the time

283
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,836
Because she could say those words without any hesitation

284
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,049
Then I told her

285
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,635
Maybe go to an amusement park

286
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,720
Some clues can be found

287
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,015
As a result, Shengshu stared at me

288
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,727
Asked me if I knew what she would do when she found her mother

289
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,690
What did she say she was going to do?

290
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,113
She said she was going to kill her mother.

291
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,532
And it was torn into pieces

292
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,499
She said Li Shengshu also became a lost child at the age of seven

293
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,043
She has lived in an orphanage since then.

294
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,295
So is it the same orphanage as Zhenghu?

295
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,006
Let's go check it out.

296
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,217
There must be some overlap between the two of them.

297
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,345
What is certain is that ten years ago when Li Shengshu was in medical school

298
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,472
Liang Zhenghu went to find her

299
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,225
And Li Shengshu should be
That's when I started planning the murder.

300
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,352
This is what the timeline looks like.

301
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,980
Zheng Huge said

302
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,190
"It's all because of me"

303
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,611
He said it was all because of him.

304
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,948
It's not the kid's fault.

305
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,369
(Searching for missing children)

306
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,579
So far

307
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,039
For the past 32 years, I have been alone

308
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,667
827 missing children found

309
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,669
Because the country doesn't care about this kind of thing

310
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,880
Only an old man like me can do it.

311
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,756
(Li Shengshu)

312
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,841
（Search results）

313
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,887
Between 1995 and 2000
Among the missing children

314
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,930
There is no girl named Li Shengshu

315
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,725
There is a boy

316
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,563
Could you please check Dreamland?

317
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,189
Wait a moment

318
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,984
(Dreamland)

319
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,654
At the same time in Dreamland

320
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:21,283
None of the missing children is named Li Shengshu

321
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,039
But there was a seven-year-old girl named Li Xue

322
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:28,749
(Li Xue, Dreamland)

323
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,459
(Assisting in finding children)

324
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,963
(Name: Li Xue, female, seven years old)

325
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,636
That might be her other name.

326
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,263
Amusement Park

327
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,350
The girl who disappeared in Dreamland

328
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,602
Seven years old

329
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,604
The incident happened more than 20 years ago

330
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,106
(Family member: Li Nanshu
No. 204, New Dong-A Market, Ruizhen Canteen)

331
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,191
New East Asia

332
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,027
"Ruizhen"

333
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,706
Was he cremated?

334
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,211
Still in the morgue

335
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,009
He must be cold.

336
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,346
Zheng Hu said that if he died

337
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,975
Help him after cremation
Scatter the ashes in a sunny place

338
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,852
He said he hated the cold.

339
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,814
He was in winter

340
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,483
He was kicked out of the house barefoot by his mother

341
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,403
He said it was really cold

342
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,698
I suddenly remembered what he said.

343
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,286
By the way, is there anything else you want to ask today?

344
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,338
May I ask if this child has also stayed in this orphanage?

345
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,133
Her name is Li Xue, or Li Shengshu

346
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,510
This

347
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,637
I don't think I've seen her

348
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,935
You said that Zheng Hu Ge has someone he really wants to find
He became a policeman because of this.

349
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,604
You said before that it was personal privacy and it was inconvenient to talk about it.

350
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,982
But you can talk now, right?

351
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,401
Is that person's name Li Shengshu?

352
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,863
That thing?

353
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,949
yes

354
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,660
There's no point in keeping it secret now.

355
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,873
I don't know the other person's name

356
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,043
But the person I'm looking for

357
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,836
It's where he used to work.

358
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,755
The daughter of the owner of Ruizhen Canteen

359
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,006
Ruizhen?

360
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,675

00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,183
It has now been transformed into a unique city.

363
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,062
Is there any way to contact that boss?

364
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,690
She died in an accident 20 years ago.

365
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,943
You may be young and not very clear

366
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,446
That was a major event at the time.

367
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,990
Zheng Hu almost died at that time

368
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:23,173
(The City of Oneness)

369
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,448
(The City of Oneness)

370
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:03,797
(The City of Oneness)

371
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:33,326
(20 years ago)

372

(New East Asia Market)

373
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,250
(Oppose to the death!)

374
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,974
Did you buy a lot of delicious food?
Do you want to eat with your grandma?

375
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,185
Could it be the lover, not the grandmother?

376
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,855
Do you want to eat?

377
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,317
Let's eat together. I haven't eaten a single meal today.

378
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,526
OK?

379
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,612
Don't be afraid

380
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,488
Why should I beat you?

381
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,615
Give it to me

382
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,534
I'll help you carry it, you give it to me

383
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,748
Hello

384
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,499
I have a question for you.

385
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,502
Those old people inside won't be alive for long.

386
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,171
But you're a young man.

387
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,506
What are the benefits of staying inside?

388
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,760
Go out and work and make money, brat.

389
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,016
I am working and making money

390
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,525
They promised to
The promised compensation plus 30%

391
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,319
This situation is unprecedented

392
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,488
Look

393
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,949
Relocation fee: 3 million won
Plus compensation of 15 million won

394
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,951
This is really a good condition, auntie

395
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,040
Then this is when I closed the shop

396
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,125
Specially reserved for you

397
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,211
How many times do I have to say it?

398
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,922
I don't need compensation.

399
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:13,009
As long as they let me continue
Just do business here until I find my daughter.

400
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,135
That's all

401
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,056
Aunt

402
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,351
If she was going to come back, she would have come back long ago.

403
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,062
Your daughter hasn't been back for ten years.

404
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,356
If you continue to do business here, will she come back?

405
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,440
Meiying

406
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,734
Maybe you haven't been selling clothes here for long.

407
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,987
So you can leave easily

408
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,114
But this is my home and this is where I make my living

409
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,409
I've been doing business here for 20 years, you know?

410
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,745
Where can I do business with that money?

411
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,290
Everyone says

412
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,750
As long as we stick together, they can't build

413
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,962
Oh, you really don't listen.

414
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,589
Do you believe that kind of thing?

415
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,051
The court has issued an enforcement order.

416
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,886
Sooner or later you will

417
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,680
Driven out of here

418
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,685
You now

419
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,063
Do you want to ask for the right of first refusal?

420

(Seojin Canteen)

421
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,866
A bunch of greedy guys

422
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,043
-Brother, are you full?
-Well, have you eaten?

423
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,297
What did she say?

424
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,758
The auntie in Ruizhen Canteen is impossible to communicate with

425
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,844
People from other shops seem to have united as well.

426
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,012
what to do?

427
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,723
These stinky beggars

428
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,225
How much more do they want?

429
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,269
Aren’t you the demolition king?

430
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,688
Can't we just use a bulldozer to flatten it?

431
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,483
There will be no problems in enforcing the law

432
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,193
Hello

433
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,279
It's not the 1980s anymore
That will cause trouble.

434
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,116
Damn it, it's all those bastards' fault

435
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,369
I lose so much money every day.

436
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,080
Are you crazy? Someone is watching

437
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,624
-Come here for a moment
- Ouch, go away.

438
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,170
Miyoung that woman looks
Have you completely changed your mind and become more capable?

439
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,172
right

440
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,091
Listen to everyone

441
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,677
She would get some more money.

442
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,804
Really

443
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,598
She seems to be everywhere

444
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,850
Convincing others to sign

445
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,103
Oh my god, that bad woman.

446
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,231
She doesn't even think about how good I am to her.

447
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,027
Zhenghu

448
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,614
It's time for you to leave and find a new job

449
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,659
I don't think I should keep you here any longer.

450
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,078
You have to protect yourself

451
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,666
How can I leave?

452
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,084
You bastard!

453
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:55,088
So how much more time do you need?

454
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,924
I'm sorry, bro. Please give me some more time.

455
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,843
Boy, you really opened my eyes.

456
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,553
Damn poor workmanship

457
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,972
Hello

458
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,767
Do you know how much interest I have to pay every day now?

459
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,106
You can't solve it this week.

460
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,067
Don't talk about the final payment and bonus.
You can't get a dime, so take care of yourself

461
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,277
Do you understand?

462
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,447
Why don't you reply? You bastard!

463
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,158
You fucking do things like this and you still want money?

464
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,576
Big Brother

465
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,704
How could you say that? It's so hurtful.

466
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,373
I really tried my best.

467
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,541
Brat

468
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,710
If it were me in the past

469
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:37,464
The people were driven out long ago and the building was demolished.

470
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,428
If you want to do this
I might as well do it myself!

471
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,221
Why outsource it to you?

472
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,932
That's it, bastard.

473
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,310
Big Brother…

474
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,734
hateful

475
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,962
I'll sort it out today.

476
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,049
You just need to prepare the final payment.

477
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,011
Also, please call the police.

478
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,806
Please pretend they don't know

479
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,625
Are you ready?

480
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,126
-alright!
-alright!

481
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,503
Come in

482
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,671
Smash it!

483
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,507
Walk!

484
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,179
Open the door and drag everyone out!

485
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,806
-yes!
-yes!

486
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,603
Don't come in, you bastards!

487
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,865
Hey, you bastards!

488
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,075
Are you still human?

489
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,204
- What's going on? There's a fire.
- There is fire

490
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,040
There's fire!

491
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,460
On Fire!

492
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,796
You bunch of bastards!

493
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,844
-Come in!
-Don't come over here!

494
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,597
How dare you break in?

495
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,434
Are you crazy?

496
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,311
Go up quickly, hurry up

497
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,522
-What are you standing there for? Come on up!
-yes

498
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,157
-Where else do you want to escape to?
- Please forgive me

499
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,702
-Brother, this is for you
-Give it to me

500
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,641
No, please forgive me.

501
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,685
-Is everything settled there? Let's go.
-Yes, everything is fine.

502
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,148
Why don't you get out now? Get out now!

503
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,408
Come out, I tell you to come out

504
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,911
You guys just need a beating to wake up.

505
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,621
bastard

506
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,043
What are you bastards doing?

507
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,253
stop!

00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,631

00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,307
I'll talk to you nicely, and you'll stamp it obediently.

513

Why the fuck don't you listen?

514
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,144
Are you still human?

515
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,438
You are worse than a beast!

516
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,824
You can't do anything

517
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,118
You can only use it by looking, do you understand?

518
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,244
-clear!
-clear!

519
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,541
-Help!
-Help

520
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,086
-Just leave when I tell you to. Why are you staying here?
-I'm leaving!

521
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,338
Get out now

522
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,548
go out

523
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,594
- I told you to get out
-No! I can't leave!

524
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,183
Go away, crazy woman.

525
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,728
I told you I can't leave, idiot

526
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,105
- Really
-You might as well kill me!

527
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,565
Are you crazy about wanting to die?

528
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,066
Let’s go!

529
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,359
-Go!
-Big brother!

530

Is this lady really crazy?

531
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,779
Come on, auntie, do you want to die?

532
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,831
Brother, we should go.

533
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,000
Why can't I get out? Damn it.

534
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:32,800
- Damn it, let go
-Let go, auntie, are you crazy?

535
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,971
Let me go

536
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,933
Brother, get up quickly
If we don't leave now we will really be burned to death!

537
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,351

00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,676
But the sooner it is resolved, the better.

543
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,761
(Yacht owner)

544
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,889
This fireworks display shouldn’t cause any problems afterwards, right?

545
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,642
We are following the script here.

546
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,061
Hangang Police Station and District Office

547
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,813
How much do you know?

548
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,190
There shouldn't be any big problem.

549
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,399
That's right.

550
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,444
They also hope

551
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,155
Things can be resolved soon

552
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,092
It's such a pity

553
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,470
I heard that there was a cafeteria auntie sleeping at that time.

554
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,639
No time to escape the fire

555
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,099
I also received the report

556
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,978
You don't have to worry too much

557
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,689
After all, there were a lot of petrol bombs at the scene.

558
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,358
There is always a risk of fire.

559
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:16,112
There is always a price to pay for creating a masterpiece.

560
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,658
Wait a minute, I'll call you back later

561
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,578
Hello, bro

562
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,037
Oh my god

563
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,248
Whose idea was this?

564
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,833
What a quick decision

565
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,795
Thanks to this, our Han River District
A new landmark is coming

566
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:39,552
When I become mayor and minister
I won't forget this

567
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,804
Although this is a good thing for me

568
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,806
But it should be better for you.

569
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,184
You're going to be rich.

570
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,020
Director Yin, congratulations

571
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,190
OK, thanks

572
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,526
Yes

573
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,487
Yes, of course we should use the power of prosecution to eliminate the case.

574
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,655
(Prosecution)

575
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,741
Oh, it's nothing.

576
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,201
(New East Asia Market Fire Death Case)

577
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,871
Want to eat?

578
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,831
OK, thank you

579
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,169
I eat everything

580
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,463
On the 7th of last month, at the New East Asia Market

581
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,757
The tenant surnamed Li who runs a canteen

582
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,383
Because they think the compensation is too low

583
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,928
And did not get the right of first refusal, and felt resentful about it

584
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:24,180
So they threw petrol bombs and set fire

585
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,433
The process leads to the implementation of demolition in accordance with the law

586
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,102
Injury of corporate employees

587
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,730
The entire market was reduced to ruins in an instant.

588
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,607
Because of one person's greed

589
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,359
Causing the entire city center to fall into turmoil

590
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,236
The vicious cycle is repeating itself

591
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,488
We also need to be more cautious about this tragedy, which is even more terrifying.

592
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,448
How long will we stand idly by?

593
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,617
"Death to the arsonist"

594
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,745
"But that responsibility"

595
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,538
"should"

596
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,000
"Who will carry it?"

597
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,014
Yi Luo

598
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,817
Can you turn around?
