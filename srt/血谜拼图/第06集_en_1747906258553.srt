1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Tree

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When did you go to the hospital?

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What's all this?

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Aren't you going to work?

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't remember last night.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As expected, three bottles of soju.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If three people are the culprit, who is the victim?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Who's the next culprit?

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to work.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is the base camp.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Here?

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is my house?

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, your house.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why do you need a base camp?

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Of course, you need space to make a public place.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Besides, the culprit is around us.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't stand out to others.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I like this place.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who are you trying to make public?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Make public.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How is it?

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Did you make it well?

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll have to have a cup of coffee first.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you want coffee?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I ordered coffee.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Americano with shot.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I bet you'll have a drink.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll have to proceed with the breakdown.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're so annoying.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll have something sweet.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This guy?

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,660
There's no information about Yoon Dong-hoon's name.

33
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,600
Kang Chi-mok, even if there is, driving, assault, that's all.

34
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,780
Do you really think these three people are the culprit?

35
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,460
Of course.

36
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,080
The three people wouldn't have entered the same puzzle by accident.

37
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,200
Did Uncle kill someone?

38
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,200
You don't have anything to say as a detective team at the time?

39
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,400
You know well that there was no other powerful actor besides you.

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
That's right.

41
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,880
Uncle and Im was out of touch.

42
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,400
But Kang Chi-mok came out of Im.

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,760
Then, is there anyone who could stand out from Kang Chi-mok?

44
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,320
What if the next victim comes out?

45
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,060
But I have a question.

46
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,640
When did you do the tattoo on your neck?

47
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,440
Oh, this?

48
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,720
I did this when I was investigating the coin case of the Han River gang three years ago.

49
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,680
I did it when I was investigating the organising as a team member.

50
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,980
I haven't erased it yet.

51
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,440
Oh, the tattoo is undercover.

52
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
It's a little cool.

53
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,840
But why did you erase it?

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
This is not supposed to be erased all at once, but it should be erased in several times.

55
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,680
Strangely, I can't erase it once and then I can't erase it.

56
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,680
I guess you're in love.

57
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,560
It's not that I couldn't erase it because it hurt.

58
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,760
Oh, well, there's that.

59
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
I thought I was going to die.

60
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,280
Do Yoon-soo.

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Do you know this person?

62
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,360
Do Yoon-soo?

63
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,360
He was on the phone with me just before Kang Chi-mok died.

64
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
We talked on the phone about three times.

65
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,400
We don't talk on the phone three times in a row for no reason.

66
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
There's something I want.

67
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,640
Have you ever met him?

68
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,080
No, I haven't met him.

69
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,280
He had a clear alibi and didn't have anything to be accused of.

70
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,140
If it's Do Yoon-soo.

71
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,720
Wait a minute.

72
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
Do Yoon-soo.

73
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
Do Yoon-soo.

74
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,240
It was a little dark.

75
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,040
I told you that we didn't know Kang Chi-mok, but it's been about a minute and 40 seconds since we called him three times when he died.

76
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,040
We weren't strangers.

77
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,720
But why do you think it's Do Yoon-soo?

78
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,800
No, I was just curious.

79
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,800
Anyway, you've never met him.

80
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,240
All right, I'll call you again.

81
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,840
Yoon-hee.

82
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,560
What can I do for you in Seoul, not in Gangwon-do?

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,760
You know Kang Chi-mok, right?

84
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,680
I don't remember.

85
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,120
Hey, you bastard.

86
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

87
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,160
Why do you keep calling me?

88
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But why did you call someone you don't know three times?

89
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,400
Do you really not know Kang Chi-mok?

90
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,280
What about Yoon Dong-hoon and Lee Mi-young?

91
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,360
How many times do I have to tell you that I don't know?

92
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,280
I already told the investigator last time, why should I make you say it twice?

93
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,040
Are you going to let me down?

94
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,840
I'm busy, so if you don't have anything else to say, go.

95
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,680
Everyone I told you about was killed by the same criminal.

96
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,120
The criminal is probably waiting somewhere to target the next target, right?

97
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,640
If the criminal kills Do Yoon-soo, why would that be?

98
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,600
Have you ever given someone a motive to kill?

99
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,200
What?

100
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,920
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

101
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,360
I'm so annoyed.

102
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,800
A taxi driver was caught killing a customer.

103
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,240
He hit the victim's head with a hammer in the trunk.

104
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,480
Do you know why he was killed?

105
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
In the water.

106
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,800
He spoke informally.

107
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,200
He sat down and spoke informally, and said he was busy throwing money.

108
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,160
At that moment, he caught the victim and killed him.

109
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,680
He turned the victim around and looked at his eyes and hit the center of his head.

110
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
I told him not to do that next time.

111
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:06,320
He told me to find another way to find out because the blood splattered on his clothes and traces remained.

112
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:16,680
In this case, he used a sharp needle to stab a piece of wood.

113
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,640
He came up from the first level and came right here.

114
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,520
I think he'd do this if he was the criminal I was looking for.

115
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,920
That's crazy.

116
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,880
I'm not gonna let him get away with it.

117
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,000
Hm.

118
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
I'll get it.

119
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Have you made a reservation?

120
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Yes?

121
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Thank you.

122
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Why did Chimok come all the way here?

123
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I guess everyone has a lot of questions.

124
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
What do you want to know?

125
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Have you ever heard of Do Yoon-soo?

126
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,320
He's the one who called me three times before he died.

127
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Do Yoon-soo?

128
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
What does he do?

129
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
He's the CEO of a construction company.

130
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
He's the CEO of a construction company.

131
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
What does he do?

132
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
He's the CEO of a construction company.

133
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
He's old?

134
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
He's almost 60 years old.

135
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Do you know?

136
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,320
He asked me to arrange a wedding for his late husband.

137
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
He said he was the CEO of a construction company.

138
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Of course, I refused.

139
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Wasn't it him?

140
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
That's right.

141
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,320
It's been over three years since we got married.

142
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
He asked me to say hello together.

143
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
He was gentle in his clothes, but he was actually very arrogant.

144
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
He was willing to kill his husband.

145
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,320
He asked someone to take care of him.

146
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
What the hell?

147
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
Did you hear how they met?

148
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
You worked together.

149
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
I didn't hear anything.

150
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
You didn't hear anything?

151
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
I didn't hear anything.

152
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,320
But I heard that they were having a good time together.

153
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
What if it was a good time?

154
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
I don't know.

155
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
You've never killed anyone, have you?

156
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Of course.

157
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,320
It's not easy to have such experiences, even if you're a police officer.

158
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
It's not fun.

159
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Detective.

160
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Next time, I'll send you to In-ha.

161
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Don't I look like a matilda?

162
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,320
You were so angry last time, but you're in a good mood today.

163
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I finally found a place to sleep.

164
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Here's a present.

165
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
You can kill it.

166
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Did you really sleep well?

167
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Yes.

168
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
I didn't wake up once, I didn't dream, and I slept for two hours.

169
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Where is it?

170
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
It's still a secret.

171
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
I'm sorry.

172
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,320
But don't you feel uncomfortable living with Mr. Hwang?

173
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Why do you think it's uncomfortable?

174
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
First of all, he's a man.

175
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I don't think it's going to be easy to stay with someone else.

176
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,320
I've never thought of Mr. Hwang as a man.

177
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
It's good in many ways.

178
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,320
The money is saved, and the price of a house in Seoul is too expensive.

179
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,320
And it's the same building, so it's not like we live together.

180
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Did you buy the painting?

181
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Do you think I bought it?

182
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Oh, is it what Mr. Hwang painted?

183
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Yes.

184
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
How is it?

185
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm a painter, too.

186
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
This is too much.

187
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
What's wrong?

188
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,320
But why do you live with this teacher?

189
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
By any chance?

190
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
This teacher?

191
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Yes.

192
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
You're here?

193
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Good. Let's take this together and go out.

194
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
What did you order so much?

195
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

196
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
What? Why did you take off the lid?

197
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,520
I took it off at the

198
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
I'm scared.

199
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Pretty, right?

200
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Did you spend a good time together?

201
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Yes.

202
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,900
But Kang Chumok and Do Yunsu have no relevant

203
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
No matter what the plan is, there is no relevant situation.

204
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,320
The owner of the restaurant and the owner of the construction company.

205
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Where did they meet?

206
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
The fact that they spent a good time together

207
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,320
It means that the financial benefits were great.

208
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Did you two work together?

209
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Do you want coffee? Shall we order delivery?

210
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Aren't you going home?

211
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Why do you go home after the base camp?

212
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Why is that my house?

213
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
I even bought a humidifier.

214
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
I can sleep here.

215
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
What?

216
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
What?

217
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Yesterday, you fell asleep on the table

218
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,320
I fell asleep on the sofa here.

219
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,320
But it's been two hours since I woke up.

220
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
I usually can't sleep like that. I wake up in five minutes.

221
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,320
But it's been almost ten years since I've never woken up like that.

222
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
I can't sleep in my house.

223
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Why do I feel sleepy here?

224
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
There is no 상은 in this house.

225
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
My house is full of wounds.

226
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Where the uncle was lying

227
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
The place where the blood was flowing next to it.

228
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
I can't sleep here.

229
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Then you can move.

230
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
I couldn't leave that house.

231
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,320
I had to remember.

232
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
In fact, this house owner was the one who pushed me to the culprit.

233
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,320
The counselor said that I could sleep when I felt safe.

234
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Do you think this is safe?

235
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Then pay the money.

236
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
You have to pay the rent.

237
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Then you pay the pizza.

238
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
I'm sorry.

239
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
What happened?

240
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Did you see the news?

241
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
No, why? Did something happen?

242
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Do Yun-soo was found dead.

243
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Come to the scene now.

244
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
The culprit is waiting for the police.

245
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
He was arrested until late.

246
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
He said he was going to go down now.

247
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
It's around 9 o'clock.

248
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
But he didn't come down.

249
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Well, it happens sometimes.

250
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I waited for him.

251
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
He didn't come down for an hour.

252
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
He came up because he was strange.

253
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
At first, I thought he was asleep.

254
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
I called the boss several times.

255
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
He wasn't there.

256
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
So I went closer.

257
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Did you report it right away?

258
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Of course. I reported it as soon as I saw it.

259
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
How are you recently?

260
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Did you have any symptoms of pain?

261
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Did you have any symptoms of any kind?

262
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Recently, the news about the Seoul market was also reported.

263
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
I think he was very upset because of the Resort death accident.

264
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
The company's stock price keeps falling.

265
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
But he was still healthy.

266
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Oh, my God.

267
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
I'm watching people who live in the news like this.

268
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Did the company's stock price fall and the market's economy is down?

269
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
I saw it and it was a low price.

270
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
There were a lot of politicians down there.

271
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
A noisy person died.

272
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
It's late.

273
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
How did you two come together?

274
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Did the team leader ask for your help?

275
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Why do you ask me?

276
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
I thought you'd need my help.

277
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
I met him this morning.

278
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Why? Why did you meet him?

279
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I'll look around.

280
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
You asked me about Do Yoon-soo this morning.

281
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,320
You said you had no words when you found Do Yoon-soo dead.

282
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Is it a problem with the content or the timing?

283
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Both.

284
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
The whole 30th floor of the TH Construction Cannon Tower is used.

285
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,320
But there is no CCTV record from 5 a.m. to now.

286
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
It's all deleted.

287
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
I'll check it right away.

288
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,320
If you pierced the 1st mirror, it would have been harder to find the shot gun because it was covered by the hair.

289
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
You pierced the 6th mirror as if you were worried.

290
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,320
As if you're asking me to find it quickly.

291
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Where were you hiding?

292
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Where did you go?

293
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
I don't know.

294
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
I don't know.

295
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
I don't know.

296
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
I don't know.

297
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
I don't know.

298
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Where? How did you get in?

299
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,400
The victim really came out of the

300
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
strong silence.

301
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,320
The CCTV record on the 30th floor is said to have been deleted before.

302
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Is Do Yoon-soo really the fourth victim?

303
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Yes.

304
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I'm sure it's the fourth victim.

305
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm sure it's the fourth victim.

306
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
I'm sure it's the fourth victim.

307
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Yes.

308
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,320
The fourth victim is the culprit.

309
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,320
The D.H. Construction CEO Do Yoon-soo was found dead in the company office last night.

310
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,320
CEO Do was investigated for the development of the Seoul City Complex Cultural Center.

311
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,320
It has been confirmed that he felt a lot of pressure about the recent recent death of Yangyang Resort.

312
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
This is a report by Choi Jin-hyuk.

313
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:05,320
At 10.30 p.m. yesterday, CEO Oh Yoon-soo was found dead in the D.H. Construction office on the 30th floor of the Seoul Hangang-gu Cannon Tower.

314
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,320
CEO Do was found dead in the office of the D.H. Construction.

315
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,320
CEO Do was found dead in the office of the D.H. Construction.

316
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Hello, manager.

317
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Why did you come out so early in the morning?

318
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
I guess it's a big deal.

319
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
I saw your car in the parking lot.

320
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Where are all the teammates?

321
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Park Pro, the autopsy results have not yet come out.

322
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I have nothing to tell you.

323
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Oh, my God. What's wrong with you again?

324
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,320
Is this related to the Seoul City Lobby case?

325
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Yangyang Resort death accident and so on.

326
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,320
I'll tell you again, but I have nothing to tell you yet.

327
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Manager, but the news didn't come out?

328
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Did you get the news?

329
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Here it is.

330
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,320
You didn't eat, did you? Let's go out and have breakfast together.

331
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Yoon-hee? Yoon-hee, are you here?

332
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Are you Yoon-hee?

333
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Yes.

334
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm Yoon-hee.

335
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Oh, you're really here.

336
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
The quick service article just came out.

337
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Here it is.

338
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
The autopsy results came out.

339
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
What's the cause?

340
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
It's a blood sugar shock caused by insulin excessive bleeding.

341
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,320
The blood insulin concentration was more than 2,000 picomers per liter.

342
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,320
This is 10 times more than the normal blood sugar patient's bleeding.

343
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Do Yoon-soo is the fourth puzzle.

344
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,320
Someone is trying to control blood sugar by using insulin.

345
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
I'm sorry.

346
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
I'm sorry.

347
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,320
It seems that someone has accidentally used insulin to control blood sugar.

348
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
I found a needle mark on the back of my neck.

349
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
I'll get the autopsy report.

350
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
Yes, sir.

351
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
Manager, I'll meet the adoptive family and inform you of the autopsy results and contact you again.

352
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Thank you.

353
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
But how did they know you were in the National Police Department?

354
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Hey, hey, hey, Yoon-hee.

355
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Yoon-hee.

356
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
What is he doing again?

357
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Please answer the phone.

358
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Gun, ear, horse, horse, and clown.

359
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
The clown is Do Yoon-soo.

360
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Three people, no, four people are the culprit.

361
00:29:49,320 --> 00:30:00,320
Dolls, cotton candy, children dancing, sand castle, big guy?

362
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
This looks like an amusement park.

363
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
Is this an actual amusement park?

364
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,320
Are all these people related to this place?

365
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,320
What are you doing? Why did you get out of the car without answering the phone?

366
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
I had somewhere to go.

367
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Where?

368
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
Are you worried about me?

369
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,320
You.

370
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,320
I'm the one who worries about all citizens.

371
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
And.

372
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,320
Hey, we don't know anything about the culprit, but the culprit knows about you.

373
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
I'm watching you. Don't you think you're in danger?

374
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
I could kill you.

375
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,320
No, if I were going to kill you, I would have killed you earlier.

376
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
There's a reason, so I saved myself.

377
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Why? Because of the puzzle?

378
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,320
Yeah, I want the culprit to find the meaning of hiding in the puzzle.

379
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
If I die, the puzzle will be completed.

380
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,320
So I'm safe until then.

381
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Don't be too confident.

382
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,320
There's no way to reach perfection, whether it's good or bad.

383
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Even serial killers can't make a common mistake.

384
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,320
That's the line from the tragedy of the red-haired family in Edenfield Port.

385
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Did you see that book?

386
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Masterpiece.

387
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Put it in.

388
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Yes, sir.

389
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Where?

390
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
You're here.

391
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
It's so frustrating.

392
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
The CCTV is all erased.

393
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,320
There's no evidence of the crime of DNA in the house, so.

394
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Did you check the CCTV at the cannon building?

395
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,320
San is watching it now, but there are so many other companies in the building.

396
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,320
And there are almost a few thousand people a day, so I don't think there will be any results.

397
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm sorry.

398
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm sorry.

399
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
I don't think there will be any results.

400
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,320
By the way, what are you doing with Yuna these days?

401
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,320
I'm just...

402
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
I'm just...

403
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
I'm just curious.

404
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Who does she sound like?

405
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,320
Didn't Yuna think she was the killer who killed Mr. Yoon Dong-hoon?

406
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
Why did you change your attitude all of a sudden?

407
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,320
Are you dating?

408
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
No.

409
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
No, it's not like that.

410
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,320
When I'm done, I'll tell you separately.

411
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Tell me if you need help.

412
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
I'll go with Yangyang tomorrow.

413
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
I called the Gangwon-do Police Department.

414
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Oh, are you going to look at the Resort suicide case?

415
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,320
It was written in the statement of Lieutenant Yoon In-ha, but there is someone who promised to meet before Do Yoon-soo died.

416
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,320
There must be a reason why it was drawn in the puzzle in the amusement park.

417
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
If it's an actual amusement park...

418
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Daegwan Namcha?

419
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Dreamland...

420
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
I'm sorry.

421
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Mr. Seo Dong-hoon.

422
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Yes, that's right.

423
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
The one I was supposed to meet.

424
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,320
I said I'd call you after I got the police investigation, but you didn't answer.

425
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
People are dying here.

426
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Who the hell are you?

427
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Who did I work for?

428
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
There must have been a lot of things piled up on Do Yoon-soo.

429
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,320
You must be mistaken, but I'm more at loss if you die.

430
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
What's the exact cause of the Resort suicide?

431
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,320
It was an accident while working on the concrete.

432
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,320
The concrete didn't dry quickly because the temperature was low, so I made a crack in the concrete to match the construction plan.

433
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Cracks are cheap, so it's all because of the heat.

434
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Then, among the construction site and the Resort officials, are there any people who want to kill Do Yoon-soo?

435
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
I don't know.

436
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,320
There are so many that it's hard to tell who they are.

437
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Oh, I'm not exactly a resort official, but I'm a teacher who runs a restaurant in Gangnam.

438
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
I know what it is.

439
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Are you talking about Kang Chi-mok?

440
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Yes, that's right.

441
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,320
I always thought that the relationship between him and the head of the board was a little strange.

442
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
What do you mean by that?

443
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,320
When the head of the board was a member of the team when he played the game, he called him sometimes.

444
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,320
He likes to play games and plays well.

445
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
He's a great player.

446
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,320
But when he drinks, he says,

447
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
I can't do this because I'm drunk.

448
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
I want you to do one more resort.

449
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Then he keeps talking.

450
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
He's a man who doesn't care about this business.

451
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,320
If he's the head of the board, he's not a man who just stays still.

452
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,320
He would have hit the ground or hit the bamboo.

453
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,320
I don't say anything about that.

454
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,320
He just held it in.

455
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,320
Where were you at 21 o'clock to 23 o'clock two days ago?

456
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Me?

457
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
I was at home.

458
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,320
My son, who studied abroad in the U.S., came to Korea and had a family dinner and stayed at home.

459
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
You should go and check it out.

460
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,320
Why did the culprit draw a puzzle here?

461
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
I don't know.

462
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
I don't know.

463
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Why did you draw a puzzle here?

464
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Are you going to ride it?

465
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,320
If you're going to ride it, turn the machine around and ride it when you're behind.

466
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,320
It's over here in English in two months.

467
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
How long has it been here?

468
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,320
It's been 33 years this year.

469
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,320
When I first started the business, it was very good.

470
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
I know you don't ride it, so I'm going.

471
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Have you ever had a big accident here for 33 years?

472
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Or a person died.

473
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
No, I haven't had such an accident.

474
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,320
I've been like this since I started the business.

475
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,320
There were so many people that I lost my child, but there was no such serious thing.

476
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Take a picture and upload it.

477
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,320
There are quite a few people who have memories here.

478
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
Yes.

479
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Do you really think it's related to the resort accident?

480
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Because of the timing.

481
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
I'm a little weird about that timing.

482
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
What do you mean?

483
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
In a week after the resort accident, Do Yoon-soo was found dead.

484
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
At first, we thought it was highly likely to be a soldier.

485
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,320
It was the day after Do Yoon-soo was investigated by the police.

486
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
I was very stressed about the reminiscence.

487
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
If the culprit wanted to hide the murder, it was possible enough.

488
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
It's a murder, but it can be manipulated as a soldier.

489
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,320
But it's a strange amount of insulin injection.

490
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Why?

491
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Because I didn't want to die in this noisy mess.

492
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,320
So I don't think this has anything to do with the resort accident.

493
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Then what does it have to do with?

494
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,320
I'll look into the relationship between Do Yoon-soo and Kang Chi-mok.

495
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
What is this?

496
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Where is this?

497
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Is this a real amusement park?

498
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
It's the same as the picture.

499
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Dreamland.

500
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,320
It was opened in 1990 and is scheduled to close this month.

501
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
When did you come here again?

502
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,320
There must be a reason why the real amusement park is the background of the puzzle.

503
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,320
There is no contact with Yoon Dong-hoon, Kang Chi-mok, and Do Yoon-soo yet.

504
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
There has never been an accident there.

505
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
But why is it there?

506
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,320
The sea is so beautiful.

507
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
Did you go to the beach?

508
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
It smells like the sea breeze.

509
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,320
I went to Yangyang to meet the staff of the resort.

510
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,320
But isn't there a possibility that the culprit made a mistake this time?

511
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,320
If you look at the situation, you know you met Do Yoon-soo and you rushed to move.

512
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,320
The culprit made a mistake because there was a variable in his plan.

513
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,320
He already committed a murder of three cases except Do Yoon-soo and did not leave any evidence.

514
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,320
A perfectionist who hid the real amusement park in the puzzle made a mistake?

515
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,320
I told you then, but there is no perfect person in the world.

516
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
It's the sense of a detective.

517
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,320
No, if you make a mistake, it will be part of the plan.

518
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Where are you going?

519
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Hey.

520
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Why are you following me?

521
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
I'm going for a walk.

522
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Do you have any contact with Dreamland and Do Yoon-soo?

523
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,320
Do Yoon-soo's company is a construction company.

524
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
What do you know?

525
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,320
Oh?

526
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Hey.

527
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Hey, say it quickly.

528
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
You've been out in the fire for five nights.

529
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Are you crazy?

530
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
Don't die!

531
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:56,320
visibility operation

532
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
It's fun, isn't it?

533
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
You're racing every night.

534
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
You have to speed up.

535
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,320
It's a police.

536
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,320
I'd like to ask for your cooperation.

537
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,320
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.

538
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,320
I'm sorry.

539
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,320
I'm sorry.

540
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,320
I'm sorry.

541
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,320
I'm sorry.

542
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,320
I'll send you a message.

543
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,320
I'll arrest you for the crime of cooperation.

544
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Let me go.

545
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Why?

546
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
I asked for it.

547
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
I'm curious about the shadow from me.

548
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,320
What do you mean?

549
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,320
You asked me to find out who was following you?

550
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,320
It's all over.

551
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Why are you here so early today?

552
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Sit down.

553
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,320
You said you arrived the first.

554
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Did you check the CCTV on the 30th floor of Cannon Tower for the first time?

555
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,320
Yes, but why?

556
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:10,320
I have to check it again, so let's go to the scene.

557
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,320
I have to go to the first floor and check the CCTV.

558
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,320
There are too many people, so there are more than 2,000 people.

559
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,320
Follow me.

560
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,320
I'm Han Sang-kyung Kim, a Han River police officer.

561
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,320
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

562
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,320
Is there anything strange in these pictures?

563
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Is there anything strange?

564
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,320
For example, do you have anything that's not yours?

565
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,320
Please take a closer look.

566
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
I don't know.

567
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
I think it's all yours.

568
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
What are you looking for?

569
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
I checked everything.

570
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Look.

571
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Why?

572
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
There's no handkerchief.

573
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Handkerchief? What handkerchief?

574
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,320
There's a handkerchief next to the acupressure slipper.

575
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,320
Do you have any evidence?

576
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,320
The boss doesn't use a handkerchief.

577
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Are you sure?

578
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Yes.

579
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
This is it.

580
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
This is the handkerchief.

581
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
This is it.

582
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
This is it.

583
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
Do this.

584
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
Think about it.

585
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,320
What's the difference between this picture and the first time you came?

586
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
I'm sure.

587
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
There's a name card and a note.

588
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,320
There's a completely old handkerchief next to the acupressure slipper.

589
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
It's really old.

590
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
I'm sure.

591
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,320
Who's the first one you came to?

592
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Noh Kyung-hee, Myung-hwa, Yang Team Leader, Kwan-soo Team.

593
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
Yoon In-ha came.

594
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,320
Take a look at the old handkerchief.

595
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:36,320
The old handkerchief is a little old.

596
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
I'm sure.

597
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Please write down the record.

598
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
All right.

599
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,320
I'll take a picture of it.

600
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
I'll check this side, too.

601
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:05,060
It was just here.

602
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,620
Are you sure?

603
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,620
It's important to answer correctly.

604
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,740
Yes, I'm sure.

605
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,560
I remember it clearly because it's a really raw handkerchief.

606
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,720
Why are you talking about this now?

607
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,060
Of course, I thought it was one of the victims' parts, and there was a team of department heads at the scene.

608
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:29,100
So I can't think of anything else because I'm 100% sure.

609
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,680
Anyway, I'm sorry.

610
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,300
It could be a mistake.

611
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,900
It could be intentional.

612
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,480
I'm sorry.

613
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,220
No.

614
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,400
But I'm glad I told you.

615
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,380
And San-ah, this is an accident, an accident, a big accident.

616
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,400
Promise me one thing instead.

617
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,860
Don't tell anyone about this.

618
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,760
Okay?

619
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,140
Why aren't you answering?

620
00:49:59,140 --> 00:49:59,800
Okay.

621
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,480
Okay.

622
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,320
Manager, I need some instructions.

623
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,440
I need some help.

624
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Is there any possibility that it's a victim's item?

625
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
No, there isn't.

626
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,400
I checked with the driver and his family,

627
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,400
but they said they didn't wear a handkerchief, hat, gloves, or a scarf.

628
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
There's no reason for San to lie.

629
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,400
Then, it means that someone took it from the scene.

630
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
Yes.

631
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,400
Captain, are you sure about this?

632
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,400
There's a criminal or accomplice in our Han River.

633
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,400
Okay. Let's keep San from entering and watch him.

634
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,400
Yes.

635
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Han River

636
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Why didn't he pick up the phone again?

637
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,400
Han River

638
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
Han River

639
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,400
Han River

640
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
You're good at getting involved in death.

641
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,400
You're not even close to my house, so you're going to enter a dead person's house?

642
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,400
But...

643
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,400
You're not even far from here and your house.

644
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
Why do you live alone?

645
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
Isn't it more strange to live with your mom at this age?

646
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,400
No.

647
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,400
I think I'd live with my mom in a better house.

648
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,400
I'm uncomfortable, and so is my mom.

649
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,400
When I was young, my father passed away, and I couldn't meet other men.

650
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,400
I don't even throw away my father's belongings.

651
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,400
Now we're comfortable alone.

652
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,400
It's much more serious than I thought.

653
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,400
You're a man who can't forget.

654
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,400
A man who can't erase.

655
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
It's...

656
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
Here.

657
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
What are you talking about?

658
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Lee Mi-young, Kang Chi-mok, and Do Yun-soo's common denominator.

659
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Lee Mi-young is the last owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

660
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Before that, Kang Chi-mok.

661
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,400
And before that.

662
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
The first owner of this house is...

663
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
Do Yun-soo.

664
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,400
Huh?

665
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,400
Do Yun-soo is the first owner of this house?

666
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,400
I'm sure these three people have something in common.

667
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:56,400
At that time, Kang Chi-mok said that Lee Mi-young was in a mess at the bar.

668
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Lee Mi-young's apartment was originally hers.

669
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Seoyang said the same thing.

670
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,400
Do you know how much the apartment I gave to Lee Mi-young is now?

671
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,400
If the three people shared a certain place,

672
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,400
and if it's this apartment.

673
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,400
So right here.

674
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,400
I contacted the registration number of The One City 5,802.

675
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,400
That's where Do Yun-soo, who died, came out.

676
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,400
What happened here?

677
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

678
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

679
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

680
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

681
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

682
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:08,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

683
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

684
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

685
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

686
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

687
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

688
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

689
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

690
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

691
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,400
The one who was the first owner of the last house in the The One City 5,800.

692
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Thank you for watching.
