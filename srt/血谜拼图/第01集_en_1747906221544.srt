1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:47,300
The

2
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,080
Let's go.

3
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,540
Go to the back door, you two.

4
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,220
Have you found him?

5
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,460
Here he is.

6
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,980
We only got one CCTV yet so they definitely exist.

7
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,260
source was just found so we haven't found him.

8
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,560
to crack down on the activity using CCTV.

9
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:22,920
Oops I didn't

10
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,600
It's been less than an hour.

11
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,760
Do you know this person?

12
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
The former president of the Korean history,

13
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,200
General Yoon Dong-won.

14
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
Your old secretary.

15
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,240
It's the first case of our youngest,

16
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,400
but it's not easy.

17
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,320
Some people study meat centre.

18
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,520
Sometimes it is more than in in-person chat room.

19
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,800
I taught him to be a picky eater.

20
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,420
And I much 영

21
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,060
I much

22
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,640
care.

23
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,960
I quite like that.

24
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,480
I eat meat.

25
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,560
I have so many odd activities.

26
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,320
I am curious what are lesions and herbivores.

27
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,200
This is the most relevant for talking.

28
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,440
Robin Stop,

29
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,560
Sorry

30
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,840
Sorry

31
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,840
What happened?

32
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm fine

33
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,560
I said it's okay

34
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,700
I'll thank you

35
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,920
Don't thank me

36
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,840
I don't want to be an ally

37
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,260
right now

38
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,880
I'm sorry

39
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,220
Sorry

40
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,760
I told you

41
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,660
Because I can mountain Louisiana

42
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,320
You're a mountain

43
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,460
Its kind of a place

44
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,540
maybe

45
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,340
Us all

46
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,800
could't keep our eyes on you

47
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I understand.

48
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Do you remember what time you arrived home?

49
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Did you see anything you didn't see before?

50
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Nothing?

51
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
I don't remember.

52
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I just remember a little bit.

53
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
If you remember anything, please tell me.

54
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Can I say it later?

55
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I don't remember.

56
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Ever since I came home.

57
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
You don't remember?

58
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
It happened a few hours ago.

59
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Yes.

60
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I don't remember.

61
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Okay, then.

62
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Let's talk about it before you come home.

63
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Do you remember coming home from school?

64
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Tell me until you remember.

65
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
What time did you leave school?

66
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
It was 8 o'clock.

67
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
What time did you leave school?

68
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I left school at 9 o'clock.

69
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
What happened after that?

70
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
I opened the door and went into the garden.

71
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
I pressed the door lock password.

72
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
I opened the door and went into the garden.

73
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I opened the door and went into the garden.

74
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I juts opened the door.

75
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,800
And from that, do you not remember?

76
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Then,

77
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
how did you remember again?

78
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Tell from that beginning.

79
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
The lady working at the house

80
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
called my name.

81
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I was standing in the living room.

82
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
And...

83
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I saw my uncle lying on the floor of the living room.

84
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
That's all.

85
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
The same handkerchief.

86
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
The same handkerchief.

87
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
6 months ago, Yun In-ha bought three handkerchiefs.

88
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
From arrival to the new place,

89
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
she was left alone for 13 minutes.

90
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
She had no trace of her relatives.

91
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
She had no body,

92
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
no chance of being exposed,

93
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
no motive,

94
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
and no conflict with the dorm.

95
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
So Yun In-ha is the suspect?

96
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Yes.

97
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
There's no evidence.

98
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Look.

99
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
The crime time is 10 minutes.

100
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Do you think it's possible?

101
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
It's not impossible.

102
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
From the bus stop,

103
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
it's not a suspect's way.

104
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
It's a shortcut.

105
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
It's a shortcut.

106
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
It's a shortcut.

107
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
21 minutes is enough.

108
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Okay.

109
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Then,

110
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
you try it.

111
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Okay.

112
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
The victim

113
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
never resisted.

114
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
It must have been very painful.

115
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
You said you arrived at 21 o'clock, right?

116
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Yes.

117
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
The victim, Yun Dong-hoon,

118
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
was stabbed

119
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
in the handkerchief and died.

120
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
And in the handkerchief,

121
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
you know that only Yun In-ha's fingerprints were found, right?

122
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Yes.

123
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
It's true that you were with your uncle

124
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
about the dorm.

125
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
That's right.

126
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Yes.

127
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
It's true that you had an affair

128
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
because of the property management problem.

129
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
That's not true.

130
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
That's not true.

131
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Did Yun In-ha kill you?

132
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
I'll ask you again.

133
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Did you kill him?

134
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
You were the only one who was there

135
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
during the time of the death.

136
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I don't remember.

137
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Really.

138
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
You're so convenient.

139
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Mister,

140
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I've finished my words.

141
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Can I go home now?

142
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Yes.

143
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Where did dad take all the clothes that fell from the floor?

188
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
There are lots of things that disappeared

189
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Okay

190
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Yes

191
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I picked it up in the living room that day.

192
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
The only evidence of the culprit.

193
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,140
Ham может d ah

194
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,860
Why is he moreıyla?

195
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,240
How many bungee jumps a day?

196
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Why are you so happy?

197
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Aren't you sick of it?

198
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,240
I feel like I'm going to die every time I jump off

199
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
I feel so good

200
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Go inside

201
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
I'm going to die every time I jump off

202
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm going to die every time I jump off

203
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Isn't it funny?

204
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,240
You killed your husband and marked everything with a box lid

205
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
It's because the field is too wide

206
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,240
And you can't plant sweet potatoes

207
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Which part is funny?

208
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Box lid or sweet potato?

209
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Isn't it funny to hear about me?

210
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Is it boring?

211
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Teacher, when I first saw you, you looked like a college student, but you're old now

212
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,240
I didn't know I wouldn't remember for so long

213
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Is your dream still on?

214
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
It's weird if it's not

215
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,240
I pressed the door password

216
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
I stepped on this puzzle

217
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,240
The light came on and uncle was lying there

218
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
That's it

219
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Something must have happened between them

220
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Maybe you don't remember because there's nothing

221
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Look, I'm old

222
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
I didn't say that before

223
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,240
No, I said I don't remember, so I made a strategy

224
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
You're just laughing

225
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
The defense is getting worse

226
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,240
You're talking as you think, and you're jumping off

227
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Why jump off?

228
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Come to think of it, I think it's part of the accident

229
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
You always do this

230
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,240
How's it going with people these days? Is it still difficult to deal with people?

231
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm fine

232
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,240
No, I'm not fine

233
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,240
I don't think about anything when I'm with people

234
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I don't listen to them

235
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,240
But when I come home, I think of everything

236
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Why did I do that? What if they don't like me?

237
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
That kind of thought

238
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Actually, I'm scared

239
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't want to go into that big house

240
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
It's a big deal

241
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Good bye

242
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Are you going to the exhibition next week?

243
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
Go

244
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Goodbye

245
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Let's go.

246
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Enjoy your meal.

247
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Do you want a meat pie?

248
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
You said it's hot.

249
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
There are so many customers since morning.

250
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Long time no see, Ms. Im Se-ryong.

251
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Do you know me?

252
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
You changed the North.

253
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,240
What made you come back to Korea for 10 years?

254
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
You are the boss, right?

255
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
I know you very well.

256
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Who told you to be here?

257
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
I'm police.

258
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
I'm police.

259
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm police.

260
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Police?

261
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Okay.

262
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Calm down.

263
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Since when did the police have a tattoo?

264
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Calm down.

265
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Calm down.

266
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Calm down.

267
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
You look like a police officer.

268
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm a police officer.

269
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
I didn't come for you.

270
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Calm down.

271
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Calm down.

272
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
What's that?

273
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
And thank you.

274
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Okay?

275
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Thank you.

276
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Ms. Im Se-ryong.

277
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you know what day it is today?

278
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
How can I know that?

279
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Today is the 10th day of the murder of the uncle of Mr. Yoon In-ha.

280
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
I'll ask you again.

281
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Why did you come back to Korea?

282
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
I left because I didn't like Korea.

283
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
I came back because I missed you.

284
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Did you answer me?

285
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Your husband is a Venezuelan nationality.

286
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:52,820
He has a drug

287
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Did you do anything strange?

288
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Did you say anything?

289
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I don't think it's that important.

290
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,240
When In-ha left the room that day, she told me.

291
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
You're my alibi.

292
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Do you know who it is?

293
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
I know very well.

294
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Oh, my God.

295
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
You've been out for a while.

296
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,240
What brings you here today?

297
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
You don't do much work, so I don't know if you forgot.

298
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Did you have kimchi stew again?

299
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
You should have some abchumas.

300
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Three cups of rice porridge.

301
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
I think it's okay up to that point.

302
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Wow, a detective who can't catch a criminal.

303
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
You've had lunch for the longest time.

304
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
I just met your roommate.

305
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
It's a great timing.

306
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Is it a coincidence?

307
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Is he in Korea now?

308
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
What did he say?

309
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Why are you curious?

310
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Didn't you contact him?

311
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Did you contact him?

312
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Go buy some clothes.

313
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Old and new.

314
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Dong-hoon.

315
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
If you hadn't seen him,

316
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,240
you wouldn't have been so desperate.

317
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Fuck.

318
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
If it weren't for that incident,

319
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
it wouldn't have ended so badly.

320
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
I'm sorry.

321
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I'm sorry.

322
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
I'm sorry.

323
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
I'm sorry.

324
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
I'm sorry.

325
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
I'm sorry.

326
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
I'm sorry.

327
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
It didn't end so well.

328
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
But you...

329
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,240
Why did you go to Hangang again?

330
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Are you loyal to your death?

331
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I mean...

332
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm not loyal to my death.

333
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
It's the end of my life.

334
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Do you know Kim Han-se,

335
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,240
the second team leader of the team leader?

336
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,240
He was the one who investigated with me.

337
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
He was the youngest.

338
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Kim Han-se?

339
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
That bastard.

340
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240
He may be a lunatic,

341
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
but he's not a crazy bastard.

342
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
He's a good guy.

343
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Does he still suspect that In-ha is the suspect?

344
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
That's true.

345
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
But everyone around In-ha

346
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,240
is dead.

347
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,240
His mom, dad, and uncle

348
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
are all dead.

349
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
It's not a common thing.

350
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm sorry.

351
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
I'm sorry.

352
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
I'm sorry.

353
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I'm sorry.

354
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
I'm sorry.

355
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
I'm sorry.

356
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
I'm sorry.

357
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm sorry.

358
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
I'm sorry.

359
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm sorry.

360
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
I'm sorry.

361
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I'm sorry.

362
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
I'm sorry.

363
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
I'm sorry.

364
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I'm sorry.

365
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
I'm sorry.

367
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,240
I'm sorry.

368
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,240
I'm sorry.

369
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm sorry.

372
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I'm sorry.

373
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm sorry.

375
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
I'm sorry.

377
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
I'm sorry.

378
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Sorry.

379
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
I'm sorry.

380
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
I'm sorry.

382
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
I'm sorry.

383
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
I'm sorry.

384
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Sorry.

385
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I'm sorry.

386
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Sorry.

387
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
I'm sorry.

388
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Thank you.

389
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Sorry.

390
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
That was the wiredle.

391
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
I guess your Natural Disadequate Test evidence

392
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
is in the old study bag.

393
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
He must have been in age

394
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
trying to make a cause to his death by jumping

395
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,200
over a death lottery.

396
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
I just got home.

397
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
What are you talking about?

398
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Did you forget again?

399
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I told you to come to the scene.

400
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Hurry up.

401
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Hi.

402
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
You're here.

403
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
You're here.

404
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Do you think I'm pretending to be crazy?

405
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
No.

406
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
I'm not.

407
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
That's good.

408
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
It's comforting.

409
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,200
But why haven't you caught the criminal yet?

410
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
The one who came out of the house was the parents and the family.

411
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
The parents were injured.

412
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
But there is no evidence to prove it.

413
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
The investigation team must be in a lot of pain.

414
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
I guess so.

415
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I've never been involved in any foreign affairs.

416
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,200
There's no one around me who has any motive.

417
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Even if you're a 10-year-old person,

418
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
you're still a family member.

419
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
But why did you kill my 10-year-old child?

420
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,200
And you were so angry that you stabbed him with a hammer

421
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,200
without covering his neck or back.

422
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,200
You washed the crime tool and put it in its place.

423
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Why did you suddenly calm down?

424
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Why did you become calm?

425
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Because I'm used to it here.

426
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
The mother is very neat.

427
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I don't think anyone in the house would like it.

428
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
The first place in the math competition.

429
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,200
The gold medal of English speaking competition.

430
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
The victim who died is a younger brother better than his brother.

431
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,200
His brother with a name tag on all the things.

432
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Judging by the size of the letters,

433
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,200
he seems to have a very low self-esteem.

434
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,200
He wanted to claim his possession of his things.

435
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
The first discovery.

436
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
The testimony of his brother.

437
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
He opened the front door, took off his shoes, and went to the police station.

438
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
He saw his brother stabbed.

439
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,200
He called his parents that his brother was stabbed.

440
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Then he called the police.

441
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,200
He was scared, so he went outside and waited for the police.

442
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,200
At first, he called the victim Junseo.

443
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Suddenly, he changed the name to his brother.

444
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
He said that the knife was sharp.

445
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,200
It's not common to change the name without a reason in one sentence.

446
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Why did you do that?

447
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Did he want to keep a distance from the victim unconsciously?

448
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Mom ran to Junseo's room with a face that looked like she saw a ghost.

449
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Dad's eyes were red.

450
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,200
It was that expression when he was at his grandfather's funeral.

451
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
The testimony of the case is brief.

452
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Mom and dad's reaction is detailed when writing the proportions and the description.

453
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Was the reaction of mom and dad more important than the brother who was killed?

454
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
His brother, who calls his room Junseo.

455
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,200
And the radical discrimination of his parents.

456
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
I vote for the brother who killed.

457
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I'll go first. See you in the office later.

458
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Who told you to do this?

459
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
What if you run away?

460
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Did I run away?

461
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
When did I run away?

462
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Who is that woman?

463
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Is she a police who killed a person?

464
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
If you killed a person, you can't be a police.

465
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,200
She is a criminal investigator from the Seoul Police Department.

466
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Her name is Yoon In-ha.

467
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Yoon In-ha is the nephew of the police officer who was killed?

468
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
How do you know that?

469
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I heard it when I was in police school.

470
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Why do you keep saying that I'm the youngest?

471
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I'm old.

472
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
You're the youngest.

473
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Who told you to come in?

474
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
You're getting old again.

475
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,200
The victim of the Sehwa-dong PC Bang case, Ahn Jae-man, repeated the testimony.

476
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
He was standing still in front of the prosecutor.

477
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,200
He changed the statement that the accomplice killed him.

478
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,200
What are you talking about?

479
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
What should we do now?

480
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
We can prove that there is no accomplice.

481
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
We won't make any decision in advance.

482
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Noh Kyung-hee, Ahn Young-ah,

483
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,200
we will take the case as a case of the accomplice.

484
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Kim Han-se and I will act as if there is no accomplice.

485
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Yes.

486
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
There is a strawberry cake in the refrigerator.

487
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,200
One Americano and one cappuccino on the table for coffee.

488
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Thank you for the coffee.

489
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,200
It's not police service, it's in-house service.

490
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Thank you for the coffee.

491
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,200
I think your memory is very large.

492
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
I'm not a police officer.

493
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm a police officer.

494
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm a police officer.

495
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
I'm a police officer.

496
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I think your memory is very large.

497
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
You know the taste of coffee,

498
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
and how many people work in this building.

499
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
You pressed the elevator button today.

500
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
So what?

501
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,200
I don't remember anything important.

502
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Okay, stop pressing the elevator button.

503
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Stop what?

504
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
People look at you strangely.

505
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
He's strange.

506
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,200
It's different to look at something strange.

507
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Why is your makeup different from before?

508
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Where have you been?

509
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
What do you mean? What's different?

510
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I have a cousin.

511
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Whose birthday is it?

512
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Is it that day today?

513
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,200
I don't know what day it is, but I'll answer it.

514
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
I got a call from the investigation team.

515
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
When can I receive the analysis report?

516
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
As you said, the victim's brother was injured.

517
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,200
But I suddenly don't remember.

518
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Like someone.

519
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
You suddenly don't remember?

520
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
I don't remember.

521
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
I suddenly don't remember?

522
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Then I'll go meet him.

523
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
I'll call you.

524
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Wallet.

525
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Car key.

526
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
What's wrong?

527
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
I don't know.

528
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
You look very happy.

529
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I saw you sitting in the car.

530
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I'm sorry.

531
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm sorry.

532
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
You're not supposed to be so happy.

533
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm sorry.

535
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
I'm sorry.

536
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I'm sorry.

537
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm sorry.

538
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I'm sorry.

539
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I'm sorry.

540
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
I'm sorry.

541
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Let's talk about it.

542
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
I'm going to talk to my uncle.

543
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I took a bus from the dormitory and came home.

544
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Junseo.

545
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
I was alone at home.

546
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I came home right after school.

547
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I pressed the door password.

548
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,200
20131025 shop.

549
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
I pressed the door password.

550
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
4116.

551
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
5377 shop.

552
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,200
I took off my shoes and went into the living room.

553
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I took off my shoes and went to my brother's room.

554
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
The living room was dark.

555
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
I felt warm water on my feet.

556
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,200
I opened the door.

557
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Blood is boiling.

558
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,200
It happened a few days ago.

559
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,200
You're using the current time and the past tense together.

560
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Time?

561
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,200
What happened in a day is like what happened in the past.

562
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,200
It's like what happened now.

563
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
That's what I'm thinking about.

564
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
I'm thinking about it.

565
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,200
There are two cases where you change what happened in the past into the present.

566
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,200
One, it didn't actually happen.

567
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Two, you decorate what you don't remember and talk about it.

568
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,200
It's a story that's being made in the student's head right now.

569
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,200
I'm lying right now.

570
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I pressed the door password.

571
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
20131025 shop.

572
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,200
I pressed the door password.

573
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,200
No, I pressed it.

574
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
4116.

575
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
5377 shop.

576
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,200
I opened the door, took off my shoes, and went into the living room.

577
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,200
I took off my shoes and opened my brother's room.

578
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,200
The living room was dark and I felt warm water on my feet.

579
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
The room...

580
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
No, the kitchen...

581
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Why did you go to the kitchen?

582
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Where did you throw the blood-stained clothes?

583
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,200
I know where you are.

584
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Is your brother Junseo really dead?

585
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
No.

586
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,200
I'm back.

587
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm back.

588
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
What did you say to make him confess?

589
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Nothing much.

590
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
We just talked.

591
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
We both sympathized with each other.

592
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
He said that to himself again.

593
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Stop it.

594
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Why do you want me to stop?

595
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
That's my money.

596
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
I know.

597
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Didn't you accept it because of that?

598
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
No?

599
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Did I accept it because I'm the daughter of the hospital?

600
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Hey, what does it have to do with me being the hospital?

601
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm not even doing it now.

602
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I'll go in first.

603
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,200
I've posted the report.

604
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Do whatever you want.

605
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Hey, stop.

606
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,200
I drank some whiskey at the restaurant earlier.

607
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
I'm not feeling well.

608
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,200
Captain Taedongsu, you went to the restaurant again.

609
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,200
You're telling me to drink and die

610
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
because you're not feeling well?

611
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
A criminal who hasn't caught a criminal for 10 years

612
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
should know how to drink and drink.

613
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Is that how it works?

614
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Then let's drink and die.

615
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Brother, I'm sorry.

616
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
I'm sorry.

617
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Time flies.

618
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
It's already been 10 years.

619
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,200
This neighborhood has changed a lot.

620
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,200
The restaurant is only here now.

621
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Do you come to Inasua often these days?

622
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I went back and forth today.

623
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
You can't accept everything.

624
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Why?

625
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,200
You're the one who's coming to me.

626
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,200
I'm filming a rap video.

627
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,200
I still think Inasua is a powerful hero.

628
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,200
I haven't changed my mind in 10 years.

629
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,200
I'll accept it someday.

630
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,200
A man who has so much property

631
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,200
has become a police officer and a profiler.

632
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
It's a little strange.

633
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,200
That's how we know what we're looking for.

634
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,200
That's why I follow you.

635
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,200
It's still early in the evening. Let's have another drink.

636
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
What's the rush?

637
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,200
I'm sorry. I have to go somewhere.

638
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Where are you going?

639
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,200
You have to drink with me.

640
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
I have a lot of things to do.

641
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
I'm sorry.

642
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
The boss is taking care of me.

643
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
I have to go somewhere.

644
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Batman is busy.

645
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,200
I have to go to the orphanage.

646
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Wait a minute.

647
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Where are you going?

648
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,200
I'll go.

649
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
What's this?

650
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,200
This is an emergency gift.

651
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Emergency gift?

652
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,200
It's not a kid.

653
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,200
It's not fun without alcohol.

654
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Did you call the manager?

655
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
Be careful.

656
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
I'll go first.

657
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
I'll go first.

658
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
20 hours and 0 minutes.

659
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Unannounced exit.

660
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,200
5 minutes from the school gate to the bus stop.

661
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,200
20 hours and 0 minutes.

662
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,200
One hour before the death of Yoon Dong-hoon.

663
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,200
After arriving at the bus stop, the bus arrived at 147.

664
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,200
147 bus stop in 3 minutes.

665
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,200
One person is on the bus.

666
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,200
There are five stops in front of the school.

667
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,200
There is no stop in between.

668
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,200
32 minutes to the bus stop in front of the school.

669
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,200
There is no one on the bus.

670
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,200
20 hours and 40 minutes.

671
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,200
20 minutes before the death of Yoon Dong-hoon.

672
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,200
20 minutes from the bus stop to the school.

673
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,200
12 minutes from the bus stop in 8 minutes.

674
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,200
It's a well-calculated time.

675
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,200
20 minutes from the bus stop to the school.

676
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,200
12 minutes from the bus stop in 8 minutes.

677
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,200
It's a well-calculated time.

678
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,200
12 minutes from the bus stop to the school.

679
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,200
It's a well-calculated time.

680
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,200
There is no CCTV or witness.

681
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,200
The bus stop is in front of the school.

682
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Excuse me.

683
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,200
Do you happen to live here?

684
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,360
Officer Kim?

685
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,600
What are you doing here?

686
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,640
I need to check something.

687
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,120
What's up, Officer Nam?

688
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,800
We just got a report.

689
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,880
A suspicious person is here.

690
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,080
Did you see anything strange?

691
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,720
No, I didn't see anything.

692
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,680
It's so quiet here.

693
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
It's because of the hat.

694
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,720
I didn't recognize him at first.

695
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,520
He looks like a different person.

696
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,920
I have a report.

697
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,480
Someone is looking at us in a strange way.

698
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,120
Are you talking about me?

699
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,480
It's so boring.

700
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,240
No matter how much I look at it,

701
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,840
it's still the same as the case that happened 10 years ago.

702
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,280
I don't think he's a human being.

703
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,320
He's not just a moving person.

704
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,080
He's very meticulous.

705
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,280
He's too much.

706
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,280
He's been in the police force for 10 years

707
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,520
and hasn't been promoted yet.

708
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,880
What kind of boss would like a security guard like him?

709
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,520
I'll go in first.

710
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,240
Okay.

711
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,120
Call me if you need anything.

712
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,680
Okay.

713
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,720
Be careful.

714
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,040
Okay, good luck.

715
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,040
I'm going to the convenience store.

716
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,440
I want a coke, too.

717
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,880
Why do you drink so much coke?

718
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,240
It's not good for your health.

719
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,480
Maybe it's because I quit smoking.

720
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,040
I'm so bored.

721
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,680
Then I'll buy you zero coke.

722
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,520
Okay?

723
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,280
You can't just order a cigarette.

724
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,480
Good luck.

725
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,480
I told you to go before you came.

726
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,880
Is this Yun In-ha's house?

727
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,480
Yes, it is.

728
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,280
I'm Yun In-ha.

729
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,280
Who sent this?

730
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,480
I don't know.

731
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,880
Yun In-ha

732
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,280
Yun In-ha

733
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,480
Yun In-ha

734
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,280
The number you have dialed is busy.

735
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,480
Yun In-ha

736
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,480
Yun In-ha

737
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,480
Yun In-ha
