1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
It's already the same year. Is Mr. Han here?

4
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,900
I'm Yoon In-ha.

5
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,100
Oh, yes.

6
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,800
But Mr. Han doesn't live here.

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,500
I know. But isn't it a week from now that he comes here?

8
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,000
He's not coming today. What should we do?

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh, he's not here.

10
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I couldn't reach him, so I called him.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,300
Good night.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's going on?

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What's going on?

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What's going on?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's going on?

16
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think it's over there.

17
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, sir. We're going into the house together.

18
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes, A-Dong underground parking lot.

19
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think it'll be off in five minutes.

20
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Aren't you wearing gloves?

21
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes, I'll do it later.

22
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This victim is the resident, right?

23
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, that's the security guard.

24
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's A-Dong 5802.

25
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You took care of it neatly.

26
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not a robber because you put your bag in it.

27
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not a robber.

28
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm not a robber.

29
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not a robber because you put your bag in it.

30
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Do you know anyone?

31
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No.

32
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So who reported this?

33
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Who was the first to find out?

34
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
A puzzle that came back after 10 years.

35
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And the murder that happened on the same day.

36
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This puzzle is definitely drawn by the same person as the puzzle found when my uncle died.

37
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't want to get involved in this kind of place.

38
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Anyway, I got a quick message and signed up for a gift at 10 32 at night.

39
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There's something in the bathroom's secret storage.

40
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Ah, the men's bathroom.

41
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There's no CCTV.

42
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Of course, I picked it up from nowhere.

43
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Of course, there's no fingerprint.

44
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I sent a message with a phone that I can't track.

45
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Who the hell sent it to me after 10 years?

46
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Did you come here as if you were dying?

47
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why didn't you answer the phone?

48
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why you again?

49
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why did you have to be there at that time, 10 years ago and today?

50
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I went to see you today.

51
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Am I your alibi this time?

52
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's Friday today, but I didn't go to your parents' house.

53
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why are you coming to see me?

54
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I had something to say.

55
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What do you want to say?

56
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Did the same person draw it?

58
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What is this? Where did you get this?

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I found it on the day my uncle died.

60
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Look.

61
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's a serial murder.

62
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It started again after 10 years.

63
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
On what grounds?

64
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, we'll find out from now on.

65
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I wrote the truth here, so please refer to it.

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Didn't you call me after you killed him?

67
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You made that puzzle, too.

68
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why should I?

69
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Or is this all a coincidence?

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Think whatever you want.

71
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You came here because it wasn't 12 o'clock, right?

72
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It must have been a little late.

73
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You and your phone didn't work.

74
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

75
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's late, so go to bed.

76
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Who is that guy?

77
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He's a colleague at work.

78
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How urgent would it have been to come here at such a late hour?

79
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't worry.

80
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He doesn't have to worry.

81
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

82
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll sleep if you come.

83
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes.

84
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll go next week.

85
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay.

86
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes.

87
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I drove here by car, but I forgot which floor I parked on.

88
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So I looked around the basement parking lot and found the car.

89
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think this makes sense.

90
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, I sometimes forget which floor I parked on when I go to the mart.

91
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Anyway, the alibi is certain.

92
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then the alibi is...

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's check if it's certain.

94
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sir, do you have breakfast?

95
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't have any thoughts.

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes.

97
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll go to the convenience store later.

98
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.

99
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I was alive until now.

100
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The time of death is between 10 minutes and 20 minutes.

101
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Can you show me all the way to the third floor?

102
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes.

103
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why don't you park here?

104
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's almost a square.

105
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's a square.

106
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was going to install it because of the residents' protests.

107
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
San, I need to check the black box of the car parked on the second floor.

108
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What is this?

109
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Korea is a public country of CCTV.

110
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's a job for a detective to check CCTV.

111
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I know that, but isn't this a black box?

112
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's been a month since you joined the power team.

113
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Check all the floors, whether it's CCTV or a black box.

114
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And when you work with me, eat first.

115
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why don't you answer?

116
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's why you always listen to the sound of the MG.

117
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay.

118
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Shall we do it together?

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll check one more thing.

120
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Show me the common front door from 22 o'clock 10 minutes to 23 o'clock 30 minutes.

121
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay.

122
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Please turn it over quickly.

123
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

124
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There.

125
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Here.

126
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is the person.

127
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm going to check the black box.

128
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
When do I ever live in a house like this?

129
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm going to check the black box.

130
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm going to check the black box.

131
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm going to check the black box.

132
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm going to check the black box.

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm going to check the black box.

134
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm going to check the black box.

135
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm going to check the black box.

136
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm going to check the black box.

137
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm going to check the black box.

138
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm going to check the black box.

139
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm going to check the black box.

140
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm going to check the black box.

141
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm going to check the black box.

142
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm going to check the black box.

143
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm going to check the black box.

144
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm going to check the black box.

145
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm going to check the black box.

146
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm going to check the black box.

147
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going to check the black box.

148
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm going to check the black box.

149
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sure there's no one who's used to it.

150
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,060
Doesn't the house seem to everyÃ© discrimination towards you?

151
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,060
I'm not home, so I'll check.

152
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,420
What the...

153
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,020
What an attempt at last minute action.

154
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,000
There was nothing wrong with the Sh weakline garage's CCTV.

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't think I've ever seen it.

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I think I knew where the square was.

157
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can't see it.

158
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm also a black horse, but I don't cooperate with the people of the house.

159
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Would you help me?

160
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They're all people who are going to fart.

161
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey, the people who live here are the top of the average income in Korea.

162
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There's a pet kindergarten in the shopping street.

163
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I sell dog ice cream, and it's 20,000 won a year.

164
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What kind of dog ice cream is 20,000 won?

165
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Isn't it a dog pie?

166
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:39,640
The first team checks the

167
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,840
listed products..

168
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,440
2.3-3.5 minutes.

169
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Can I get the call first?

170
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
This is 112.

171
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
This is Do-won from Hangang-ro.

172
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
I need to make a call.

173
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Yes, please.

174
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
A woman is dead.

175
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Where?

176
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
She's not a soldier, she's a murderer.

177
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
She's on the second floor of the A-Dom underground parking lot.

178
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
A woman is dead.

179
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Where?

180
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
She's not a soldier, she's a murderer.

181
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
A woman is dead.

182
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Where?

183
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
She's not a soldier, she's a murderer.

184
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
She's on the second floor of the A-Dom underground parking lot.

185
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
You're always on the emergency.

186
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
You're always late.

187
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
You didn't get anything.

188
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
I knew it.

189
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,440
I worked so hard, there's no way I got anything.

190
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
What's the matter?

191
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,440
It looks normal, but it's not.

192
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Thanks. I'll have a latte.

193
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Lee Seung-joo is here.

194
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Hello.

195
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm Kim Han-seung from Hangang-ro.

196
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Do you remember me?

197
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
I've seen Yoon In-ha's problem before.

198
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Of course, you don't remember it.

199
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm Kim Han-seung from Hangang-ro.

200
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Do you remember me?

201
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I've seen Yoon In-ha's problem before.

202
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Of course, you don't remember it.

203
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Have you ever shown or mentioned this puzzle?

204
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
I wonder if you know anything about it.

205
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,440
I repeat myself, but I can't tell you about the personal information that the patient does not agree with.

206
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,440
You mean it's related to the patient and the puzzle.

207
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
What did you say?

208
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
It's hard to answer.

209
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
What if the patient killed a person?

210
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,440
I don't answer about the family.

211
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
You're still the same.

212
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
You too.

213
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Did you go to the whiskey bar?

214
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm still open.

215
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I was just picking up the suspect's whereabouts.

216
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Who is the suspect?

217
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Yoon In-ha?

218
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
How?

219
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,440
He could be the first witness to a murder case.

220
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
This can't be a coincidence.

221
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Why would a profiler know the victim?

222
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
We need to know the criminal's heart.

223
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
I'm going to pick up the victim's whereabouts.

224
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Pick up the victim's whereabouts on the day of the murder.

225
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,440
If the suspect is the suspect, there will be a connection with the victim's whereabouts.

226
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
I'll look for it.

227
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Hi.

228
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Why did you go to the hospital again?

229
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
How did you know I was there?

230
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
I knew it from the past.

231
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Just ask me.

232
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Should I?

233
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Why did you kill someone and press the bell?

234
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Because I can't get caught.

235
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Are you confessing now?

236
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
There was nothing on the scene.

237
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
There wasn't.

238
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,440
The time of death is 22 to 32 minutes ago.

239
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Why should I tell you that?

240
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
That's right.

241
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,440
I killed someone and sent a puzzle.

242
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
That's what I'm talking about again.

243
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
It's a serial murder.

244
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,440
It's very intellectual and planned, and the emotions are controlled.

245
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
There was a woman in the puzzle.

246
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
The victim of this case is also a woman.

247
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
It's not a coincidence.

248
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
You don't believe in coincidence.

249
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Besides, the attitude of the criminal on the scene is the same.

250
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,440
He didn't do anything unnecessary other than murder.

251
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,440
So you're saying that some crazy guy killed someone and sent you a puzzle?

252
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Why did you send me a puzzle?

253
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
What does the picture mean?

254
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
What's the motive?

255
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Who is the criminal?

256
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Are you writing a fiction?

257
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
I'm sorry.

258
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Hello.

259
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,440
I'm Kim Han-sem-kyung from the team of Kang Yeo-gi of Hangangseo.

260
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,440
I have a bartender certification test this morning.

261
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I left a little early.

262
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Boss.

263
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,440
The boss said he had something to do and he was leaving first.

264
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
What time did you leave?

265
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
9 o'clock.

266
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Lee Mi-young.

267
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Did you hear anyone say that she was meeting someone or that she had an appointment?

268
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Yes.

269
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
There's no CCTV here, right?

270
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,440
The boss said it wasn't because it was a private space.

271
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,440
How many customers were there at the bar when you got off work?

272
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,440
There were about four of them, and the boss talked to one of them.

273
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Of course it was a man.

274
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Yes.

275
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Do you know who he is?

276
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
No, I don't know his name.

277
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
But Jeong-eun will know.

278
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,440
But the manager must have been sleeping in the morning.

279
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Can you give me the manager's number?

280
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Yes.

281
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,440
And did this person come here by any chance?

282
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
I've never seen him.

283
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Really?

284
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,440
And if you think of anything, please contact me.

285
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Thank you.

286
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Mercedes.

287
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,800
Sorry.

288
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,080
21 was a phone call at the same time broke at 21 4.

289
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,080
And as he was found dead, the movement ended.

290
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,580
Hello, this is Hyunwoo.

291
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
Hello.

292
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,580
Tell me, hello.

293
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,580
I'll see you if you don't tell me.

294
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Lee Mi-young is dead?

295
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Are you talking about the Griffin?

296
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Yes.

297
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
It's a regular bar.

298
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,080
I've been there for over two years.

299
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
At first, I called to reserve a room.

300
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
I called the vice-president.

301
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,080
I called again to cancel the reservation.

302
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
I didn't answer and just stopped.

303
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
So you're saying you didn't cancel the reservation, right?

304
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
You didn't even leave a message.

305
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Is there a reason?

306
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Why would there be a reason?

307
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
I didn't receive it, so I couldn't cancel it and just didn't go.

308
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
Why are you asking me that?

309
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
I said I didn't go.

310
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
If you were going to reserve a room,

311
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
you must have been going to meet someone.

312
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,580
You punk.

313
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,580
Do I have to tell you that?

314
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,580
I'm sorry.

315
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Why did you try to cancel the reservation?

316
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Yesterday, I checked that the whiskey was kept in the name of the president.

317
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,580
Didn't you go to the bar?

318
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,580
I'm sure I told you.

319
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,580
I didn't go.

320
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
Dr. Kim, stop it.

321
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
Sir, do we have any more information to know?

322
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
No.

323
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
I'll check the president's statement.

324
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,580
Here's the statement.

325
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,580
Please write it down.

326
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
What's going on?

327
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
Oh, that's right.

328
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,580
Come often, Mr. Hyun.

329
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,580
You reserved a room yesterday, but you didn't come.

330
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,580
Then how was the whiskey kept in the name of Mr. Hyun Ok-eun yesterday?

331
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,580
That's usually a conversation between close friends and a drink.

332
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,580
And the guest who talked to Lee Myung until the end yesterday,

333
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
I don't know who it was.

334
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,580
I don't know who it was.

335
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,580
I don't know who it was.

336
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,580
I don't know who it was.

337
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,580
I don't know who it was.

338
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,580
Can you tell me who it was?

339
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,580
I don't remember the names of the guests well.

340
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,580
He was a little big.

341
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,580
He was a little big.

342
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
But he could be a cop.

343
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,580
I've been here with him and Mr. Hyun before.

344
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,580
You're a cop?

345
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,580
Yes.

346
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,580
Cops come here often.

347
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,580
You said Han River Police Station, right?

348
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,580
It would be faster if you ask there.

349
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
Yes, sir.

350
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
What's up?

351
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,580
What's up?

352
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,580
Why didn't you call me first?

353
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,580
I feel a little uncomfortable today.

354
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,580
Lee Myung.

355
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
What kind of person is Lee Myung?

356
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
Is he related to you?

357
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,580
What are you talking about?

358
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,580
I know a lot about you than I thought.

359
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,580
You're the last person I talked to.

360
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,580
That's right.

361
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
Why are you talking about my uncle all of a sudden?

362
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Did you know my uncle and Lee Myung?

363
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,580
I don't know.

364
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,580
But why?

365
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,580
Your uncle may know, but at least three of you have never seen him.

366
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Okay, I'm going.

367
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Did you kill him?

368
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
Hey.

369
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
Three bottles of banju.

370
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
I'll be right back.

371
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,580
Did the team leader go there?

372
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,580
We went there together on the day of the president's inauguration.

373
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Why didn't you tell me?

374
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,580
I'm sorry.

375
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580
I didn't want to misunderstand.

376
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,580
Let's get rid of it quickly.

377
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
First of all, I'll go.

378
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,580
I'll go.

379
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,580
I'll go.

380
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,580
I'll go.

381
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,580
I'll go.

382
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
I'll go.

383
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,580
I'll go.

384
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,580
I'll go.

385
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,580
I'll go.

386
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
I'll go.

387
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
I'll go.

388
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,580
I'll go.

389
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,580
I'll go.

390
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
I'll go.

391
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,580
I'll go.

392
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
First of all, I'll go.

393
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
You went often.

394
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Where were you around this house two days ago?

395
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Why did you say you were at home?

396
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
You should have checked your phone location.

397
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
I'll check it.

398
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
Have you ever met the victim in private?

399
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
Are you crazy?

400
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
You're going to meet him alone?

401
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
You're really bad at this.

402
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,580
Did you know the victim, Lee Myung, usually?

403
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,580
Is the boss's name Lee Myung?

404
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,580
I've never seen her.

405
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
I don't even have a memory card.

406
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,580
The boss left because he was the boss.

407
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,580
I didn't go because I wanted to go.

408
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Then I'll do it.

409
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
It's just a formal thing.

410
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,580
Open it.

411
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,580
Let's finish it quickly.

412
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
Yes, yes.

413
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,580
Thank you.

414
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Everyone, keep your mouths shut.

415
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:38,580
If you write a line in the media, you'll see more of it that day.

416
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,580
I'll be careful.

417
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
I'll be careful.

418
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,580
A woman in her 40s was found dead in a parking lot in a residential complex in Seoul.

419
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,580
The police are investigating.

420
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:44,580
The police in the police station are suspected of being involved in this case.

421
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,580
The situation is getting worse.

422
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,580
This is Jung Seung-hyun.

423
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,580
This is a parking lot in a residential complex in Hangang-gu, Seoul.

424
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:58,580
The report that a woman in her 40s was found dead in a parked car was received on the night of the 25th.

425
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:06,580
The police who were on the scene immediately captured CCTV and black box videos, but they haven't identified the suspect yet.

426
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Meanwhile, it is reported that the police in the Hangang Police Station were attacked several times at the whiskey bar run by the victim.

427
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:23,580
The police are suspected of being attacked by 7 to 8 employees in the local community.

428
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:31,580
The Hangang Police Station is not responding to the phone and text messages of the victims who are suspected of being involved in the fire.

429
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,580
That bastard.

430
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Is he the only one who's guilty?

431
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,580
What the hell is he talking about?

432
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,580
He's the one who's going to the police station.

433
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,580
I don't want to work with him.

434
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,580
I don't believe him.

435
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
It's a shame that no one is uncomfortable.

436
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,580
I brought coffee.

437
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
Have a good night.

438
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,580
Thank you.

439
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Did you sleep well?

440
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,580
Yes.

441
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Did you burn my condensed milk?

442
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
Of course.

443
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Give this to the team leader.

444
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Yes.

445
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,580
It's strange.

446
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
Hey, the rappers are good.

447
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,580
Fake news and suspicions are everywhere.

448
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
I guess you're confident to endure everything.

449
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
Are you in the mood to drink coffee?

450
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Huh?

451
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,580
Aren't you going to solve the case?

452
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it quickly.

453
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Clean up everything by this week.

454
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,580
You ran in like you were going to catch a rat.

455
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,580
You still haven't solved it?

456
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
I'm investigating.

457
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,580
It's Friday today, but this week...

458
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
You're telling me not to go in?

459
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
It's an accident.

460
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
What's the problem?

461
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,580
I'm not going to die.

462
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Yes, manager.

463
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,580
You asked about the customer who talked to the boss in the bar last time.

464
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
Yes.

465
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,580
I was cleaning up the store today.

466
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,580
I remember him keeping whiskey before.

467
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
Who is this?

468
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
It's Mr. Taedongsoo.

469
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
He's from Gwangsu University in Seoul.

470
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:53,580
He drank the whiskey of the head of the criminal police on that day.

471
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,580
Thank you for your cooperation.

472
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,580
Let's go in.

473
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
Say hello to the Gwangsu University family.

474
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,580
It's about the Griffin CEO, Lee Mi-young.

475
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,580
What should we do?

476
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,580
Let's go in and talk.

477
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
I'm sorry.

478
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
I'm sorry.

479
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I'm sorry.

480
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,580
I'm sorry.

481
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
I'm sorry.

482
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
I'm sorry.

483
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
I'm sorry.

484
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
I'm sorry.

485
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
I'm sorry.

486
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,580
I'm sorry.

487
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,580
I'm sorry.

488
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:49,580
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,580
I'm the last person I've met before I die.

490
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,580
Is that what you're talking about?

491
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,580
Did you talk to the boss separately?

492
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,580
No matter how close you are, you don't talk about the case.

493
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,580
Then why did you meet Lee Mi-young on the day of the incident?

494
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,580
I went because I thought of a whiskey with Siga.

495
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Why?

496
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,580
Is something wrong?

497
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,580
Did you meet her right after you broke up with me?

498
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,580
Yeah.

499
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,580
Alone?

500
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,580
Yeah, alone.

501
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,580
You didn't make an appointment with Mr. Hyeon-ok-won, did you?

502
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,580
I made an appointment with you that day in advance.

503
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,580
How can I make an appointment with Ho-gun?

504
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,580
I know you two are uncomfortable with each other.

505
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Are you suspecting me right now?

506
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,580
Did you act suspicious?

507
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:02,580
Mi-young said she was going to go in early, so I drank three glasses and left a little over 9 30.

508
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,580
I heard that the person I looked for left right after Mi-young left.

509
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,580
I didn't go out right away, I went out to walk.

510
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
To sober up.

511
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
You took the car that day.

512
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:20,580
I called a taxi for you and left the car at home and walked to the bar.

513
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,580
It took about 10 minutes.

514
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,580
You know how I moved to the apartment in that neighborhood.

515
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,580
I'll check it out.

516
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,580
What's your relationship with Lee Mi-young?

517
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,580
What are you talking about?

518
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,580
What's your relationship?

519
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,580
It's nothing.

520
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,580
I'll check that out.

521
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,580
Are you done?

522
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,580
Yeah.

523
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,580
Go.

524
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Mix coffee is bad for your health.

525
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,580
How many glasses do you drink a day?

526
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,580
We're going to die soon, right?

527
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,580
Yes?

528
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,580
What's going on?

529
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,580
What's wrong with your face all day?

530
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,580
No.

531
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,580
You're doing this because of that incident.

532
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
Forget it.

533
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,580
You'll see more in the future.

534
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,580
By the way, I heard there's no suspect in that case.

535
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,580
I thought it would end soon.

536
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,580
Yes, this is Han Kang-seo, Kang Hyuk-hee team.

537
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,580
Yes, Lieutenant Kim.

538
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,580
Oh, Lieutenant Nam.

539
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
What's going on?

540
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,580
I have something to ask you.

541
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
To me?

542
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,580
The death of the one-city case a few days ago.

543
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Is it true that the victim was killed in the parking lot?

544
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,580
I was wondering if there was anything new.

545
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,580
No, there's nothing new.

546
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,580
Why is that?

547
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,580
Oh, nothing?

548
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,580
No, nothing.

549
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
Have a good day.

550
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,580
Lieutenant Kim.

551
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
Lieutenant Kim.

552
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,580
Yes.

553
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,580
Captain Tae Dong-soo, the captain, is still not in Alibi, right?

554
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,580
Yes.

555
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
I checked the apartment CCTV.

556
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,580
They both died after the time of the death.

557
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
What's this?

558
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
You only emptied that, right?

559
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,580
The one-city can't be entered without a resident card, but that card is nowhere.

560
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,580
One of the victims' belongings was lost.

561
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,580
I heard there was no trace of the victim entering the house.

562
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,580
That's right.

563
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,580
But why did you only take the resident card?

564
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I think it's a secret.

565
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Yeah.

566
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
Resident card?

567
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Yes.

568
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
Yes, I'm Yang Jong-ho.

569
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,580
Hospital?

570
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,580
Wait a minute.

571
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,580
Yes, yes.

572
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
Nice to meet you.

573
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:16,580
I'm Yoon In-ha, the team of Seoul City's criminal analysis team, who will be teaching about related profiling today.

574
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,580
I look forward to your kind cooperation.

575
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,580
You know the Handong case, right?

576
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,580
This case took place in several cases.

577
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,580
There was no common ground, so the official history book didn't ask for the serial number.

578
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:49,580
What was the common ground that I could tie this case to serial number?

579
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Anyone know?

580
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,580
The victims are all women.

581
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
Again?

582
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
It all happened at dawn.

583
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
All on the street outside.

584
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:07,580
It's true that all three cases happened on the street without CCTV, but the street is everywhere.

585
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
That doesn't apply.

586
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,580
And they were all the same day.

587
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,580
That's right.

588
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
All three cases were the same day.

589
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,580
But I think it's not enough to tie it to serial number just by what you said.

590
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:26,580
It's true that all the victims were women, but their ages were all different, and the crime tools, the law of the forest, and the area were all different.

591
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
That's right.

592
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:33,580
But there's a decisive reason why I saw these three cases as serial numbers.

593
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
What was that?

594
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
Go to hell.

595
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:55,580
When Handong committed the crime, he repeatedly said to the survivors.

596
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,580
I focused on the symbolism of the word hell.

597
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:07,580
What made this man say the word hell?

598
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
It was church.

599
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:19,580
Every Wednesday at dawn, the church had a Wednesday worship.

600
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,580
The crime scene was all the way to church.

601
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:33,580
The criminal was dissatisfied with the woman who went to church, and he was likely to have committed the crime.

602
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:42,580
In fact, while Handong was on the morning worship, his son, who was alone at home, died of a fire.

603
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,580
He killed women who reminded him of his wife, saying that this was all because of the church.

604
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,580
As you can see, even if the criminal procedure changes, the consistency of the communication,

605
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:59,580
that is, the actions of the criminals with the signature can be related profiling.

606
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,580
But it would be dangerous to see them all as serial crimes, right?

607
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,580
The evidence must be clear.

608
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,580
Whether it's emo or signature.

609
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,580
Puzzle.

610
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
Signature.

611
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,580
The main character in the puzzle picture is Lee Mi-young.

612
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,580
Sakun is clear even behind his neck.

613
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:35,580
He wrapped the Gyeongdong map exactly and pulled it from the back seat.

614
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:43,580
There are traces of resistance in the car, but no fingerprints were found.

615
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,580
The criminal strangled his neck with gloves on.

616
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,580
The intention of the murder is so clear.

617
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,580
He didn't do unnecessary actions.

618
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:06,580
At least the movement is intelligent and the emotions are not buried.

619
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:13,580
If he's the same criminal as the case, there must be something in common.

620
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,580
Puzzle.

621
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,580
The only thing in common is the puzzle.

622
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:07,580
If the puzzle didn't come, it would never be tied to the chain.

623
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,580
How can I guess the criminal by the puzzle?

624
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,580
What's this?

625
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,580
I thought you left.

626
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,580
He's asleep.

627
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,580
Sorry.

628
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,580
Don't stay up late. Go to bed.

629
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,580
Don't stay up late. Go to bed.

630
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,580
Don't stay up late. Go to bed.

631
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,580
Don't stay up late. Go to bed.

632
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,580
Don't stay up late. Go to bed.

633
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,580
Don't stay up late. Go to bed.
