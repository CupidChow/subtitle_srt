00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:14,306
(20 years ago)

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:19,269
(Dreamland)

4
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,508
Ms. Li Shengshu

5
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,260
(10 years ago)

6
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,344
Ms. Li Shengshu

7
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,855
(Hansung University Hospital)

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,533
This is your mother

9
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,952
The remains of Ms. Li Nanshu

10
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,674
Because you changed your name
So I spent a lot of time looking for you

11
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,093
sorry

12
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,365
Why is this in your hands?

13
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,747
you

14
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,791
What is the relationship with my mother?

15
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,128
Ten years ago

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,256
Your mother and I worked together in the cafeteria

17
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,884
Your mother

18
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,471
I've always wanted to find you

19
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,394
Where is my mother now?

20
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:34,673
Blood Puzzle

21
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,352
Yi Luo

22
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,778
Can you turn around?

23
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,586
It seems you don't need counseling anymore.

24
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,756
yes

25
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,136
It was this face at first

26
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,596
That's right

27
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,473
It's me

28
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,810
You must be having fun these days.

29
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,482
Watch me fall into self-doubt

30
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,402
Watch me struggle to solve the puzzle

31
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,945
You must find it interesting.

32
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,158
No

33
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,285
I am very anxious

34
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,704
Because I hope you

35
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,457
Can keep up with my pace at a moderate pace

36
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,253
Yilo, you did a great job.

37
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,922
You are excellent

38
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,180
Who will be the next victim?

39
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,807
Where is Jin Wulong?

40
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,934
Come with me

41
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,061
I'll tell you

42
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,026
Really interesting

43
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,570
You don't want to know the last victim.

44
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,531
Is that who?

45
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,285
Is the person still alive?

46
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,249
Come with me

47
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,838
Yeah

48
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,923
or

49
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,802
You can arrest me here.

50
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,220
Otherwise...

51
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,932
You can kill me now.

52
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,902
(Jin Hanquan, calling)

53
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,345
(Jin Hanquan, calling)

54
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,809
The number you dialed does not have...

55
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,936
Jin Hanquan should come to me

56
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,855
I don't want to be disturbed

57
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,038
team leader

58
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,332
I can't contact Guard Yin Yiluo

59
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,377
She said she was going to get some information and would be back to the headquarters soon.

60
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,177
Did you know that no one knew about this?

61
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,806
No one wants to know

62
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,767
Why did the victim die?

63
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,020
What does the puzzle represent?

64
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,775
At that time, I thought it was useless if no one understood it.

65
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,819
So I stopped.

66
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,281
Then I met you by chance

67
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,208
See that night
The girl I left behind appeared in front of me

68
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,044
Do you know how shocked I was?

69
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,927
Why didn't you kill me?

70
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,804
Why should I kill you?

71
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,597
You're not a criminal.

72
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,143
Team leader Liang Zhenghu is not a criminal either.

73
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,603
But he died because of you

74
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,731
He didn't die in my hands.

75
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,949
That handkerchief

76
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,327
It's my mom's, you know?

77
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,260
We always hope that you can live like an ordinary person

78
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,305
No matter if it's me

79
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,641
Your mother is the same.

80
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,106
We want you to go skiing

81
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,985
Go to the sea

82
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,116
I hope you spend Christmas with your friends.

83
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,373
Stop it, Shengshu

84
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,670
I don't understand what you're saying.

85
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,847
You can speak out with confidence

86
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm not recording

87
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,355
Can revenge change anything?

88
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,114
So why do you help those kids?

89
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,158
Would that change anything?

90
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,953
Well, it can change

91
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,789
I believe it can change

92
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,752
You're just like those kids.

93
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,130
Live your own life.

94
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,759
It's too late

95
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,638
You just need

96
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,142
Just keep doing your job.

97
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,981
How hard and painful your past life has been

98
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,400
I understand

99
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,236
You must hate humans.

100
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,363
Because I used to be like that

101
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,121
Do you understand me?

102
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,291
Understand my life?

103
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,804
good

104
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,850
I may not fully understand you

105
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,106
But I can understand your hatred and anger

106
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,573
Because I, like you, have been in a resettlement agency.

107
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,536
It's not too late

108
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,956
I will take all responsibility

109
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,459
You just forget everything

110
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,628
Live your life.

111
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,339
How are you going to take responsibility?

112
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,092
This is the life I want.

113
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,266
Why should I tell you all that?

114
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,686
It's all my fault

115
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,399
Since this incident was caused by me

116
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,444
Then I should tell the world
And end it all yourself

117
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,447
That's what you want, right?

118
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,828
That's it.

119
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,962
This is not what I want!

120
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,512
Why on earth are you doing this?

121
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,392
If Lee Nam-sook

122
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,230
There was no shelter for Team Leader Liang Zhenghu who had nowhere to go...

123
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,238
If it wasn't Lee Nan-sook who died
But Liang Zhenghu, or...

124
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,369
If he didn't find
Li Xue, who changed her name to Li Shengshu...

125
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,414
In that case

126
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,126
Would this not have happened?

127
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,838
Team leader Liang Zhenghu also has the same regret

128
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,675
There are many "what ifs"

129
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,139
No

130
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,142
This is going to happen eventually.

131
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,605
Let's go and see the night view

132
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,217
(Jin Hanquan, calling)

133
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,638
We are looking for Guard Yin's vehicle

134
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,932
The surveillance camera has traced the route to Shuangxi Road.

135
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,684
The subsequent dynamic line is still under review

136
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,187
But why was Guard Yin Yiro kidnapped?

137
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,981
Could it be that the last piece of the puzzle is Guard Yin Yiro?

138
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,526
No, Yin Yiluo has nothing to do with the puzzle.

139
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,903
Otherwise why?

140
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,074
Shuangxi Road

141
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,951
It is the location of the unique city

142
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,746
Hey, it's the only city

143
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,706
The city of one?

144
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,166
The prisoner's destination

145
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,044
This is where all this started.

146
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,421
Established in the New East Asian Market
A unique city on the ruins of a fire

147
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,716
Would she want to end it all there?

148
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,057
Don't you want to ask me why I killed them?

149
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,603
Is there no other way?

150
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,940
What method?

151
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,030
completely

152
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,491
No one apologized to me.

153
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,243
None

154
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,249
Logically speaking, even if they
You should apologize in order to beg for mercy.

155
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,503
But no one talked

156
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,547
Why?

157
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,553
Because they totally forgot

158
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,514
Who is Lee Nam-sook?

159
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,187
So you kill people?

160
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,778
Where are the victims?

161
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,405
We're here

162
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,159
No. 5802

163
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,662
There is the next piece of the puzzle

164
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,779
Mr. Jin Wulong, I am a policeman

165
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,072
Mr. Jin Wulong

166
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,644
What's going on?

167
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,687
Where is Li Shengshu?

168
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,690
She's gone

169
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,362
What are you thinking about?
Why did you follow her here?

170
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,366
I thought maybe I could save him in time.

171
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,912
Even if she might lie to me, I still want to believe her

172
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,210
Didn't you ever think that you might be in danger?

173
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,506
A serial killer who killed seven people

174
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,550
There is no way the victim would survive.

175
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,344
Isn’t it?

176
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,430
Then why did she come to me?

177
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,558
She didn't come to kill me.

178
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,774
Is it to see my helpless expression?

179
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,449
this

180
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,993
It is a puzzle on the table of Lee Mi-young's house

181
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,167
Is this the last victim?

182
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,878
This is just a black puzzle.

183
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,297
There's nothing drawn on it.

184
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,633
What does this mean?

185
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,304
The burnt-out New East Asia Market

186
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,057
Fire Cases

187
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,728
Could it be related to the fire?

188
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,832
After 1987
Privatization of demolition projects in urban renewal areas

189
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,001
Demolition manpower companies began to emerge among the public

190
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,546
The first one was Jichan, founded by Du Runxiu.

191
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,132
From the early to mid-1990s

192
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,051
They almost have a monopoly
All urban renewal and demolition projects in Seoul

193
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,971
But as you know, they will do whatever it takes.

194
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,307
They are also notorious for their violence.

195
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,185
After they caused several social controversies

196
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,146
Those construction companies and urban renewal companies
I started to be reluctant to outsource to Jichan

197
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,691
So Du Runxiu used
Establishing a subsidiary company under someone else's name

198
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,445
That is the prolific development run by Jiang Zhimu

199
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,659
How much do you know?

200
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,458
about…

201
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,753
My uncle's story

202
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,300
You must have investigated Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon as well, right?

203
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,347
He probably suppressed the matter.
Then I received the benefits.

204
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,266
Otherwise, someone promised him a promotion.

205
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,395
Yin Dongxun

206
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,482
Benefits of suppressing fire cases

207
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,734
That is to get three houses in the unique city

208
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,153
and

209
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,657
The house is not registered in his name.
It's his niece's name.

210
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,454
Later, when his niece was in high school

211
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,498
He sold the three houses in the City of One.

212
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,667
Bought a luxury house in Hannam-dong

213
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,924
My parents are also members of the New East Asia Market Urban Renewal Association

214
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,928
They have ten stores

215
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,146
Where does this story end?

216
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,569
How wide-ranging is the scope of this whole incident?

217
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,117
Kim Woo-ryong, Director of Hangang District Office
It has been going on since I was a city councillor

218
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,869
Accepting a huge bribe from Du Runxiu

219
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,997
Later, when Do Yun-soo transformed himself into a construction businessman

220
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,417
Kim Woo-ryong, Chairman of the Seoul City Council
Made a decisive contribution

221
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,752
After Jin Wulong

222
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,547
Is there anyone else related to the New East Asia case?

223
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,091
I feel like that person will be the last piece of the puzzle

224
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,845
The last victim
It should have nothing to do with the New East Asia case

225
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,723
The Jin Wulong in the puzzle is sitting on the throne

226
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,060
Black puzzle...

227
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,106
We have to figure out what it means.

228
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,734
Let’s think about where Li Shengshu will go.

229
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,237
Where would she want to end this story?

230
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,503
The background of the puzzle is an amusement park, Dream Park

231
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,883
Dream Park

232
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,969
Where Li Shengshu lost her mother

233
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,429
There is also a unique city

234
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,099
For Li Shengshu
That's where she lost her mom.

235
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,478
Black puzzle...

236
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,114
Well, Ah Suan

237
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,159
Guard Gold, we are sure
Li Shengshu's final destination

238
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,327
How did you determine that?

239
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,704
We reviewed the video of Jin Wulong falling from the rooftop.

240
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,165
The surveillance camera in the parking lot of Unicity

241
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,418
Found Li Shengshu got on a model taxi

242
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,963
The taxi driver also gave testimony

243
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,091
He said that Li Shengshu
We arrived at the funeral parlor in Namyangju

244
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,342
funeral parlor?

245
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,844
Yes, but there

246
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,765
It happens to be currently placed
The place where the remains of Team Leader Liang Zhenghu are

247
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,149
Why did she go to Zhenghuge?
What about the funeral home?

248
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,860
Does the black puzzle represent death?

249
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,821
Everyone wears black when they go to a funeral home.

250
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,490
Wait until we find Li Shengshu
You'll know what that means.

251
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,742
Let's split up and look for it.

252
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,078
You go to the funeral home, I go to Dreamland

253
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,038
Wait, you want to go to Dreamland alone?

254
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:16,640
(Tianguang Funeral Home)

255
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:44,334
(Tianguang Funeral Home)

256
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:04,396
She didn't do anything
After standing there for 30 minutes, it disappeared.

257
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,815
And soaked like a drowned chicken

258
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,526
She must have come here knowing that Zheng Hu Ge was here.

259
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,195
But why did she leave after just standing there for a moment?

260
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,655
Not going in either

261
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,118
So what on earth was she doing here?

262
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,733
welcome

263
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,111
I've been waiting for you

264
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,455
coward

265
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,626
Don't break it this way.

266
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,884
Me and my mom

267
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,261
Took this together

268
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,472
I was still very short at that time

269
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,183
There are not many recreational facilities to play

270
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,898
I rode the carousel

271
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,400
Bumper car

272
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,445
I also bought some cotton candy.

273
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,336
I have several times

274
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,130
Waiting for my mom here.

275
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,301
I had no idea she was waiting for me in the cafeteria

276
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,347
I imagine every day

277
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,976
The expression on my mother's face when she appeared in front of me one day

278
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,979
Imagine her looking at me

279
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,107
Laughing and crying expression

280
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,445
Imagine she said she had been looking for me for a long time

281
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,950
Saying she didn't abandon me

282
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,125
I also want to tell her that I have been looking for her for a long time

283
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,966
But I don't remember that cafeteria.

284
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,320
sorry

285
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,829
I didn't want to hear that from you.

286
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,040
Why are you apologizing to me?

287
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,834
I know now

288
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,337
My uncle and my parents' story

289
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,885
perhaps

290
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,763
I also like the protagonists in the puzzle

291
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,765
No difference

292
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,020
It's not your fault.

293
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,439
You are too sensitive

294
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,816
That's why you lose sleep

295
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,318
Don't feel too guilty

296
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,198
I have a question for you.

297
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,911
Why are you in Lee Mi Young's car?
Play the classical music "Nocturne No. 15"?

298
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,040
Is there any significance to that piece?

299
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,667
That's not what I played.

300
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,254
Lee Mi-young played that song as soon as she got in the car

301
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,590
I originally thought about turning it off.

302
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,134
But it really…

303
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,472
So beautiful

304
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,394
I have been

305
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,897
No chance to listen to music

306
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,274
"very nice"

307
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,276
"So beautiful"

308
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,820
I have never had that concept in my life.

309
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,993
But that song is so beautiful
Let me forget I got on that car

310
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,413
It's for killing people

311
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,921
It's not too late

312
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,590
You can start now

313
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,801
Live that kind of life

314
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,263
Yi Luo

315
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,558
I've finished what I needed to do.

316
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,853
I don't want to live anymore

317
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,689
There's no reason to live anymore.

318
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,651
Why?

319
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,444
Why?

320
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,823
Why don't you want to live anymore?

321
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,625
I…

322
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,504
Never again

323
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,632
I can't stand myself anymore

324
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,638
No kidding.

325
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,474
Just hold on.

326
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,271
Live and atone for your sins. Just live like that.

327
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,527
Li Shengshu!

328
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,119
Hands up, come out

329
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,635
Ms. Li Shengshu

330
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,515
You are suspected of committing the Jigsaw serial murders
I want to arrest you urgently.

331
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,645
Please raise your hands high and walk out slowly.

332
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,943
I hate humans.

333
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,781
Why are you
Are you trying so hard to stay alive?

334
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,578
What's the reason for you?

335
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,081
Do we have to live so desperately?

336
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,823
Why?

337
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,369
Yi Luo

338
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,331
Why on earth did you...

339
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,043
Why do they kill people...

340
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,882
To build a place for people to live?

341
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,075
Tell me what happened today

342
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,746
And what did you talk about with the suspect?

343
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,379
Yin Yiluo Guard

344
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,426
I

345
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,012
I don't remember

346
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,389
do not you remember?

347
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,227
And you?

348
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:48,938
Don't you have anything to say?

349
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,837
I really wanted to stop you.

350
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,635
But now I finally know
Why did you do that?

351
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,515
Sorry, bro.

352
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,987
I'm here again

353
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,073
How is she today?

354
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,992
Same as yesterday

355
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,703
Staying in the room all day long

356
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,040
Please help me get this to her.

357
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,001
She won't drink.

358
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,232
(Resignation)

359
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,489
Please think about it again.

360
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,909
This is my decision after careful consideration.

361
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,623
You really won't regret it?

362
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,500
Won't

363
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,796
What are your plans for the future?

364
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,300
have no idea

365
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,178
I'm still young, I want to try everything

366
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,315
Your resignation

367
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,734
I will keep it first

368
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,070
You can always come back if you change your mind.

369
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,784
Thank you for letting me work here.

370
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,465
(No entry or exit, police cordon)

371
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,700
Yin Yiluo Guard

372
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,047
You came out earlier than I expected.

373
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,722
Have you seen Insadong Murder? What do you think?

374
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,642
What is that?

375
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,186
Don't you watch TV?
That's the most sensational thing recently.

376
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,315
Three people died in a Korean house in Insadong
The suspect has not been found yet.

377
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,360
Don't tempt me

378
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,904
Besides, Insadong is not under your jurisdiction.

379
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,198
I'm just asking.

380
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,743
Quite interesting.

381
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,625
I cooked it temporarily, I don't know how it tastes

382
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,252
Eat it while it's hot

383
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,184
Eat now

384
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,703
Really

385
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,497
It really tastes like fried sauce

386
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,001
I'll just say it

387
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,848
- By the way, Curry Man
-Um?

388
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,683
There is something I'm curious about

389
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,978
How come your mother lives in the City of One?

390
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,984
I started

391
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,945
Tell her I want to be a police officer

392
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,492
She is concerned about police salaries
I applied for the housing lottery in my name.

393
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,577
Then I was lucky enough to win

394
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:01,954
So cool

395
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,082
It's like winning the lottery

396
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,875
Yeah, I won the jackpot.

397
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,419
This is actually my mother's wish.

398
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,797
She has always wanted to live in this kind of house.

399
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,008
This is everyone's dream.

400
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,344
Very ordinary desire

401
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,721
So I can't criticize

402
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,322
Hello, everyone!

403
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,200
Today we have a special interview

404
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,411
Do you remember the previous nine-piece puzzle?

405
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,704
With a prisoner?

406
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,165
The prisoner left a puzzle and killed eight people.

407
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,626
This case is called the Jigsaw Serial Murders

408
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,628
Even sitting members of Congress have been killed.

409
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,797
Caused an uproar

410
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,674
We invited the first person to uncover this case

411
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,385
And analyze the case from beginning to end

412
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,512
Former criminal profiler Yin Yi-ra

413
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,014
Hello, Criminal Profiler Yin

414
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,600
Just call me by my name

415
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,602
I'm no longer a criminal profiler.

416
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,229
OK

417
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,814
Then Ms. Yin Yiluo

418
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,984
Please allow me to ask a rather old-fashioned question first.

419
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,610
Why did you become a criminal profiler?

420
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,696
It's really old-fashioned.

421
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,532
yes

422
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:23,077
We really invited the right person today
Looking forward to your wonderful reply

423
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,413
Should I have made my answer more interesting?

424
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,498
No, this is fine now.

425
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,378
I was doing a criminal profile for myself.

426
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,796
Um?

427
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,466
Could you please tell me what this means?

428
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,927
I want to know myself

429
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:43,014
Did you kill my uncle?

430
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:47,143
Jigsaw murder case
The second victim, Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon

431
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,854
I should now

432
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,773
You're not interviewing a murderer, are you?

433
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,443
Remind Yourself of Self-doubt

434
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,447
That's why I became a criminal profiler.

435
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,243
So you no longer doubt yourself?

436
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,419
(Forced demolition is murder! We will never back down!)

437
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,059
-Hello
-Hello

438
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,521
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
Criminal profilers gathered together

439
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:33,606
Who found this?

440
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,817
I heard that the director felt that the case
If something is wrong, I will immediately request support.

441
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,320
- He probably doesn't believe us.
- Really

442
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,912
The victim had no belongings with him.

443
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,996
Oh, Hanquan

444
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,331
Has your identity been found out?

445
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,999
Wait

446
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,923
The fingerprint comparison results just came out

447
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,550
Tian Meizhao, 23 years old

448
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,178
She lives nearby, Changil-dong 7

449
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,055
What was the cause of death?

450
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,975
The details will be known after verification.

451
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:12,603
But judging by the cuts on her neck
It is assumed that he died from excessive blood loss.

452
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,439
And the wounds appear to have been sutured posthumously.

453
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,150
Estimated time of death...

454
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,698
It's the night of the 23rd

455
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,494
The scars and sutures
Doesn't look like a professional's work

456
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,123
If it's the 23rd, it's only two days later.

457
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,333
Is her face too pale?

458
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,876
Yeah, I think so too

459
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,254
It feels like the blood was drawn intentionally.

460
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,423
If the blood was not deliberately drawn from the corpse,

461
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,425
Then her face will be black.

462
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,011
She looks like she's been stuffed.

463
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,557
Why would the criminal do this deliberately?

464
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,310
Because the prisoner wanted to show

465
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,854
My own masterpiece

466
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,611
The prisoner combed her hair to her liking.

467
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,405
Re-makeup

468
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,615
And put on a beautiful dress

469
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,576
Made her look like this

470
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,663
This must be the prisoner's long-standing fantasy.

471
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,499
To comfort my loneliness and emptiness

472
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,377
I have depicted it in my mind countless times.

473
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,962
A dreamlike appearance slowly constructed

474
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,631
Then when I saw the victim

475
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,760
The prisoner thought she was able to
The object that realizes that dream appearance

476
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,930
Then the criminal must have thought
Show off your unique work to others

477
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,559
That’s why the victim is shown like this.

478
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,773
Pretty good looking

479
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,026
But it makes people feel uncomfortable

480
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,864
The perpetrator may also want to humiliate the victim.

481
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,242
After all, the dream object is not only the object of your desire,

482
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,411
They will also be the object of hatred

483
00:47:56,248 --> 00:48:00,169
This dumping site
Would it mean anything to the prisoners?

484
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,172
The prisoner is familiar with this place.

485
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:07,134
The criminals are all around us.
