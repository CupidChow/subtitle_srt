2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,267
Is it a calm day today?

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,646
Where's your wife? Isn't she going with you?

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,482
She went to America to see her children.

5
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,692
- How's the oil?
- I changed it.

6
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:29,154
After changing the oil, I also had the whole thing serviced.

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,572
Please be safe when going out to sea

8
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,749
Let's go

9
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:20,909
Blood Puzzle

10
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,051
I heard she is a criminal profiler at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency?

11
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,177
right

12
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,264
Then why didn't she say anything?

13
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,057
I don't know

14
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,227
I don't know if this will affect us.

15
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,608
The Han River Police Department said they would come to deal with the person
Why hasn’t it arrived yet?

16
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,161
(Jeju Police Department)

17
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,540
This is what you want me to do anyway
Do I have to believe your reasons?

18
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,508
what is going on?

19
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,137
How should I understand this situation?

20
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,433
How do you want to understand it?

21
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,643
Yin Yiluo

22
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,898
If you believe me, I'm not a criminal.

23
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,317
If you can't believe me

24
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,902
Then I am the criminal.

25
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,612
Don't joke with me, make it clear

26
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,159
Wu Zhejin appeared in
People in Lee Gang Hyun's case file

27
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,954
He was Li Gangxuan before his death
The last person to call

28
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,749
Aren't you here to find him?

29
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,714
Yin Yiluo!

30
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,344
I don't remember

31
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,734
We don't think the police kill people.

32
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,695
But her fingerprints and footprints were on the yacht

33
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,782
She was also seen holding onto the ropes tied to the body.

34
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,201
Anyone who sees it will find it suspicious

35
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,787
But no matter how we ask
She's refusing to respond now.

36
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,581
See if you guys want to hurry up
Convince her to give in or whatever

37
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,041
Solve it yourself.

38
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,502
Otherwise, it will be troublesome when the reporters get the news.

39
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,671
What is the estimated time of death of the victim?

40
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,841
It was between 5pm and 8pm yesterday.

41
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,885
Some people who took part in the yacht tour
Just after 5 p.m.

42
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,055
Seeing Miss Yin Yiluo
Staying with the victim Wu Zhejin

43
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,431
What happened after that?

44
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,017
There is no meaning in what you do afterwards.

45
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,479
From our perspective
Just the evidence we have so far

46
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:58,066
That's enough to consider her a suspect.

47
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,034
Director Xuan, since you called me personally,

48
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,161
I told them to suspend the investigation.

49
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,332
But you still have to solve it as soon as possible
I can't give you much time.

50
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,921
But this matter
Why is it the Han River Police Station that is stepping in?

51
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,799
Isn’t the suspect affiliated with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency?

52
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,759
What suspect?

53
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,305
I explained it to you on the phone.

54
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,390
A policeman

55
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,311
A working
How could a criminal profiler kill someone?

56
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,022
There must be some misunderstanding here.

57
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,233
That's got to be determined through investigation.

58
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,321
She should be for
I'm here for a case related to our police station.

59
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,156
Although I can't tell you in detail...

60
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,908
You don't have to tell me in detail.

61
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,287
But that Wu Zhejin

62
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,664
He has extensive political connections.

63
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,334
He is a man who can call the shots in Jeju.

64
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,046
I see what you mean.

65
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,425
Chief, we should go.

66
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,720
We want to see Guard Yin Yiluo

67
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,525
You were telling me about some serial murder case.

68
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,404
Why am I locked up in a detention room now?

69
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,742
I heard you were arrested at the scene.

70
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,703
What is going on?

71
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,918
What are you hiding?

72
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,062
Why do you think I'm hiding something?

73
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,066
I heard you doubted me

74
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,278
Now
Don't you think things have become simpler?

75
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,031
After all, what you see may not be the whole picture.

76
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,369
I'm quite surprised by your sudden change of attitude.

77
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,205
but

78
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,835
I think you are the one who is hiding something.

79
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,421
Am I guessing wrong?

80
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,549
Isn't it you?

81
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,762
What are you doing?

82
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,561
Where have you been?

83
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,229
Have you checked Guard Yin?

84
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,106
Have you recorded all of his whereabouts on the day of the incident?

85
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,275
What about the hotel’s surveillance camera footage?

86
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,986
Currently, the police are investigating, but...

87
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,656
No evidence has been found to clear her of suspicion.

88
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,702
Hey, you either let her loose
Either that or she can show you her solid alibi.

89
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,787
Gotta do something.

90
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,247
I see

91
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,585
Team Leader

92
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,420
Let’s talk

93
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,198
Why did we mention puzzles in the first place?
You didn't say anything?

94
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,825
I should have told you
That's because I don't trust Yin Yiluo.

95
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,161
But you can tell me

96
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,415
Don't you trust me either?

97
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,960
Because you are by Yin Yiluo's side

98
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,924
So, you just don't believe me.

99
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,675
Yeah, isn't that what you're best at?

100
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,261
I want to learn from you too.

101
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,436
Will Yin Yiluo be the only one to receive the puzzle piece?

102
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,771
right

103
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,732
Starting from the murder of Lee Mi-young

104
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,901
What? You don't believe this either?

105
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,490
I don't know now

106
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,325
What to believe?

107
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,370
She must have some plan.

108
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,747
And I have to find out what that is.

109
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,509
today

110
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,264
I want to share with you the story of a young boy who was talking nonsense.

111
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,767
The boy had ten years

112
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,062
I live in a truck with my father.

113
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,567
During this period, he was severely beaten by his father many times.

114
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,694
Finally he escaped to the orphanage

115
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,864
That was when we first met.

116
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,742
The patient was suffering from severe depression.

117
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,452
He also attempted suicide several times.

I really tried my best

120
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,587
I really want to see that patient get better.

121
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,715
I also often go to the orphanage.

122
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,175
However

123
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,051
One day

124
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,055
The patient suddenly came to my clinic to see me

125
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,266
He had a look I had never seen before.

126
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,977
Very relaxed expression

127
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,688

129
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,608
He also stressed that it was true

130
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,359
Says he's fine

131
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,195

(Guardian Jin Hanquan of Han River Police Station)

133
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,824
Then he said nothing.

134
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,827
Just look into my eyes

135
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,624
As if to let me see something in his eyes

136
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,504
That's when I understood

137
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,258
The patient killed his father

138
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,935
In fact, the patient

139
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,313
While his father was sleeping in the car
Set the truck on fire

140
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,615
You all know that in the eyes of the young people at that time

141
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,869
Did you see anything?

142
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,290
In his eyes,

Please reply to the person who contacted you.)

Why are you here?

153
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,415
Did Jin Hanquan ask you to do this?

154
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,084
right

155
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,672
Dr. Huang and I happened to have a seminar in Jeju
So I came directly here

156

Before I came here, I listened to Dr. Huang.

What on earth are you doing this for?

168
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,401
Do you trust me too much?

169
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,864
Shouldn't you first ask me why I kill people?

170
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,064
She didn't say anything special.

171
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,233
But she asked me to pass this on to you.

When was this received?

173

00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,369
I want to go out too.

181
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,043
Come, check my alibi

182
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,379
(Private taxi in Jeju)

183
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,239
(Han River Police Station)

184
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,913
(Seoul Han River Police Station
Jigsaw serial murder case report)

185
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,039
(Han River Police Station)

186
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,757
So Dongxun's murder case

187
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,136
It's one of those serial murders, right?

188
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,264
Yes, Yi Luo is right.

189
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,975
This is a serial murder case.

190
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,811
Counting Wu Zhejin, this is the sixth case

191
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,564
Liang Zhenghu

192
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,899
Do you agree too?

193
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,776
Although I don't want to agree

194
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,028
But maybe we have to look at it this way for now.

195
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,072
Jigsaw serial murders

196
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,285
We may need to set up an investigation headquarters.

197
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,871
You take charge.

198
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,542
Are you still willing to recall me, a failed detective?

199
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,794
Thank you so much

200
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,089
Take this opportunity to make amends.

201
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,507
That's right

202
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,177
I don't think I saw Jin Hanquan.

203
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,762
He is still in Jeju

204
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:25,021
I confirmed your estimated time of death at Wu Zhejin
A record of riding a Jeju transport taxi

205
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,317
The taxi driver told you to take it near the hotel

206
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,360
Back to the pier again

207
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,571
Why did you go back? Tell me now.

208
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,616
Great, these two days are quite interesting

209
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,701
I don't care if you're interested or not, just tell me now

210
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,662
What have you gained by doing this?

211
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,379
Do you know where I received this puzzle?

212
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,218
I met Wu Zhejin and took a taxi
When we were about to arrive at the hotel

213
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,721
Suddenly someone knocked on the car window

214
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,738
How did the other party know I was in that taxi?

215
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,866
How did you know which hotel I was staying in?

216
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,454
We have been running around so far

217
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,539
Once you receive the puzzle, you must find the murder case.

218
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,167
We also need to find the connection between the puzzle and the victim.

219
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,336
Yes, but we don't know the other party's motives yet.

220
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,296
I don't know why these victims were chosen.

221
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,798
But so what?

222
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,967
We are still walking in the fog

223
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,554
But the prisoner was watching us clearly.

224
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,391
So you're willing to make yourself a suspect?

225
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,936
When I found Wu Zhejin's body

226
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,731
I really want to know if I take the blame
How will the prisoner react?

227
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,943
To achieve a certain purpose
The criminals are continuing to kill people

228
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,195
And wanted to use me in the process

229
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,324
So I want to know
When I sink into the water, who will pull me out?

230
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,952
I want to see the other person's true face

231
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,999
Because the prisoner doesn't want me to sink.

232
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,337
So have you seen the other person's true face?

233
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,466
Except you, the people who came to Jeju Island to see me

234
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,051
There are four in total

235
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,805
Director Xuan Haojin
Team leader Liang Zhengnu, doctor Li Shengshu

236
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,515
besides

237
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,016
Huang Rencan

238
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
What's going on?

239
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,617
Have you been released?

240
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,911
I sit here today

241
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,306
I see you from here

242
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:06,974
It's like this

243
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,602
How do I look?

244
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,191
Your expression looks like you want to change your position and talk

245
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,359
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

246
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,779
Why did you come to Jeju?

247
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,781
I told you there was a seminar.

248
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,201
Dr. Huang is going to make an important sharing there.

249
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,622
The date of the seminar
When was it decided?

250
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,582
I heard about it three months ago.

251
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,584
Say

252
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,714
Am I a suspect?

253
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,727
I just feel weird

254
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,898
I don't know why your face popped up in my mind

255
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,441
That is to say

256
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,654
I also want to know what's in your mind
Why does my face appear?

257
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,616
When did you meet me?

258
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,370
It must be very hard to deal with patients who have not recovered.

259
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,580
You could have told me not to come again.

260
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,874
But why do you continue to counsel me?

261
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,878
You came to me on your own initiative

262
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,092
Do you think you can find Dr. Huang?
I was uncomfortable with counseling, so I came to me instead.

263
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,094
in addition

264
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,513
Have you forgotten that this is a police-designated hospital?

265
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,599
That is true.

266
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,187
Actually, it reminds you of that memory.
It's not my job

267
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,692
What I care about is
Why can't you recall that memory?

268
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,028
but

269
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,155
I've always been curious

270
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,241
Your memory

271
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,123
Why?

272
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,042
Why are you curious?

273
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,795
Is it you who is in that memory?

274
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,636
You made a simple question complicated.

275
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,263
I am just

276
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,182
I just hope I'm better than Dr. Huang.

277
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,026
Were you two competitors?

278
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,116
No matter what, I'm going to interrogate Dr. Huang next.

279
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,672
(Second Consultation Room)

280
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,677
(Sunshine Psychiatric Hospital)

281
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,388
(Kim Young-sung, Personnel Division, Hangang Police Station)

282
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,349
(This is what you asked me to do.
Remember to keep it secret, otherwise I will be punished)

283
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,725
(Liang Zhenghu's personnel file)

284
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,981
Police University, Yangxi, Mapo

285
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,774
Finally, the current Han River Police Station

286
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,361
When Chief Police Officer Yin Dongxun died
He works at the Mapo Police Station in the next district.

287
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:48,946
etc.

288
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,656
Mapo Police Station ten years ago?

289
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,247
(Breeze Police Station)

290
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,049
So you want to ask Team Leader Liang Zhenghu
How was he at Mapo Police Station?

291
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,300
Why are you asking this suddenly?

292
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,511
Just curious

293
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,431
After all, he's a hard person to figure out.

294
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,434
Honestly, I find him quite elusive.

295
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,895
Although we are the same age, we get along quite well.

296
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,481
But we never opened up and talked

297
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,650
He doesn't talk much.

298
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,777
He handles cases very efficiently.

299
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,281
But among colleagues
It can be said that there is a lack of intimacy.

300
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,701
Anyway, looking at the years we worked together

301
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,996
I can count the number of times I've had a drink with him alone.
That explains everything.

302
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,624
And he always finds excuses to get away.

303
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,585
Where are you going?

304
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,379
I don't know, but he's often missing.

305
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,465
Said his brother or sister had something urgent

306
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,799
Once

307
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,677
We were drinking and it was raining heavily.

308
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,013
That day he also said
His brother or sister has an emergency.

309
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,724
Apologize to me
Said he'd be right back, then left.

310
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,101
We were drinking alone.
What should I do if I am the only one left?

311
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,729
Wait, brother and sister?

312
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,067
Brother Zhenghu has no brothers or sisters.
He used to live in an orphanage.

313
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,193
Um?

314
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,445
Did he live in an orphanage?

315
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,740
Then why would he say that?

316
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,868
Aren’t they siblings?

317
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,496
Anyway, the reason why I remember that day

318
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,832
Because there was a major case in the next district.

319
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,711
You should also remember
It was the murder case of Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon

320
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,838
That was the day

321
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,715
I was drinking while waiting.

322
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,095
As a result, I saw outside
Both the police car and the ambulance were speeding along.

323
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,306
I was waiting for Zheng Hu, just watching

324
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,809
It turned out that he came back soaking wet.

325
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,685
I thought he wouldn't come back.

326
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,313
Was there anything unusual about him at that time?
Or did he say anything?

327
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,817
Let me think

328
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,362
He doesn't look well.

329
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,155
But he didn't say anything

330
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,949
Because later we just kept drinking

331
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,784
Do you remember that pub?

332
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,582
(Maki snack bar)

333
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,717
From the snack bar to the house where Chief Police Officer Yoon Dong-hoon was killed
The shortcut is 12 minutes away

334
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,721
If Zheng Huge had gone to the crime scene that night ten years ago

335
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,017
Plenty of time

336
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,938
There is no progress in Jeju yet?

337
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,357
- The surveillance footage you mentioned is...
- He's here

338
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,157
I am Tai Dongshu, the captain of the Guangsou team.

339
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,410
The severity of the case

340
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,705
I don't think I need to say more, you all know it clearly

341
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,749
This is already together
A serial murder case in which six people were killed

342
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,127
Wide Search Team

343
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,422
Responsible for researching every murder case except Wu Zhejin

344
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,590
Serious Case Team 2

345
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,717
Responsible for the centralized investigation of Wu Zhejin's murder case

346
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,636
Although each case
The methods of committing crimes and the causes of death vary.

347
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,180
But please don't forget
This serial murder case is ongoing.

348
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,016
Be sure to speed up

349
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,851
The details will be handled by this

350
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,062
Crime Analysis Group of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
Guard Yin Yiluo explained to everyone

351
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:22,200
The man who took the photo with his eyes closed represents Lee Gang Hyun

352
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,498
The man who shot the doll with a gun

353
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,459
Representative: Dong-hoon Yoon

354
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,464
This woman holding a marshmallow and whispering

355
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,548
Representative Lee Mi-young

356
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,886
The man dancing with the armband

357
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:41,970
Representative Jiang Zhimu

358
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,224
This clown is trampling the sand castle

359
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,768
Representative Do Yoon-soo

360
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,688
This man who was participating in the hamburger eating competition

361
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,148
Wu Zhejin

362
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:58,070
Each piece of these puzzles has a different picture

363
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,989
The picture above represents the victim.

364
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,702
Now let’s put these puzzle pieces together.

365
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,791
As you can see, this puzzle

366
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:15,128
A square made up of nine puzzle pieces

367
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,589
So the remaining puzzle pieces

368
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:19,967
There are three more

369
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,345
That is to say

370
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,806
There are three more murders yet to happen.

371
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,188
Okay, everyone understands, right?

372
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,233
We just have to find clues as soon as possible.

373
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,443
To save those three people

374
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,028
Let's act quickly.

375
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,530
- good
- good

376
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,326
Guard Yin Yiluo, let's talk.

377
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,415
Yi Luo, because you are the victim's family member

378
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,084
So there are a lot of people
I'm quite critical of your joining the search team.

379
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,962
After all, this violates the Criminal Investigation Regulations.

380
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,300
You are subject to the request for recusation
We should exclude you.

381
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,177
But after all

382
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,139
You started this case.

383
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,475
Let's continue like this.

384
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,776
Thank you

385
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,903
team leader

386
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,616
As the criminal police officer in charge of the case,

387
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,619
I really can't face you.

388
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,332
You're really good at apologizing.

389
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,548
I'm back

390
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,342
How are you?
We all heard about your time in the holding cell.

391
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,012
Beautiful lunatic, have you ever eaten tofu?

392
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,599
I didn't mention it.
Can white fresh cream cake be used instead of tofu?

393
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,684
Do you know how much you scared me?

394
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,896
Really? You don't usually scare easily.

395
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,775
Yeah, but you did it.

396
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,360
But I hope you come back safely.

397
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,823
We received the information to search the headquarters.
Start analyzing now

398
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:11,161
The prisoner knew I was going to find Wu Zhejin.

399
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,289
Du Runxiu's murder case
The prisoner didn't expect me to go find him.

400
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,708
But this time the criminal knew about it in advance and took action.

401
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,502
But the criminal certainly didn't expect

402
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,005
Will you take the blame for the murder?

403
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,465
That's right

404
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,218
So the criminal might have panicked.

405
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,513
Because I can't sink so quickly

406
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,600
But why the criminals
Did I start sending you puzzles from the Lee Mi-young murder case?

407
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,229
That's what I'm most curious about.

408
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,980
From the perspective of the criminal.

409
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,149
When killing Lee Gang Hyun and Yoon Dong Hoon

410
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,068
The criminals left puzzle pieces at the scene.

411
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,197
But no one noticed
So the criminal finally stopped.

412
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,283
As a result, ten years later, the criminal started killing again.

413
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,119
Then send you the puzzle.

414
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,581
Because the prisoner only now knows who you are.

415
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,127
Who could it be?

416
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,711
Do you have anyone in mind?

417
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,047
For example, someone you just met recently

418
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,300
The other party should be around you

419
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,972
Someone you just met recently?

420
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,812
There are indeed a few

421
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,191
The face that lingers before my eyes

422
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:29,281
There are four people who came to Jeju Island to see me.

423
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,285
None of them I have met recently.

424
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,328
There is another person

425
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,081
Been to Jeju Island

426
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,250
who?

427
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,210
Cui Suan, the youngest in our group

428
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,130
I took him with me.

429
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,724
Are you sure the criminal is here?
Were you among the people who stayed in Jeju Island that day?

430
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,894
Then you are sure about this
Is it really related to Liang Zhenghu?

431
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,187
You also know

432
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,981
The detective in charge of Lee Gang Hyun's murder case was Jung Hu.

433
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,819
At that time, he was close to Chief Police Officer Yin Dongxun.
The murder scene is only eight minutes away.

434
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,116
Besides, he knew Lee Mi-young before she was murdered.

435
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,203
What's wrong? Do you know her?

436
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,329
Unknown

437
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,625
And using Lee Mi-young's
The access card is still missing for unknown reasons.

438
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,543
The person who changed the direction of the investigation

439
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,754
It's also Zheng Hu Ge

440
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,088
Is there something missing there?

441
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,259
The only city cannot be entered or exited without an access card

442
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,719
But I can't find that card anywhere.

443
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,847
The only thing taken from the victim was that

444
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,808
Then there were unexpected changes.

445
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,144
That's Xu Liangxi

446
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,397
He didn't have to kill Jiang Zhimu himself.

447
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,525
Then there is Do Yoon-soo

448
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,818
Do Run-su?

449
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,488
I don't think it's right.

450
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,282
But why did you ask about Do Runxiu?

451
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,451
Do Runsu appears in Jiang Zhimu's communication records

452
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,702
But Zheng Huge ignored it

453
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,623
He must be trying to buy time.

454
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,252
Later you went to see Do Yoon-soo
His plan went wrong.

455
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,003
He may have acted in haste.

456
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,881
What if that was why he dropped his handkerchief?

457
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,176
What about Wu Zhejin?

458
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,014
I have to confirm the date of the incident first.
Is he in Jeju Island?

459
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,809
Even so, this is only circumstantial evidence.

460
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,645
We must find solid evidence or witnesses

461
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,984
Rollo Thomas

462
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,820
What are you talking about?

463
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,240
Haven't you even watched "The Iron-Man"?

464
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,832
The final twist in the movie
It is to find out that the colleague who was originally one of us

465
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,292
It turned out to be a criminal

466
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,627
That inmate later shot Kevin Spacey.

467
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,297
Kevin Spacey left a message before he died.

468
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,467
That sentence is "Roro Thomas"

469
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,596
The criminal was finally caught because of this sentence.

470
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,347
Please go watch this masterpiece.

471
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,433
Is it time to talk about movies?

472
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,143
Don’t you two have a very good relationship?

473
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,104
You are such an extreme T person

474
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,693
No, I really think
That's the possibility, right?

475
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,403
All right

476
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,323
Then we don't talk about Kevin Spacey

477
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,326
Do you know what Wu Zhejin said before he died?

478
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,453
So you mean

479
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,247
Gang Hyun didn't commit suicide, right?

480
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,249
right

481
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,753
And recently President Do and Jiang Zhimu died

482
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,506
It’s also related to Gang Hyun’s death, right?

483
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,591
right

484
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,885
They were all killed by the same criminal.

485
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,221
Why do you think these things happened?

486
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,057
Among the three dead

487
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,267
Is there any connection?

488
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,356
It should be because of the unique city.

489
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,359
I built the only city

490
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,737
This will happen to me eventually.

491
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,579
You now

492
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,165
Live in the City of One?

493
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,250
I?

494
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,960
Why do you ask?

495
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,758
Didn't your uncle tell you?

496
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,970
Tell me what? About the One City?

497
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,101
It seems that Director Yin
I haven't talked to you much about your parents.

498
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,565
Do you know my parents?

499
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,401
Dean Yin and his wife

500
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,444
It couldn't be more familiar

501
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,699
Thinking about this
You should be very familiar with our Yongxun, right?

502
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,785
Aren't you the same age?

503
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,418
so

504
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,295
Are you doubting Liang Zhenghu?

505
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,756
Who do you think killed Wu Zhejin?

506
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,758
Is it Liang Zhenghu?

507
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,762
I mean, it's possible.

508
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,598
Can you take responsibility for what you say?

509
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,351
Could you please approve a document for me?

510
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,897
Before Yin Yiluo's guard
Did you mention No. 5802 in the unique city?

511
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,650
The only city at the beginning
This is the company where Wu Zhejin works.

512
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,402
Built by Chengjin Construction

513
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,863
According to people related to Chengjin Construction

514
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,741
The person in charge of the construction project is Wu Zhejin

515
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,286
I heard that he often tells people around him
Show off your best location in Seoul

516
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,871
Built the most expensive apartment

517
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,582
Are the results of his autopsy results out?

518
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,585
It came out. It was suffocation.
Suffocation due to neck compression

519
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,503
Although he had bleeding on the back of his head

520
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,797
But that wasn't the direct cause of death.

521
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,175
That seems to be the injury he suffered when he fell.

522
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,761
What about the suspect's DNA?

523
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,346
Didn’t you find it this time?

524
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,433
Yes, just like the other cases.
The crime scene was clean.

525
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,937
We obtained in Jeju
I have also seen the few surveillance cameras.

526
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,231
Nothing special found
The monitor angle is not ideal either

527
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,986
I haven't seen Jin Hanquan all day.

528
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:01,863
Where has he gone?

529
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,619
Oh, I have something for him to do.

530
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,287
Thank you for your hard work.

531
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,663
Let's end the meeting here.

532
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,000
Captain, take care

533
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,317
Why do you want to act alone?

534
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,532
I'm just conducting a thorough investigation.

535
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,242
Don't you want to tell me?

536
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,164
I don't think it's the right time yet

537
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,794
Then I'll ask you a question

538
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,089
Why are you looking for someone from Mapo Police Station?

539
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,633
Do you think I'm a criminal?

540
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,973
Then you think like that.

541
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,725
I will continue to do my job

542
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:05,528
You're making me doubt you.

543
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,700
You should know that there are surveillance cameras everywhere, right?

544
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,995
Is it worth it for you to step into the detention room on your own initiative?

545
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,081
worth

546
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,501
Is that what you came to me to ask?

547
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,586
no

548
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,214
What I really want to ask is something else.

549
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,012
Chief Police Officer Yin Dongxun told me

550
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,432
The night Lee Gang Hyun died ten years ago

551
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,644
His niece Yin Yiluo is on the top floor of that apartment

552
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,813
So I've been thinking

553
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,608
If what he said was true

554
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,277
Did you see anything then?

555
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,782
Did you see anything?

556
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,205
Too long ago

557
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,126
I don't remember

558
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,629
Yeah?

559
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,426
So is there anything you want to tell me?

560
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,553
For example?

561
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,894
If you remember anything, please feel free to contact me.

562
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,334
(The official document has been received
Attached is the boarding record you requested to review)

563
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,044
(Airline travel records from 2022 to 2023)

564
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,093
(2022-2023 Airline Travel Records
Open file)

565
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,514
(Airline flight record query)

566
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:04,564
(October 18, 2023, Gimpo to Jeju
October 19, 2023, Jeju to Gimpo)

567
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,940
(November 18th, Gimpo to Jeju)

568
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,358
One month before the incident

569
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,944
Even on the day Wu Zhejin died, he was in Jeju

570
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,780
Oh my god, you are number one again today

571
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,742
Have you not slept yet?

572
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,494
Um

573
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,293
Ah Suan

574
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,129
Excuse me, can you do me a favor?

575
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,509
You want me so suddenly
What can I do for you? It feels terrible.

576
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,144
Are you sure you want to do this?

577
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,563
I would have kept quiet if I had known this earlier.

578
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,241
Excuse me
I called you here suddenly, but it's an emergency.

579
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,160
So we hurried over.

580
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,204
It doesn't matter

581
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,040
Let’s get started right away

582
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,923
You need to go to the most comfortable place

583
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,635
Relax your whole body

584
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,387
have a good rest

585
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,600
You are in a

586
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:27,605
A forest where you can hear the birds singing and feel the wind blowing

587
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,567
Please listen to the voices around you

588
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,863
And feel the touch on your skin

589
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,795
Now, you have to go back to

590
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,089
The moment you found the handkerchief

591
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,341
one

592
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,052
II. III

593
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:11,607
A police officer from a police station uses an intercom at the door

594
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,944
I told him I was here and he could leave first.

595
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,656
Please look around

596
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,284
Is anyone there?

597
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:24,912
I'm alone

598
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,124
What else do you see?

599
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,504
The scientific search team and our group

600
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,382
Entering the crime scene

601
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,467
How many people are there in total?

602
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,971
Six people

603
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,225
There are two people in the scientific search team and four people in our group

604
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,270
What are they all doing?

605
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,691
The scientific search team took photos at the door

606
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:58,196
Our team is checking the scene

607
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,115
Ouch, what a mess.

608
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,492
Now think about it carefully.

609
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,537
Colleagues' actions

610
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,372
You one by one

611
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,875
Look at them

612
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,169
Say what you see

613
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,758
Senior Lu is taking photos with his mobile phone

614
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:23,387
Senior Ying Xia is checking the evidence

615
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,059
Someone is walking slowly beside the desk

616
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,646
But I can't see the face

617
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:42,198
Come closer and see the other person's face clearly.

618
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,368
What is that person doing?

619
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,500
The man squatted down and stood up again

620
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,378
That person squatted down and stood up again

621
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,382
What is that person doing after he squats?

622
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,933
I can't see clearly

623
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,729
Okay, you did a great job.

624
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,023
Now

625
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:20,903
You slowly walk to where you can see the person clearly.

626
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,658
If you can see that person clearly

627
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,870
Just stop and tell us what you see.

628
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,666
That guy picked up something.

629
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,501
What did you pick up?

630
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,178
handkerchief

631
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,223
The man picked up an old handkerchief

632
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:58,441
Okay, now you carefully
Look at the man who picked up the handkerchief.

633
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,569
Tell us what you see

634
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,491
The man's clothes are dark.

635
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,707
I'm not sure

636
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,338
You can talk about the smell, the sound, anything.

637
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,048
Do you feel anything?

638
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,384
That person is a man

639
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,721
I smell smoke

640
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:33,851
What does he look like? Can you see his face?

641
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,770
no

642
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,774
It's blocked by the desk and can't be seen.

643
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,985
It's okay, you did a great job

644
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,577
good

645
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:56,582
Now you go over to him and face him.

646
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,126
You take a step

647
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,462
Face him

648
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,600
Wait, I can see a watch.

649
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,352
that…

650
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,189
This watch...
