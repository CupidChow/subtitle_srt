00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,046
(The characters, groups, background, events, etc. of this play
This is purely fictitious, please be informed)

2
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,931
Are you looking for this?

3
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:18,977
It's me

4
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,438
I killed everyone.

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,305
Mr. Leung Ching-wu

6
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,896
You are suspected of committing the Jigsaw serial murders
I'm going to arrest you

7
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,156
You have the right to appoint a lawyer

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,826
You can refuse to make a statement or make an excuse

9
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,579
They also have the right to request a review of the suitability of their arrest.

10
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,872
Do you understand?

11
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:44,289
Blood Puzzle

12
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,181
May I have your name?

13
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,684
Liang Zhenghu

14
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,979
What is your occupation?

15
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,111
Criminal Police

16
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,159
Where is your residential address?

17
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,455
No. 35, Xinridong, Dongjak District

18
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,424
The suspect, Mr. Liang Zhenghu...

19
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,227
I always hoped it wasn't you

20
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,983
Although all clues point to you
But I still hope it's not you

21
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,696
I clearly told you
Don't trust anyone until the case is closed.

22
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,156
Are you kidding me?

23
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,493
Have you been playing tricks on me for the past ten years?

24
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,124
Has it been ten years?

25
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,129
That's right

26
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,631
I killed all the people.

27
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,510
Lee Gang Hyun, Yoon Dong Hoon

28
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,472
Lee Mi-young, Kang Ji-mok, Do Yoon-soo

29
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,973
And Wu Zhejin

30
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,643
Yes, Jiang Zhimu, I couldn't do it myself.

31
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,315
I also sent the puzzle to Guard Yin Yiluo.

32
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,902
Why on earth would you do that?

33
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,822
Why on earth did you kill those five people?

34
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,120
Just help me get someone from the news department over here
I will answer you

35
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,293
You want me to get someone from the news department over here?

36
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,420
right

37
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,297
As soon as the news department comes

38
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,342
I will plan and practice
The cause of this serial murder case

39
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,385
Tell it all

40
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,973
There are three remaining murder plots.
I will also tell you everything

41
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,235
Then why did you turn yourself in?

42
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,448
There are still three murder plans left.
Why do you want to turn yourself in?

43
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm tired

44
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,586
I want to end this.

45
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,354
- Hello, Director.
- Hello, Director.

46
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,992
Is this situation reasonable?

47
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,662
The person who killed Dong Xunge was Liang Zhenghu?

48
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,252
I don't understand either.

49
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,525
(Boys' room)

50
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,283
Who are you?

51
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,306
Nice to meet you

52
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,644
What are you happy about?

53
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,773
In the past ten years, I have really
Try your best to recall that memory

54
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,985
Sometimes I even suspect that I might have killed someone.

55
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,031
Now I finally see the criminal.

56
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,451
So I'm very happy to see you

57
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,168
The day my uncle died

58
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,338
Did you know I would show up?

59
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,844
Your presence was not part of the plan.

60
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,846
I regret

61
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,852
What were you thinking when you were behind me?

62
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,238
Why you

63
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,824
Didn't kill me?

64
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,330
I won't answer any more questions.

65
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,876
Wait until you get the news department here.
I will explain in detail

66
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,974
When Liang Zhenghu was five years old, his father died of illness.

67
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,268
His mother also ran away from home two years later

68
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,979
He lived in the orphanage until he became an adult.

69
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,898
He has no relatives

70
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,358
Check out his recent contact history

71
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,570
He only has about 15 people in private contact.

72
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,406
good

73
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,242
Did anything come out of that handkerchief?

74
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,037
We have already entrusted the National Science Search and Identification Service to conduct an identification.

75
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,999
But they say it will take some time to do a thorough analysis of the DNA.

76
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,629
They will complete the analysis within this week.
Please tell us the detailed results.

77
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,547
What about the results of the search of his house?

78
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,342
The address registered on his household registration is not where he lives.

79
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,094
Others live

80
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,679
What do you mean? Please explain clearly.

81
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,682
Generally speaking, children in orphanages

82
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,769
Anyone over 18 will be forced to leave the hospital.

83
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,814
And we found there
There lived a group of children who had nowhere to go after leaving the hospital.

84
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:09,651
In other words, it's a bit like a shelter.

85
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,446
So where does Liang Zhenghu live now?

86
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,199
He seems to have other residences, we are still investigating.

87
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,121
It means there is no progress at all.

88
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,707
We need to investigate further

89
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,752
What we have now
Only his confession and the results of judicial hypnosis

90
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,881
Both of these are difficult to be admitted as evidence in court.

91
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,468
But why did he ask
How about asking someone from the news department to come over?

92
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,680
We all know he's not that type of guy.

93
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,642
What if we get someone from the News Department?

94
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,812
If we get someone from the news department

95
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,981
What would be the worst case scenario?

96
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,861
This is not an ordinary case after all.

97
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:57,198
We may need to simulate the situation of both parties

98
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,824
Why would you do that?

99
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,169
I thought about why you did that.

100
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,842
But no matter how hard I think, I can't figure it out

101
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,766
Do you remember when you first arrived
When he took up his post at the Han River Police Station?

102
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,278
(Please make sure to catch the real murderer who killed Young-hoon!)

103
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,781
(Yingxun has passed away for 1123 days
The late Chi Young-hoon, who was 16 years old when he died)

104
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,339
Do you remember you and the Han River Police Station team?
What was the first sentence you said?

105
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,929
You asked the team members right away.
A person performing a solo demonstration at the main entrance

106
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,681
What's his son's name?

107
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,392
Then you said this

108
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,023
"We must not"

109
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,776
"Forget the Victims"

110
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,700
You used to be that person

111
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,496
Why would someone like you do that?

112
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,086
You told us not to forget the victims.
Now he kills people with his own hands

113
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,299
Why?

114
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,220
Jin Hanquan Security Guard

115
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,223
Don't take a detour.

116
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,227
As long as you find someone from the news department
I will tell you everything.

117
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,562
Time is running out

118
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,155
Where is your actual residential address?

119
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,158
Are you only going to make this public through the media?

120
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,172
(Life Hotel)

121
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,521
(Life Hotel)

122
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,476
(Happy birthday)

123
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,813
(Strengthen character education centered on experience)

124
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,543
(A New Sociology)

125
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,096
(Uncle, I finally graduated!)

126
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,430
(Thank you, Mr. Detective)

127
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:40,606
(I will win! I have completed my training at the training center!)

128
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,359
(Congratulations on becoming a Special Corporal!)

129
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,907
(Mr. Detective!
We are married! I will visit you later)

130
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,536
Curry man, have you made any progress?

131
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,414
You go

132
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,125
I don't feel like talking today.

133
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,545
I'm not here to talk.

134
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,964
Why do you look like a F person?

135
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,389
This is the fish Liang Zhenghu asked us to help feed

136
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,272
You haven’t been to Team Leader Liang Zhenghu’s home, right?

137
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,195
I found out that he took the children from the orphanage
Letters and photos sent

138
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,905
All well packed in the box

139
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,831
Aren't you going to investigate the case?

140
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,001
Didn't you ask me before
Can we face those cases squarely?

141
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,254
So why are you crying here like a loser?

142
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,759
Could Brother Zhenghu really be the criminal?

143
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,347
Was he really the person standing behind you at that time?

144
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,974
What if not?

145
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,896
Why do I always feel that he surrendered himself...

146
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,984
Does it seem like self-harm?

147
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,323
Have you been to the orphanage he sponsored?

148
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,123
(Seoul Hangang Police Station, Kim Han-cheon)

149
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,795
Detective Jin, I heard Zheng Hu mention you.

150
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,007
but

151
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,426
Is it really Zhenghu?

152
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,178
There's no way he would do that.

153
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,806
The case is still under investigation, I have no comment

154
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,725
When did you meet?

155
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,730
We grew up together in the orphanage.

156
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,651
We spent our childhood here together

157
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,862
Zhenghu

158
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,450
Said I was going to work outside
So he left the hospital when he was about 18.

159
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,785
I've been living and working here.

160
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,790
So how did you meet again?

161
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,086
After he was admitted to the Police University, he began to come back to visit

162
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,632
I was surprised at how much he had changed.

163
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,926
What changes has he made?

164
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,428
When he was in the orphanage

165
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,264
He is a very introverted and timid person.

166
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,975
But since he entered the Police College

167
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,394
Become very strong

168
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,314
It can be seen that his beliefs and goals are very clear.

169
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,650
- Target?
- right

170
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,818
He said he had someone he wanted to find.

171
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,987
So being a policeman is his dream

172
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,947
The person you are looking for? Who is that?

173
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,243
That part

174
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,204
Personal privacy

175
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,623
I'm not in a position to tell you

176
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,707
privacy?

177
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,501
Six serial murders have occurred so far

178
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,170
I don't know what the future will bring
How many people have been harmed, and you tell me

179
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,380
- privacy?
- sorry

180
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,633
I may not be able to reveal more.

181
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,930
Anyway, after he became a policeman
I have been regularly supporting the children of this orphanage.

182
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,640
He also said

183
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,686
Everyone should be given a chance

184
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,189
He became outstanding

185
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,490
Is there anyone he needs special protection from?

186
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,117
You can guess whoever you want.

187
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,495
Someone he needs to protect?

188
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,124
Probably the children he sponsored.

189
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,045
After all, he regards them as more important than anything else.

190
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,588
These

191
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,426
These are the children you sponsored.

192
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,804
The list of these 21 people

193
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,932
Is there someone you want to protect?

194
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,143
How could I have someone to protect?

195
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,937
Those kids have nothing to do with this case.

196
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,064
I'll decide if there's any connection.

197
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,735
Now the search team is investigating them one by one

198
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,863
explain

199
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,406
Who is the real criminal?

200
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,618
Nancy round?

201
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,537
Or Jung Jae-il? Lee Ye-seul? Park Kyung-jin?

202
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,457
Or one of the people who lives in your house?

203
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,125
What are you doing? I already told you it's me

204
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,878
No, it's not you.

205
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,714
Jin Hanquan Security Guard

206
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,674
No time

207
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,179
I will confess everything
Please get someone from the news department here as soon as possible.

208
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,812
elder brother

209
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,525
Haven't you ever thought about

210
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,945
You remain silent
Will another murder happen?

211
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,115
There are three pieces left in the puzzle

212
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,410
It means someone else will die.

213
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,495
No

214
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,499
There will be no more murders. It's over.

215
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,083
I'll ask you again

216
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,086
Who is it?

217
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,558
Remember this

218
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,771
If anyone dies again, it's because of you.

219
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,254
Brother Zhenghu is not a criminal

220
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,381
I think so too

221
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,050
Liang Zhenghu didn't know the day my uncle died

222
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,678
The prisoner used to stand behind me

223
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,975
Most importantly, Liang Zhenghu is a warm person

224
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,812
A selfless person who can
People who give their houses to others

225
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,273
There is no reason to commit serial murders

226
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,027
He is sacrificing himself to divert attention.

227
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,406
Because he has to protect someone.

228
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,785
We must find out who Liang Zhenghu wants to protect.

229
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,402
Come out

230
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:34,788
(Han River Police Station)

231
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,467
What are you doing?

232
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,386
You know it well, right?

233
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,974
Except your confession
There is no evidence to prove that you are the criminal.

234
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,769
The day Lee Mi-young died

235
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,229
At her estimated time of death
You are in an orphanage.

236
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,149
When Do Yoon-soo died
You and Ah Suan stay in the Han River Police Station

237
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,194
Can provide proof of your alibi
There are countless surveillance cameras and witnesses

238
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,612
You didn't kill anyone.

239
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,573
What do you want? The criminals have admitted it.

240
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,450
There are three pieces left in the puzzle

241
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,372
We have to catch the real criminal, don't mess around.

242
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,001
It hasn't even been 48 hours.
Is this too hasty?

243
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,294
Whose idea was this?

244
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,339
The director and Senior Dong Shu both agreed.

245
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,300
So stay out of this case.

246
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,140
Yes, Guard Gold

247
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,935
Team leader Liang Zhenghu just walked into the exam hotel.

248
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,938
Hello

249
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,441
Wait, you can't go in now...

250
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,903
I'm going to get some fresh air.

251
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,572
Do you want to go for a ride?

252
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,908
I have an appointment today

253
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,382
Didn’t I tell you everything before?

254
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,134
Is there anything else that hasn’t been mentioned?

255
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,429
Was it five years ago that we first met?

256
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,222
We suddenly want to talk about this?

257
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,851
How do you know me?

258
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,313
My mentor introduced it to me.

259
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,647
Yeah

260
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,984
The doctor who consulted me five years ago

261
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,695
There is a good doctor junior
Ask me to meet the other party

262
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,280
So we met, right?

263
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,115
right

264
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,993
Before you guide your seniors to introduce

265
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,454
Do you know me now?

266
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,292
Why do you ask?

267
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,545
You asked your mentor to introduce me to you.

268
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,673
Or was it your supervisor who asked you to meet me?

269
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,138
I don't remember, it happened too long ago

270
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,226
do not you remember?

271
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,438
This question is very important

272
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,735
Do you still remember that patient?

273
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,946
The black patient

274
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,284
Is that right?

275
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,831
Your own story or the story of someone close to you?

276
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,458
Why do you think that?

277
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,712
Psychiatrists usually
I'm not very good at talking about case stories.

278
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,758
I almost remember
I haven't heard you mention the case story.

279
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,636
The only case you met in the orphanage

280
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,680
I think I heard you mention it a few times.

281
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,182
It was my fault

282
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,643
I shouldn't talk to you about that.

283
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,941
What appointment do you have today?

284
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,111
Why am I even telling you this?

285
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,283
Can't we even ask this between us?
I thought we had a good relationship.

286
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,952
We have a very good relationship.

287
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:47,291
But I can't do that because of this
I'll tell you all my private matters. I don't want to talk about them.

288
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,339
Where should I drop you off?
I have to go to a date.

289
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,642
What if Liang Zhenghu did not take action?

290
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,769
There's no way he doesn't know you're following him.

291
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,396
He must know.

292
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,148
But he will still act.

293
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,942
When I uncuffed him yesterday, he was very panicked.

294
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,738
This is the first time I saw him so panicked.

295
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,783
His expression seemed
My plans were all disrupted.

296
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,493
What will his plan be?

297
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,414
Why did Liang Zhenghu surrender himself?
And you also asked us to ask someone from the News Department to come over?

298
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:31,668
What does the Ministry of Information have to do with him protecting someone?

299
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,004
Is there such a plot in detective novels?

300
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,965
Wait me a moment

301
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,593
(Cui Suan)

302
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,969
Well, Ah Suan

303
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,554
Gold Guard

304
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,807
The team leader just left home and is driving

305
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,392
Where did he go?

306
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,478
I don't know yet

307
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,064
You follow carefully first
Report immediately if there is any special situation

308
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,525
I heard that Zheng Hu went out.

309
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,236
He moves faster than expected.
Are you going too?

310
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,529
You must go

311
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,518
(Chuncheon Interchange, Chuncheon, Wonju, Hongcheon)

312
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,488
Well, tell me.

313
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,572
Okay, senior.

314
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:47,119
The team leader's car
On the highway to Chuncheon

315
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,080
OK, I got it

316
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,624
Don't be distracted, you must follow him well

317
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,875
I'm leaving now.

318
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,482
But is it okay to let him go like this?
I don't know where he's going.

319
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,359
He must be meeting someone.

320
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,861
I'll follow soon, wait for me

321
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,946
- Don't lose me.
- OK

322
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,423
You came really early

323
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,300
Hello, Brother

324
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,470
When I heard you were coming
I've been waiting for you here.

325
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,180
You are so good

326
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,817
Mayor Kim

327
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,944
Have you ever hunted here?

328
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,656
I've only hunted pheasants a few times.

329
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,866
And you?

330
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,951
This is my land, of course I come here often to hunt.

331
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,330
By the way, there are sometimes wild boars here.

332
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,501
Aim for the top of the boar's head and heart

333
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,377
shot

334
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,091
Young people nowadays are crazy about golf

335
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,967
But it's nothing like hunting

336
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,387
Hunting is the most primitive instinct of human beings.

337
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:34,309
I'll find an opportunity later
Let you experience that feeling

338
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,104
Please remove the green belt designation immediately.

339
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:41,650
I didn't buy this land to hunt wild boars.

340
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,819
Oh, please wait a little longer.

341
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,280
Soon here will be
Cover highways and rest stops

342
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,949
Green belt designation will also be lifted

343
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,326
I'm thinking about you too.

344
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,161
I want you to hunt more wild boars.

345
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,999
Thank you for your thoughtfulness, but don't put it off until this year

346
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,816
- Hit the target every time
- That's amazing.

347
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,985
- Let's take pictures
- good

348
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,070
- no problem
- Um

349
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,324
- Come on, let's take a photo
- Um

350
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,535
very good

351
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,453
1.2

352
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,819
Yes, senior

353
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,614
He had just parked his car in a
Behind the SUV, and then got out

354
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,617
I feel like I'm here to meet someone.

355
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,328
What now?
Should I wait here or follow?

356
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,425
Hmm? What's the problem?

357
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,385
Brother, green belt

358
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,054
It's not like a belt that can be untied.

359
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,806
I'm not unblocking

360
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,099
Just follow the process

361
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,935
What process? I don't care about that.

362
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,854
Please wait a little longer.

363
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,481
Oh, that one is so pretty.

364
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,155
Get down!

366
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,618
Wake up, bro.

367
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,703
What's going on?

368
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,129
Hello, this is the reed field in Shangdi
Please send an ambulance.

369
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,880
good

370
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,299
It's a gunshot wound

371
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,384
Yes, hurry up!

What's wrong with you?

376
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,489
I've called an ambulance, just hold on.

377
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,994
Did you survive?

378
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,204
What's the meaning?

379
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,040
victim

380
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,711
Did you survive?

381
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,296
Which victim?

382
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,759
I couldn't stop

383
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,806
I wanted to stop it.

384
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,312
The result failed

385
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,691
Who did you fail to stop?

386
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,027
Who are you trying to protect by doing this?

387
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,533
Sorry, Hanquan

388
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,162
Bro, you've done this.
What is it for?

389
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,831
Why on earth would you go to such lengths?

390
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,210
All this

391
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,548
It's all because of me

392
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,718
What's the meaning?

393
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,179

They're all assholes

398
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,112
They are indeed bastards.

399
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,077
But all this

400
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,458
But it's all because of me

401
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,340
It's not the kid's fault.

402
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,010
Who is that child?

He looked like he had something to say.

412
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,522
Maybe we really
We should get someone from the news department here.

"Ruizhen"

415
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,184
This is the last thing Zheng Hu said.

416
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,107
We are late again this time.

417
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,904
Next, we will take the initiative to force the criminals to act.

Wu Zhejin works for Chengjin Construction

426
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,311
Is that related to the death of Lee Gang Hyun?

427
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,897
But Lee Gang Hyun is from Myeongseong Daily

428
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,610
Why do I feel like I've heard it somewhere before?

429
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,239
OK, victim human rights businessman, 58 years old

430
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,533
Former Attorney General, currently a consultant at the First Law Firm

431
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,744
The victim loved hunting.

432
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,330
The criminal seemed to know this.

433
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,541
I can only think so

434
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,420
However, Liang Zhenghu

435
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,464
How did they know in advance where the criminal would commit the crime?

436
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,383
Could he have tracked the criminal's location?

437
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,595
We didn't find the team leader's cell phone at the scene.

438
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,181
It seems to have been taken by the criminal.

439
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,143
Then we have to find the cell phone of Team Leader Liang Zhenghu first.

440
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,687
What did Mayor Yangchuan, who was present at the time, say?

441
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,439
According to Mayor Jin Mouyi

442
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,026
Team leader Liang Zhenghu suddenly
Fire a gun into the air, then charge forward

443
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,402
Rushing towards the direction of Quan Shangfan

444
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,781
Jin Mouyi was so frightened when he saw that scene that he ran away

445
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,407
Where did he get the gun?

446
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,163
I'm sorry, I can't defend myself.

447
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,461
Who is guarding the door of Quan Shangfan's ward now?

448
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,754
Hello, everyone!
This is DBC's Nine O'Clock News

00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,180
It's a murder case happening in Seoul.

452
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:45,516

Decision to safeguard public interest

453

456
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,027
Next, let's talk about the details with reporter Hong Chengmin

457
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,656
Currently there is a
A mysterious case straight out of a movie

458
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,242
- These puzzles are made by murderers
- Who is this guy?

459
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,994
- Left behind after killing the victim
- Who is it?

460
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,996
Who are the victims of this series of murders?

461
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,372
Which bastard leaked it?

462
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,333
You can now see the puzzle pieces on the screen.

463
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,418
There are six pieces in total

464
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,170
There were also six victims...

465
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,422
Do you want to use a jigsaw puzzle?

466
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,550
The criminal keeps killing people because he has something to say.

467
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,677
Then we should pass on the microphone

468
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,222
So you know who is speaking.

469
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,849
Isn’t this what Team Leader Liang Zhenghu wants?

470
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,018
There must be some reason.

471
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,229
He would ask for someone from the News Department.

472
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,530
(Yin Yiluo)

473
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,032

00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,077
The puzzle arrived

475
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,120
What?

476
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,248
Wait, wait for me.

477
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,802
Hey, Quan Shangfan is still alive.

478
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,595
You turn on the TV.

479
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:12,270
Yesterday our station reported
Jigsaw puzzle provided by anonymous tipster

480
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:16,190
Earlier, our news department received another piece of the puzzle

481
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,527
It was a puzzle sent directly by the prisoner.

482
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,239
Considering the seriousness of the incident

483

Nothing happened here.
What is going on?

488

Is it somewhere...

489
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,384
What's that sound?

490
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,055
Mr. Quan Shangfan

491
