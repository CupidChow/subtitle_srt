1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You can't stay in this company this year.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All interns can't stay.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't want to either. Sorry.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What you said is all nonsense. I don't want to hear it again.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I thought you were a good person.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No. It's the first lesson in social college.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There are no good people in this world.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Remember this feeling. The more you experience it, the more you know what you want.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The more you know your position.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're not in this office.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll give you an answer.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
First, this job is not a job.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your salary is only high-end documents and computer maintenance fees in accounting.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Second, you only have one boss.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No matter how ridiculous my order is, you have to obey.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Third, you can't tell anyone about your job.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If you break the confidentiality agreement, you'll be fired immediately.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There are many kinds of men. The most important thing is to find a suitable position for yourself.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There are high and low people. The most important thing is to find a suitable position for yourself.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then, where is my work place?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The whole room is yours.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello, everyone. I'm the news director of SNK, Gu Zhao Hua.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Welcome to the special program, News is All Confined.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Was the news just now shocking?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Many people are wondering why our colleagues left and appeared again.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why don't you let them tell us?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Wen Hui Xin.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Long time no see. I'm Liang Jing Ren.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We should start with Mr. Liang Jing Ren's private meeting.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I received a lot of opinions from the audience.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They said they were reluctant to leave this good partner on the screen.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But it's a pity that Mr. Liang Jing Ren has already left us.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Only pain and longing are left.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But the need for SNK to accompany Hong Kong people to go through half a century of transformation

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is the motivation for our progress.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, we use technology to turn impossible into possible.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Our production team has put the news materials in the database for the past ten years

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
into the computer for more than 50,000 hours of recording and recording.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a very realistic AI anchor.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
With the appearance, voice, and tone,

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
even the micro expression, we try to restore the real person.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's more realistic than the real person.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
AI anchor is not a new thing.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But using AI to re-enact the missing news workers

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
is the first time in Hong Kong and even the world.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Breaking through time, space, and the dimension of life and death

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
is a classic legend, and will be passed on forever.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let the anime and manga roots

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
keep moving forward acting as old analogs.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Getting ready to open

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello everyone, in the hot Zone,

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
SNK has become the world's leading brand with AI.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a super hit!

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The first company to use AI like this

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is like the first person to eat crabs.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a genius.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Imagine if AI was as old as a star,

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and used this essence.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now there's a discount code.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hurry up and buy it!

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
AI will be the center of attention.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Not only will it be the news,

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but it will also be the next benchmark for entertainment.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
In the future,

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
we will see

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
AI actors and AI singers

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
looking forward to it.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm Tang Zhi Yao.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's only one focus in the stock market today.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
AI concept.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The SNK stock market is on the rise.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Everyone knows that I was born in the SNK.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've always been a big fan of the Niang family.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I've always told everyone that I can be a part of it.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Usually, there are fans who are obedient.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Tonight, we can add food to celebrate.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of course, the rise is related to the media ecosystem.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Some famous anchors are always in the office politics.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
High-profile resignation and high-profile pay.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're just an anchor, not a protagonist.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
On the contrary, AI anchors are absolutely obedient.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The cost of the editor is low to zero.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So I'm very optimistic about the future of SNK.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
After all, the gold brand is a guarantee of good luck.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm really not afraid of the rise.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're going against the rules. You also buy SNK.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What? I'm talking about risk-adjustment.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I earn some foreign currency to open a public platform.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then you don't have to buy the stock of SNK.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is it really rising?

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sister Man.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sister Man.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You also believe what Tang Zhiyou said?

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He has enough money. Even the black can be said to be white.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Not only him. All big KOLs are on the side and look at SNK.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now everyone treats AI as a toy.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They all come to make money.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No one asked if it was dangerous. It will happen sooner or later.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
SNK has a poll report saying that 80% of the people support them.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But all those questions are very biased.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And deliberately bring the wind to attack the net media.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Especially our open platform.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's obvious that someone spent money to create trouble.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When all the wind blows in the same direction.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You have to ask where the wind came from.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It must be them who spent money to find someone to do it.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You give me a hand.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He said it would still rise.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have lived for a long time.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have never used fake goods.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You are doing this in my SNK?

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
When Mrs. Fang invited me to SNK.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you remember what you told me?

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You told me you wanted to try new things.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You want me to be disobedient.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You want me to do things that other companies don't dare to do.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
As long as I can make money and have a good life.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can play around.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have done the above.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I didn't expect you to be so ignorant.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then I will say now.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can't do it anymore.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay?

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can pretend I didn't hear it.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But if Mrs. Fang wants to live hard.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You don't have to invite me.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Invite milk tea to fly back.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I remember my duty.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You invited me back.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Just want to force you to change yourself.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You are afraid that SNK will lie in bed for too long.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Too comfortable.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Become a big fat.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
When the times change.

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He can't turn around.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I am in this line.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm famous for not listening to the instructor.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are willing to take me in.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Prove it.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You want me to stay.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hold on to SNK.

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's the matter?

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
To turn around?

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There are many people online.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There must be a counter-message.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let you see the praise.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How much money did you spend to find crystal white?

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Am I so low?

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't spend this kind of money.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If you don't believe the netizens.

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then believe the ancient people.

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The real gold and silver supports us.

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How much do you think SNK has earned?

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't report it later.

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We are the news.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We hate to be caught.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I know.

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Can I sit down?

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But there is one thing.

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Need to talk to Mrs. Fang.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's the matter of A.A.I.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I told everyone.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You know it in advance.

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And agree.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You want me to be disobedient?

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm obedient.

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Mrs. Fang needs to drink tea.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Please enjoy.

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Go, go.

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Eat.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What do you say?

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Black pine road is expensive and difficult to buy.

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not the French.

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They monopolize the whole market.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The market.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Have resources.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The price is good.

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's cheap to feed pigs.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The price is increasing.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,880
It's always the

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
A.A.I.

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's good.

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This topic can be discussed again.

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The price can still rise.

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Just make a door and bring the wind.

187
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The leek is easy to cut.

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mr. Liu.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Bosses.

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Sorry, I'm late.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You are finally here.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You know how to do it.

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You are late.

194
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I want to make the makeup better.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And more beautiful.

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
See you bosses.

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm late.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll drink first.

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Great.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Great.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you know why I talk to him?

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He is very talkative.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Because I am like him.

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I have a grudge against Wen Hui Xi.

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You have a beauty to accompany you.

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We can only eat by ourselves.

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Not good.

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So many net celebrities under your hand.

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
When will you call them out?

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I know these very well.

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In short, those net celebrities.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Little sister.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Just spend money.

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But now sitting on the same table.

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's a good chance to make money together.

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Am I right?

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Mr. Liu, you are really good at coaxing people.

218
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Actually, I want to thank you bosses.

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Willing to take you to play together.

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Come on, I toast to everyone.

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Wish you all the best.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Good.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Ask SNK to hand over the investigation report to AI anchor.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Explain the operation of the back module.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Government interferes with private companies.

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You want to hurt me.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Of course not.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I just think that AI's future development has unlimited potential.

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If we don't repair it now.

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's not our turn to control it in the future.

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So I think we should report as soon as possible.

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
YT, director of the creative science and technology department.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you know what project is going on recently?

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Digital transformation.

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Co-development of the creative science and technology department.

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No.

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's me who works with the news department.

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But it's normal that you don't know.

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You are not qualified to participate.

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's an AI news expert.

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If you understand.

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's you who go to talk, not me.

243
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
AI news expert.

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
To be honest.

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Half of the revenue of SNK in recent years comes from Wen Huixin.

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I never doubted your ability.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But if Wen Huixin is no longer the only one.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't see any advantages of the public platform.

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The whole investment value will fall.

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't worry, Diana.

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We are dealing with it.

252
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Ok.

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We will talk about the contract after you are done.

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ok.

255
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The contract is to stop the investment?

256
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will stop it first.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Their share price will fall like that.

258
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's normal that the emotional market will fluctuate.

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's not necessarily because of us.

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How to explain to the shareholders?

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Every investment is money.

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why should we invest in the first one?

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The first one that will drag the company's share price.

264
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We need money in every way.

265
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So we can invite people to the new place to exchange equipment.

266
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't we need to think about it?

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Sister Man.

268
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Can you ask how long the capital can be kept?

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's ok.

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Anyway, I will give you the salary for this month.

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's all?

272
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I will help you.

273
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't worry.

274
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How can we care about money?

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I will keep it in my heart.

277
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Lawyer Shao.

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Actually, the most urgent thing now is how to make SNK stop using AI Man.

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is there any way?

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because AI is too new, there are too few cases.

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
There are similar cases in the United States.

282
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you really fight with them, it may be helpful.

283
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But the most important point is that you have no money to fight.

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's true that capital is the master of everything.

285
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wei Liuyan.

286
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How about talking to your master privately?

287
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I think we should accept the fact that people will change.

288
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Actually, it's not a bad thing to recognize a person's true face.

289
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Power really makes people corrupt.

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sister Man.

291
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's great, but you don't have to be so narcissistic.

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You always say that AI is like me.

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Where is the most like?

294
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Did you notice?

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I didn't notice.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Face, voice, small actions are all like.

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, it's the manuscript.

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The whole rhythm is 80% or 90% similar to me.

299
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Even the words are learned from my essence.

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
These are not done by AI.

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There must be a master behind it.

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
There must be a master behind it.

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
No editor, no editor.

304
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's just a new AI production team.

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Jiayan or Kingston?

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It must not be Jiayan.

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He is so stubborn.

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's the same as his manuscript.

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's not like me.

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Kingston doesn't have to say it.

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They must have hired a master.

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
SNK is the most promising in the future.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Maybe this person.

314
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I bought it for you.

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's right.

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm alone when I get home.

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's better to work overtime in the company.

318
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Try to get a promotion, right?

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It was the same in SNK.

320
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I was used to it when I went back to work after finishing the hard work with George.

321
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's right.

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm used to it.

323
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm used to it.

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm used to it.

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's too late.

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's right.

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You made me work overtime many times.

328
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You don't have to be so worried.

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let alone that time.

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Now working overtime is also because of you.

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The matter of AI anchor is not only affecting the news industry.

332
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It has a great impact on the whole of Hong Kong.

333
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You are against SNK.

334
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They are targeted.

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
George is not here.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You didn't let him go.

337
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's really too much.

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What?

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You come to work so late.

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do you need my help?

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Just tell me.

342
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's not you helping me.

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's me helping you.

344
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This time, George and I just used it to test the water temperature.

345
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We don't know when we will push the new AI anchor to come out.

346
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm just doing the news.

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What are you afraid of?

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But you know your situation.

349
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You are the one who has the most dark history.

350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you become an AI anchor,

351
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Wang Wei will wait for you to leave every day.

352
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think it will be difficult for you to get promoted.

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I give you the face to call me sister Man.

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But please make it clear.

355
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This is my main factory.

356
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You are the guest.

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you really need my help,

358
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
please be polite.

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay.

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's not talk about who helps who.

361
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's talk about cooperation.

362
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can use the name of the news agency

363
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
to hold some AI forums with overseas institutions.

364
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You are not my superior anymore.

365
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I have my own way.

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If you are interested, wait to read the newspaper.

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The public official can't take advantage of you.

368
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Here is the money.

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's all for the selection meeting.

370
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Today, many of the selection topics are very deep.

371
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Very good.

372
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And,

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
the director said that the AI anchor was very successful.

374
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He wants to invite everyone to celebrate.

375
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Everyone has a share.

376
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I have a question.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What?

378
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Will you use AI anchor tonight?

379
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Will you all use AI anchor in the future?

380
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
If you have an email, you should know to read the schedule.

381
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Sister Man taught us that

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
no matter what,

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
we should give the client a chance to respond positively.

384
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Okay.

385
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I will tell you.

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes.

387
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
My colleagues and I don't agree with this approach.

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
My colleagues and I don't agree with this approach.

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This is an insult to the professional anchor.

390
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You don't need to tell me if you agree or not.

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In fact, this world

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
will not satisfy you with every single thing.

393
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You can continue drinking your tea,

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
but you can't manage the coffee shop.

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's full of stores.

396
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Times turn.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Only the testers can survive.

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's not up to me.

399
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Then I'm sorry.

400
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I can't accept it.

401
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes.

402
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I can't decide or change.

403
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But I can choose.

404
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If any of my colleagues have the same feeling as me,

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
we can resign together.

406
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You resign in time.

407
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You have to pay a month's salary.

408
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:20,600
The

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll insist that

410
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
the proof or not,

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the first excuse or the first a thousand excuses

412
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I won't kick you out.

413
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
If economy isn't good,

414
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
sheres can't be called sales.

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's more important to keep our jobs.

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,320
or by my watch?

417
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,960
Furthermore,

418
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,800
your nodigity

419
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,840
is not insufficient.

420
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,320
I was very

421
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
wronged.

422
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
I did not expect

423
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,720
to be fooled by someone else.

424
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
I admire your courage.

425
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
I mean it.

426
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
But leaving

427
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
won't bring any change.

428
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Changing jobs is just changing prisons.

429
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
It's all prisons.

430
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
No difference.

431
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
This industry is very narrow.

432
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Good luck to you.

433
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Do your job.

434
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I will survive.

435
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
I will survive.

436
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Sister Man,

437
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
you don't have to worry.

438
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Just say it.

439
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
First of all,

440
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
I admire you.

441
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
But she is the founder

442
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
and the deputy director of the public platform.

443
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
We won't mind.

444
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
The public platform.

445
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I believe everyone here

446
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
is fair and equal.

447
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
But maybe I will be a little guilty.

448
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Second,

449
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
you left for me.

450
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
There is no way out.

451
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
I have to invite you.

452
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
The east is not bright, the west is bright.

453
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Don't feel sorry for Sister Man.

454
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
You don't owe us.

455
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Third,

456
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
I can't find more excuses.

457
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Just one thing.

458
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
We have no money.

459
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Sister Man, we didn't expect it.

460
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Let's spend time together.

461
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
We have no time.

462
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Then you said

463
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
after you get on the track,

464
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I will give you an extra 20%.

465
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Thank you, Sister Man.

466
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Make it clear.

467
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
If you make a mistake, you will be scolded.

468
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
We are not used to it if you don't scold us.

469
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
We can start work at any time.

470
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
By the way,

471
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I really want to ask you something.

472
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
AI production team.

473
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Who wrote those drafts?

474
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Usually, their drafts are all released

475
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,720
through Shuitang, Kingston and Jiayan.

476
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
The company recently invited new people

477
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
and formed a new team.

478
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
I don't know who it is.

479
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Shuitang?

480
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
It's the one on the internet.

481
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
These people are from the company.

482
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Thank you, Liu Yan.

483
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
When do you usually go to work?

484
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
You see my accounts are everywhere.

485
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Keep everything under父.

486
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
The rythm works.

487
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
When there is misunderstanding,

488
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
rich people buy a lot.

489
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Sizzle is enjoyable when people ask for more.

490
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
We want to become protected.

491
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
The people who mortify

492
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,020
for our progress

493
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,220
have good reputation.

494
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
хочу

495
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Say it.

496
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
You are natural as well as human.

497
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
and left-handers.

498
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,120
But if I want to be an AI sister,

499
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,600
or even an AI flying wild,

500
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,320
I have to keep going.

501
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,120
You saved the whole company

502
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,960
for the second time.

503
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,000
You have a subordinate?

504
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,160
A technician.

505
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,200
Sister Jiayin,

506
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,120
I'm Buck.

507
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,000
Hi.

508
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,600
Sister Jiayin,

509
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,040
I have something to talk to you.

510
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
The contract list

511
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,800
and the AI team,

512
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,560
can you give us all the details?

513
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,160
You agreed to take this job

514
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,120
because you didn't mind.

515
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,840
Actually, this is to ensure that

516
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,360
you won't be charged with legal responsibility.

517
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,200
Besides,

518
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,200
someone will misunderstand you.

519
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,520
They'll blame you for being an AI anchor,

520
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,440
for destroying the news,

521
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,280
and for being selfish.

522
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,400
I know. I know.

523
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,480
I know.

524
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,760
When you feel very unhappy

525
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,960
and want to give up,

526
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
you have to think about

527
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,080
why you wanted to be a reporter.

528
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
So you have to

529
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
hold on to your original intention of being a news reporter.

530
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
All the efforts you've put in won't go to waste.

531
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,040
At least I saw it.

532
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Xiao Tian is actually

533
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
much better than many people.

534
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,960
See how much you've done.

535
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,760
Sister Jiayin,

536
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,960
thank you.

537
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,160
I won't let you down.

538
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,160
I'll keep doing it.

539
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Thank you.

540
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,360
In the dark

541
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Silent and cold

542
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Layers of white eyes

543
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,360
They couldn't bind my soul

544
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,360
Then came the sunlight

545
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,360
It lit up the shadows

546
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,360
I start to grow

547
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,360
My fantastic tale unfolds

548
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,360
But then all good times had been spent

549
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,360
My love seemed to come to an end

550
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Another story once again started again

551
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,360
As I fly

552
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Fly as a clock in the candlelight

553
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
When you say goodbye

554
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm on your side

555
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Please don't cry

556
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,360
After my part in this precious time

557
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Did I do anything wrong?

558
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Or

559
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Still living my life

560
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Would you look down on me?

561
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Isn't AI very advanced?

562
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
It won't talk if it's not done.

563
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
News is about who's faster.

564
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
No one is more unique in a second.

565
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
AI is just a step ahead.

566
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Dangerous

567
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,360
It's not more dangerous to run in the typhoon.

568
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
News is dangerous.

569
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Respect your will.

570
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
If I'm the one who dies

571
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
You're the one who decides.

572
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Don't tell me you won't push ANI Zhang Jiayan out.

573
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
With your character

574
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
At least ten times more to break the gap.

575
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Right?

576
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
AI anchor will not be absent.

577
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Live broadcast will not make mistakes.

578
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,360
The anchors will not fight for the prime.

579
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,360
Do you want the audience to think independently?

580
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Don't you want to be a star anchor?

581
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,360
All of these are the reforms that Sister Man has been wanting to do.

582
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Real and authentic, self-written.

583
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Super Ego is complete.

584
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
How could it be wrong?

585
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
It would be once again, Li Feelian.

586
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Stop drinking.

587
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Give me one.

588
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Please.

589
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Listen up, everyone.

590
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,920
the online version of the app

591
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,520
and ask Xiao Wen online.

592
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,520
Then Xiao Wen

593
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
will find the answer

594
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
in the database of the newspaper.

595
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,360
Okay.

596
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,520
Please support her, okay?

597
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
Okay.

598
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,600
Thank you.

599
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,240
Come on.

600
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,880
Hurry up.

601
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,560
Hurry up.

602
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,480
Hurry up.

603
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,640
Come on.

604
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
That's my performance.

605
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,640
Dance.

606
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,440
Come on.

607
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,600
Sun Wujing

608
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,840
Making of

609
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:15,960
planetary chopping

610
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,540
Thesem questions

611
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,400
I'll go personally

612
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,880
Announce you

613
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,520
Yes

614
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,160
What Amber

615
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,900
Yes

616
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,180
Find the case of grabbing

617
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,740
WhoNet

618
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,280
How many tons

619
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,200
And what's the country's weight

620
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,700
Yes

621
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,300
Prepare a 100-400mm lens.

622
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,100
Roger.

623
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,420
Check online if anyone has posted a video.

624
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,500
If there is, buy it for free.

625
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,900
Roger.

626
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,780
Remember to bargain.

627
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,260
Roger.

628
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,700
Hey, Hai Chi, let's go.

629
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,700
Every time,

630
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,220
he comes to work as soon as he eats.

631
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,900
After the five-day news is over,

632
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,940
we will do a live broadcast.

633
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,900
Michael, live broadcast.

634
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,180
Jingting, live broadcast. Go.

635
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,060
Wait.

636
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,940
Today, I want to do a new try.

637
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,220
Michael, you go live.

638
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,820
But you don't have to do a live broadcast.

639
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,940
Jingting is in the office.

640
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,340
I want to use all the broadcasts this time.

641
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,980
What should I do?

642
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,780
Just A.I. man is on the scene.

643
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,540
A.I. George is the anchor.

644
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,980
We haven't tried A.I. interview.

645
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,020
Is it from the chicken roll?

646
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,460
So we have to try it.

647
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,900
Michael is on the scene.

648
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,420
Who will you make contact with?

649
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,380
A.I.

650
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,060
Talk or notebook?

651
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,860
One is not clear, one is not fast.

652
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,980
Take both.

653
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,780
What about the one in the data?

654
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,380
Take it. Take it. Take it all.

655
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,020
What about the other one?

656
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,140
No need. No need.

657
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,700
No. No. No.

658
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,060
Take it together. Take it together.

659
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,860
Let's go. Let's go.

660
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,380
You can go after finishing this article.

661
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,140
Okay. Let's go.

662
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,420
Go.

663
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,060
drop the district

664
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,420
The police have blocked the investigation

665
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,940
of the nearby sea area.

666
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,540
If there is further information,

667
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,420
we will continue to follow up.

668
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,100
Just shoot me for a while.

669
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,860
Keep your back to the ground.

670
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,340
The gold will stay here.

671
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,020
Prepare for the press conference later.

672
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,420
San, go to take a photo for the interview.

673
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,460
Take some photos.

674
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,460
Yes, Sister Man.

675
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,380
Thank you.

676
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,460
Sister Man,

677
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,260
you came to the scene because you didn't believe the message?

678
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,460
You think too much.

679
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,900
Because I'm close to the police.

680
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,460
Interviewing and information.

681
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,900
These are the advantages of the experience at the scene.

682
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,580
Hello, friends of the media.

683
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,100
The police arrived at the scene at 1.13 this afternoon.

684
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,980
There was an explosion on the sea of Qigong.

685
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,340
It is estimated to be a rare bomb explosion.

686
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,420
We have sent a diver to investigate the situation.

687
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,580
It is confirmed that

688
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,500
three bombs were found in the east of Shinezhou,

689
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,540
at the sea of the first generation.

690
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,860
Each bomb is about 1.5 meters long.

691
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,580
It's time for the media to question.

692
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,500
Miss Wen Huixin.

693
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,580
Hello, Mr. Zhu.

694
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,260
Three questions.

695
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,020
How powerful are the bombs?

696
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,180
Will there be any more threats of explosions?

697
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,860
How will the police handle it?

698
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,820
The three bombs are of the same type.

699
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,780
The gunpowder is still in the final stage.

700
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,580
I don't know if there are any explosions.

701
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,340
Our explosion processing team

702
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,220
will detonate underwater when necessary.

703
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,300
Will it further expand the range of coastal blockade?

704
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,380
And if three bombs detonate together,

705
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,540
will it cause a sea fire?

706
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,460
No additional information for now.

707
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,900
How is the current situation?

708
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,100
Say a few more words, okay?

709
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,660
Mr. Zhu.

710
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,860
Maggie went to the scene.

711
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,060
The reporter couldn't ask anything.

712
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,020
Sam, the information.

713
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,980
So nervous.

714
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,940
You don't understand the situation

715
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,340
between the police and the media.

716
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,460
Look at the material.

717
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,260
Then explain it to me.

718
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,900
The police won't tell the next step

719
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,620
to every media.

720
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,500
So they will find a long-term partner

721
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,020
to be the most experienced and friendly media

722
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,420
to release the news and represent.

723
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,460
The other media will follow up.

724
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,500
If you become this representative,

725
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,900
you can know the deployment earlier.

726
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,460
That's Wen Huixin.

727
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,820
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

728
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
It's been a long time.

729
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,420
I thought you were in charge.

730
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,300
You didn't have to come out.

731
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,260
How could a tiger change its food?

732
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,220
After it's over,

733
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,100
I will give an interview to the explosive processing department.

734
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,340
And take a big picture.

735
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,180
Then the C position must be you.

736
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,900
You are not enough in the picture.

737
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,780
If every media is like you,

738
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,980
I will be relieved.

739
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,220
I'm not afraid of you.

740
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,260
I'm not afraid of you.

741
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
I'm not afraid of you.

742
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
I'm not afraid of you.

743
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I'm not afraid of you.

744
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
I'm not afraid of you.

745
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
I'm not afraid of you.

746
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,180
Thank you for helping me.

747
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,140
Thank you.

748
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,540
Thank you.

749
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,540
Thank you.

750
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
Thank you.

751
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Thank you.

752
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
Thank you.

753
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,860
Three minutes for the live.

754
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,180
Is the AI mode ready?

755
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,180
Can you do it?

756
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
I think it's ready.

757
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,300
Can you be more confident?

758
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,380
I'm very nervous, brother.

759
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,580
I'm nervous, too.

760
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,420
I've never done such a big live before.

761
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,260
The two guys in the AI just learned to climb.

762
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,180
They don't even know how to walk.

763
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,780
But they are in charge of such a big live.

764
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,900
I'm not confident.

765
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Don't worry.

766
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,500
What about the professional news?

767
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,220
Only professionals

768
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,100
can see the professional side of things.

769
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,340
Not even the audience.

770
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,620
They can only tell

771
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,900
whether it's good or not.

772
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,060
I don't agree.

773
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,140
But I won't argue with you now.

774
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,900
There's no need.

775
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,180
Sister Mian, here's your mic.

776
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,140
Thank you.

777
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,620
Look.

778
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,300
SNK's live broadcast.

779
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,100
Let's do our own thing.

780
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,180
We have to be faster than SNK.

781
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,260
Ready.

782
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,300
Three.

783
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,380
Two.

784
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,580
Welcome to the public platform.

785
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,420
I'm Liu Yan.

786
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,820
This is the live report

787
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,220
of the reporter Wen Huixin.

788
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,900
The exclusive news we just received.

789
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,980
Three bombs

790
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,740
were found at the bottom of the sea.

791
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,500
They are of the same type.

792
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,580
They are all A&M-65

793
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,940
American air-to-air bombs.

794
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,500
Each weighs 500 pounds.

795
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,660
Two of them, I believe,

796
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,580
have been used up.

797
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,140
The police officer said

798
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,860
three 1.5-meter-long bombs

799
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,140
were found at the bottom of the sea.

800
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,820
According to many military experts,

801
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,620
the photos show the bombs.

802
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,900
The American air-to-air bombs

803
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,260
were found at the second war.

804
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,340
We can't confirm the actual weight.

805
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,220
According to the informant,

806
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,220
the police will detonate

807
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,260
the remaining bombs in half an hour.

808
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,180
We are faster than SNK.

809
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,220
We'll win the first round.

810
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,740
You're slow.

811
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,220
Do you need my help?

812
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,100
Director.

813
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,460
Or do you want to continue?

814
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,140
Take a step.

815
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,980
AI team, find the information.

816
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,580
Tell us the history.

817
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,780
Which bombs have been found in Hong Kong?

818
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,060
Find out the news of the Hong Kong bomb this year.

819
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,940
In fact, Hong Kong

820
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,340
has found the bombs

821
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,940
left before the war many times.

822
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,140
According to the record,

823
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,180
in 2014,

824
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,860
the Queen of Wan Zai

825
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,580
used a large force

826
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,220
to dig out a 2,000-pound bomb

827
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,660
and used it to detonate

828
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,300
the most powerful air-to-air bomb

829
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,100
found in the city.

830
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,660
In 2018,

831
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,580
the Wan Zai station

832
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,940
also found a 1,000-pound bomb.

833
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,580
Man, you're so smart.

834
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,140
You're faster than a computer.

835
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,820
Usually, the bomb found in the city

836
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,220
is used by the bomb experts

837
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,900
in the EOD department.

838
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,780
But now,

839
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,860
the bomb is used to detonate

840
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,660
the Wan Zai station.

841
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,220
Hey, this is the West Palace.

842
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,700
Why are you suddenly talking about

843
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,860
the Hong Kong-island blockade?

844
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,900
Only those who know the information

845
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,460
will not know the specific situation of the scene.

846
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,740
Good.

847
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,460
Do you know how to improve the A.I.?

848
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,180
I believe the police will

849
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,300
handle it in a way that is controlled and reported.

850
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,900
What's the situation at the scene?

851
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,100
Too much information.

852
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,540
The computer is getting dizzy.

853
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,060
What should we do?

854
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,180
Oh, game over.

855
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,780
Listen up, everyone.

856
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,540
I'm King Sir.

857
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,980
I'm going back to the studio.

858
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,100
Dennis, get ready.

859
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,220
Give the scene to Michael.

860
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,740
Michael, take it.

861
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,300
The scene is reported at any time.

862
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,260
But the water is still not over.

863
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,300
I'll write it down.

864
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,260
Tell Michael to stay for two minutes.

865
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,780
Yes.

866
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,460
Brian, lend me the computer.

867
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,140
The police bomb disposal unit,

868
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,860
the Flying Tiger Team, the Water Ghost Team,

869
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,140
the Small Barrier Team,

870
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,740
the North Water Police Division,

871
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,580
and the Water Police UAV Team

872
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,420
have been killed.

873
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,020
The program is not responding.

874
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,180
The server should have crashed.

875
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,220
This battle

876
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,500
is really miserable.

877
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,740
Maggie,

878
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,420
the SNK signal is broken.

879
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,420
Stop the live broadcast.

880
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,580
Does he see us?

881
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,200
Guys,

882
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,500
I'm here to help you.

883
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,740
Yes.

884
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,040
Just like a real man.

885
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,020
I'm so confused.

886
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,020
I found a mirror

887
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,020
somewhere in my heart.

888
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,020
Beautiful, it's beautiful

889
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:19,020
deep inside my heart.

890
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,020
Try to brighten up your eyes

891
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,020
cause the truth will never lie.

892
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,020
Just wipe away and make it clear

893
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,020
in my mind.

894
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,020
It's our just you have got to try

895
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,020
cause the truth will never die.

896
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:56,020
For always, all the way, all the time.

897
