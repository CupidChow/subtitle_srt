1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Man, we've lost our income from advertising this month.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
We might not have enough money to pay rent.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800
I know that there's a press conference for the tech giant Edison Tech.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,400
The most promising fund managers and investors in the entire China will attend.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,000
You can then sell the platform.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Man, look at this.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,800
Look over here.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,000
So pretty, Man.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,800
Yes, look over here. Thank you.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Look to your left.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,200
Thank you.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,000
Mrs. Fang is here.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,200
Hello.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
Man and Mrs. Fang are so big today.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,400
Why don't you come closer and take a picture?

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Yes, did you two discuss it beforehand?

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,600
Are you the same designer?

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,000
Look at the camera in the middle. Thank you.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,200
Look to your left. Thank you.

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Thank you.

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,600
I've been wearing this brand for over 30 years.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,800
I never thought I'd wear it like this.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,200
Times have changed.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,600
Different times have different ways of wearing.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
You're laughing at me for being conservative. I have to say it too.

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Wearing clothes is a matter of virtue.

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
If you blindly follow the trends,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,400
you'll harm yourself and the brand.

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200
You have to try something new to be worthy of the audience.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,000
The audience's eyes are the brightest. Did you teach them?

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,200
People have to be able to wear clothes. The point is to look good.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
Thank you. Thank you.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,800
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,800
But this designer, I'll blacken her up in the future.

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
No matter how good she is,

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000
if she leaves the brand, there's no value.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,800
No one knows the future.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,200
I look forward to creating another high-end.

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,600
Look at you. You're even getting married.

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
Is your work hard?

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,800
Don't ruin your health just because you're angry.

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm fine, Sister.

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Why are your hands so cold?

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
You've been very tired lately. You can't sleep well?

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll introduce you to a Chinese doctor.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
A specialist who can't sleep.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Of course, a Chinese doctor should look at the screen often.

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
It's an experienced old man.

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Now, there are some new people who are in the industry.

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,400
They work in the Tang building, the repair shop, and the next door store.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
I can't rely on them.

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
It's good that you're not old.

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
A good doctor is a good doctor.

54
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,400
But once you're famous, it's hard to get back.

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,600
You really have to be careful.

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,400
The new media battlefield is definitely the Internet.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,400
The transmission speed is fast, the network is fast, the cost is low,

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,800
the global interaction is strong, and the market size continues to grow.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,800
So investing in our public platform is not a choice you'll regret.

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,040
ثر

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,240
What?

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
What are you doing, my co-worker?

63
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,400
You aren't welcome here. Security guard!

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
I'll leave.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
I scared you.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
So, Diana is not only an inventor and entrepreneur,

69
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
but also a fighter.

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Open the platform.

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
I'll read your letter.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
You should have left earlier.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
SNK is so stupid.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
That bastard was a regular.

75
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
What does it have to do with me being the owner?

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
I can't tell you.

77
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Now I understand

78
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
why people outside call you

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
the female version of Nikola Tesla.

80
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
I'm not.

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Tesla doesn't do business.

82
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
A great inventor of a exchange store,

83
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
he actually defeated Edison

84
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
because of the words of the electronic dog.

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
He doesn't do marketing.

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
So, your company is called Edison?

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Edison is also controversial.

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I'd rather others call me

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
the female version of Iron Man.

90
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Is it more handsome?

91
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I should go on stage.

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
I like you, Wen Huixin.

93
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
We'll talk after the party.

94
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Do you have time to make an appointment?

95
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Okay.

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
The new energy car battery launch is about to start.

97
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Please come in.

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
The new energy car battery launch is about to start.

99
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Please come in.

100
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Thank you.

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Thank you.

102
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Thank you.

103
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Thank you.

104
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Thank you.

105
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Thank you.

106
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Thank you.

107
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Thank you.

108
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Thank you.

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Thank you.

110
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Thank you.

111
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Thank you.

112
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Welcome to Edison Tech's press conference.

113
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm the CEO of Edison Tech,

114
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Diana.

115
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Einstein once said

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
there are two things in this world

117
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
that are infinite.

118
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
The first one

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
is the universe.

120
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
The second one

121
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
is the stupidity of mankind.

122
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
But I think

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
the third one

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
is the wisdom of mankind.

125
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
From the fire of mankind

126
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
one million years ago

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
to the present,

128
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
the power of mankind,

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
every invention we've experienced

130
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
is a display of wisdom.

131
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm honored to introduce to you

132
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
the latest and most groundbreaking product

133
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
of Edison Tech.

134
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
The smallest

135
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
battery car.

136
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Hello.

137
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Hello.

138
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
We're all here.

139
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Can you sign here?

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Thank you.

141
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
You are Daman seventeen years.

142
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Please, let me sign you the car registration.

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Please, let me sign you the car registration.

144
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Sir,

145
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
don't worry.

146
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,220
PROFESSOR ZHUANG CHEN

147
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,220
What are you doing in here?

148
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,820
Move away.

149
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,560
You are right.

150
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
P счит我得從此完善

151
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,620
Thank you.

152
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Last time,

153
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,400
our two TV stations were very successful.

154
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I don't know when I'll have the chance to work with you again.

155
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Master.

156
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Actually, if you're not that good at chatting,

157
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
you really don't need to be a bad chat.

158
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,400
I think the recent SNK news strategy is very problematic.

159
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I hope you can pay more attention to it.

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
For example, George's

161
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
post-mortem of an accident.

162
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Who made the decision?

163
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
There's no convincing evidence.

164
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
First, the arrow was fired, then the arrow was drawn.

165
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Only the facts are not all facts.

166
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,400
No report can convince all Hong Kong people

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,400
to believe that the news is fake.

168
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I think you should be careful.

169
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
I think you should be careful.

170
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm grateful to you for being able to convince all Hong Kong people.

171
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,400
But I'm also grateful for your precious opinion.

172
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
What is SNK hiding?

173
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Your taste is biased, so your questions are biased.

174
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,400
How can you be a reporter if you're so ungrateful?

175
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Just because SNK is unwilling to

176
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,400
publicly inform its employees about the news,

177
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
it's enough for me to make a report.

178
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Then do it.

179
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I also hope you can convince all Hong Kong people.

180
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Prove that my decision was right.

182
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I hate to talk and be a sly girl.

183
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
You know that.

184
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I set up an open platform

185
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
because I'm disappointed in SNK.

186
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm disappointed in you.

187
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Now, I have my own opinion.

188
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
We reported the truth

189
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
that is closest to the truth.

190
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
If you can find new information,

191
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
you can report a version that is closer to the truth.

192
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Instead of just saying that you don't believe it.

193
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
You need to build trust.

194
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
You're the one who's been destroying it.

195
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
You can't blame me for not trusting you.

196
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I don't need you to trust me.

197
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I really don't need anyone to trust me.

198
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,400
As long as I can do what I want to do, that's enough.

199
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Liu Yan, Liu Yan.

200
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Meiqi is leaving.

201
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Jiayan.

202
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Thank you.

203
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Really?

204
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
You're not bad either.

205
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
You're very feminine.

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
You're rich and you're not bad-looking.

207
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm willing to be like that.

208
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I gave birth to two old men.

209
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
They're badly injured.

210
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
They're driving on the road.

211
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Otherwise, why would her husband have a mistress?

212
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
It's a secret.

213
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Women are not women.

214
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
It's not that your mother is in charge of your body.

215
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Men are just talking about this.

216
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Is it right to talk about it?

217
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Hey, I heard that it's Sam and you.

218
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
You and you?

219
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Yes.

220
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
When? Who released it?

221
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
It's no use to pursue responsibility.

222
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Now we should think of a way before it spreads.

223
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Save the fire first.

224
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
How can we stop it if it's all on the Internet?

225
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
The public relations disaster in the wide-border.

226
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Shan Tie is also a public relations disaster.

227
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
In this respect, you are an expert.

228
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
You should know better than me.

229
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
You don't want to talk to me.

230
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
You want to explain to Mrs. Fang.

231
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I'm a woman.

232
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I think these remarks are very offensive.

233
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
I really don't know how to help you.

234
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Misunderstanding.

235
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
It's not a verbal statement.

236
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,400
This incident should start from a female's point of view.

237
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Send a statement.

238
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Say that these remarks are said during the off-work time.

239
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
It doesn't affect character and work ability.

240
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
The company regrets it.

241
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
But understand.

242
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I really don't understand.

243
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Give me a reason.

244
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Why should I help you?

245
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
I'll give you three reasons.

246
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
First, you and I are on the same boat.

247
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
SNK can't get better.

248
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Second, you just convinced the people under your command.

249
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
You can clear the line if you make a mistake.

250
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
You're not afraid of them.

251
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Third, I'm not lucky today.

252
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Next time, you are not the man.

253
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
You also often scold others.

254
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
You go to the factory to do business.

255
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
It's very discriminatory.

256
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
And fourth, you are the director.

257
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
You are my superior.

258
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Exactly.

259
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Every one if this is my intention.

260
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
That especially depends on who he is.

261
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,400
All four of us will have a discussion.

262
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Don't be biased.

263
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,060
Xing Qi has

264
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,400
never stepped in the company.

265
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
There are characters but you also follow their 5-charge-horror- expose.

266
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
One more reason should come from you.

267
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,400
여러분i comes before the heroes tonight.

268
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
to face the four walls?

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Don't be used to it.

270
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,640
My husband will be back sooner or later.

271
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,040
You have to get used to it alone.

272
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,000
Well,

273
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,960
I didn't send Wang Wei to the US.

274
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,600
He said he would go there himself.

275
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,920
It's useless to blame me.

276
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,880
In fact, he has such a goal and such a big ambition.

277
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
You should be happy for him.

278
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Everyone has their own things to do.

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,400
The most important thing is not to forget your original intention.

280
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,800
I didn't forget.

281
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,320
You don't have to answer me.

282
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,880
Just tell yourself.

283
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,200
Tan Qigong is right to have his own idea when facing killing situation.

284
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,320
Thank you.

285
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,760
Wait a moment.

286
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,080
What's going on?

287
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,520
Hi.

289
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,360
Hi.

290
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,880
Hello.

291
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,560
The photos are so cute.

292
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,080
When I was a kid,

293
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
I was in a school for teaching.

294
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,080
There was a talent show

295
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
that I was invited to be an angel.

296
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,840
I wore this one.

297
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,160
I was punished by my brother.

298
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,040
I thought I was right

299
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
because I was innocent.

300
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,560
That's why I couldn't stop crying.

301
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,040
You're right.

302
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,800
Lucifer was an angel.

303
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,760
C,

304
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,600
you know my logic.

305
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,080
Everyone has different ideas.

306
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
My mind is different from others.

307
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,520
Why should I be like them?

308
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,800
What do you want to say

309
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,240
to the words of the knight?

310
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,480
I think it's funny.

311
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,360
Three cars are nothing.

312
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,320
They have nothing to do with all the cars.

313
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,080
You're not theirs.

314
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,360
But your body is mine.

315
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,360
Why should I care about others' opinions?

316
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,800
Those officials

317
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,520
even asked me to clarify

318
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,680
my relationship with my husband.

319
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,960
They're so unreasonable.

320
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,560
Aren't you afraid that others will say you're weak

321
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,080
and that you're a womanizer

322
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,240
and that you'll affect the company?

323
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,280
After the assets reach a certain number,

324
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,480
they're just meaningless numbers.

325
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,760
I don't want to waste time

326
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,720
arguing with others

327
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,440
to avoid getting myself in trouble.

328
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,520
I'm done.

329
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,800
Okay.

330
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,160
Okay, come on.

331
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,640
Changsheng, the client gave it to me.

332
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,600
It should be okay.

333
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,600
You need more money.

334
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,360
You want to attack me?

335
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,040
I've checked it.

336
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,760
That recording

337
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,200
was released by the intern you quarreled with.

338
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
You'll stir up the mood of the people.

339
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,880
You'll harm the safety of the hostages and kill people.

340
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
I've used the word once.

341
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,800
Once is not a shield.

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,240
Don't think you can say anything

343
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,360
with a few words.

344
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
You're facing the public.

345
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,080
You have social responsibility.

346
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,160
Pack up and leave.

347
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,880
Insane.

348
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
I won't do it if you don't want to.

349
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,400
Now you're the one who quarreled with me.

350
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,880
You made her unhappy

351
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,960
and got me involved in the matter.

352
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,480
But I've talked to her.

353
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
She apologized to me

354
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,120
and said she won't do it again.

355
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,520
What did you tell her?

356
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,440
I've analyzed for her.

357
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,120
If she does it again,

358
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,920
how will our company block her

359
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,760
and how many companies in Hong Kong

360
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,240
are related to Mrs. Fang?

361
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,040
The intern did it.

362
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,760
But this

363
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,960
hasn't been done yet.

364
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,360
Although

365
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,040
Dana is no longer in charge,

366
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,760
but

367
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,040
many female rights activists

368
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
have complained to the review committee.

369
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
You need to explain it to them in person.

370
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,360
If you can't explain it well,

371
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,360
Mrs. Fang will be blocked.

372
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,320
I've decided.

373
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,720
This time,

374
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,640
you'll explain it to them on behalf of the company.

375
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,760
When you have nothing to do,

376
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,040
you treat women as your laughing stock.

377
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,760
When you have something to do,

378
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,960
you push women out and carry them.

379
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
You're a man

380
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,680
who does everything for the benefit.

381
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,760
But this time,

382
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,480
it's really not about gender.

383
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,680
I just think

384
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,440
it's better to have women

385
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,400
speak out for the matter.

386
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,280
You want me to go to the review meeting.

387
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,800
I'm not afraid of talking nonsense.

388
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,040
I'm not afraid of talking nonsense.

389
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,240
I'm not afraid of talking nonsense.

390
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
I'm just kidding.

391
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,480
You're my boss.

392
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,960
Whatever you want me to say,

393
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,040
write the script.

394
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,520
I'll try to memorize it.

395
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,600
Before 2015,

396
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,440
no one has ever heard the name Dana.

397
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,840
It was the third puzzle solved

398
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,560
in that year.

399
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,560
Edison Tech

400
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,880
was a coincidence

401
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,800
when thunder came out from the ground.

402
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,160
His childhood friend, Qi Jie,

403
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,040
was also a coincidence.

404
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
You suspect that his company

405
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
was founded with the 1 million dollars.

406
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,000
High IQ and humor.

407
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,640
It's a little cold

408
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,840
to be over 30 years old.

409
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,560
It's more suitable for you to analyze the first question.

410
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,520
But these are all indirect evidence.

411
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,000
There is no direct evidence pointing to him.

412
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
I just finished talking with the editor of the publishing house.

413
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,000
Do you know who the author of the children's horse riding horse is?

414
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,720
Who is it?

415
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,000
Mr. Hong.

416
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,160
The one who lives in the Iron Manor.

417
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,040
The hidden rich man who serves him.

418
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
He has died this year.

419
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,000
The newspaper also said that he was very heartless.

420
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,440
He didn't leave a single dollar to his family.

421
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,280
He gave it all to the foundation.

422
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,320
If he is the one who raised the question,

423
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,920
he wants to invest that money

424
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,000
into a smart person.

425
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,160
So, Cicada is not a secret organization at all.

426
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,400
It's Mr. Hong's angel investment fund.

427
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,960
Because there is a new successor,

428
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,200
there are new media.

429
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,320
That means there is no direct evidence.

430
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,560
Is this clue broken?

431
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,480
It will be over in less than 24 hours.

432
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,680
The second round...

433
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,520
Do you dare to bet?

434
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,880
If you lose,

435
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,680
you will lose 1 million dollars.

436
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,000
Bet?

437
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,920
Since that money never belonged to me,

438
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,160
how can it be a loss?

439
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,040
Hello.

440
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Hello, Miss Wen.

441
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,000
I did an interview with Diana last time.

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,280
I want to add three questions.

443
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,400
Can you please ask her

444
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,280
if she has time?

445
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,240
Please wait a moment.

446
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,320
Diana, Miss Wen is here.

447
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,000
Diana, please go in.

448
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,640
Thank you.

449
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,560
Sorry, I'm here to punish you again.

450
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,840
I'm very busy today.

451
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,760
I only have five minutes.

452
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,680
What do you want to ask?

453
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,520
Okay.

454
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,600
What do you want to add

455
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,440
about Edison Tech's first-class source?

456
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,120
And what does your relationship with

457
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,960
the hidden rich man, Mr. Hong, have to do with?

458
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,060
The

459
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,600
And the children's chess piece

460
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,000
on the shelf.

461
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,840
What's special about you?

462
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,280
The first one, no supplementary.

463
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
The second one, I don't know this person.

464
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,520
The third one, no special meaning.

465
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,640
Are you satisfied?

466
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,240
We know they're lying.

467
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,920
They also know they're lying.

468
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,800
They also know we know they're lying.

469
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
We also know they know

470
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,880
we know they're lying.

471
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,440
But they still lie.

472
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,160
What's the name of the Nobel Prize in Literature

473
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,520
for the All-Person Music?

474
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,240
Why don't you answer?

475
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,480
You guys come and ask.

476
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,040
If you understand,

477
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,480
you will understand.

478
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,320
Anyway,

479
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
I'll be there at Privacy is My name.

480
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,440
Don't worry.

481
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,320
Fifty minutes have been up.

482
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,720
Okay.

483
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,320
Bye for now.

484
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,600
Since the money never belongs to us,

485
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,640
how can it be a book?

486
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,440
Fine.

487
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Let's open the second chapter.

488
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,480
It's stuck anyway.

489
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,800
Why don't we make a single chapter

490
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,720
to let the public platform

491
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,000
grab a wave of points?

492
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,720
Actually, the second chapter

493
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,000
is not just about finding the book.

494
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,440
It depends on the three of us.

495
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,520
We can't find it.

496
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,920
That's one million dollars.

497
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,840
Just give it to others?

498
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,200
That's what I want to do.

499
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,440
The whole game

500
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,080
is in the hands of the publisher.

501
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,560
We can only be good at solving the mystery.

502
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,400
It's too passive.

503
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,720
The main thing is

504
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,360
to disrupt the rules of the game.

505
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,920
As long as the suspect

506
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,200
has any action,

507
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,560
we can find him.

508
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,200
But what if...

509
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,320
What if...

510
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,240
What if it's not Diana?

511
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,160
It's a mess.

512
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
We didn't pass the first chapter.

513
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,840
We're going straight to the third chapter.

514
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,040
The only one who passes the first chapter

515
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,960
will be kicked out.

516
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,000
It's completely against

517
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,040
the purpose of the whole game.

518
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,920
The documents on Sikata

519
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,000
are ready.

520
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,440
You just need to sign it.

521
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,760
Forget it.

522
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,280
We'll take the fund back this year.

523
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,720
We'll deal with it again next year.

524
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,520
And help me get Wen Huixin.

525
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,640
Diana.

526
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,960
I want to tell you

527
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,440
a story about inheritance.

528
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,680
Ten years ago,

529
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,720
there was a girl

530
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,960
who was called a genius.

531
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,360
She was bored

532
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,960
and solved a riddle online.

533
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,480
The person who solved the riddle

534
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,760
asked her to meet her here.

535
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
She saw Sikata for the first time

536
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,120
and knew she was a low-key rich man.

537
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,640
She wanted to find a good investment

538
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,600
so she asked her to meet her here.

539
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,640
She was very happy

540
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
to get the $1 million prize

541
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,840
and set up a company.

542
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,440
The company was very successful.

543
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,880
The more they did,

544
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,000
the more wealth they got.

545
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,440
Sikata left this year.

546
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,240
The girl hoped to continue

547
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
the path she had taken.

548
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,520
She was very lucky.

549
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,320
She was lucky to have a good friend.

550
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,520
She was lucky to have a good friend.

551
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,360
She was lucky to have a good friend.

552
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
She was lucky to have a good friend.

553
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
She was lucky to have a good friend.

554
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,000
So she set up

555
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,360
an angel fund

556
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,040
to continue the tradition of online riddles.

557
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,680
She hoped to find

558
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,200
a good investment.

559
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,680
At the same time,

560
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,640
she inherited the tradition here

561
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,880
and bought insurance.

562
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,840
She really achieved the wealth inheritance.

563
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,440
She did it

564
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,840
in case of an accident.

565
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
The fund can continue to operate.

566
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,280
She can achieve the unparalleled inheritance

567
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
of Sikata.

568
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,920
There are many talented people in Hong Kong

569
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,320
and many outstanding startups.

570
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
There are many funds.

571
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,440
Money is not lacking, but people are.

572
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,080
But what is lacking is the vision.

573
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,960
There are thousands of miles,

574
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,160
but there is no way to cross it.

575
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,600
But have you ever thought about the changing times?

576
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,000
Now the social media is corrupt.

577
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,800
The information is circulating.

578
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,040
One person can solve it.

579
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Everyone can solve it.

580
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,600
You can't find the smartest person.

581
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,840
In the end, the one who is determined to solve the problem

582
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,280
may just fight for resources.

583
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,120
If you go out and let others solve it,

584
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
you can't show your strength

585
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
by using a super computer.

586
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,880
Now you've messed up the game.

587
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,640
I know it.

588
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,760
Can this story be reported?

589
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,840
No.

590
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,600
If it is reported,

591
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,560
Sikata can't inherit her will.

592
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,640
But the people outside

593
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,560
also need an explanation.

594
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,800
If not, they can just

595
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,080
give it over and collect the goods.

596
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,000
The Dynar of Edison Tech

597
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,760
was inspired by this matter

598
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,760
and took out the amount of

599
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,160
the shares of the shares of the Dynar

600
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,560
to set up an investment fund

601
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,680
to invest in the first-class

602
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,240
public platform.

603
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,080
But

604
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,000
I like Wen Huixin.

605
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,880
But I don't like Liu Yan.

606
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,200
Get rid of him.

607
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,160
I'll invest right away.

608
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,760
The End

609
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,120
Don't just walk around.

610
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,240
I don't know what you're hesitating about.

611
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,000
Liu Yan would rather resign

612
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,160
and use that money to set up a public platform.

613
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Unless you and him have established a friendship

614
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
and a personal relationship,

615
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,880
then that's a no-no.

616
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
It's not about money or feelings.

617
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,840
It's about principles and editing.

618
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,240
Today, he can say

619
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,040
he doesn't like Liu Yan.

620
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Tomorrow, he can say

621
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,360
he doesn't like any newspaper

622
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,120
and wants me to resign.

623
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,800
What should I do?

624
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,680
Use money to help people get rid of the disaster.

625
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,080
You have to be obedient

626
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,000
when you receive the money.

627
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,800
This is called a waiting price transaction.

628
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,640
I want money

629
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,120
and autonomy.

630
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,640
If it doesn't work, then forget it.

631
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,480
If I leave their public platform,

632
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,280
what's the point?

633
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,080
That would only be MAX's profitable rings.

634
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,640
I've never thought that

635
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,760
I can accept her offer

636
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,240
as long as I work hard.

637
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,720
Is it all right?

638
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,520
Ming Tian is also forced to pay for rules,

639
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,280
and big companies will take our accounts.

640
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,240
That means

641
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,440
we also have to label her on it.

642
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,560
Her gave you money

643
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,480
so you can use it.

644
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,720
My money is your green rounded,

645
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,440
green counted.

646
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,720
If we don't sell the paper,

647
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,720
then a man of the millions

648
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,580
withms a engage in a ейfei

649
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,320
and a company

650
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,680
will pay our NYU quietly at once.

651
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,480
You're saying

652
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
I've seen the most stupid decision

653
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,560
in the past ten years.

654
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,320
You said that wisdom and stupidity

655
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,000
are both limitless.

656
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,240
Because they are

657
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,320
just a line of difference.

658
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,040
I think this line

659
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,920
is persistence.

660
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,600
Doing news and research are the same.

661
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,880
You have to believe in your persistence.

662
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,960
So I said I like you, Wen Huixin.

663
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,040
You and I are the same kind of people.

664
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,600
The news is looking for the truth.

665
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,400
Research is looking for unknown.

666
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,480
But the truth can be found.

667
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,840
But unknown may never be found.

668
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,840
So I think it may be easier to do news.

669
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,560
But what I'm saying now

670
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,360
is that in order to keep a stupid,

671
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
you don't even want a million dollars of investment.

672
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,400
The open platform is not a business.

673
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,720
It's a vision.

674
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
It's a goal.

675
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
It's even a compensation.

676
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
It's a vision.

677
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,120
If there is no rumor,

678
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,920
nothing is true,

679
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,720
it's meaningless.

680
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,480
I've made many smart choices in my life.

681
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
I decided to be stupid once.

682
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Mianqi.

683
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,120
Thank you.

684
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,680
You are me.

685
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,440
Liu Yan is the first person

686
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,800
who has a clue in Hong Kong.

687
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,720
I like smart people so much.

688
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Why don't I want him?

689
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,920
Do you know

690
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,320
why it's a kid's period?

691
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,120
I want to know.

692
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,120
This is a way

693
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,120
I use to commemorate Mr. Hong.

694
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,520
He used to support new ideas

695
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
unconditionally.

696
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,920
I respect him.

697
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,640
Now I'm the one who passed on the story of Cicada.

698
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,040
I hope I can continue his will.

699
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,880
So I'll spend the money

700
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,880
on those

701
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,400
people and things I think are worth appreciating.

702
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,880
In fact, many things

703
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,000
don't have to be too complicated.

704
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
We have learned the truth of life

705
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,080
in the kindergarten.

706
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
The simplest and most direct

707
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,760
is the best way.

708
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,920
What if I give up

709
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,360
this smart and stupid?

710
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,960
If you sacrifice your ideas

711
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,600
for the sake of profit,

712
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,160
you're not Sister Man.

713
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,880
The file is written as

714
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,920
EOC 20252316.

715
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
It's a complaint against SMK.

716
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,040
We invite the Deputy Director of the News Department,

717
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,440
Zhang Jiayan, to respond to the inquiry.

718
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,760
Thank you, committee member.

719
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,960
The recorded voice on the Internet

720
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,240
is confirmed to be real after our investigation.

721
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,440
The three people in the office

722
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,560
are our employees,

723
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,400
including two reporters and a senior.

724
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,240
They had already left work

725
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,360
and were chatting in the teahouse.

726
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,240
There were no women at the scene.

727
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I want to emphasize that

728
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,280
the scene didn't happen during work time.

729
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,040
Their remarks don't represent SMK.

730
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,080
It doesn't affect their professionalism.

731
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,280
Can you confirm

732
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,560
the identity of the person in the office?

733
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,440
Yes.

734
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,520
And they have already

735
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,880
committed internal punishment.

736
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,560
The two reporters

737
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,120
Jiang Liheng and Zeng Zhenye

738
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,680
are not yet considered as parents

739
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
because their conversations are not elegant.

740
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,200
So they have been assigned

741
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,880
to the human resources center of the company

742
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,960
to conduct a number of hours

743
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,880
of non-violent communication

744
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,360
NVC training courses

745
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,560
to improve communication skills.

746
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,640
What about the other senior?

747
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,280
We can't keep up with the other senior.

748
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,280
Why?

749
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
The remarks of his three cars

750
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,600
are very disrespectful to women.

751
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,320
The crime is much more serious.

752
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,720
We completely agree with

753
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,840
the comments above.

754
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,600
But after our investigation,

755
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,840
we found that this recording

756
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,320
was already six months ago.

757
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,160
The person who said this

758
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,920
is our former deputy director,

759
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,240
Mr. Liang Jinheng.

760
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,200
He has died,

761
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,680
so we can't keep up with him.

762
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,120
He pushed the crime to a dead man.

763
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,800
This is not smart.

764
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,840
It's a coward.

765
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,160
This recording

766
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,280
only has sound, not a high pitch.

767
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,320
We can't confirm who said it.

768
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,240
Sorry.

769
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,480
I won't memorize it.

770
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,560
You go to the review meeting yourself.

771
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,520
I'll go to the review meeting.

772
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,280
The evaluation of Diana

773
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
is not my original idea.

774
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,160
George told me

775
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,680
that Diana's husband

776
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,160
is making a small fortune

777
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,400
and so on.

778
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,480
I'm just a deputy director.

779
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,920
You've heard it too.

780
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,840
I didn't wrong him.

781
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,360
But you recorded it.

782
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,640
Not him.

783
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,680
Please get to the point.

784
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,440
Didn't I say

785
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,000
that the recording

786
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,840
can't be confirmed by anyone?

787
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,000
Why don't we use this?

788
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,080
That's the most beneficial to the company.

789
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,280
If you're willing to say

790
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,480
that you and I are on the same boat,

791
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,680
if you're not willing to say that

792
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,280
you're the enemy of the company and me,

793
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,120
you should know

794
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,520
what will happen next.

795
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,320
You're a student of the ship.

796
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Such a simple account

797
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,720
will definitely be counted.

798
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,680
For the benefit,

799
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,280
I'm the only one

800
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,400
who can sacrifice the idea.

801
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,360
Actually, Diana is really my idol.

802
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,120
She dares to do, dare to do,

803
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,240
dare to love, dare to hate.

804
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,560
She doesn't care

805
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,000
how others criticize her.

806
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,040
Whatever she says

807
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,720
is so harsh

808
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,920
that it's all from the heart.

809
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,240
What about me?

810
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
Every word of SNK

811
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,280
has a plan.

812
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Every word

813
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,600
is not sincere.

814
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,280
You said

815
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,800
everyone has their own position.

816
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,360
Why don't you try to think

817
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,000
that you're not sacrificing

818
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
for the benefit?

819
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,440
Sacrifice the idea

820
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,040
instead of making a small sacrifice

821
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,560
for a bigger idea.

822
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,240
I have to make some

823
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,040
uncomfortable decisions

824
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,120
every day

825
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,600
because I want to please Kingston.

826
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,640
It's really painful.

827
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,480
I know it's hard for you to be alone.

828
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,720
But don't forget

829
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,360
what you wanted to do

830
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,320
when you insisted on staying at SNK.

831
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,640
You did it for the truth,

832
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,240
for George.

833
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,360
Only your level

834
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,000
can find out the reason

835
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,600
why he went to the waterway.

836
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,640
Let's work together.

837
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,040
As long as we find out the reason,

838
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,920
all the sacrifices you made now

839
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,760
are worth it.

840
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,400
Good luck.

841
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,080
Liang Jingran.

842
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,760
Wait a little longer.

843
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
I hope you can convince

844
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,560
the present you.

845
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,240
Because the past me

846
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,680
and the present me

847
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,520
have always been the same.

848
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,240
They've never changed to you.

849
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,760
Cheers!

850
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,800
Cheers!

851
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,800
The first thing about being rich.

852
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,120
I've already listed this list.

853
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,080
Of course, I need to update the equipment.

854
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,960
Have a seat.

855
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,120
All of these

856
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,160
are from Hollywood.

857
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,800
Although the price is a little expensive,

858
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
it's okay to

859
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,520
show it on the screen.

860
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,400
That much?

861
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,160
Yes.

862
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,240
Of course, the rich should hire employees first.

863
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,840
If there's no one,

864
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,920
we shouldn't use these equipment.

865
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,160
Should we move to the office first?

866
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,880
Look at this mess.

867
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,440
The door is so sour.

868
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,800
How can we hire someone to do the work?

869
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,960
No.

870
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,480
We can make a commercial film

871
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,000
and wear a suit

872
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,880
like those insurance companies.

873
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,000
Hold your hands like this.

874
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,600
And then...

875
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,080
Open platform

876
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,040
is not just a web media.

877
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,640
It's a question mark.

878
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,840
Let's make it like this.

879
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,400
How about a slogan?

880
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,360
Open platform, no money.

881
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,080
I'll help you.

882
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,520
It's so funny.

883
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,080
You can say that.

884
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,920
Xi, turn on the TV.

885
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,920
What's this?

886
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Welcome to Prime Time News.

887
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,120
Long time no see, Liang Jingren.

888
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,680
Yes, Wen Huixin.

889
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,280
Today's main news is

890
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,200
this morning, citizens in the Western Continent...

891
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,360
This is today's news, not the same news.

892
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,440
The police are on the scene of the blockade.

893
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,280
Sit down.

894
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,960
Go to see this gun.

895
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,720
Found it!

896
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,120
What's going on?

897
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,520
Miss Xia!

898
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,040
Miss Xia is here.

899
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,000
Does theer think it's a bad idea to stop R på hearcakez?

900
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,920
Ohh!

901
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,040
So interesting.

902
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,840
Let's talk to the cashier again.

903
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,120
to stop the program right away,

904
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,400
make a complaint,

905
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
and push Zhao Hua out of the case.

906
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,640
First of all, this program

907
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,720
is not a decision of one person.

908
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,760
It was passed after

909
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,120
countless meetings and discussions.

910
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,960
Mrs. Fang also agrees.

911
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,600
Secondly,

912
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,920
SNK is now

913
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,880
fully responsible for the implementation of the collective,

914
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,200
it is no longer the previous individualism.

915
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,840
This matter is so ridiculous,

916
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,480
you don't stop it.

917
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,440
I am very disappointed with you.

918
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,600
I have nothing to say to you.

919
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,440
You tell him.

920
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,280
I have always been honest with you.

921
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,680
But you...

922
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,320
Bye bye.

923
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,560
Miss Zhao,

924
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,440
please return the key to me.

925
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,760
I am the legal representative of the public platform,

926
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Mr. Shao Junle.

927
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,880
On behalf of my client,

928
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Miss Wen Hui,

929
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,840
without the authority of your company,

930
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,320
use its filial piety without permission,

931
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
which leads to its personal

932
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
and public platform reputation being damaged,

933
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,520
and make a serious protest.

934
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,040
Okay, talk about the law.

935
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,920
When will Hong Kong be able to

936
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,160
have filial piety?

937
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,280
Miss Wen Hui, as a public figure,

938
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
her name,

939
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,440
filial piety and voice

940
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,440
are all characteristics of

941
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,360
individuals who can be identified.

942
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Without the authority to use it without permission,

943
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,240
it is already a false endorsement.

944
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,200
It is a misguided effect

945
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,800
that violates the description of the product.

946
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,080
This is the contract of SNK and Wen Hui Xin.

947
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,160
Article 9,2 of the second chapter

948
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,400
of the contract.

949
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,280
The party has the right to

950
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,480
make a video clip

951
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,120
based on the copyright,

952
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,920
the right to translate and rewrite.

953
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,240
But the name

954
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,360
can be used to produce products of AI.

955
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,280
It's in the copyright.

956
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I think it's better to have a judge

957
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,520
to make a judgment.

958
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,680
AI is a technology of recent years,

959
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,200
so we are very cautious

960
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,680
and consulted with the legal department of the company.

961
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,680
Whether it's Hong Kong or the world,

962
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,480
there is no relevant regulation power.

963
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,560
So this is not a gray area,

964
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,800
but a place where SNK opens a new box

965
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,600
and leads the world to explore unknown areas.

966
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,840
The US government does not mean

967
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,760
that it can do whatever it wants.

968
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,160
SNK as a responsible media company,

969
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,200
it should ensure the employment of its employees and former employees.

970
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,880
Mr. Shao, I also hope

971
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,680
you can promote the legislation to be reformed.

972
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,080
By then, Hong Kong will lead the world.

973
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,000
All media, advertising and film companies

974
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,520
will have to review the contract again.

975
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,560
But before this day comes,

976
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,480
SNK still has the right to use all the

977
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,240
hidden assets of the anchor during the contract.

978
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,080
You will ruin the company's reputation.

979
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,960
You don't have to worry about this.

980
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Last night, they broke the

981
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,880
Hong Kong news collection record.

982
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,600
It seems that the citizens of Hong Kong

983
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,640
don't think there is a problem.

984
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,400
Sorry.

985
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,720
I heard every explanation you just made.

986
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,160
SNK is not good without Wen Huixin.

987
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,280
Even if it breaks the chain,

988
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,160
it will keep this person.

989
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,200
I have a little favor to be paid.

990
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,840
Okay, just admit it.

991
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,160
Don't waste my time.

992
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,920
See you in court.

993
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,440
This world will not be without anyone.

994
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,280
You mean me or her?

995
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,840
She is telling herself.

996
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,000
Give it to the Ministry of Law.

997
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,760
Yes, received.

998
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,160
Chang s sideways boCs

999
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,600
More detail

1000
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,680
Quite the experience

1001
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,560
Really

1002
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,040
Chang

1003
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
is my buddy in Heaven.

1004
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:43,440
Seldom

1005
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,020
Enchantment

1006
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,240
No response

1007
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,440
Not necessary

1008
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,720
you can do it till the second night.

1009
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,680
I'll write your name then.

1010
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,000
I'm afraid you'll thank me.

1011
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,360
Somewhere in my heart

1012
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,480
Beautiful, it's beautiful

1013
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,240
Deep inside my heart

1014
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,320
Try to brighten up your eyes

1015
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,600
Cause the truth will never lie

1016
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,960
Just wipe away and make it clear

1017
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,240
In my mind

1018
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,520
Don't you still have got to cry

1019
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,040
Cause the truth will never die

1020
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,520
For always, always, all the time
