1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm so happy and lucky to get this award.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Every day, the Hong Kong literature, finance, and sports

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,500
have a hundred news articles.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Each one seems to have nothing to do with it.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But the butterfly effect

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
may be on the other side of the earth,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the starry sky,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
or the starry sky.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But the butterfly effect

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
may be on the other side of the earth,

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the US will influence the tourism industry in Hong Kong

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and even the crime rate.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Put every news article that seems irrelevant

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
into a big net

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and read it to the audience.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It becomes a meaningful truth.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is what a news worker

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
should be responsible for.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Lastly, thank you, Sister Man.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have gotten this award.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Without Sister Man, there wouldn't be the good people today.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This summer,

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hong Kong suffered a violent rain for 500 years.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In the face of the death, George was the head of his new profession.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He took the award

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and let us see something

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that is the closest to the truth.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But in the face of an accident,

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
he threw away his microphone

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and his professional identity as a news worker.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He jumped into the water to save people.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's it.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
SNK lost one

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
respectable news anchor.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And I lost one too.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A good colleague who taught me the spirit of news.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A good comrade who taught me the care of people.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
A good comrade who taught me the care of people.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A good comrade who taught me the care of people.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The best news of the year.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This time, it's really a grand funeral, King Sir.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
It's George's grand funeral.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Oh, right. What did George do in the video?

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,600
He escaped from Europe in 2016. Although he's a bit older, he's very experienced.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,200
I understand. There are no other high-end people in the past ten years.

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800
It's hard to find the right material.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,600
But I really don't mind this matter.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
You were the director of the film you made.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
That's right.

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Then do you have a director's common sense?

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
Who did he thank in the end?

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Is that person in S.A.K.? Why did he thank him?

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Did he want to give him a bonus?

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
Sorry, I cut him off.

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Do you agree, Vice Director?

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm just in charge of the news.

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
As long as it's the truth, it can be broadcast.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,400
As for the marketing publicity,

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,200
it's better for you to manage it yourself.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
Good.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
You're still standing here, do you want me to scold you again?

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,400
I'll go right away.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,200
Everyone, come here.

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm going out to collect the fees later. Everyone, fighting!

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Give me something.

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
I know.

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,400
Remember,

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I want this news in Hong Kong today.

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,200
Follow up!

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
Let's go.

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,200
Are you sick? He treats today as a show.

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
Show face?

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600
This is a trial.

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,000
Can you respect the organizers?

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,600
If you want to participate in the trial as friends,

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,400
you can ask HR to take a leave and sit outside.

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
If you're here to work,

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
please do your job well.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,400
Help the company to do this.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
This show.

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Take this.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,600
I remember it's pure silver. You won't get allergic.

83
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,800
We will always miss the heroic deeds of Mr. Liang Jiren.

84
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,400
This is Deputy Director, Zhang Jiayan.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,200
At the trial, we will continue to report for everyone.

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,400
Thank you, Lai Jiayong. We are now outside the venue.

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
The trial will probably start in 30 minutes.

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,800
You can see there are still a lot of people waiting to enter.

89
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
In addition to the news and media,

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,600
there are also many famous people in the society

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
who are saying goodbye to our hardworking colleague.

92
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
Mr. Liang is really a model for Hong Kong reporters.

93
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
He sacrificed himself to save people. I'm really touched.

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,400
I came to see him off today.

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,400
This is the highest recognition for the news staff.

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,800
Let's see the situation here and hand it back to the colleague.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Cut!

98
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Okay, thank you.

99
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
Can I take a picture with you?

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes, you are more beautiful than the camera.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,800
I watch your show every night at six thirty.

102
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes, I saw you and Mr. Liang reporting the news.

103
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Wen Huixin, right?

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Yes, yes.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Hello, my name is Zhang Jiayan.

106
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
I don't know which time you have the most impressive report on Mr. Liang.

107
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Can I refer to it when I do the special?

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Actually, every news is almost the same, right?

109
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
How can I remember so much?

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,400
Each one is good.

111
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
This press conference is good.

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,000
It's fake and fake.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,400
Everyone is here to get a card.

114
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Go tell the director.

115
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,000
Go back to the repair shop.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Do you want to go there to record a video?

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,600
I will definitely go in your proper farewell.

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,400
You know you were pushed out to do the show, but you still go.

119
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,000
This press conference is just to consume the two sides.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Obviously, the new director wants to take the opportunity to announce the world.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Can you get Anson K to the high-level office by taking the new position?

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Although so,

123
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,200
after all, Xiao Zuozhi once cried for you in front of all the audience in Hong Kong.

124
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Did you check if the tears were really crying?

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Just say a few words and you will be happy.

126
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,600
You don't say anything and say that you are a bad person.

127
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Are all things just an audience's wish?

128
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,800
What do I think? Don't explain to them.

129
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
Miss Wen, why don't you go to the press conference?

130
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,400
Are you really having a sexual intercourse with Liang Jingren?

131
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,600
You don't dare to open a live broadcast because you are afraid that I will say something wrong.

132
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,400
You have improved. You learned to play the game of tag and want to get the most ugly pictures.

133
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,000
Then do you think you should take responsibility for the death of George?

134
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Liang Jingren is a deputy director. Who ordered him to go to the front line?

135
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,000
What happened on the day of the accident? What is the cause of death?

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
SNK is trying to get the limelight. Are you hiding some facts?

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,800
You can answer all my questions and come over to talk to me about responsibility.

138
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
This classic is enough for you to teach.

139
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
But I bet Kingston doesn't dare to broadcast it.

140
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,000
So this interview can be considered as not doing it.

141
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,000
Turn off the machine. Close.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,600
You have improved. The problem is sharp enough.

143
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,200
Let's make a short chase. It's easier to call a cab when we get back.

144
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes. They are all here anyway. Go.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He is Lai Fen.

146
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
Don't pretend you don't know.

147
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,400
Today SNK arranged quite well.

148
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Of course. It's the director's turn.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
For a senior, he doesn't need to know the news.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
He just needs to know the people and the situation.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
The director is here.

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Director, director.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
Director, did you come to the police to represent the government and to identify the two men?

154
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Is it because SNK is a big company that you came?

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,800
When will the investigation be released?

156
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Director, please say a few words.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,600
We will have a report meeting very soon. Thank you for your concern.

158
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Why did the press release hit the old and new?

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,600
It didn't mention the responsibility of the personnel.

160
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
The script mentioned the natural disaster many times.

161
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
Are you trying to make things worse?

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,800
I believe the media should know

163
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
that it's not about asking the director.

164
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
The director is the one who should be asked.

165
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
The reporter should know, too.

166
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,400
If you don't ask, the director will answer.

167
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
Director, please respond.

168
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,400
Today is the investigation meeting, not the press conference.

169
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,200
If you don't respond, is there anything to hide from the director?

170
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
I emphasize again.

171
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Today is the investigation meeting of Mr. Liang Jingren.

172
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,600
He used to be a news worker.

173
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
And he sacrificed himself to save people.

174
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,800
I hope today everyone can respect Mr. Liang

175
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
as a great man.

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Today's investigation meeting is a public event.

177
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,600
The meeting also invited media to do an interview.

178
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
As a public figure,

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
the director has the obligation to travel to the public to know the situation.

180
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
Am I right, Director?

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Mr. Liang Jingren is a very experienced reporter.

182
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
Every interview, action and decision

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,400
are carefully thought through.

184
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
Today's investigation meeting,

185
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
as the deputy director of SNK,

186
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I hope everyone can respect the deceased

187
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,000
and give everyone some space to send him to the end of this road.

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
As for other things,

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
I believe the director will arrange a better time

190
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
for everyone to ask questions.

191
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
In short, there is the latest progress in the investigation.

192
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,400
I will notify everyone as soon as possible.

193
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,600
Thank you.

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Cute Valley

195
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,400
Hello, Can you and I~!

196
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,000
What?

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,400
What?

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
What are you laughing at?

199
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,600
If this flabby character doesn't end up in the scene

200
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,900
everything will be ruined in the end.

201
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,440
But if this is the truth

202
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,800
then everything will be demolished soon.

203
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,060
Yes

204
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,340
You can tell me anytime

205
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,300
Mr. Gu, thank you

206
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,820
You arranged it so carefully

207
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Let our son

208
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,220
Can walk in a crazy way

209
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,540
You are his good boss

210
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,700
Don't be polite, uncle

211
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,020
We SNK up and down

212
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,580
I want to do something for George

213
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,620
By the way, after the meeting later

214
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,220
Please come up to the stage and say a few words

215
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,820
I want to tell you the process

216
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,900
I will arrange you to sit in the first row

217
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,220
The first two positions

218
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,300
Wait a minute

219
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,180
I want to ask that woman

220
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Is it the one who caused George to divorce?

221
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,780
You don't have to say it

222
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,420
Mr. Gu, we only have one request

223
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,700
We don't want to see her here

224
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,300
OK, I'll handle it, don't be angry

225
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,500
I will go to the control room

226
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,060
Zhang Jiaye

227
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,180
OK, understand

228
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,100
The most important thing is that the investigation will go smoothly

229
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
I will go to the control room

230
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,500
Please invite Mr. Liang Jingren's family

231
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,900
And friends

232
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,300
Turn around

233
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,620
First Nelson

234
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,940
He拿手座

235
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,220
Please accept my tremendously

236
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,260
Thanks

237
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,140
That is all

238
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,900
Please be sure to give birth

239
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,580
One by one

240
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,340
OK

241
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,340
it is mús

242
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,380
Come on

243
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,140
Please take a seat.

244
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,540
Please致As the status of such.]

245
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,660
Uh,

246
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,420
At least you can't suffer today

247
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,940
if not for this glass of wine.

248
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,360
the

249
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,420
Twin high school

250
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,340
The

251
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,420
Why

252
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,380
Why

253
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,620
why

254
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,780
Why

255
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,300
And Whether you're not afraid of death,

256
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,980
or plots against your own eyes,

257
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,740
have your Vitamin O.

258
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,540
After you've downgrade your levels,

259
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,420
then let's see how you can finish your classes.

260
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,460
I understand.

261
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,900
Now guess a little longer

262
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,700
Miss Wen

263
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,980
Are you the one in the pine flower card?

264
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,020
What are you doing? Don't shoot

265
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,620
Say a few words

266
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,220
go out

267
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,180
Did you see this line?

268
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,460
I went through this line

269
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Private place

270
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,380
I can call the police and arrest you

271
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,820
This is just losing experience

272
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,660
It's a public place outside

273
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,020
Hong Kong has no portrait rights

274
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,620
You can shoot as you want

275
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,460
Eiffel

276
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,500
The dress meeting is almost over

277
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,460
Let Jiayin go back

278
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,140
Go

279
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,780
It takes time to clean up

280
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,540
A-sen, take your time

281
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,380
Let the deputy director wait for a while

282
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:05,940
it is good

283
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,620
Sister Wen

284
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,300
Really not you

285
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,060
Come in and say

286
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,860
Fist hard

287
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,900
Dare to fight disease

288
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,220
Or that deputy director is famous

289
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,220
Can't call you

290
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,740
Everyone knows Zhang Jiayin

291
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,540
How did you get your position today?

292
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,020
No one is convinced at all

293
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,460
The third forces with the ability are all gone

294
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,940
The left-wing party's head just left

295
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,860
They can't accept it so quickly

296
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,660
How do you fight a general without soldiers?

297
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,580
Tell the truth

298
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,620
I really miss

299
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,500
Sister Man's days in SNK

300
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,980
What about Kingston Valley

301
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,420
I can't see it in their eyes

302
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,860
She rarely goes back to the company

303
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,660
She doesn't care what we do

304
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,260
She only cares about one thing

305
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,100
Is the result

306
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,060
Every day, every news

307
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,740
Do flow analysis in seconds

308
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,420
We have been trained to write a draft

309
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,260
Know when the audience will quit

310
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,460
Which needle will take a picture

311
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,900
Just look at the likes and clicks

312
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,020
Attract people to buy advertisements

313
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,180
Help sister do a good job

314
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,460
What is the news station called?

315
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,340
Why don't you call the data company?

316
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,660
Looking at it this way

317
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,460
That flower brand is very suspicious of the deputy director

318
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,300
One for the flow, one for the heart of the buyer

319
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,580
There is a chance in the company

320
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,620
Pay attention to what they have

321
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,380
Which one should be on duty on the day of the storm?

322
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,900
Actually between our colleagues

323
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,020
Very rarely discuss this matter

324
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,700
Always need a little time

325
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,020
To digest this tragedy

326
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,700
You too

327
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,820
People's internal affairs

328
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,580
Why should I explain to you an outsider?

329
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,380
That's right, just asking

330
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,180
But the more you don't say, the more you will be confused

331
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,140
More suspicious

332
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,660
It's almost prime time, let's go

333
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,220
Heroes are not affected by rumors

334
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
No matter who sent it

335
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,420
Thank you for providing flow

336
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,700
Here

337
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,820
Push

338
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,300
Hello

339
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,260
How I can help you

340
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,620
I would like to ask

341
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,620
Did you make this flower dial

342
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,460
Yes, but we have online stores

343
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,020
Can order on behalf of the source

344
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,980
I can't see the name of the guest

345
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,620
Who do you suspect

346
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,220
I will suspect everyone

347
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,140
How to deal with this painting

348
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,220
Cold treatment is the best treatment

349
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,220
Leave it as garbage

350
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,780
Don't find someone to follow

351
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,340
Take more time

352
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,700
Just let the murderer succeed

353
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,780
Ok, I'll go first

354
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,700
I'm going back to the company, do you want to go together

355
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,860
I still have something to do

356
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,060
I have time to tell you now

357
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Sorrow by the way

358
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,340
gone

359
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,820
fine

360
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,500
Refreshing

361
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,940
Even the chief of the news office came to the gong

362
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,140
Your last ending above

363
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,340
pretty good

364
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,060
you smart

365
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,060
Patting the cały

366
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,060
I don't need to face this mess anymore.

367
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,060
Leave me alone.

368
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
Just because of a rain,

369
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Liang Jingren, you are usually the most lazy at work.

370
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Why are you so brave this time?

371
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,060
Luckily, Uncle and Auntie won't let me come out.

372
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Otherwise, I...

373
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Otherwise, I don't know how to hold out the whole live broadcast.

374
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:58,060
I didn't even fight with you. Why are you trying so hard?

375
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,060
If I had given up earlier,

377
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,060
you wouldn't have died.

378
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,060
I'm sorry.

379
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,060
I taught you

382
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,060
that no matter how big a news is, it shouldn't be worth more than life.

383
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,060
Right?

384
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,060
Something happened.

385
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,060
Everyone outside calls you a hero.

386
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,060
To be honest, this is not healthy.

387
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,060
This will lose objective analysis.

388
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,060
The person who loses judgment will die a very unclear death.

389
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,060
You need a person with a clear mind to help you find the answer.

390
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Liang Jingren?

391
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,060
I don't need a work license?

392
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,980
Yes, I regret it separately

393
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,540
I'm not the one whoonymong beside Bai Chi

394
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,220
Thank you before your Met прилet

395
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,460
Thank you hemit

396
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,140
Thank you miss Wen for his precious advice

397
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,400
our SNK has an independent

398
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,580
model of Newman

399
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,560
No worry

400
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,820
In his rights

401
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,780
Please survive

402
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,380
What a coincidence.

403
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,540
It was a big show just now.

404
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,580
Now it's another big show.

405
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,340
George is so lucky.

406
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,580
Why don't you talk?

407
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,260
Go on. Don't mind me.

408
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,980
I always drink red wine

409
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,380
when I talk to George.

410
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,700
Whether it's before or after death.

411
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,500
You're off work now.

412
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,460
It doesn't matter to you.

413
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,780
You have nothing to do.

414
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,980
Do you have any more?

415
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,300
Count me in.

416
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,180
I'm here to check the flowers.

417
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,780
Everyone is here.

418
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
You don't mind, do you?

419
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,500
Thank you.

420
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,460
Cheers.

421
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,060
You shouldn't raise him like that.

422
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,780
Good.

423
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,700
We should help him deal with the situation.

424
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,500
I have to go out early tonight.

425
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,060
OK.

426
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,380
See you.

427
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,300
Just tell me what happened.

428
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,700
Please do not mind it.

429
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,140
I can do nothing.

430
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,540
You must come with me.

431
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,500
You should come with me to the restaurant.

432
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,180
Also I is busier now.

433
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,580
The destruction of the atmosphere is your true story

434
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,740
Please don't lose my face again

435
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,220
first

436
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,900
How are you sure we all want to help

437
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,340
George get justice back

438
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,860
Second, even if it is true

439
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,580
We all have different purposes

440
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,140
Some people want to get promoted

441
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,060
Some people want to get the name

442
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,140
So many hidden motives, how to cooperate

443
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,380
And third

444
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,420
The old comrade-in-arms was anonymous at the beginning

445
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,900
I'm embarrassed to be asked a few words

446
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,100
After all, we shared the same bottle of water

447
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,900
Now share the same bottle of red wine

448
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,140
Can everyone tell the truth

449
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,100
Wait a minute

450
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,660
When did we share a bottle of water

451
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,500
That time, the kidnapping

452
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,420
Is it a sister?

453
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,820
Don't get it wrong

454
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,100
That day I drank a sip of water

455
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,420
You took the water to drink, not to share

456
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,860
Did you remember wrong

457
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,380
We are not in the desert

458
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,860
It's obviously a bottle per person

459
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,700
I went back to the company after I finished it that day

460
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,580
I don't have time to share water with you

461
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,660
No, I remember it clearly

462
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,260
A bottle of water we share together

463
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,860
We laughed happily

464
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,260
The weather was fine that day

465
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,460
Sunlight

466
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,940
Definitely not

467
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,540
What news worker

468
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,940
Luo Shangmen

469
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,500
how to help

470
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,540
Fax check

471
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,980
Find video materials and witness

472
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,300
What if no one took it

473
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,660
What if there are five, six, seven, eight versions

474
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,460
Even if it's really taken

475
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,060
It may not be true

476
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,700
This time we can cooperate for profit

477
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,820
Next time you can also turn against the grain for profit

478
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,460
Your story is not true at all

479
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,340
remember

480
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,940
What you see is just a perspective

481
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,060
Does not represent the fact

482
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,620
What others see is just a point of view

483
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,940
Does not represent the truth

484
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,700
Don't worry about your wisdom

485
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,420
Bye bye

486
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,460
I'm going back to the company

487
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,580
Take your time to understand

488
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,500
You just left like this, I haven't

489
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,220
I'm just an outsider

490
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,940
The fact is waiting for you to tell me

491
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,380
But the point of view is also worth referring to

492
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,700
Kathy thought there were a lot of bottles of water

493
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,220
No need to steam

494
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,100
Because she has a lot of resources now

495
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,060
Forget the days when I saw the situation before

496
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,180
And Zhang Jiayan thinks she's not on the scene

497
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,940
Because she feels guilty

498
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,900
Dare not face everyone

499
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,700
And your steam water advertisement

500
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,300
simple

501
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,780
What about sister Man

502
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,780
You think we grab your things

503
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,900
Want to be king

504
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,780
You have to guard your territory

505
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Don't let go

506
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,260
No wonder I'm destined to be a news crew

507
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,700
Bye bye sister Man

508
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,700
As an пов batteries

509
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:13,700
apt

510
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,300
You completed your task

511
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Can work

512
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,380
Thank you for watching this morning news

513
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,220
I am Pan Zhao

514
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,860
Basically, how was the dress rehearsal that day?

515
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,020
What a pity. You should watch less of the big show.

516
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,380
What pity? I went to interview Sister Man. Isn't she handsome?

517
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,220
But then again, who is that old comrade?

518
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,180
I thought about it all night and I didn't think of it.

519
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,380
I'm sure no one in the same industry can guess it.

520
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,900
What are you doing, Bella?

521
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,820
I'm doing my homework at the selection meeting.

522
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,980
Hey, we've already agreed on both sides. We won't do anything.

523
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,180
Sorry, I don't know that much.

524
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,940
A celebrity is a big deal.

525
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,540
Why do you need to improve if you don't compete?

526
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,660
It's the same for both sides.

527
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,420
Even if you don't have to do the dress rehearsal, there's still Kingston.

528
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,420
So it's someone's first morning shift. That's no wonder.

529
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,540
Let me tell you. Kingston is always late.

530
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,820
He has to go to the sponsor and advertise every day.

531
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,180
That's why he comes back after the lunch meeting.

532
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,860
The morning meeting has nothing to do with him.

533
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,860
Relax, Bella.

534
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,780
So fierce.

535
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,580
Evan, by the way.

536
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,940
What?

537
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,020
It seems that America will really add more people this time.

538
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,820
How about focusing on this topic recently?

539
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,580
You're the one who's been under pressure on this topic.

540
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,060
Not bad. Just take this one.

541
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,580
Good luck.

542
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,540
In short, this dynasty is the most peaceful.

543
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,940
There are different jobs.

544
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,100
Daddy is looking for sponsors outside.

545
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,900
Mommy is the witness. She guarantees the quality of the show.

546
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,220
Water is not a crime.

547
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,020
You'd better talk less.

548
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,580
If you don't talk, the vice director will scold you at most.

549
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,060
But if you have an idea and she's willing to go crazy with you,

550
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,940
that's a problem.

551
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,580
Everyone will work overtime with you.

552
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,620
She wants to do it because she's doing it alone.

553
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,900
People who are not kind-hearted are going to be punished.

554
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,580
Go to do things.

555
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,060
Hui Liang.

556
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,780
Wow.

557
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,580
The special show that Zou Zhi did that day

558
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,300
was very successful.

559
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,380
Let's give a round of applause to our vice director.

560
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,220
Bravo!

561
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,620
Let's start the meeting.

562
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,500
What's the topic today?

563
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,500
You're waiting for me again?

564
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,740
How about giving me your salary?

565
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,020
Vice director is a wise leader.

566
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm not a leader.

567
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,300
Who didn't teach the class today will teach five more questions tomorrow.

568
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,900
A Xin.

569
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,220
A Xin.

570
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,980
Give me the screw knife. Thank you.

571
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,740
How many times have I said it?

572
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,260
Screw knife is not a leader.

573
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,860
Enough.

574
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,660
Don't draw it anymore.

575
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,660
It's so bad that my eyes are blurry.

576
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,380
No show can capture the golden seven seconds.

577
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,620
I'm an audience.

578
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,100
I have money to choose.

579
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,780
Actually, there's a switch on the remote control.

580
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,260
You don't like to watch it, so you turn off the TV.

581
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,380
I can choose not to watch it.

582
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,180
But I don't want to turn it off.

583
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
I suddenly miss Fei Yin.

584
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,860
I read him in the ship and ran to the battlefield.

585
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,100
I know what news is.

586
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,820
That Kingston Gu is from the market.

587
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,420
How can he be the news director?

588
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,660
A Xin, if you're not feeling well, let's go see a doctor.

589
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,060
You're praising Fei Yin.

590
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,380
I remind you that this is a repair shop.

591
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,940
You're watching TV here.

592
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,540
If you really want to pay,

593
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,140
please make some noise.

594
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,700
Don't sit here and wait for the transport.

595
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,380
Otherwise, you can help me.

596
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,300
Destiny

597
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,300
is fought by oneself.

598
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,860
I'm not waiting for the transport.

599
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,340
I'm waiting for the wind.

600
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,820
What wind?

601
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,540
When there's no wind,

602
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,060
no matter how you turn it, it's useless.

603
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,820
But if you can grasp the wind,

604
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,940
you can go a long way with a little bit of power.

605
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,260
Americana

606
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:22,140
Long Tian Wei, escape jail dai

607
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,140
is dead today,

608
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,980
whether your whole family could be died today.

609
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,440
Mr. Zhao Seifu Sir.

610
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,240
This...

611
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,460
What's going on?

612
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,900
Also

613
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,980
appeared the three times.

614
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,140
CD is prepared.

615
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,420
Any news from him?

616
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,740
실 from the upstairs seat- candle room is on the third floor.

617
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
The company is under construction.

618
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,380
Someone reported that there is a unit on the second floor.

619
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,340
A year ago, the building was repaired by Yan Guoluo.

620
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,100
Now, the barrier and the outer wall of the maintenance are removed this month.

621
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,300
I found the rabbit.

622
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,220
Now I will make a 3D animation to simulate the scene.

623
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,500
Are you ready for the interview of the head of the Engineering and Engineering Club?

624
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,540
Bella, can you do it?

625
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,140
I'm trying to get it right.

626
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,260
I don't have time to answer.

627
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,980
Eben, you have to be the one to answer.

628
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,020
This interview is exclusive.

629
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,540
OK.

630
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,540
Hey, be faster.

631
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,700
Are you ready?

632
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,580
Yes.

633
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,460
Five, four.

634
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,820
A special news report.

635
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,980
Fifteen minutes ago,

636
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,340
the old-style hall collapsed with the building on the eighth floor.

637
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,340
We are on our way to the scene.

638
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,380
We haven't received any news of the casualties yet.

639
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,740
SMK will bring you more detailed reports in three minutes.

640
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,460
What are you afraid of?

641
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,260
I'm afraid you can't shoot the material.

642
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,060
OK, wait a minute.

643
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Sam, call the director.

644
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,540
Hello, director, Kinser.

645
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,340
What will you shoot later?

646
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,420
All straight.

647
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,820
No need to hit the horse, no post-production.

648
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,180
Death needs to see the body.

649
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,540
Life needs to see the blood.

650
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,540
That's it.

651
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,540
Kinser, you can't get through the trial like this.

652
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,420
I know.

653
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,780
Isn't it just paying?

654
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,940
I made a lot of money in the ad period.

655
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,540
The live scene was so fast.

656
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,820
What's the big deal if you accidentally shoot it?

657
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,180
Very practical, very means.

658
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,620
This shows that our SMK is the leader.

659
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,860
Then the complaints and the company's reputation.

660
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,340
We are now pursuing the truth.

661
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,620
The most original news.

662
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,300
How much effort.

663
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,820
Anyway, I'm in charge of it.

664
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,460
How about it?

665
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,620
This night's ad is canceled.

666
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,820
Throw it away.

667
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,860
Re-sale the advertising cancelation.

668
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,700
Dead people fall down and sell insurance.

669
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,780
40 seconds of accident complete insurance.

670
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,060
30 seconds of military insurance.

671
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,140
Mr. Li's new building ad for 20 seconds.

672
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,820
Add a rental app.

673
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,420
Got it.

674
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,220
Send the news immediately.

675
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,900
OK.

676
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,540
Kinser is great.

677
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,700
The crisis is the business class.

678
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,940
Ad package is just fast fashion.

679
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,260
Not worth it.

680
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,540
Make up and earn more money.

681
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,100
Roman Bridge

682
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,060
Captain unanimously compartiries haha.

683
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,220
Hens hi to shoot around the city.

684
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
// gives me further stabs and death.

685
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,540
Thailand walking steps first.

686
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,460
Yes.

687
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,060
Criminal law Dasheng

688
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,540

689
00:35:47,540 --> 00:36:02,300

705
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,140
The interviewer said something

706
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,060
Don't delay us

707
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,700

708
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,420

I want to take a picture

712
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,740
Miss is in the rescue

713
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,500
If you want to interview

714
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,300
Please go to the back

715
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:44,700
Thank you

716
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,620

Sorry sir

720
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,180
Sorry

721
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,220
Our machine is not good enough

722
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,180
Not enough people

723
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,820
Not enough face

724
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,740
Don't go to Yangguan Road

725
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,900
Kill new blood

726
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,900
go

727
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,540
go

728
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,180
We also don't paly thewares

729
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,060
and fly to the site to see the situation.

730
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,940
All our machines are the latest model.

731
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,020
The airship has advantages.

732
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,300
Roger that.

733
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,140
Adjust the vertical view 360 degrees for me.

734
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,940
I want to use the full-angle angle to protect the audience.

735
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,660
So many drones.

736
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,820
You want to control it?

737
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,580
Roger that.

738
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,500
What's going on?

739
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,220
Miss Jiang, there's interference.

740
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,420
We can't control the machine.

741
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,380
What's going on?

742
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,900
What's going on?

743
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,540
Hello, journalists.

744
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,020
I'm here to give you a brief report.

745
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,060
Because the number of drones

746
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,220
has exceeded the limit,

747
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,420
we decided to turn the site into a restricted area

748
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,500
to avoid any obstacles.

749
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
It's effective in time.

750
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,860
What's going on?

751
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,460
You didn't notify us and you're disturbing us.

752
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,980
Are you trying to give us an explanation?

753
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,860
What's the limit?

754
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,940
We can only fly again after we discuss the data.

755
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,260
When will it be closed?

756
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,860
It's been disturbed.

757
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,420
It won't be closed for a short time.

758
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,700
That's a right to know.

759
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,340
The chief has given the order.

760
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,620
The most important thing now is to rescue them.

761
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,180
I hope you can understand.

762
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,140
Understand?

763
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,020
Then we should understand.

764
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,460
That's right.

765
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,660
Now the drones are destroyed.

766
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,820
Is it the government's compensation?

767
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,380
Is it the government's compensation?

768
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,860
I used to be a reporter.

769
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,140
I only know that if you continue to entangle with me,

770
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,220
you will miss many golden images outside.

771
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,020
It will be harder for you to communicate.

772
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,100
Anyway, I will notify you immediately

773
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,180
with the latest news.

774
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,940
Thank you.

775
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,300
Chief, say something more.

776
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,420
Say something more.

777
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,420
You really ask him to go?

778
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,140
He's gone.

779
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,540
Xu Shiqing, how do you work?

780
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,700
If you disturb us,

781
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,860
we will be complained by the whole city.

782
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,940
You said you would deal with it immediately.

783
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,580
That's why I did it.

784
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,580
No.

785
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,700
It's your decision to disturb us.

786
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,500
You are wrong.

787
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,620
After this matter is over,

788
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,340
write a report to me.

789
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,180
And also,

790
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,580
the court hearing that day should be written.

791
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,820
What's wrong with me that day?

792
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,220
Everyone sends flowers, you send red wine.

793
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,700
How reasonable is that?

794
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,620
Do you know that this will cause many questions?

795
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,460
Is buying wine to spend money on the tax collector?

796
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,340
What special relationship does the government have with the dead?

797
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,860
These are all materials that are spread and written.

798
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,140
You used to be a reporter.

799
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,540
How can you be so insensitive?

800
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,980
I bought the wine myself.

801
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,820
This is just a common memory between me and my old colleague Liang Jingren.

802
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,860
You have to remember.

803
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,060
You represent the government.

804
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,580
You don't attend in the name of the individual.

805
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,780
I don't care what relationship you have with the dead.

806
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,060
But don't forget.

807
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,300
Your reputation is not good.

808
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,500
Don't make people think.

809
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,900
Yes.

810
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,660
Chief did praise you for being smart.

811
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,420
But you still have a lot to learn.

812
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,260
Be careful with what happened today.

813
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,660
I don't want any mistakes.

814
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,580
I understand.

815
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
There won't be next time.

816
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,180
Just do your basic work without a card.

817
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,060
Clean the streets and buildings and do individual interviews.

818
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,300
I want to know who reported the case.

819
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,420
What did the workers do?

820
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,180
You must go deep.

821
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,580
I don't take in the usual answers.

822
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,700
Xiao Fang's Xiao Se is a famous officer.

823
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,700
It's useless to be hard.

824
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,940
Amber, you have a chance with him.

825
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,780
Yes.

826
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,420
Liang, you and the police.

827
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,620
PRW has a good impression of you.

828
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,140
They may say a few more words.

829
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,820
No problem.

830
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,060
Don't think that I can get in without arranging a mission for you.

831
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,340
Do all the interviews for me.

832
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,060
I want to have emotions and a picture.

833
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,380
If you can't meet my requirements, go back and wait for the letter.

834
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,860
It's more valuable to use your salary to buy a new aircraft.

835
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,580
Wait for your good news.

836
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,260
Dismiss.

837
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,700
Yes.

838
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,220
The live broadcast room is about to be changed.

839
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,420
We can't go up.

840
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,060
Find someone to hold the live broadcast room for two more minutes.

841
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,700
Come on.

842
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,180
Go.

843
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,180
Are you OK?

844
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,700
I'm fine.

845
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,500
OK.

846
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,300
OK.

847
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,780
Yes, this position.

848
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,180
Give it to me.

849
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,940
Get ready to start the live broadcast.

850
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,500
ID and direct access.

851
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,900
Five, four.

852
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,100
Five, four.

853
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,940
Welcome to SNK.

854
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,860
I'm Zhang Jiayin.

855
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,060
Hello, I'm Wen Huixin.

856
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,300
I'm currently in the air of the downing of Long Tianwei, Yuan Lang.

857
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,940
The police called for help.

858
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,500
If it's not necessary, don't go to Yuan Lang.

859
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,700
The Queen is back.

860
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,940
Meili,

861
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,220
it's bad news.

862
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,780
I'm so confused

863
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,780
I found a mirror

864
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,780
Somewhere in my heart

865
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:43,780
Beautiful, it's beautiful deep inside my heart

866
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,780
Try to brighten up your eyes

867
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,780
Cause the truth will never lie

868
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,780
That's why the way I make it clear

869
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,780
In my mind

870
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,780
It's hard just to have got to cry

871
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,780
Cause the truth will never die

872
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:13,780
For always, all the way, all the time
