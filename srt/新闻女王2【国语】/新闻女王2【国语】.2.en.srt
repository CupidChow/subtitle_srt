1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Miss Wen, the news office has rules.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,200
I've already made it clear to you.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm asking you right now why...

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Comrade, I'll take over.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,600
It's the same for everyone.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
I received this seal.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,800
What? It's printed?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a seal.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,400
It's a seal.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,000
It's a seal.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,200
I received the first one.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
What? It's printed?

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
You're trying to send me away?

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,800
It's black and white.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,200
It means you've seen it.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,600
Goodbye, Miss Wen.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm asking why you disbanded

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,400
the independent committee that investigated Liang Jingren's death.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
This is the government's news office.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,400
We welcome any media to investigate

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,000
but we don't accept personal questions.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,800
Miss Wen, which media do you represent?

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,200
What era is it now?

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
Please respect the public.

25
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,200
As far as I know, Miss Wen, when working in a big organization,

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,800
has strict requirements for the professionalism of the reporters.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,800
You don't agree with the public.

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Now, take it as a sign.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
Okay.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm not asking the news office or the news director.

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm asking the news reporter Xu Shiqing.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Okay.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
I'll answer you as Xu Shiqing.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,600
Your question is the answer.

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
You used to be a business officer.

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,200
Not because you're the news reporter Wen Huixin,

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
but because you're the chief anchor of SNK.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,000
Everyone gives you face.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,600
You've heard the story of Hu Jia and Hu Wei.

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I think you've confused who's Hu and who's Hu.

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,200
SNK is a company that deserves to be given face

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
because I used to be there.

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
You figure it out.

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,400
I only know that just the word Wen Huixin

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
is nothing now.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,600
As for your question,

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,200
I don't need to give you a file to answer.

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,000
One letter is enough.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The truth is hard to hear.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
But you should feel it.

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
You're having an interview with an expert.

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
Is there anyone who cares about you?

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
You'll regret that we had this conversation.

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Episode 19

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
People have more money and more people.

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
We can't compare the information in the picture.

57
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
If we want to win,

58
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
we need to be flexible.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
I've got news.

60
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
Yuan Lang's neighboring welfare group

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
is taking pictures in the first view.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's see if we can transfer it.

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Someone from the welfare group of Tang's building

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
is willing to take the interview.

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
I found a worker.

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
The real man of the police, Liao Tianqun.

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
I worked in that building before.

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,200
It was very dangerous.

69
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
I was forced to do it.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Hello, I'm Liu Yin, a reporter from Open Platform.

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
We're now interviewing

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
the collapse of Tang's building

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
of Yuan Lang Long Tianwei.

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
We want to invite you to

75
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,400
have a real-time phone interview.

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
If you're free,

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
give me a call.

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Thank you.

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,800
So we need to know

80
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
how the internal damage is.

81
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
Then I can make a judgment.

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,600
Thank you, the president of the Engineering Division.

83
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
It can't end yet.

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
We still have two minutes.

85
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Please wait, president.

86
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
We have other questions.

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,200
You said the collapse

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
would have an effect on the share price.

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
With your professional vision,

90
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,600
can you analyze

91
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,200
whether it will affect the Tang's building nearby?

92
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,200
You can't go in and check.

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
Go inside and read it.

94
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
It's really hard to say.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,600
President,

96
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,400
the audience may have just turned on the TV.

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I don't know if you mind if you repeat it once.

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
What are the signs

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,800
before the collapse of the building?

100
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,600
So that the audience can be more alert.

101
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
I've answered many times.

102
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
D&A, great.

103
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,400
Read this one.

104
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay.

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,000
The 35 Building is in need of maintenance.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
If there's an accident,

107
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
there was a case in the past

108
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
that the owners of each building

109
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
would be compensated for millions of yuan.

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,400
They also have to take the responsibility.

111
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,800
So insurance is really important.

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,200
Let's do the ad.

113
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
We'll come back later to see the scene.

114
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,200
Okay, cut.

115
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,800
Cut.

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Come back in three minutes.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Where's Ivan?

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
Did I just do the ad?

119
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
It's none of my business if you read it.

120
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,000
After we begin the video recording,

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:15,820
its

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,800
audio in low-frequency,

123
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
The roof opposite the scene of the crash

124
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
We can see the collapsed wali now

125
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
There are probably two floors

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Shoot the helicopter inside

127
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Seriously, where are they?

128
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Hello, I am Wen Huixin

129
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,300
Hahahahaha

130
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,100
Hohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohoho hohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohohoho o did he say

133
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,060
now he micod

134
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,640
if

135
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,100
oh

136
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,680
if

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
The building is completely collapsed.

138
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
The scene is like ruins.

139
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
A whole area is destroyed.

140
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
The whole place is covered in mud.

141
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
We must immediately apply for a ban from the Civil Aviation Department.

142
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
No matter what method we use, we must immediately get him down.

143
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Roger that.

144
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Isn't it great to make news?

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Is it too late to deal with it now?

146
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Didn't you think of it when you entered the drone?

147
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
The Queen is back.

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Wow, it's snowing.

149
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
What should we do now?

150
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
We should have an audience.

151
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
But we can't let the face of the world get wet.

152
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Continue the broadcast.

153
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
The man and woman are peaceful.

154
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Okay.

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Their expressions are also very entertaining.

156
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Let the netizens take a picture.

157
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Hey, I have nothing to say.

158
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
I can't focus.

159
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm going to the hospital.

160
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Let's talk about the main point.

161
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Long Tianwei has been collapsed for more than half an hour.

162
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
The area around the city is temporarily closed.

163
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Are you kidding?

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Such a wonderful picture.

165
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Why are you taking these two pictures?

166
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
I want to see the helicopter.

167
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Immediately change the stage.

168
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Found it.

169
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
What website?

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
The new personal website of Wenhui.

171
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
The authorities have not announced the death toll yet.

172
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
But it is reported that at least four people have disappeared.

173
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
No one is still trapped.

174
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
The police are on the way.

175
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Let's go.

176
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Go.

177
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Go.

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Go.

179
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Go.

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Go.

181
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Go.

182
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Go.

183
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Go.

184
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Go.

185
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Go.

186
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Go.

187
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Go.

188
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Okay, okay, let me finish this sentence.

189
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
But seeing this accident,

190
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
we will doubt

191
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
whether home is really the safest place.

192
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Be low.

193
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
The building below seems to be in danger.

194
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Miss Wen, I'm really leaving.

195
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Life is at stake. Hurry up.

196
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Hurry up.

197
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Come here.

198
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Hurry up.

199
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Everyone,

200
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
an analysis has been found

201
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,980
The media can only shoot outside the封鎖 line

202
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,480
And I saw it from the perspective of the high sky

203
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,280
The water in the next building is clear and there are cracks

204
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Suspects that the building was affected by the collapse

205
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,080
Losing the original support

206
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,280
Causing the whole building to be clear

207
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,720
Lesson 1

208
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,240
Lin E, you're right

209
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
I found that the nature air duct inside this building has a broken linear connection

210
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,280
Und tre bottleneck

211
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,560
Front editing

212
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,960
bypassed

213
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,520
There was obvious cracks in the Thomas house next to the sys

214
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,640
The road'sams��

215
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,640
The natural gas pipes also have signs of breaking and leaking.

216
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
Once a collapse or explosion occurs,

217
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
the most worried is that it may cause the effect of the old plate,

218
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,640
which will cause the surrounding dense old buildings to collapse in a row.

219
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
OK.

220
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Left feet ends in three, two, one.

221
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Sir! Sir!

222
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Yes, what's up?

223
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,640
Reporter, we saw that the building next door seems to have a chance of collapsing.

224
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
We have issued a arrest warrant

225
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
to stop the live broadcast of the people on the helicopter.

226
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Face the legal responsibility.

227
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Chief, how is the media handling it?

228
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,640
I went to the scene to communicate with the person in charge of the logistics,

229
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Kathy, to answer.

230
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Compared to what we did,

231
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
the media are more concerned about what we didn't do.

232
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Hong Kong citizens will not pursue the helicopter or the safety assessment at the first time.

233
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Instead, they will start timing

234
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
to see when we start to rescue people.

235
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
But the patience of the audience is limited.

236
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
The pictures taken will only become more and more dangerous.

237
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,640
When the nervous emotions turn into dissatisfaction with us,

238
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
it may cause serious public relations disasters.

239
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Kathy, we are just coordinating media activities.

240
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,640
We don't need to participate in the rescue arrangements.

241
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
You are right.

242
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
But is the fire station professional?

243
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
We can also catch this point and do a live broadcast

244
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
to match the live broadcast of the other party.

245
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Let the fire department's preparation procedures,

246
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
even the entire rescue plan,

247
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
be publicly shown to the citizens.

248
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Let them know that we are not not doing anything.

249
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,640
We have an emergency response system that can cooperate.

250
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
OK, just follow this direction.

251
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Kathy, well done.

252
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Thank you, Chief.

253
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
I'll go and make a news article.

254
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
This way.

255
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,640
We can see that the buildings next to the collapsed building

256
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,640
are also undergoing a second emergency evacuation.

257
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,640
After receiving the news, the police immediately rescued all the residents.

258
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,640
We can see that the residents in the building should be safe now.

259
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,640
We can see that the police are expanding the evacuation range.

260
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
I believe that according to the latest information,

261
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,640
we can try to get time to evacuate all the victims of the threat.

262
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
OK.

263
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Sister.

264
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
What's going on with the live broadcast?

265
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Jiayan.

266
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Sister.

267
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
K&B, hurry up.

268
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
OK.

269
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
It's a big news when it falls.

270
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
What's going on?

271
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
What's going on?

272
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
What's going on?

273
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
What's going on?

274
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
What's going on?

275
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
What's going on?

276
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
What's going on?

277
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
What's going on?

278
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
What's going on?

279
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
What's going on?

280
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
What's going on?

281
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
What's going on?

282
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
What's going on?

283
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
What's going on?

284
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
What's going on?

285
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
What's going on?

286
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
What's going on?

287
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
What's going on?

288
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
What's going on?

289
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
What's going on?

290
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
What's going on?

291
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
What's going on?

292
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
What's going on?

293
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
What's going on?

294
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
What's going on?

295
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
What's going on?

296
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
What's going on?

297
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
What's going on?

298
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
What's going on?

299
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Boom.

300
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
erel humor,

301
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
what's going on.

302
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
What's going on.

303
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
What's going on.

304
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
What' s going on.

305
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,720
What's going on.

306
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
What' s going on.

307
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
What's up.

308
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
What's up.

309
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
What's up.

310
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
What's up.

311
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
What's up.

312
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
What's up.

313
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
What's up.

314
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
What's up.

315
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
What's up.

316
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
What's up.

317
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
What's up.

318
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
on the scene

319
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,880
can be seen that the helicopter has recovered stability

320
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
An chaos came and fell down madly

321
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,120
a discontented

322
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,720
Out to warm your heart

323
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,880
I'm watching a remind

324
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,060
from now on.

325
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,800
Anyone hurt?

326
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Go downstairs!

327
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Help! Help!

328
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Someone's up there! Someone's hurt!

329
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Help! Hurry!

330
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Miss! Miss!

331
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Help!

332
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Be careful!

333
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Miss! It's dangerous!

334
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
You can't go over there!

335
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Miss! Miss!

336
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Miss! Miss, calm down!

337
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
Move aside!

338
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Leave it to us!

339
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
We'll handle it!

340
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Here! Here!

341
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
You leave it to us!

342
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Hurry!

343
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Call for Amber!

344
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Okay!

345
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Director Zhang Jiayan

346
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
has just found a living person

347
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
in the Wali pile.

348
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
The fire has successfully

349
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
rescued the injured

350
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
and sent them to the hospital.

351
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
SNK News will continue to

352
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
send you the first news.

353
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Please pay close attention.

354
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Let the host do the live broadcast.

356
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
I'll go to the hospital.

357
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Roger!

358
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Listen up, everyone.

359
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
During the time when the man is gone,

360
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
you must get the audience back.

361
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
No matter what,

362
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
you must get the audience back.

363
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
You must get the audience back.

364
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
You must get the audience back.

365
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
You must get the audience back.

366
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Wu Huixin,

367
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
SNK KINSTAN.

368
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Man is busy now.

369
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Just tell me what you want.

370
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
I'll help you tell him.

371
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
So you're the one

372
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
who's been a veteran in the army.

373
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
No wonder when Man came out,

374
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
there was such a big battle.

375
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
It's rare to find such a good battlefield.

376
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Of course, I have to do my best.

377
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
I'm sorry to steal your mirror.

378
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
It's a helicopter.

379
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Killing a chicken with a knife.

380
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Does it show that

381
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
you don't have confidence

382
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
in the brand of Wen Huixin?

383
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
You need to make such a big move.

384
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
We've been working too hard.

385
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
We always do things like this.

386
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
We don't know how to save our chance.

387
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
But you're not bad either.

388
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
You're not bad either.

389
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
You're the first one to call.

390
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Are you in a hurry

391
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
to get a video?

392
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Is the professional soldier going to be fast?

393
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Let me tell you.

394
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
It's not fast.

395
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
The higher the price, the better.

396
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
But it will be on the market

397
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
in the prime time tonight.

398
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Okay, take a look.

399
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Buy a piece.

400
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
I didn't decide the price.

401
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
It's the market that decides.

402
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Although your SNK is a big stage,

403
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
you have to follow the rules.

404
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Okay, let me remind you.

405
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
The news is different from the red wine.

406
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
It will be depreciated if you keep it for a long time.

407
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
I'll talk to Wen Huixin later.

408
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
I won't bother you to be a receptionist.

409
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
We have a unified approach.

410
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
We have a unified approach.

411
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
We all blame Wen Huixin.

412
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I want Wen Huixin

413
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
to be a brand that is not valuable.

414
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Wen Huixin

415
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Don't you need so many people?

416
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Wen Huixin,

417
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
we want to ask you to go back

418
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
to help with the investigation.

419
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Okay, no problem.

420
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Thank you.

421
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Let me talk to Sister Man.

422
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
What crime did the police use

423
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
to sue Wen Huixin?

424
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
No one can be charged for now.

425
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Is Sister Man going to be responsible for the wedding?

426
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Is there any right to interview the police?

427
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Thank you for your hard work.

428
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Actually, I'm here today

429
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
to interview you like everyone else.

430
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Wen Huixin

431
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Wen Huixin

432
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Wen Huixin

433
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Hello, sir.

434
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
I just found your S&K reporter.

435
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
If you don't mind,

436
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
can I give you an interview?

437
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Are you a guest in the building?

438
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Be careful.

439
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I'm a decoration worker there.

440
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
When you came just now,

441
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
you kept saying sorry.

442
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Who are you sorry for?

443
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
It has nothing to do with me.

444
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
It has nothing to do with me.

445
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Say it.

446
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Say it.

447
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Let's see how we can help you.

448
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
I support Sister Man.

449
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
The whole town supports Sister Man.

450
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Stop it.

451
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
The whole town supports Sister Man.

452
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
If Sister Man succeeds,

453
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
the whole world will be turned upside down.

454
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Go away.

455
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
The live broadcast is over,

456
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
but the news is not out yet.

457
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Don't send the news.

458
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Why did the explosion and collapse?

459
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Is it because of human factors?

460
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Who is responsible for it?

461
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
There are no answers to a series of questions.

462
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Now

463
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
is the time for the reporter

464
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
to start working.

465
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
There are four hours left

466
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
before the prime time.

467
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm going to find all the Hong Kong

468
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
and Tang Lou's

469
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
identification reports

470
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
that have been in the building for more than 50 years

471
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
to do the mutual reference.

472
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Okay.

473
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
How many hours are left?

474
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Then don't follow the other reports.

475
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
It's a life-or-death matter.

476
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
How to do it?

477
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
It's impossible.

478
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
It's too late.

479
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Don't do it.

480
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Don't watch boring videos.

481
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Don't say a few words.

482
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
There will be time.

483
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Dong Shi, Xiao Ping.

484
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Who is talking?

485
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
I know you are behind me.

486
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
You compare me with Sister Man.

487
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Say it again.

488
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm not her.

489
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
I'm Zhang Jiayan.

490
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
I'm the only one.

491
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Now she is in the police station.

492
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
I'm in the SNK.

493
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Please figure out

494
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
who is your boss.

495
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
In the future, the prime time

496
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
will not use the previous one.

497
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
We have to use our strength to investigate

498
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
and get the audience back.

499
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
You'd better cooperate.

500
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
People who can't do it

501
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
or people who are in trouble,

502
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
don't blame me for being rude.

503
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Sister Jiayan, please take a shower.

504
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
There are some stickers on the window.

505
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Your hand is hurt.

506
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Thank you.

507
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Liang Jinyan, look.

508
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
What kind of people

509
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
have we raised?

510
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
We fought with you.

511
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
You die, I live.

512
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
The prize we won

513
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
is a company like this.

514
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
The collapse of this time

515
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,040
can be solved by the number of deaths.

516
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
It's a great fortune.

517
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I am a public-page reporter, Liu Yan.

518
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
I report for you live.

519
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Cut.

520
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Okay, that's not good.

521
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
So Sister Man's video is so important.

522
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
What's going on in Hong Kong

523
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
only she took it?

524
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Drink some water first.

525
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Add some water.

526
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
I'm not drinking.

527
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
I'm thinking.

528
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Actually, there may not be a chance.

529
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
All major media institutions

530
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
even want videos from old women on the street.

531
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Why?

532
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Sincerity.

533
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
She's doing a countdown on her channel.

534
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
She's going to send a hero's post

535
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
to the whole martial arts world to grab the exclusive secret.

536
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
How can she get a small role like us?

537
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
How can I know if I haven't tried?

538
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Have you ever thought about it?

539
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
What if Sister Man can't sell it

540
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
before the prime time tonight?

541
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
She posted it on social media.

542
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
She has no money to make.

543
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Total loss.

544
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Then the open platform can be cut.

545
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
It's cheap.

546
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
So

547
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
as long as it doesn't end,

548
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
we don't know who will lose.

549
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
What are you doing?

550
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Leave money and leave travel documents.

551
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
General security conditions.

552
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Lawyers will handle it.

553
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
I'm not asking about this.

554
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Wow.

555
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
What?

556
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Guess how much?

557
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
How much?

558
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
How many people or how much money?

559
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
More than three thousand messages.

560
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
More than two hundred calls.

561
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Only five percent of power.

562
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Who are you going to restore first, Miss Wen?

563
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Think about it.

564
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
I haven't thought about it yet.

565
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
I'm the only one who took a picture at the historic moment.

566
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
If you want to be worthy of the audience,

567
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
you have to choose

568
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
the most suitable platform to play.

569
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
That's great.

570
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I'm begging you.

571
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
You're a few decades old.

572
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Can't you find a good job?

573
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
You have to fight for your life.

574
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
You can't praise me.

575
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
You have to pour cold water on me.

576
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
I just know

577
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
I can't fight a few times.

578
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
So I take the blackout once.

579
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Isn't it great?

580
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Don't bother me driving.

581
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm not praising you.

582
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
I will never praise you.

583
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm praising you.

584
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
I tell you.

585
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
You won't win every time.

586
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
So many messages.

587
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
It's not necessarily a good thing.

588
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Think about it.

589
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
You wanted to get a job before.

590
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Mrs. Fang blocked your way.

591
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
But she didn't this time.

592
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Why?

593
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
I really want to go back to SNK.

594
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Now I'm managed by a person who doesn't know the news.

595
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
It's not even the same level.

596
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
People will compromise.

597
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Can you?

598
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
I will.

599
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
If you don't do the big stage, do the other stages.

600
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Where there is strength, there is a stage.

601
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Really?

602
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Then the net media, can't you?

603
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
It's not the weather yet.

604
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
You want me to be a bull?

605
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
You see the public platform

606
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
How to do the message with PM?

607
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,040
You don't look at those new media.

608
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
What's the self-media?

609
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
It's not that you can't see it.

610
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
It's the fact.

611
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Not enough people and resources.

612
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Most of the time it's a transfer.

613
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Occasionally there is a story of a person.

614
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Publish.

615
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,040
No matter how high the click, it's also a person's ad fee.

616
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
How many readers are willing to pay?

617
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I'd better work for money.

618
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
You dislike this and dislike that.

619
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
No matter how much information is useless.

620
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
There is not much left after choosing.

621
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:19,020
The

622
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,080
I guessed Mrs.ak

623
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,040
Didn't want to call me to report the finance.

624
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
You don't play mahjong.

625
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,640
This is your solution.

626
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,640
Hi, Koumo.

627
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,280
I'm here.

628
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,520
Lower the air conditioner.

629
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,160
Okay.

630
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
The air conditioner in the living room has been lowered by three degrees.

631
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,320
Do you need to ask Mrs. Fang for a horse friend?

632
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,600
It's not easy to find a good horse friend.

633
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,200
You have to be good at ranking and have a topic.

634
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,560
You also have to know each other's temperament.

635
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,920
You know what you can say and what you can't say.

636
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,680
What cards can be played and what cards can't be played.

637
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,440
It's best to be familiar with each other.

638
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
I asked her to come back.

639
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,440
But think about it.

640
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,920
Buy the video.

641
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,960
It will improve the quality of the video.

642
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,640
Advertising price is 15 percent.

643
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,360
The cost is very low.

644
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,600
Your watch is limited edition, right?

645
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,640
Why do you want to buy it?

646
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,480
It's just that there is no one, no one, no one.

647
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,040
I have it, it's worth it.

648
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,080
Horse sauce is a long-term war.

649
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,760
One or two, what does it matter if you lose?

650
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,080
Keep your eyes wide open.

651
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,360
I understand.

652
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,040
But I also hope that Mrs. Fang understands.

653
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,480
This time, it's not because you are a horse sauce addict.

654
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,080
So impulsive consumption.

655
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,200
Okay, I'll help you find out the recipe.

656
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,480
Okay.

657
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,360
Mrs. Fang.

658
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
You want to play this horse sauce.

659
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,520
What if the man doesn't play?

660
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,600
Then don't fight.

661
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,240
You are right.

662
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,400
You broke up the six-legged empress?

663
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,720
Is that it?

664
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,920
So you have to prove me wrong

665
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,360
Who am I?

666
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,840
I've got to silence you.

667
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,880
I said it.

668
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,240
You answer me directly.

669
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,220
Why do i disband your

670
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,320
Two Police personnel's trials

671
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,280
There won't be today's event

672
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,040
I said you will regret es.

673
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,160
You are not regretted being caught.

674
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,240
How can i regret?

675
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
I'm very dissatisfied with it

676
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
The government is doing things

677
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,240
Is to choose the best choice for public interest

678
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,680
Is to persuade the jade first

679
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,880
Then warn and then execute

680
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,720
The army was in a panic

681
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,720
In a hurry to save the head of the rescue team

682
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,440
There is danger if you don't act immediately

683
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
And the media never listen to me

684
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,320
If persuading and warning is useful

685
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,640
Where to invite me and you

686
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
You still talk

687
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,120
Thank you

688
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,880
The pressure of the master is so big

689
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,280
So many media don't go to the first interview

690
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,160
Government work

691
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,320
Is this an interview

692
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,360
The official does not admit

693
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
If there is nothing

694
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
I'll go to work first

695
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,040
I haven't finished

696
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,560
How familiar are you with Wen Huixin

697
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,680
Do you guess he wants to do government work

698
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,840
Want to put me under the five-finger mountain

699
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,040
Make me angry

700
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,640
Don't look down on yourself

701
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,520
Ruolan Fuzu didn't even do it

702
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,800
Just sent me here

703
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,600
I know how sincere it is

704
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
So fast to refuse

705
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,760
Afraid that I will come down empty

706
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,720
No more your position

707
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,520
Will you accept this opportunity

708
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,880
Your horse

709
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,080
Even Mrs. Fang, this knight

710
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,240
May not be able to control

711
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,840
How can you come to us

712
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,080
Use it as a horse

713
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
You want to invite Wen Huixin

714
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,200
You invite him here

715
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,680
It's like telling everyone

716
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
The government is not allowed to launch a helicopter

717
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,920
Just encourage others to do this

718
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,400
How can we prove it in the future

719
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,480
How to play with each other's gray land

720
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,040
Xu Shiqing

721
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,640
You are really inexperienced

722
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,360
We are not really inviting him

723
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,520
I'm willing to do it, you don't want it

724
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,280
See the report

725
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,600
Criticize the government for not inviting the industry talent

726
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,560
Hot kitchen in the management team

727
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,800
If you guessed it right

728
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,560
You are also using me to do the appearance

729
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,680
It shows that you are also robbing people

730
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,120
Then you still come

731
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,000
how

732
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,080
Want to use the government to see you

733
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,160
Self-sufficiency

734
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,800
Just take what you need

735
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,560
This is

736
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,200
Everyone can teach

737
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,680
According to your way of doing things

738
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,920
Are you used to it over there?

739
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,200
It's the same wherever you work

740
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:34,020
Just the difference between the

741
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
It causes creeks

742
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,240
How long hasn't it been in this office

743
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,400
Heard my voice

744
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,040
Meigen

745
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,160
I came back

746
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,440
Sis Meng請你們吃

747
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,800
Thank you Sis Meng

748
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
How are you?

749
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Sister Man, you came back just in time

750
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Do you know we are in a very bad situation now?

751
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Yes, that Jiayan, he is the one who made the wrong move

752
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
You know I hate it when people talk about right and wrong

753
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Let's talk about it after work

754
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Come and eat together

755
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
I bought yours too, I'm now in the dance group

756
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Thank you sister Man

757
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Sister Man

758
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Come by yourself

759
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Why are you all standing there?

760
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Take your seats and eat while sitting

761
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Thank you sister Man

762
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Why are you here?

763
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
You don't want to sit in George's seat, do you?

764
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Do you know what the next sentence is of the two generals and Wu Ruobin?

765
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
I read the Western books, I don't know

766
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Actually, shouldn't you be transferred back to manage the English station?

767
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
It's the strong general's subordinate, Ji Yongcai

768
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
It's the strong general's subordinate, Ji Yongcai

769
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
It's the strong general's subordinate, Ji Yongcai

770
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
You don't have to be in charge of everything

771
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
You can only get the people's attention by clapping and walking

772
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I told you that you are the political kindergarten of the office

773
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
I told you that you are the political kindergarten of the office

774
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Hong Kong is not only a news reporter

775
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
The news is not only one angle

776
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
The exclusive is not only you

777
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
What I found

778
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Will not be worse than your video

779
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
If it's true

780
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
He won't want to buy my video so much

781
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Sister Man, this way please

782
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Then I won't see you off

783
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Sister Man

784
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
And if I come back

785
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
The position will not be negative

786
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
It's right

787
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Let's talk about it when we can

788
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Even the office of the concubine is dismantled and rebuilt

789
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
The last song is not very good

790
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
The last song is not very good

791
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
The last song is not very good

792
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
I'm not only good at counting

793
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Of course, the wind and water are so bad

794
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
We don't believe anything in the news

795
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Just believe the facts

796
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Is there a sample

797
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Pay and unlock

798
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
If I say that I want you

799
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
What about

800
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Sister is interested

801
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Although I said it, I don't believe it

802
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Tell me if you believe it

803
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
There is also an empty office

804
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
With Zhang Jiayan

805
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I set the position

806
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Content director

807
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Is it comfortable

808
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Those who are smart and smart can't lie to me

809
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
If there is something, who am I with you

810
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Give you another special offer

811
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Reform rights

812
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I wanted to do it before you left

813
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Come in and finish it

814
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
I don't like it

815
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
There is a person who doesn't know how to do news

816
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
The person who knows how to do news is here

817
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
A knife on the head

818
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Even if you don't chop it down, you will be able to do it

819
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
My knife is not only SNK

820
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
So look down

821
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Let's talk about your video first

822
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Your video is not only on TV

823
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Network media can't afford it

824
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Live-in machine

825
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Such a high cost

826
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
But if you don't sell it to SNK

827
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
I will be in a hurry

828
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I will make the whole industry not buy your video

829
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
The whole industry does not buy your video

830
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Then after the prime time, your video will be wasted

831
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
The old expert like Fei Ye

832
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Maybe possible

833
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
You are an outsider

834
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Which one can you teach to read the news

835
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
News is not my profession

836
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
I am engaged in business

837
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
I don't have those news ideas

838
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
I have no bottom line

839
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Your previous opponent

840
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
George Fei Ye

841
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
A little student

842
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
You can fight for power with him

843
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
SNK is a listed company

844
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
I play the stock price

845
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
You don't think you can affect the stock price if you broadcast good news

846
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
You really think this place is so easy to sit

847
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Then you think about how to explain to sister

848
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
How did you miss me

849
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Okay, I'll wait and see where your video is broadcast today

850
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
I will broadcast it immediately

851
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Okay

852
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,800
I will broadcast it

853
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
OK

854
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
I will broadcast it

855
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Good

856
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Brother Jie

857
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Brother Jie

858
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Thank you

859
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Sister Man

860
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Come

861
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Sister Man

862
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Hello

863
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,760
Then I'll be honest

864
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,560
I want to invite you to join our public platform

865
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,440
it is good

866
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,800
The helicopter rented 96,000 for two hours

867
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,160
I haven't paid my salary yet

868
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,840
You six bullet

869
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,280
Our public platform has just started

870
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,840
The revenue has not yet balanced

871
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,720
So in terms of funds, I have no money

872
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,160
No money, no people, no resources, no means

873
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,360
Even the dog's nest office above

874
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,960
It was all shared by Ah Jie to you

875
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,880
You want to invite me

876
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Sister Man, I won't bother you anymore, we're leaving

877
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,680
Sister Man, I worked with you several times

878
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
I really feel from you

879
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,200
Learned a lot

880
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,000
You learn that you have benefits

881
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,400
I work with you and work in advance

882
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,360
What's my advantage

883
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,800
I know you have a passion for news

884
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
I am the same

885
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,440
So which company can give me

886
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,240
Set up a good stage, I'll go there

887
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,360
How about Ben

888
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,360
Didn't sell

889
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,640
Waiting for you to open

890
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,840
You wash the bowl at night

891
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
Didn't you hear what Sister Man said

892
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,960
The best way is to go to the hospital

893
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Good stage

894
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,440
Good stage doesn't have to be defeated by money

895
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,040
We just have to answer the right question

896
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,520
Can attract Sister Man

897
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,040
As long as the news is not over

898
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,200
I haven't lost

899
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,920
Open the door

900
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,080
Zhang Jiayin, why don't you hand over the video of your camera?

901
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,200
This is the agreement between me and the visitor

902
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,640
The video is not your personal item

903
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
This belongs to the company

904
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,080
But it's still not broadcast

905
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,000
It's the company's decision, it's not your decision

906
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,760
For the company

907
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,360
You shouldn't broadcast this video

908
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,000
Violate the will of the visitor

909
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,480
It's easy to have a counter-effect

910
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,440
Public relations disaster

911
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,360
Is it public relations disaster

912
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,720
It's also my decision, it's not your decision

913
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
If there is something

914
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,640
I will find a way

915
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,560
Is it to alert the Ministry of Law

916
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
And alert Mrs. Fang

917
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,640
Givethree

918
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,000
Thank you

919
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,760
But can you promise me a little

920
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,760
Can't broadcast

921
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,840
Because i don't want my son

922
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,600
I think i am a bad person

923
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
I

924
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:52,200
I knew that there was a wall there.

925
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
But I still removed it.

926
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
It's my fault.

927
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Then what happened?

928
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Then the ceiling began to collapse.

929
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Then the floor began to be lighter.

930
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Finally, the ceiling collapsed.

931
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
So you think the wall was broken down because of the collapse, right?

932
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Or you can help me find it.

933
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Come here.

934
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Let's talk about the direction of the prime time.

935
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Each person takes one.

936
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Collapse.

937
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Yes.

938
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
The picture is very shocking.

939
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Explosive and save people.

940
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
But in fact, it's not the point.

941
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
We are not shooting a Hollywood disaster film.

942
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
What happened?

943
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
It's just one of the elements.

944
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
We are looking for why.

945
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
It can be beautiful with content.

946
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
I compared the nearby architectural drawings.

947
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
I visited many engineers and decoration workers.

948
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,200
I found that the wall is connected to this position.

949
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,200
In fact, it is...

950
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
OK, you can return it to me.

951
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Thank you.

952
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I just called Man.

953
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Wait for him to come back.

954
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I said before.

955
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
I won't let them make up the story.

956
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
I will be fully responsible.

957
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
No conflict.

958
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
I also have to be responsible for Mrs. Fang.

959
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
I have been running outside with my colleagues for a day.

960
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
How tired and hard it is.

961
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,200
You may not understand it sitting in the air conditioner room.

962
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
But thank you for buying the video back.

963
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
You have killed all the efforts.

964
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
In the future, someone will work for you.

965
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
In short, you can't lose tonight.

966
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,200
SNK doesn't have the money to take risks for you.

967
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
In terms of completeness, depth and body angle.

968
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
I have confidence.

969
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
It's richer than Wen Huixin's video.

970
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
Yes.

971
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
Did you see?

972
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Our King Sir humiliated the deputy director in public.

973
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Will Man come back?

974
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
We will test the water tonight.

975
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
If the water is really clean,

976
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Even if you don't come back tomorrow night,

977
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
You will come back the day after tomorrow.

978
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
OK.

979
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Make a good luck charm.

980
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Congratulations to my new queen back.

981
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Tidy up the workplace.

982
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Yes.

983
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
I will send you a cheque as soon as possible.

984
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
But I don't want a soft copy.

985
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I want the original SD card.

986
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I will send someone to get it.

987
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
I will send someone to get it.

988
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
It will start in half an hour.

989
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
Everyone is ready.

990
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Please come to the broadcast tonight.

991
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,200
But we have to leave a space.

992
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Ake.

993
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Let the best driver of the car

994
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,200
Go to Wen Huixin to get something.

995
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
I'm so confused.

996
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
I found a mirror

997
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,200
Somewhere in my heart

998
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
Beautiful

999
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
It's beautiful

1000
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Deep inside my heart

1001
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Try to break the ice

1002
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I'm so confused

1003
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,200
I found a mirror

1004
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Try to brighten up your eyes

1005
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,200
Cause the truth will never lie

1006
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Just wipe away and make it clear

1007
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,200
In my mind

1008
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,200
It's hard to still have got to try

1009
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Cause the truth will never die

1010
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,200
For always all the way

1011
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,200
All the time

1012
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
Thank you for watching.
