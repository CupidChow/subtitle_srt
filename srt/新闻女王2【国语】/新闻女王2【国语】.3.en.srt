1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,140
River Cast только

2
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,040
Pull over

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,100
Hello

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,840
Rnu

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,660
Don't move

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,500
What happened

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,700
I told her

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,540
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,860
The fried rice is so dry.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Why don't you resign?

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,260
SNK is no longer the same as before.

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,020
There are so many problems with illegal racing.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,100
They don't go to check it out.

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,260
They just broadcast it.

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,420
I really can't accept it.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,260
SNK hasn't changed.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,500
Jiayan has changed.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,940
Anyway,

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,020
I think there's nothing worth me to stay here.

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,340
How about this?

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,580
We'll go to Rome together.

22
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,140
I used to work in two companies.

23
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,060
But they all closed down.

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,860
Then I went to SNK.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,660
I know everyone is laughing at me behind my back.

26
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,740
I'm a third-party slave.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,340
I don't want to be a fourth-party slave.

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,780
Moreover,

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,620
maybe every company has its George,

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,700
its Fei Yan,

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,140
and Zhang Jiayan.

32
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,220
Maybe this is the world.

33
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,700
I'll be unhappy no matter which company I go to.

34
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,700
You can be disappointed with people.

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,300
But you can't be disappointed with the news.

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,300
Okay.

37
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,860
How about this?

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,100
We'll open a platform and do it ourselves.

39
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,260
You can open it.

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,420
Are you a rich second generation?

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,780
Now the threshold for online media is very low.

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,660
Just have a mobile phone.

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,820
Didn't you say that

44
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,380
people who don't enter the industry can only do online media?

45
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,460
Can you afford it now?

46
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,860
We?

47
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,340
My smart materials

48
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,940
plus your dark-gray-naked-cow-cow.

49
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
I don't believe

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,020
I can't make the most professional and in-depth report.

51
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,260
Okay.

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,100
Let the citizens of Hong Kong know

53
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,900
that online media can do this.

54
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,980
They can only grab the spotlight and the attention.

55
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,460
We don't need to go through the process.

56
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,740
We don't need to be stopped by the boss.

57
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,220
It's faster than the TV station.

58
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,700
The readers can see it immediately.

59
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,860
We'll be the reporters,

60
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,780
we'll be the editors,

61
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,220
and we'll be the bosses.

62
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,380
You'll be the one who will sweep the floor.

63
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,100
No one can stop us.

64
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,780
How to report?

65
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,300
The most important thing is to show our conscience.

66
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,020
We'll do our best.

67
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,460
When the online media sees the news,

68
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,260
they'll come to verify it immediately.

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,980
Not only the online media,

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,380
but also a fair and open platform.

71
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,660
The news will not be

72
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,300
only broadcasted to you by the anchor.

73
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,780
It can be participated by everyone.

74
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,620
It can be commented on.

75
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,180
It can also be provided with information.

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,900
Okay.

77
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,500
Okay.

78
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,980
We'll resign immediately.

79
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,660
Let's go.

80
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,780
Finish the meal first.

81
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,420
Yes.

82
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,020
Don't waste it.

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,740
Cheers.

84
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,900
Cheers.

85
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,900
Cheers.

86
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,100
The most important thing is to show our conscience.

87
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,140
We'll be the reporters,

88
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,100
we'll be the editors,

89
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,340
and we'll be the bosses.

90
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,700
The readers can see it immediately.

91
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,660
We'll be the reporters,

92
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,780
we'll be the editors,

93
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,020
and we'll be the bosses.

94
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,780
The most important thing is to show our conscience.

95
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,820
We'll do our best.

96
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,780
We'll do our best.

97
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,740
We'll do our best.

98
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,700
We'll do our best.

99
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,820
We'll do our best.

100
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,860
We'll do our best.

101
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,900
We'll do our best.

102
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,940
We'll do our best.

103
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,020
We'll do our best.

104
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,980
We'll do our best.

105
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,980
We'll do our best.

106
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,100
We'll do our best.

107
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
We'll do our best.

108
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
We'll do our best.

109
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,100
We'll do our best.

110
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
We'll do our best.

111
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
We'll do our best.

112
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:40,280
The Spring predicted a

113
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,780
taxi.

114
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,060
We have to make sure the worker gets it.

115
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,860
Rail sil incumbent.

116
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,060
As the station hasekore mulubi���洲

117
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
we can only wait for our schedule.

118
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,700
The staff hasn't been at home much lately.

119
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,380
The returning transplant would be more difficult more.

120
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,180
Or you can tell me the reason.

121
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Why I don't buy Wen Huixin's video?

122
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,700
Who said I don't want you to buy it?

123
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,820
I want to persuade you to buy it.

124
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,420
Interesting.

125
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,380
It's no good for you

126
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,940
if Wen Huixin comes back.

127
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,180
No one is stupid enough

128
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,860
to ask a superior to come back and control himself.

129
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,380
You don't want to

130
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,660
divide your power.

131
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,940
But you still have to

132
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,860
explain to Mrs. Fang

133
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,380
that you have to steal talents.

134
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,340
You can't let him and SNK lose face.

135
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,860
So you are in a dilemma.

136
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,020
I can pay the bill.

137
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,220
But you didn't say it on the point.

138
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,100
I have a two-way solution.

139
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,500
Are you interested?

140
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,220
Buy the video and come back.

141
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,540
But don't broadcast it.

142
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,500
SNK broadcast means to announce to the outside world

143
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,380
that our people are not capable

144
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,860
to save the king by Wen Huixin.

145
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,020
If you don't broadcast it, you will lose some money.

146
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,780
But other stations can't broadcast it.

147
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,820
One hit, two hits, three hits.

148
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,580
The final battle of the golden age

149
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,860
is who has the strength to find out the truth.

150
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,780
I am still confident.

151
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,220
We have the most information.

152
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,740
Tonight, the winner will still be SNK.

153
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Mrs. Fang won't be angry.

154
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,100
She will block Wen Huixin.

155
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,100
You can keep your place.

156
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,900
I can also do what I want to do.

157
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,660
Why don't you give me a reason?

158
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,020
Why don't you do it?

159
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,300
Jiang Jiayin,

160
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,440
someone said that you are

161
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,380
the political kindergarten of the office.

162
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,340
So you graduated.

163
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,300
Actually, I don't like to play this game very much.

164
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,900
But if I am forced by the environment,

165
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,700
I have no choice but to play.

166
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,260
I will play at any time.

167
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,300
Once a colleague told me

168
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,100
that this is not compromise,

169
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,820
it's evolution.

170
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,620
Zhang Yifan

171
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,020
Mrs. Zhang,

172
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,820
I promised your husband

173
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,300
I'll find the answer for him.

174
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,180
I hope it won't affect

175
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,260
the image in his mind

176
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,540
when he was little.

177
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,220
Thank you.

178
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,740
It's just my duty to report the truth.

179
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:51,820
According to the notice received by Ms. Wen Huixin, she found a sign of water leakage in the roof of the building near the collapse building in the high air.

180
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,220
So we entered the basement of the building next door and found a crack in her heavy equipment.

181
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,060
So we immediately informed the police.

182
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,460
The police also took action to help the rescue in time.

183
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,580
So that the second explosion caused by the leak of natural gas

184
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,380
didn't cause more casualties.

185
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,060
That's all for today's news.

186
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,020
Thank you for watching the public platform.

187
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,980
I'm Liu Yan.

188
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,140
One found the cause of the explosion.

189
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,540
Another found the cause of the collapse.

190
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,500
Their disciples are quite capable.

191
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,620
Let me give you an example.

192
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,260
You're just like me now.

193
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,540
You're adding meat to this pot.

194
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,700
Should I put it here or here?

195
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,860
Do you have to choose one side?

196
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,060
Let me tell you.

197
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,420
If we open a new pot together,

198
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,020
Don't say it.

199
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,620
It's not impossible.

200
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,500
No.

201
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,340
There are many administrative jobs.

202
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,780
Don't torture me.

203
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,380
I'm just thinking about it.

204
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,380
The check-in is not that big.

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,140
But one day, it will be possible.

206
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
By then,

207
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,220
you'll burn the pot again.

208
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,100
And then I'll wash the pot for you.

209
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,220
To be honest,

210
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,580
I can't choose which side to put it.

211
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,460
Sister Man.

212
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,180
I don't think I'm asking you out.

213
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,100
You know why I'm here this time.

214
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,620
We're really sincere.

215
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,860
Didn't Eneraczy Group

216
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,660
get the new credit card?

217
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
It's just a money in a small bank account.

218
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
Divorce for a contract?

219
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,380
Yes.

220
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,180
We've arranged a contract.

221
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,660
It has to happen without any filters.

222
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,700
The price and position are all there.

223
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,020
It must be asking for a

224
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,500
satisfying offer.

225
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,620
Dad.

226
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,620
You know

227
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,660
I'm very straightforward.

228
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,860
The rounded people outside

229
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,080
call you kidnaps.

230
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,100
You know it, ha?

231
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,540
I'm not afraid of offending people.

232
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,020
Okay.

233
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,260
Do you have half of SNK?

234
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,780
Half of the income?

235
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,260
Half of the salary?

236
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,420
No.

237
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,700
I'm not satisfied.

238
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,500
But I know one thing.

239
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,700
You like the story of the giant

240
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,220
defeating the giant in the Great Wei.

241
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,420
Even if you have no resources, you can win.

242
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,100
That's why you wrote the legend of Nicole.

243
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,300
That's right.

244
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,820
You can win if you want to.

245
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,460
It depends on where you win.

246
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,340
You can't afford me,

247
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,900
but I can afford you.

248
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,940
Except for the different names of the bosses,

249
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
Open Platform and others

250
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,900
can maintain the original state.

251
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,860
People need to know their own values,

252
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,580
and their own skills.

253
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
I'm the limit.

254
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,780
I'll help you achieve

255
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,220
what you want to do but can't.

256
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
What you can't even imagine,

257
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
I'll help you plan.

258
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,900
What you think you've done,

259
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,380
I'll help you do better.

260
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,100
But...

261
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,500
But are we really worth so much?

262
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,020
The ticket was given to me by SNK.

263
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,700
Keep the change.

264
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,260
Great!

265
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,740
I heard that Manji bought Open Platform

266
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,860
and became the boss of Liu Yan.

267
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,420
You're the boss, not the boss.

268
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
Being the king of the mountains

269
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,660
is better than being Mrs. Fang's pawn.

270
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,540
Are we going to give up?

271
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,540
Wen Jiajun is always Wen Jiajun.

272
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,340
No matter where Manji goes,

273
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,340
her influence on SNK is eternal.

274
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,060
I'm just saying. Don't jump to conclusions.

275
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,100
Why did you change Manji's coffee machine?

276
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,140
I bought it.

277
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,420
If the TV department can work hard,

278
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,620
I won't treat you badly.

279
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
The new model,

280
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,020
Kumo AI coffee machine,

281
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,100
is quite expensive.

282
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,220
But it's a pity.

283
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,540
I prefer the old coffee machine.

284
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,020
It's good to be old,

285
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,180
but people need to make progress.

286
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,740
Do we always use the old one?

287
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,940
Do we always use the old one?

288
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,660
You need to learn to let go.

289
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,540
Everyone drinks coffee.

290
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,380
Does everyone like coffee?

291
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,620
In my heart,

292
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,940
there is only one coffee machine.

293
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,380
I won't drink it without it.

294
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,300
At most, I'll change it to tea.

295
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,980
What about you?

296
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,980
Don't think so.

297
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,900
It's okay.

298
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
The machine is here.

299
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,940
It's like the door in the room.

300
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,100
It's always open.

301
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,300
Whether the old one comes back or not,

302
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,820
the decision-making power is not in the hands of the user,

303
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,140
nor in the hands of the machine.

304
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,060
It's the Big Boss.

305
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,740
People leave and tea is cold.

306
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,460
I'm Brian.

307
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,820
I'm responsible for balancing.

308
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,580
Of course,

309
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,060
besides the ability to work,

310
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,860
attitude is also very important.

311
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,860
Sister Jiayuan.

312
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,780
They are new interns.

313
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,100
Hello, Sister Jiayuan.

314
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,820
I'm Smart.

315
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,860
The smart one in SMRT.

316
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,780
Hello, Sister Jiayuan.

317
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,580
I'm Beechers.

318
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,380
Good news is to go everywhere.

319
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,700
No eyes on the fist, change shoes.

320
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,660
Okay.

321
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,660
But it's already a flat-bottom shoe.

322
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,700
It should be cheap.

323
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,860
A month's salary is going to be ruined.

324
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,260
It will make you feel bad.

325
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,660
I don't feel bad.

326
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,900
I bought it specially for平时穿.

327
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,140
The one behind.

328
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,700
What's your name?

329
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,060
Xiaotian.

330
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,300
What?

331
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,900
Xiaotian.

332
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,500
Xiaotian.

333
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,820
Xiaotian.

334
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,860
Xiaotian.

335
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,940
Do you have an English name?

336
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,060
No.

337
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,860
Don't be so nervous.

338
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,060
You don't have to have an English name.

339
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,060
Say a sentence

340
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,620
that has more than ten words.

341
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,460
I started to study in Hong Kong in high school.

342
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,940
Do you know that you have a accent?

343
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,100
What's your background?

344
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,860
Where do you come from?

345
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,540
I don't care.

346
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,660
I care about whether you are professional in the scene

347
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,700
and whether you can read the words clearly.

348
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,620
This is the most basic requirement.

349
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,940
Do you want to be a matchmaker?

350
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,220
It may suit you better there.

351
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,300
No need.

352
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,060
Please read newspapers and improve them every day.

353
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,700
Why are you taking so long?

354
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,140
Come and play mahjong.

355
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,060
Tina.

356
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,180
Yes.

357
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,660
Find an app and install it.

358
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,060
Okay.

359
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,220
Coming.

360
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,380
You can only watch it if you install an app?

361
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,100
It's so troublesome.

362
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,260
Who will watch it?

363
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,700
That man is really a dead man.

364
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,740
Why does he go to the platform for no reason?

365
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,900
Really.

366
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,180
Is your card good?

367
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,260
You don't look angry at all.

368
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,620
Why should I be angry?

369
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,820
He is afraid that I will be angry.

370
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
This sister has put me at ease.

371
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,060
In order not to play against SNK,

372
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,740
she is so proud to be a net media.

373
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,420
She changed the track.

374
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,140
Do you know that

375
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,780
online news and traditional news

376
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,060
are two worlds?

377
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,220
The rhythm and the angle

378
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,220
need to be re-adjusted.

379
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,620
The exposure will decrease.

380
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,020
The credit will be deducted.

381
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,180
The entire brand

382
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,620
needs to be rebuilt.

383
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,700
She has also made great sacrifices.

384
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,820
And

385
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,340
the netizens now

386
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,980
know how bad they are.

387
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,020
Let her touch the nail.

388
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,180
If she knows it's not easy,

389
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,340
she will come back

390
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,060
and play mahjong when she thinks it through.

391
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,940
I am very generous.

392
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,220
I am very welcome.

393
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,300
Wow, you are so generous

394
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,900
Hello everyone,

395
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,700
we have bought tea bags for everyone.

396
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,300
We have any taste

397
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,340
just drink it easily.

398
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,180
Thank you...

399
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:54,280
Excuse me,

400
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
we are gathering on the stage.

401
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,820
This is for you.

402
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,080
retaining temperature on tea.....

403
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,360
experts in teahouse

404
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,340
The cuisine meeting,

405
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,500
laptop

406
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,540
Open the menu.

407
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,380
Brian, check the order.

408
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,740
I've sent it to everyone.

409
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,580
International News.

410
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,580
Jiazhou earthquake.

411
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,580
Amber, translate more information to the communication agency.

412
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,940
The disaster software and policy hardware need to be balanced.

413
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,580
Got it.

414
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,580
Morning.

415
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,420
Good morning, Mr. K.

416
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,140
Morning.

417
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Don't bother me. Go on.

418
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,460
Okay.

419
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,100
Local News.

420
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,940
Excuse me.

421
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,620
I want to ask why there's no Liu Fushan's murder case?

422
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,100
Because there's no angle.

423
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,780
But other agencies reported it.

424
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,540
We didn't suffer much loss.

425
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,460
First, we're not from other agencies.

426
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,300
Second, I think the Yezhu Conference is more important.

427
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,100
It can be a benchmark for the future development community

428
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,940
to follow the collapse.

429
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,780
But I don't believe my husband and my mother-in-law

430
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,980
will be more shocked than me.

431
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,180
Give me the drink. Thank you.

432
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,780
Got it.

433
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,900
Mr. Tian,

434
00:17:52,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Do you think

435
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,180
our people should go against Jing Yui?

436
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,260
You don't have to hurry to decide.

437
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,380
Got it.

438
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,100
Come on, Jingsha halat Bernie,

439
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Yes, public opinion is also very important.

440
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
Let's vote.

441
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Raise your hand if you support iPhone.

442
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Then raise your hand if you support Vice Director.

443
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Raise your hand.

444
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
You are very good at listening to news.

445
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,100
But you are not very good at people.

446
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Making news is about people, not about profession.

447
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Why not both?

448
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Okay.

449
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
I don't know what you think.

450
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Ordinary citizens and audience like to watch some news with images and excitement.

451
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I am very ordinary.

452
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,100
I vote to see people.

453
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
The issue of big maintenance is not bad.

454
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
But it is a bit quiet.

455
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Why not stay and do the truth?

456
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Listening to the opinions of the relevant people is also a good thing, right?

457
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,100
So, you three are interns.

458
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
You should be experienced.

459
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,100
Yes, sir.

460
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Continue.

461
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Yes, sir.

462
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Thank you.

463
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
The End

464
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Wang Jiao has a wife.

465
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Liu Fushan has a lover.

466
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,100
We make big news.

467
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
We shoot these old men and old women.

468
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100
My eyes are still swollen.

469
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Sister Nanen must have her reasons.

470
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
If you don't believe it, don't sell it.

471
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
You must believe it.

472
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,100
I don't want you to have 51% of the equity and the right to make decisions.

473
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
I won't sell it.

474
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
I know you have worked hard.

475
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Thank you.

476
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Thank you.

477
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
No way.

478
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,100
This little thing is so big that it needs to be filmed.

479
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Is it the kind of thing that is filmed in the morning and broadcast at night?

480
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,100
I know him.

481
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
He is a reporter from SNK.

482
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
You are right.

483
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
I am a reporter.

484
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
My name is Liu Yin.

485
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
But I don't work in SNK.

486
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
I am now on an open platform.

487
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
What platform?

488
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
I haven't heard of it.

489
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
What platform?

490
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Internet platform.

491
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,100
It's the kind of thing that makes news and deceives people to watch advertisements.

492
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,100
You are all deceived.

493
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
Mr. Zhuang is not a good person.

494
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Take it and see.

495
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,100
No matter how small the news is, there is a place for it to be reported.

496
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Find the right angle to help society.

497
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,100
He is not a good person.

498
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Blood is not returned.

499
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Do you want to have blood?

500
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
What is your name?

501
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
Sister Fan.

502
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Sister Fan, do you have any dissatisfaction with this meeting?

503
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Why don't we do an interview later?

504
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
What's the use of telling you?

505
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,100
I want to find a big platform.

506
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
The big platform is one sentence.

507
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
It's ten sentences better than our seven little fans.

508
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
We are also a media company.

509
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Now many people are watching the news online.

510
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
I don't know how to go online.

511
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
How can I find you?

512
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,100
Yours.

513
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
What platform is a reporter?

514
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Is there a difference?

515
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Don't care about this kind of big sister.

516
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
I can't do it.

517
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
Don't be shy, director.

518
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Drink some more tea.

519
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
I give you a chance.

520
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Don't do any more small moves.

521
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
I won't say it again.

522
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Thank you.

523
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Look what I wrote.

524
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
You really don't even have a coffin.

525
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Look at the new people of SNK.

526
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Dressed up like you were stupid.

527
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
You are so silly.

528
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
Do you remember my first news?

529
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Uncle Si Jue.

530
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Knife, gun and hostage.

531
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
You are lucky to be fine.

532
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
In fact, we can still stay in this line.

533
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
It's quite lucky.

534
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Yes, it is.

535
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
The problem is that we haven't improved.

536
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Look.

537
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
The big stage won't be wrong.

538
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Send new people over.

539
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
It means this news is reliable.

540
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
If it's messed up, it won't affect the menu.

541
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
In the eyes of the man.

542
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Uncle Si Jue.

543
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,100
We are also of this level.

544
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Don't say that.

545
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Since Sister Man asked us to come,

546
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
there must be a reason.

547
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Hello, hello.

548
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,100
I am the representative of the main case law team of Yaoshan Building.

549
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Xiao Xingzhuang.

550
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Yes, yes, yes.

551
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Please give us your guidance.

552
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Mr. Zhang.

553
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Thank you for your interview.

554
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,100
I have paid for your open interview.

555
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Thank you.

556
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Thank you.

557
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Mr. Zhang.

558
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Before we start,

559
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
let's do an interview.

560
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
An interview?

561
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Okay.

562
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Okay.

563
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
These old owners.

564
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
It's a bit difficult to ask them to do an interview.

565
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
I'll do it.

566
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Okay.

567
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Wait.

568
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Okay, start.

569
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
Hello, I am Liu Yin.

570
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
I am now in the main case law team of Yaoshan Building.

571
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
The one beside me is the representative of the main case law team.

572
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Mr. Zhang.

573
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
Mr. Zhang.

574
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
What is the purpose of the meeting today?

575
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Actually, our Yaoshan Building

576
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,100
is older than the old building house that Yuan Lang just collapsed.

577
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
The situation of the year-long renovation is even worse.

578
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Usually, there will be mud and mud falling down.

579
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
The cracks on the outer wall of the building

580
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
can be covered with a five-dollar coin.

581
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Some of our neighbors

582
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,100
dare to go to the toilet with their helmets on.

583
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
I am not joking.

584
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,100
We are also worried that accidents will occur.

585
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,100
So we hope to speed up the renovation.

586
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
So we should get the ticket earlier.

587
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
We will start the ticket today.

588
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
You are using your own tricks as a warning.

589
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
This guy.

590
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Don't believe him.

591
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
He is harming the people, you, me and the neighbors.

592
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Ignore him.

593
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
We will start the ticket now.

594
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Don't believe him.

595
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
He is harming everyone.

596
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,100
Sit down.

597
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Sit down.

598
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
Sit down.

599
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Sit down.

600
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,100
Idiots.

601
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
You are being sold and you are counting money for others.

602
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Hello, everyone.

603
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
I am Zhuang Yongchang.

604
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
We will start the ticket today.

605
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
I hope that the big renovation this time

606
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
can make everyone feel at ease

607
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
and change to a peaceful and happy home.

608
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Great.

609
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Great.

610
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,100
The only supplier, Lengxian Engineering.

611
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Great.

612
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
The total renovation fee.

613
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
Our 28 units of the military.

614
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
Each unit needs to bear

615
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
a 36-million-yuan renovation fee.

616
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
That's right.

617
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
You are not going to rob?

618
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,100
What is wrong with you?

619
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
You should not rob.

620
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,100
You should not rob.

621
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
You should not rob.

622
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
You should not rob.

623
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
You should not rob.

624
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
You should not rob.

625
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
You should not rob.

626
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
You should not rob.

627
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
You should not rob.

628
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
You should not rob.

629
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
You should not rob.

630
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,100
You should not rob.

631
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
You should not rob.

632
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
No, no.

633
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Listen to me.

634
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
I understand what you are worried about.

635
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,100
But

636
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,100
this time it concerns

637
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
the whole building

638
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,100
and even the life and property safety of the passers-by.

639
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
This money is worth spending.

640
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Right?

641
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,100
Right?

642
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
You are scheming.

643
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
You...

644
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Listen to me first.

645
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
The big renovation this time

646
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
You should take more shots.

647
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
I will check Mr. Zhuang's supplier.

648
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
The repair cost is 15,000 yuan.

649
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
It's not that simple.

650
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Wasting time.

651
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
I will not stop until the end.

652
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
I will leave after the interview.

653
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,100
The fire system update is 12,000 yuan.

654
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,100
The water and electricity pipeline update is 15,000 yuan.

655
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
It's more than 30,000 yuan.

656
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
How to pay?

657
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,100
I don't know what to do.

658
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,100
I am already old.

659
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
This time I don't even have a capital.

660
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Who is Mr. Zhuang?

661
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Who is Ms. Fen?

662
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Mr. Zhuang

663
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
moved in recently.

664
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Ms. Fen is our old neighbor.

665
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
She lives in the front house and the back house.

666
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
She runs a health center.

667
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
Sometimes

668
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,100
people from the bank come to collect debts.

669
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Hello, daddy.

670
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
Right.

671
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Can you help me find Mr. Xu

672
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
to get the building report?

673
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
I want to use it to hand in my homework.

674
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
I am waiting to use it.

675
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
I have the homework.

676
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
You guys, come on.

677
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Once.

678
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
He works in the city's reconstruction bureau.

679
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
It's very simple.

680
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
He must have these materials.

681
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Just once.

682
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
Thank you, daddy.

683
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
Love you, bye.

684
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
I also have homework to hand in.

685
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
Bye bye.

686
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Hello, mom.

687
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
I am busy now.

688
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Wait.

689
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
I won't come back for dinner tonight.

690
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Okay, okay.

691
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Okay, bye bye.

692
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Thank you.

693
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Thank you.

694
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Thank you.

695
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
The case of the mountain building

696
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
is very big.

697
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
It's very hard to get a copy.

698
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Once it's repaired,

699
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
it's a big trouble.

700
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
I can't help it.

701
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
After the house collapsed,

702
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
the owners are so worried.

703
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
I don't know what she is thinking.

704
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
She is not well.

705
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Miss Wen, you have good taste.

706
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
This is a hot spot for buying.

707
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
There are endless business opportunities.

708
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Have the developers started?

709
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Just say it here.

710
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Everything is ready.

711
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Once the east wind is in sight,

712
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
we will go to the village to surround the store.

713
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
This way, Miss Ma.

714
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Let's go.

715
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
No more talking.

716
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,100
I will say one last word.

717
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
You tear off the big hat immediately.

718
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,100
Otherwise, I will sue you for slander.

719
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
You sue me.

720
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
What? Are you afraid?

721
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
You are guilty.

722
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
I am not afraid.

723
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
I did so much for the neighborhood.

724
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
For the big business.

725
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,100
Anyway, you tear it off.

726
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
You explain the money first.

727
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,300
card

728
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
Listen to me.

729
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,300
The whole court holds a meeting.

730
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
It is reasonable.

731
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
You voted for the vote.

732
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
I stand in the name.

733
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,300
I am authorized.

734
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Miss, please help me to see it.

735
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
This is...

736
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,300
Let me help you.

737
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,300
This is the financial report in Yaoshan House.

738
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,100
No, the red frame is a problem.

739
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,460
A problem!

740
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,180
You hit me!

741
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,700
Give me back my money!

742
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,300
You hurt me!

743
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,900
Give me back my money!

744
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
What are you doing?

745
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
You crazy woman!

746
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,420
Give me back my money!

747
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,020
You're too much!

748
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,100
I'll call the police and arrest you!

749
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Go ahead!

750
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,820
Go ahead!

751
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,820
Call the police now!

752
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,580
Go ahead!

753
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,780
I've been with you for a long time.

754
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
I'll call the police first.

755
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,980
This is...

756
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
This woman is sick!

757
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,900
You stay here.

758
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
I'll call the police and arrest her!

759
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Hello, 999?

760
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,540
You!

761
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,340
I'll explain the account today.

762
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,940
No one is allowed to leave here!

763
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,060
You're all accomplices!

764
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,540
Don't come over!

765
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,340
I'll kill whoever dares to come over!

766
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,340
Don't come over!

767
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,580
What's wrong?

768
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,940
Hello, Sister Mian?

769
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,420
Someone is holding a knife at the scene.

770
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,940
I'm going to do a live broadcast of PM.

771
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,060
Why aren't you nervous at all?

772
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,100
You knew there was a problem with the legal team.

773
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,980
You sent out the financial report?

774
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
You're a private expert.

775
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,660
You know what to do and what not to do.

776
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,300
Be careful!

777
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,900
Say it!

778
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,420
Sister!

779
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,620
Did you take the money from Chen Man Shang?

780
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,220
Sister!

781
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,460
I've said it many times.

782
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,740
I've always been

783
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,740
good for everyone and the building.

784
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,660
I don't believe it!

785
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,460
Journalist, come here!

786
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,900
Shoot him!

787
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,300
You're a bad representative of the fraud business owner!

788
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,180
I only believe that you can make a claim for me.

789
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,540
Come on, ask me.

790
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
I'll answer your questions.

791
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:23,900
You...

792
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,340
What do you think?

793
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,500
I'm so happy!

794
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,380
I've been cheated hundreds of thousands of times!

795
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,100
Will you ask me questions?

796
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,340
Or will you be a big shot?

797
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:34,980
Sister Fen!

798
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,820
I'll ask!

799
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,500
Sister Fen!

800
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,340
You're so dissatisfied with the owner of the case.

801
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,660
Did you ever attend their meeting

802
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,540
to express your dissatisfaction?

803
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,140
No!

804
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,060
This guy is a representative of the court.

805
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,980
He's obviously a bad person!

806
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,620
I won't play this game with him!

807
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,620
Sister Fen!

808
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
Calm down!

809
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,180
In fact,

810
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,660
there are many channels

811
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,100
that can express your dissatisfaction.

812
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,940
We have

813
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,420
a collection box.

814
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,660
We have a group of Ye family's mobile phones.

815
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,700
You...

816
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,060
You don't have to do this!

817
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,660
Shut up!

818
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,460
Sister Fen!

819
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,140
Shut up!

820
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,780
Sister Fen!

821
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,300
Sister Fen!

822
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,940
Calm down!

823
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,420
Calm down!

824
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,340
You've done so much.

825
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,300
I just want everyone to hear your opinion.

826
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,780
Now is the chance.

827
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,820
There are tens of thousands of people watching.

828
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,620
If you have anything to say, say it now.

829
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,700
We're live streaming!

830
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,740
Live streaming?

831
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,500
Yes!

832
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,460
You!

833
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,980
No!

834
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,500
Say it!

835
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,900
Say it!

836
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,020
What did you do?

837
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,180
I was chosen

838
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,580
by you one by one!

839
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,060
During the bidding process,

840
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,900
we followed the procedure.

841
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,660
It's reasonable.

842
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,620
You can't

843
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,700
oppose it alone

844
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,860
and obey the majority and the minority.

845
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,580
It's against the rules.

846
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,220
One by one.

847
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,220
This one says it's reasonable.

848
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,420
That one says it's like a western-style person.

849
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,340
No wisdom, no position.

850
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,860
Look who's chosen!

851
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,940
Please!

852
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,180
It's because of you!

853
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,740
You made this guy

854
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,860
do whatever he wants!

855
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,540
You think we're money-makers!

856
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,060
There's nothing we can do!

857
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,620
Our building is old.

858
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,300
There's no surveillance system.

859
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,260
There's no security.

860
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,500
There are often accidents.

861
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,940
That's why the maintenance price

862
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,140
is a little higher.

863
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,420
You keep saying that

864
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,860
it's all the surveillance system.

865
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,780
It's more than 30,000 yuan.

866
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,420
Do you need that much?

867
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,340
You can do whatever you want.

868
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,900
It's just a secret operation.

869
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,620
I... I have no choice.

870
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,860
The house in Yuan Lang has collapsed.

871
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,860
That's why the market price is higher.

872
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,500
It's...

873
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,700
It's like eating seafood.

874
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
The price will be expensive

875
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,940
if you scratch the typhoon.

876
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,140
Sister Fen.

877
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,500
How about this?

878
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,220
If you can't get the money,

879
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,700
just sell it

880
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,020
and move out.

881
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,700
Sister Fen!

882
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,660
This is my house.

883
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,300
I want to live with him.

884
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,700
No!

885
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,420
The empty space

886
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,100
is where the Dian Dian Er can stay.

887
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,900
Yes, yes. Right here.

888
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,620
The owner took out the knife.

889
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,580
That's enough.

890
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,100
Mr. Pin.

891
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,540
You're the new owner.

892
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,100
Prepare for an emergency.

893
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,260
Okay.

894
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,860
What else do you have?

895
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,260
Three interns.

896
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,940
One has video to interview the owner.

897
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,860
One got the identification report.

898
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,500
And one is with the photographer.

899
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,860
You have all three angles. Good.

900
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,620
You can edit it as I said.

901
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,380
I'll come and see it later.

902
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,580
Okay.

903
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,100
Be sure to check it.

904
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Sister Fen is our old neighbor.

905
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,980
She lives in the back of the house.

906
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,420
Health center.

907
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,580
This is a good place to cut in.

908
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,940
Unlawful commercial use.

909
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,180
There are many kinds of

910
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,220
illegal commercial use.

911
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,020
So,

912
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,900
the health center can be a foot massage,

913
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,540
a foot bath.

914
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,740
Old age, old age, and a female doctor.

915
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,100
Not serious, but in the love business.

916
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,700
If it's true,

917
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,980
that's interesting.

918
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,900
But remember,

919
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,340
if you're not sure,

920
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,860
you have to add a word in front of it.

921
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,420
To avoid legal responsibility.

922
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,500
Yes, sir.

923
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,860
Marco.

924
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,420
Yes.

925
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,780
Change the advertisement.

926
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,420
A 60-second loan advertisement.

927
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,420
A 20-second loan hotline.

928
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,100
And a Biyun Town advertisement.

929
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,700
Okay.

930
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,700
Hello, Sister Fen.

931
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,300
Hello, Sister Fen.

932
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,540
Calm down. Calm down.

933
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,340
No weapons. No weapons.

934
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,340
I'm a negotiation expert sent by the police.

935
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,340
My name is Li Jiajun.

936
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,540
You can call me Jiajun.

937
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,100
You can tell me if you need anything.

938
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,340
Actually,

939
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,140
the other owners are not young anymore.

940
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,980
Why don't you let them go first?

941
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,020
I'll sit here and talk to you slowly, okay?

942
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,020
Okay.

943
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,020
I can't turn back now.

944
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,500
Sister Fen.

945
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,020
Think about it.

946
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,020
If anything happens,

947
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,420
this live broadcast will be a public service.

948
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,900
You're in such a big trouble now.

949
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,860
You're so nervous about the mountain house.

950
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,940
For your family.

951
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,700
If you really go to jail in the future,

952
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,860
you won't be able to go home.

953
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,740
Yes, Sister Fen.

954
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,020
I'm old.

955
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,100
I can't go home without a heart.

956
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,540
Let us go first.

957
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,940
Sister Fen.

958
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,460
I should take the medicine.

959
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,020
I'll take the medicine at home.

960
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,860
Where?

961
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,380
I have to go home and take my grandson.

962
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,100
Actually, I'm a little nervous.

963
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,620
You can't go.

964
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,620
Okay.

965
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,580
And...

966
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,060
And me.

967
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,740
I haven't used the toilet yet.

968
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,260
Sister Fen.

969
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,100
She's just an intern.

970
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,700
Our public platform is different.

971
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,020
We already have an audience.

972
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,220
We have experience.

973
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,180
I'll stay and continue to do live broadcast for you.

974
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,860
Tell them

975
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,860
I'm not a psycho.

976
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,740
I'll help you.

977
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,980
Please.

978
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,140
Let us go.

979
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,420
Let us go, okay?

980
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,300
Sister Fen.

981
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,900
Please.

982
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,100
Let them go.

983
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,220
Thank you, Sister Fen.

984
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,580
This way.

985
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,540
This way. Yes.

986
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,700
Okay.

987
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,020
Come on. This way.

988
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
Thank you.

989
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,380
Thank you.

990
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:49,900
Okay.

991
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,940
If you need anything, just tell me.

992
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,180
I can help you.

993
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,140
You can't help me.

994
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,180
I want to see SNK's Wen Huixin.

995
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,140
Can she help me?

996
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,660
Okay.

997
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,140
Calm down, Sister Fen.

998
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,660
You want to see Wen Huixin, right?

999
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,740
No problem.

1000
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,140
Give me some time.

1001
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,940
I'll arrange it now.

1002
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,540
I'll bring her to see you soon, okay?

1003
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,540
Calm down.

1004
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,660
We found out that the suspect

1005
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,820
is in the private sector of the building.

1006
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,260
And there's a debt problem.

1007
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,820
The debtors' bank is about 800,000 yuan.

1008
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,500
It's enough to prove that the kidnapping

1009
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,860
is not as simple as the suspect said for public benefit.

1010
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,260
It's about financial difficulties and debt disputes.

1011
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,780
Go away!

1012
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,420
You're not a psycho!

1013
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,940
No! No!

1014
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,500
Sister Fen, calm down.

1015
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,460
Calm down.

1016
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,940
Live again. Live again.

1017
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,380
I'm having a serious massage.

1018
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,420
They lied.

1019
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,220
You said they would help me.

1020
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,020
You lied to me.

1021
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,100
Now they found the bank's letter of pursuit.

1022
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,140
These evidences are not good for you.

1023
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,220
We can't control the public opinion.

1024
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,060
But calm down first. Don't talk nonsense.

1025
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,500
I just want to live until I die.

1026
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,300
Why do you push me so?

1027
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,140
Now we need more than 300,000 yuan to repair it.

1028
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,980
It's not right.

1029
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,540
It's unreasonable.

1030
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
You! Come here!

1031
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,740
Don't come here!

1032
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,700
Come here!

1033
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,540
Help!

1034
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,140
Help! Help!

1035
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,060
Help!

1036
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,140
Don't come here!

1037
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,380
We have no way out.

1038
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,140
We're all in the same boat.

1039
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,220
Sister Fen. Sister Fen.

1040
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,140
Take your time.

1041
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,540
There's no need to make a fuss.

1042
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,620
We're all in the same boat to repair it.

1043
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,820
It's not about money.

1044
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,500
It's about principle.

1045
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,660
You bastard.

1046
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,980
You bullied our master.

1047
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,220
You're afraid of trouble.

1048
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,220
You're the one who should die if you

1049
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,340
take control of the law and take our money.

1050
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,820
Excuse me.

1051
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,380
Miss Wen.

1052
00:40:59,380 --> 00:40:59,620
Yes.

1053
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,940
Sister Fen is here.

1054
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,900
Li Si.

1055
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,100
Miss Wen, please.

1056
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,140
It's very urgent.

1057
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,980
We need your help.

1058
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,660
Sister Fen.

1059
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:06,940
How is it?

1060
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,740
Sister Fen took Mr. Zhuang to the rooftop.

1061
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,140
He's not feeling well.

1062
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,660
The rooftop is over there. Follow me.

1063
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,140
Sister Fen.

1064
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,020
Don't do anything stupid.

1065
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,100
There's still room for improvement.

1066
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Come here, okay?

1067
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,620
You want to see Wen Huixin?

1068
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,700
I'll bring her here.

1069
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,300
Hello, Sister Fen.

1070
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,100
I'm Wen Huixin.

1071
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,900
Actually, I've been following up on the incident at the Pharmacy.

1072
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,700
I found a lot of problems.

1073
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,020
I've handed the information I found to the police

1074
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,020
and the Lian Zheng Department.

1075
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,980
We'll tell everyone what we found

1076
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,980
on the public platform later.

1077
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,020
We'll find the truth by then.

1078
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,060
I don't want any public platforms.

1079
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,780
I'm looking for Wen Huixin

1080
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,140
because I want to broadcast on SNK.

1081
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,100
I've already left SNK.

1082
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,340
I want Wen Huixin from SNK.

1083
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,580
I don't want Wen Huixin from other companies.

1084
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,580
I want Wen Huixin from SNK.

1085
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,060
I want the highest-grossing news in Hong Kong

1086
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,300
to help me seek justice

1087
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
and give me an answer.

1088
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,980
I couldn't make it clear

1089
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,980
I'm so confused

1090
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,180
I found a mirror

1091
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,100
somewhere in my heart

1092
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,980
Beautiful, it's beautiful

1093
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,740
Deep inside my heart

1094
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,980
Try to brighten up your eyes

1095
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,180
Cause the truth will never lie

1096
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,660
That's why the way I'll make it clear

1097
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,980
In my mind

1098
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,340
It's hard just to have got to try

1099
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,700
Cause the truth will never die

1100
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:40,140
For always, all the way, all the time
