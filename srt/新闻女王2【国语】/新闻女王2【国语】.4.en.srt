1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What garbage did you bring out behind my back?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you report this, it will stir people's emotions,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
it will harm the safety of the hostage, and it will kill them!

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,600
I already used the last word.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,400
Last word is not a shield.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,400
What the news requires is accuracy.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,200
Don't think that you can say anything with just a few words.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,200
You are facing the public and you must take responsibility for the society.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,600
It was Kinser who wanted me to say that.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,800
Hey, hey, hey!

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
I never said that. Don't blame me.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,800
What did you say?

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,200
My original words are that if the situation is real, it's interesting.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,800
I just want to remind you that

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
what is not certain is that you must add a few words before.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
Otherwise, you will be held responsible for the law.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,000
Take your things and leave.

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Don't ruin the company's property. I'm suing you.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,400
You are sick again.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,600
If you don't want to do it, then don't!

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
I will go to the scene to clean up the mess.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Evan, you help me report it.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,800
Hey, wait. I want to ask if you wrote the draft or I did.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,600
I wrote it. What's the problem?

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Your draft is famous and difficult to read. Everyone here knows it.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,200
If you don't prepare it beforehand, your tongue will surely get hurt.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,600
It's just that if you use the word accurately and have more professional skills,

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
you won't be able to report it.

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,000
Sorry. I don't have confidence in your draft.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,600
It's none of your business. Go out and interview them.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
Okay.

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,000
You are really good at it. Just let it go.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will handle it.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,800
manifestations

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,700
It won't keep you from working.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
The police and the news agency have a potential proposal

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
for the safety of the hostage.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
I hope you will accept it.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
We hope SNK and the public platform

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,400
will be able to break through the panic

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,200
and make a hit tonight.

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,880
social network

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:08,240
i wei così

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,040
SNKgments given amak tot at a price of 1.20 million,

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,000
is worse than those

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,420
who only pass second-hand comics.

47
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,400
The people on it are easily affected because of the lira and loss.

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,100
How could they do something like that?

49
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,580
I, Wen Hui Xin, finally tore off the label of SNK

50
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,100
and established my own brand image.

51
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,740
Now I have to broadcast with you again.

52
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,940
What I did before was not in vain.

53
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,980
Regarding brand, SNK is the head of the industry.

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,620
The network media that is in the same level with the level of water is not the same level.

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,260
We are in a hurry to cooperate.

56
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,980
Let the audience misunderstand us and help others recite books.

57
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,540
What happened is a great blow to the company's credibility.

58
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,060
I am responsible for this world.

59
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,580
I have the value of news.

60
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,460
I sent people to shoot. I have evidence and a full-page plan.

61
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,380
You want to collect it now that you have joined the team.

62
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,260
Aren't you ashamed?

63
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,060
The public platform has always been broadcasting the owner of the page.

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,180
The public platform has always been broadcasting the owner of the page.

65
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,820
It's a counter-planning plan.

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,580
The whole thing's user is your SNK.

67
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
It's a theme of one-time service.

68
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,460
It's a theme of one-time service.

69
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,860
That's why the situation is so bad.

70
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,660
Either someone is not good at it,

71
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,460
or he deliberately eats human blood steamed buns.

72
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,820
Both are to be condemned.

73
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,020
But after the dissolution,

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,620
he still supports our SNK.

75
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,020
He wants to see me, Wen Hui Xin.

76
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,860
Two people,

77
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,940
it's not long before the prime time.

78
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Cooperation and backup.

79
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,220
Sign it or not?

80
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
I'm not signing it.

81
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,620
I'm just expressing my opinion.

82
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,980
It's about life.

83
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,420
I can let go of the prejudice.

84
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,020
Just cooperate once.

85
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,420
We're all generous.

86
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,820
For the truth,

87
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,220
let's cooperate once.

88
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,620
Two pages are broadcasted in a row.

89
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,020
It can expand the audience group.

90
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,620
Your page is younger.

91
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,420
Your page is more popular.

92
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,220
I really don't know what you're arguing about.

93
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,620
The chain of problems is very important.

94
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,820
The chain of problems is very important.

95
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,020
The chain of problems is very important.

96
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,220
The chain of problems is very important.

97
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,420
The chain of problems is very important.

98
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,820
What are you arguing about?

99
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,020
The chain of problems.

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,220
Sign it.

101
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,620
Anyway,

102
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,220
I'll count on you two tonight.

103
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,820
You deserve it.

104
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,620
I'll bet my eyes on you tonight.

105
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,020
I'll bet my eyes on you tonight.

106
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,620
But who am I depending on my eyes?

107
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,220
Do you mean you?

108
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,420
I mean you.

109
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,020
I did Azure refuse to give you the lift,

110
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,420
but I came anyway.

111
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,420
Thank you, sir.

112
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,220
Mrs. Xiao's cafe is here.

113
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,740
We've been on air for 10 minutes.

114
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,140
We've lost our first round of attention.

115
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,420
In 15 minutes,

116
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,860
we'll be doing a live broadcast of

117
00:05:59,860 --> 00:05:59,980
SNK TV's

118
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,020
two live broadcasts of

119
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,620
The Sky is Breaking.

120
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,100
During this time,

121
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,660
let's review

122
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,220
the incident of the hostage kidnapping

123
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,460
at the nightclub of Yaoshan Building.

124
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,780
Don't mind what other people are doing.

125
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Do your own thing.

126
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,300
Everyone, listen up.

127
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
Tonight's live broadcast

128
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,580
will be very beautiful.

129
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,620
It will show big names

130
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,540
about their style

131
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,420
when they appear on the public TV.

132
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,380
Yes, Your Highness.

133
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,460
Okay, thinking.

134
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,260
Welcome to SNK.

135
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,020
Welcome to the public platform.

136
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,340
I'm Zhang Jiayan.

137
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,420
I'm Liu Yan.

138
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,860
The two TV news programs are starting now.

139
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,500
The owner of the restaurant in Yaoshan Building was kidnapped.

140
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,260
The owner suspected that the restaurant was under maintenance.

141
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,260
The representative of the law firm, Knife Terror, is still in the meeting with the police.

142
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
He's now in the meeting with Wen Huixin.

143
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,700
I'm now at the scene of the kidnapping.

144
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,980
After the police's approval,

145
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,140
I'll go to the front and talk to the owner of the restaurant.

146
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,100
I'll know the latest situation.

147
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,300
Sister Fen.

148
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,420
Is this SNK live broadcast?

149
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,220
We've already contacted the public platform

150
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,020
according to your request.

151
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,380
Take it!

152
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,820
Take it! I can't see it! Take it!

153
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,060
Calm down!

154
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,020
Don't hurt yourself or the hostage.

155
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,260
We understand your difficulties.

156
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,220
We'll tell the truth to all the audience.

157
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,100
We'll hand it over to the staff in the live broadcast room

158
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,620
to tell you the results of the investigation.

159
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,940
Thank you, Wen Huixin.

160
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,180
Next, please watch the exclusive clip that was filmed on this platform.

161
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,500
You!

162
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,700
If you don't explain it clearly today, no one can leave here!

163
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,860
You're all helpers!

164
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,860
For this big repair bid,

165
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,620
the neighbors have four accusations.

166
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,340
Who is right and who is wrong?

167
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,580
Under our cooperation, we will investigate it one by one.

168
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,300
The accusation includes the chaos of the legal team accounts

169
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,860
and the problem with the mark.

170
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,700
The legal team representative has a private deal with the sponsor

171
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,900
to force the residents to leave.

172
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,180
The average audience of the public platform is more than 19,000.

173
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,340
Today, it's 30,000.

174
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,460
Will our revenue increase?

175
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,140
It doesn't matter how much it increases. I won't report it.

176
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,380
It saves people from saying that we're relying on the public platform or Wen Huixin's service.

177
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,340
Then you agree to do the live broadcast?

178
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,220
Data is the most valuable.

179
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,420
Have you thought about it? How come in the same scene,

180
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,420
more than 19,000 people are watching the public platform, not watching SNK?

181
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,220
I don't understand.

182
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,780
That means that more than 19,000 people are their fans.

183
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,300
Even if more than 19,000 people are spreading, it's still limited.

184
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,140
Even if 10 more Wen Huixin will come, it won't be dangerous to us.

185
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,620
This is the scene that the investigation has obtained.

186
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,500
The person in the video is the person in charge of Lengxian project.

187
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,220
With this situation, we ask Wen Huixin to explain the details for us.

188
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,700
According to the investigation, Zhuang Yongchang has been in contact with the person in charge of Lengxian project.

189
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,220
It's hard to make people worry that something unfair will happen.

190
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,580
Say it! Did you receive the money from the sponsor?

191
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,700
I... I'm absolutely sure.

192
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,260
I... I... I...

193
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,580
Answer the question!

194
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,420
Did he get it or not?

195
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,620
You finish reading it first. We have been following up on this matter.

196
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,740
Every time they meet, Zhuang Yongchang will immediately go to the counter to save money.

197
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:54,980
According to the bankbook, the amount is consistent with the monthly fixed expenditure of the Lengxian project.

198
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,820
So it's reasonable to believe that the public account is the cash for the commission.

199
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,100
Did you take our money?

200
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,300
No, no, no, no.

201
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,020
No, no, no.

202
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,740
Don't let the suspect get too excited. Sign it.

203
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,740
Finish reading it first.

204
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,540
The financial report shows that the court's accounts are in chaos.

205
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,780
Experts have evaluated that the bid is three times higher than the estimated price.

206
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,860
The court representative has a private deal with the project's sponsor.

207
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,140
The owner also complained that someone had a hard time buying the project.

208
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,340
This proves that these four accusations are all true.

209
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,460
Various signs show that the additional maintenance is to force the residents to leave.

210
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,020
The company found that the Lengxian project was heavily targeted.

211
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,420
The owner behind the scenes is actually related to the previous collapse of the Yuanlong Tanglou shopping mall.

212
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,420
Let's look at the related reports.

213
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,020
We used AI to integrate several engineering companies,

214
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,900
purchasing agents, and developers' architecture.

215
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,860
We found that they were all based on a group of people in the US.

216
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,780
Does anyone know where Situ Ruitian is?

217
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,500
If you have something to say to Brian, don't blow up my email.

218
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
Have you seen it?

219
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,940
As long as I take one wrong step, all the colleagues at SNK will chase me and not let me go.

220
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,220
The complete truth of the whole thing is in this email.

221
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,300
These are just information.

222
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,980
The information is the one that has been integrated and digested.

223
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,380
You haven't seen it at all.

224
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,620
The company's owner and the developer's boss are of the same name and surname.

225
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,620
The same address. I believe it's the same person.

226
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,820
We also investigated similar conclusions on the public platform.

227
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,020
Let's ask the engineer to look around the Yaoshan Building with us

228
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,220
and see the construction structure of the building.

229
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,820
Usually, it's a water-repellent building.

230
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,620
The construction of the building is very simple.

231
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,620
The building is built with a very simple structure.

232
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
Usually, it's a water-repellent building.

233
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,220
But such a large area should involve multiple water-repellent buildings.

234
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Even the old building is very rare.

235
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,620
I think it's a human-made destruction.

236
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,420
Human-made destruction?

237
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,620
Can you say more?

238
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,420
For example, you see the damage to the wall.

239
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,220
I believe it's caused by the hammer hitting the wall many times.

240
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
Look at this side.

241
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,820
The cut is flat.

242
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
It should be caused by a knife or a saw.

243
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,020
So it's not natural damage.

244
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,820
About two months before the collapse of the old building,

245
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,420
I went to the scene to inspect.

246
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,420
I also observed similar damage.

247
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,620
I thought it was because there were too many houses.

248
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Or the decoration workers were not skilled enough

249
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,220
and caused a large-scale leak.

250
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,420
I didn't expect it could involve the form.

251
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,020
I checked the information.

252
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,820
It's the same as the Yaoshan Building.

253
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,220
It's a place of acquisition and reconstruction.

254
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,620
It's also a place of major renovation and bidding.

255
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,620
So I think there may be a connection between the two.

256
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,420
We took the photo records submitted by the engineers

257
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,220
to ask the Ministry of Health for the cause of the collapse.

258
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,220
They agreed that the collapse of the building

259
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,420
had been damaged by the third party,

260
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,020
which affected the structure of the building,

261
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,220
and the police handled it.

262
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,620
The direction of investigation will be changed from an accident to a form of destruction.

263
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,020
Qiao Tai replied to the local media,

264
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,420
he admitted that he had been acquired by the third party,

265
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,820
but he did not know how to acquire

266
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,220
the other party's aggressive and dangerous means.

267
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,620
He also stopped cooperating.

268
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,220
He said that the lives of residents and property were threatened,

269
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,620
and that there was insufficient evidence to apologize to the public.

270
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,420
After checking the land record,

271
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,020
we found that the so-called third party

272
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,220
had a relationship with Qiao Tai.

273
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
Let's take a look at the timeline.

274
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,820
After the developer Qiao Tai saw the target building,

275
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,220
he was sentenced to the so-called third party acquisition.

276
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,820
He tried to destroy the building

277
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,820
and force the owner to sell the house in a bad environment.

278
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,220
If he still did not break the door,

279
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
he would have the owner's representative of the building

280
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,420
to promote the big renovation

281
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,820
and select the most expensive cold-walled construction for various reasons,

282
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,220
and force the owner to sell the house with additional renovation fees.

283
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,420
But according to the business registration

284
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,420
and company annual reports,

285
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,620
these companies belong to the same owner

286
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,420
who is a cross-border shareholder.

287
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,820
If it is true,

288
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,420
it means that this is a series of

289
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,820
planned and planned forced evictions.

290
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,220
The destruction of these actions

291
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
has led to the collapse of the building.

292
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,020
We hope that the police and related departments will act as soon as possible

293
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,220
and punish the criminals according to the law.

294
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,620
This proves that I did not wrong him.

295
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,420
I am not making trouble.

296
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,020
I am being reasonable.

297
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,820
I just said it.

298
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,220
If you are wrong, what should I do?

299
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,420
No, no. I just lost money.

300
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,020
You said sorry.

301
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Say sorry.

302
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,620
Sorry.

303
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,220
Sister.

304
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,620
Now all of us are standing by your side.

305
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,420
Don't let the people who support you down.

306
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,020
Especially your father, Zhong Yi Ling Gen.

307
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,820
We asked a lot of people.

308
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Your massage technique

309
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,020
is a skill that you learned from your father.

310
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,220
Although he is no longer here,

311
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,820
many neighbors are praising him as a good doctor.

312
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,620
I believe that under his guidance, his daughter will not be a bad person.

313
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,220
My father told me not to lie.

314
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,420
I am not thinking of him dying.

315
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,420
I am thinking of him going to jail.

316
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,820
Okay.

317
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,420
Thank you, Wen Huixin.

318
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,220
Thank you, Miss Wen.

319
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,420
After two rounds of investigation, we finally found the truth and brought the owner justice.

320
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,420
The 6-hour-long kidnapping incident was finally solved.

321
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,420
People were desperate for food and shelter, but in the distance, the interest group was in a state of shock.

322
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,420
They completely destroyed the humble dreams of the small citizens.

323
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,420
The above incident was just a cold mountain.

324
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,420
When the Anle nest is no longer in Anle, how can we be at ease?

325
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,420
Can we participate in the building incident more, and not be a fake?

326
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,420
Let the more useful people have the opportunity to succeed.

327
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,420
Can the official department repair the relevant laws and strengthen the security of the residents?

328
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
That's all for today's breaking news.

329
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Thank you for watching the public platform.

330
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,420
I hope everyone can find their own place in Anle.

331
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,420
I am your anchor, Wen Huixin.

332
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,420
Goodbye.

333
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
I'm sorry, I'm late.

334
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,420
Okay, thank you all.

335
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
Thank you for what?

336
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,420
Next time, I'll force you to cut it.

337
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,420
It's not a bad competition, but it's still about getting the wind.

338
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Are you worried?

339
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,620
Open it.

340
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,420
And I'll show you there's no teleprompter and you are not surprised at all.

341
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,420
You want me to just stop?

342
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,620
I'm pretty sure I'm not.

343
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,620
evacuated already.

344
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Where am I supposed to start?

345
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,220
I need to work.

346
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:40,420
I read all your works tonight.

347
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,420
Everyone, tonight's credit goes to Tian.

348
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,420
What did you call me?

349
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
What did you call me?

350
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
A durian-flavored pizza.

351
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
No way.

352
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
Try it. It's a special price.

353
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Actually, I'm thinking,

354
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,420
why is everyone's picture the same?

355
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
The audience is so different.

356
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
It's already good to have a double.

357
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Don't say such a sad thing. Hurry up and eat.

358
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
In addition to the pastry machine,

359
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
our goal is to make a good media.

360
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
Report the truth, do not lie to the facts.

361
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
So no matter how many people see it,

362
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
we have to continue to do it.

363
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,420
To be unique, have a unique point of view,

364
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,420
so as to break the habit of being a beast.

365
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,420
I don't know when I'll have a chance to see you and Jiayan

366
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
work together.

367
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Cooperation is one plus one equals three,

368
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,420
or from one plus one equals zero, who knows?

369
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
But what I'm most happy about today

370
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
is not because I can cooperate with anyone,

371
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,420
but because I can help the division,

372
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
help the weak group.

373
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,420
Sometimes, I do a meaningful report,

374
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
more than a hundred high-class reports.

375
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
It's very simple.

376
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Why did you choose us to buy Open Platform?

377
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
To sell.

378
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
Because you still keep the sneakers I gave you.

379
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
What are you doing?

380
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,420
The most real feeling.

381
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,420
So ugly, I didn't prepare it.

382
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Look at it first.

383
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
So ugly, you delete it for me.

384
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
Do you have any homework to teach in the Finance Department?

385
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,420
The central and eastern political situation is unstable.

386
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Everyone is worried about the post-pandemic situation.

387
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
Please answer.

388
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
There are two things

389
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
that must be praised by our vice director.

390
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
The coffee machine you chose is really good.

391
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,420
And the coffee beans you chose are better.

392
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
Thank you.

393
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
The second thing is

394
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,420
that the account last night was good.

395
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
Although it is said that it is different,

396
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
it should not be mentioned, but it is not enough.

397
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,420
Our collection score with Open Platform is 82 points.

398
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Okay?

399
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,420
What's wrong?

400
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,420
Won't you applaud?

401
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,420
Director, can we continue?

402
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,420
No.

403
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
Do you still have something to deal with?

404
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,420
You don't deal with it, then I'll deal with it.

405
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
I don't want to be a boss.

406
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
Someone has put personal will,

407
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,420
company will,

408
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,420
and order against the boss.

409
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,420
So you pack up and go.

410
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,420
Still standing?

411
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,420
I'm not standing.

412
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
I'm not standing.

413
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,420
I'm not standing.

414
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
I'm not standing.

415
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
Still standing here?

416
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
What did I do wrong?

417
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,420
There are many excuses to make you the anchor.

418
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,420
Make small movements, split the party and split the faction.

419
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
Is it high?

420
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,420
You can continue.

421
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Still drinking this kind of tea bag, hurt stomach?

422
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
Oh, no.

423
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
No one wants the house.

424
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
The house is broken and no one is maintaining it.

425
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
The acquisition company is now being sued.

426
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Do we really have to guard that house

427
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
for the rest of our lives?

428
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
It's really worse than dying.

429
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
I also sympathize with your situation.

430
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
But what's wrong is not our report,

431
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,420
but the acquisition of your state.

432
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
Do you rather be cheated?

433
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Money is deep in the outside world.

434
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,420
We are now afraid that the house will collapse.

435
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,420
At night, the walls will sound strange.

436
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
It's dangerous to hear it.

437
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
Yes, it's dangerous.

438
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,420
In 2021, a few days before the collapse of the Miami apartment,

439
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,420
residents heard this kind of sound.

440
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,420
But no one found out the reason, so they didn't care.

441
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,420
Later, they found out that it was the sound of steel breaking.

442
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
What are you looking at?

443
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
It's dangerous.

444
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,420
Everyone, calm down.

445
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,420
How about this?

446
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,420
Let's try to contact the government department

447
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
and see if there is anything we can help with.

448
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
Whether it's funding maintenance,

449
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,420
or the incident department intervenes and accelerates the acquisition,

450
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,420
in short, we don't have to worry about it, okay?

451
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,420
Is this really okay?

452
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,420
Yes, can it work?

453
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
How about this?

454
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
So many dear owners,

455
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,420
we have a legal consultant.

456
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
How about talking to him

457
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
about whether it's possible to sue Qiao Tai for civil affairs?

458
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,420
We can take back some compensation

459
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,420
and have a guarantee, right?

460
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,420
It's good, right?

461
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
There's a chance.

462
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Hand in hand, a strike and a strike.

463
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,420
Cut off the people's lives and their conscience.

464
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,420
Bring me here to see these useless things.

465
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Why is it useless?

466
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,420
It's just a theme of revealing the truth.

467
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,420
What can compare with the one who reveals the truth

468
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,420
helping the owner of the property

469
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
to realize his dream and sell the house?

470
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
From what angle?

471
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
You can think about it.

472
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,740
From your perspective,

473
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,100
with our company's connections and resources,

474
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
how hard is it to find a new buyer for them?

475
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,060
If there's no benefit,

476
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,060
you can help the old people to make a living.

477
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,740
Rebuild it.

478
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,940
Every developer wants to do it.

479
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,380
Look at them.

480
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,820
They're so desperate.

481
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,340
We'll build a new factory.

482
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,980
There are so many business opportunities.

483
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,700
We'll make a profit.

484
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,020
When I get the favor of the developers,

485
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,820
and you get the heart of the owner,

486
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,900
we can do the next episode

487
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,980
and win the two and five.

488
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,700
You've calculated it.

489
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,300
Can I refuse?

490
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,300
Yes.

491
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,180
Communicate with them.

492
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,820
Everyone, good news.

493
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,980
The special officer called just now

494
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,740
to praise our two radio stations.

495
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,580
They did a good job.

496
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,780
Give yourself a round of applause.

497
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,460
Good.

498
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,620
The one who successfully

499
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,300
pulled them together this time

500
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,860
is really a great achievement.

501
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,700
Let's give him more applause.

502
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,660
Steven.

503
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,700
Good.

504
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,620
Thank you, everyone.

505
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,620
Thank you.

506
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,700
I'm going to see the media

507
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,980
to talk about this operation.

508
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,740
Steven, let's go together.

509
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,940
Think about how to answer the media.

510
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,820
Thank you for your time.

511
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,900
Thank you, Chief.

512
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,580
SNK's special reporter, Wang Wei,

513
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,020
is not available to answer the phone now.

514
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,700
Please leave a message after the notice.

515
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,580
Hello, I'm Lawyer Shao Junle.

516
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,900
I represent Open Platform.

517
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
Hello, Lawyer Shao.

518
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,500
Excuse me, I have to answer a call.

519
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,020
Mrs. Li, where are you?

520
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,940
Why haven't you come yet?

521
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,260
The lawyer has arrived.

522
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,180
SNK.

523
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,420
The truth.

524
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,540
Okay, okay.

525
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,620
I'll be there soon.

526
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,500
Wait for me.

527
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,540
Where are you going?

528
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,700
What?

529
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,260
SNK promised to help us.

530
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,340
So I have to hurry over.

531
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,940
We're helping you too.

532
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,940
Miss.

533
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,500
There are many people and money.

534
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,140
Which side will you help?

535
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,940
I...

536
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,940
The halo is gone.

537
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,420
Sorry, Lawyer Shao.

538
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,340
I might have let you run for nothing today.

539
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,660
It's okay.

540
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,660
Just take it as seeing the media.

541
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,900
Open Platform shouldn't be like this.

542
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,860
The media shouldn't be like this.

543
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,780
The outsiders look down on us,

544
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,260
but they can't see us.

545
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,420
We're just here to pile up stones.

546
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,940
We can never build Rome.

547
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,540
I must get the funds and resources back.

548
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,780
Welcome to the 5,000 News.

549
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,980
I'm Xian Manzhi.

550
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,580
I have an emergency.

551
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,580
Four cars collided on Tunmen Road.

552
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,300
Two drivers were sent to hospital for treatment.

553
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,860
The traffic is very crowded.

554
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,620
I wonder if there are other...

555
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,420
There's a video.

556
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,180
Is it true?

557
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,300
It happened like this?

558
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,380
It's so scary.

559
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,700
I'd better sit on the subway.

560
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,460
Look.

561
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,660
Before the live broadcast,

562
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,380
everyone knows what happened.

563
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
It's useless to say that.

564
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,700
Tell me.

565
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,580
Why is the prime time news still so good?

566
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,500
I'm a lazy person.

567
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,260
I can help you with the integration.

568
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,580
So the first round of open platform is speed.

569
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,300
The second round is depth.

570
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,060
Speed, depth.

571
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,780
What you need is funds, resources and people.

572
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,380
Do you have it?

573
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,620
Here comes the bait.

574
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,500
I don't know if it's true.

575
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,060
The whole city is on fire.

576
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,020
The website is being cut off.

577
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,100
The first mystery of the secret organization Cicada

578
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,180
appeared on the Internet in 2008.

579
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,380
The statement at that time was that

580
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,020
the most clever person in the world

581
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,620
was found by solving the mystery.

582
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,100
But it's a pity that no one solved it

583
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,060
until the deadline.

584
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,180
It's still a mystery.

585
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,020
The second question appeared in 2012.

586
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,020
It is said that it was solved by a university

587
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,980
of biology.

588
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,300
The answer is Cicada.

589
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,500
The answer is Cicada.

590
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,620
The answer is Cicada.

591
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,660
The answer is Cicada.

592
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,460
The question was solved by a university

593
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,220
of biology,

594
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,140
and succeeded in meeting Cicada.

595
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,020
There is only one question.

596
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,180
That is, if you get one million dollars,

597
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,380
what would you do?

598
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,700
I remember that

599
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,780
I was still in middle school at that time.

600
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,540
Everyone was talking about it.

601
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,900
In 2015,

602
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,060
we know that there were so many awards before it,

603
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,900
the whole city was in a whirlwind,

604
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,780
and there were many participants.

605
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,780
But it doesn't mean that it was solved quickly and easily.

606
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,220
I know the result this time.

607
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,620
In the last two hours,

608
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,100
someone really solved it.

609
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,140
But this time, no one knows who this person is,

610
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,700
what they talked about, and what they did with the money.

611
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,900
No one mentioned this matter anymore.

612
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,500
No wonder there are rumors that it was a fraud.

613
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
It's been ten years.

614
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,580
This year, the fourth question.

615
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,300
What do you think?

616
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,020
Do you think it's from the news perspective or from our company's perspective?

617
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,820
Let's talk about the news perspective first.

618
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,820
If it's from the news perspective,

619
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,620
as long as no one answers this question, it's just a topic on the internet.

620
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,620
It's not a big news.

621
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,820
At most, it's a hot search, a hot search,

622
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,220
or a talk about the history of those three questions.

623
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,220
What about the company's perspective?

624
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,220
Do you want us to solve it and get that million dollars to help open the platform?

625
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,620
Why not both?

626
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,020
Our computers are worse than people's, and people's brains are less than people's. How do we solve it?

627
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,420
It's news if you can solve it, but if you can't,

628
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,020
finding out who Cicada is is a direction of reporting.

629
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,420
Finding out the college student is the second one.

630
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,220
Or, finding out the third mystery person is also fine.

631
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,620
How about it? Any questions?

632
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,220
What is Cicada?

633
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,820
Chana.

634
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,420
I thought it was a moth.

635
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,220
Sorry.

636
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,820
It's your turn.

637
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
Is anyone free?

638
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,620
We're busy helping Jiayan to make a screen.

639
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,620
Xingxing, you guys. Intern.

640
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,020
Yes, sir.

641
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,620
Your phone.

642
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,820
I'll send you a link.

643
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,420
This is the game of the winner.

644
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,020
No matter what, solve it as soon as possible.

645
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,820
Yes, sir.

646
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,220
I want the first person to report this news. It's our SNK.

647
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,220
No problem.

648
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,420
Go. It's real.

649
00:31:48,820 --> 00:32:05,520
vär.

650
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,020
I miss you.

651
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:39,960
The fee for your

652
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,920
belt if you have a

653
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,780
oli

654
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,780
I can't be in the same company.

655
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,780
I know you were fired by SNK and you came to find a job.

656
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
And this is my answer.

657
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
I don't deserve you to give me a chance.

658
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,780
I hired you.

659
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,780
We will only be like this for the rest of our lives.

660
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
It's not good for you.

661
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,780
I thought you were in SNK.

662
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Be a single-sided anchor.

663
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
I'm really proud of you.

664
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,780
Why don't you cherish it?

665
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,780
I think it's time for you to let go of the rest.

666
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,780
Think about your future.

667
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,780
I've thought about it.

668
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,780
I think this is my future.

669
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,780
Ivan, this is not for you.

670
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,780
You should go to a bigger stage.

671
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
This is an excuse.

672
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
Okay.

673
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I won't ask you for any excuses.

674
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
Be it true or false,

675
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,780
an excuse or ten thousand excuses,

676
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
I won't ask you for anything.

677
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
You can go back.

678
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,780
Is he okay?

679
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
He was fired by SNK and came to find a job.

680
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
We don't have money to pay him.

681
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
What are you doing?

682
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,780
Checking the books and solving the code.

683
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
Everyone outside uses a super computer

684
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
to calculate all the possibilities.

685
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,780
But none of them are solved.

686
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,780
The way we use the open platform is to check the books.

687
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,780
I think there's at least one chance of survival.

688
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,780
If not, there's no chance at all.

689
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,780
Miss Wei, look.

690
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,780
The professor of the math department who often plays the I.Q. 150

691
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,780
announced that the challenge failed.

692
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Maybe they're not as lucky as us.

693
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
I'm sorry.

694
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
It's good that you're here.

695
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
He's drunk.

696
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Take him away.

697
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
Get up.

698
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
You're here.

699
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
Let's drink together.

700
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
If people see me at the bar,

701
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,780
and if people see me with you,

702
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,780
both things will affect my future.

703
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
Wang Wei.

704
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
You.

705
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,780
You didn't drink all night.

706
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
Get up. He's not in Hong Kong.

707
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
Go.

708
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Where are you taking me?

709
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
This way.

710
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
I didn't drink.

711
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
Go.

712
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
Wang Wei, your wife is so annoying.

713
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
Are you crazy?

714
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
You love her so much.

715
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
Why did you go to America to find her?

716
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
Not only are you unhappy,

717
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,780
I'm also very unhappy.

718
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
I also want to be like you,

719
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,780
drunk and have a good time.

720
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
But my job is not allowed.

721
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
You think I don't want to find her.

722
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
I also want her to stay with me.

723
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,780
But I'm half a distance away from her.

724
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,780
We don't even have time to say a word every morning.

725
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,780
I'm used to her not being by my side.

726
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
I'm used to solving problems by myself.

727
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,780
I beg you to be sober.

728
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,780
Clean up your mess.

729
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
Don't tell me you can't.

730
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
People in this world are forced to.

731
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
No one is less than anyone.

732
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
You go first.

733
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
I'll deal with it.

734
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
What?

735
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
Can't you find a job?

736
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,780
Didn't Men Jian take you in?

737
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,780
Did Ben from Ernai Tai find you?

738
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
Go back to SNK.

739
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Don't worry about Kingston. I'll treat you.

740
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
I didn't hear wrong, right?

741
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
Why?

742
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,780
There are only a few people in the TV station who can be the anchor.

743
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,780
If I don't want you because of personal grudges,

744
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,780
I'm no different from those who play boxing.

745
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,780
I don't want to be the most annoying person.

746
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
Right?

747
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,780
Come on.

748
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,780
Sister Jiayin, do you mind if I sit here?

749
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
Thank you.

750
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,780
Sister Jiayin, let's eat together.

751
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,780
Sister Jiayin, do you want some coffee?

752
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
Okay.

753
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
Thank you.

754
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
Do you want milk, Sister Jiayin?

755
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Okay.

756
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
Enough, thank you.

757
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,780
Okay.

758
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,780
I have an idea how to deal with Ivan.

759
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
How?

760
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Beat him.

761
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
It's not that simple.

762
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Then ask him to come back.

763
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,780
Kill the chicken and be generous.

764
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Right.

765
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
You be the bad guy, I'll be the good guy.

766
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,780
You fight, I'll treat you.

767
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
I knew it.

768
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
This game is getting better and better.

769
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,780
I just started playing it.

770
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,780
I don't know how to control the fire.

771
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,780
It's a little too much.

772
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,780
Now learn to be smart.

773
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,780
Thank you, Brother Mickey and Sister 18.

774
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
Thank you.

775
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,620
How do I need his information?

776
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,020
No need!

777
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,380
But I also want you to help me.

778
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,780
Sure, thanks.

779
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,340
Let's go.

780
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,280
What's happening in the allen?

781
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,120
Wha?

782
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,620
They sell libraries?

783
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,020
Sorry These shoes made of

784
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,300
Here, this hand Pretty beautiful

785
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,340
That'll be it

786
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,500
No problem

787
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:18,860
Thanks

788
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,500
by

789
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,420
Miss

790
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,060
What is it?

791
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,640
Minqi

792
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,780
Sis

793
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,060
Add me

794
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,260
soldiers

795
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,180
Sahily

796
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,380
Xiaosong

797
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:38,780
Come on

798
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,860
My chair

799
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:40,780
Miss

800
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,860
Miss

801
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:42,860
Su Nian

802
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,300
What are you doing?

803
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,540
Me

804
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,460
has no effect on the reputation of Hong Kong's economy.

805
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,820
Only to go to WeChat.

806
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,700
Who told you to report it?

807
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,740
It's me.

808
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,620
Mr. Ping.

809
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,580
Stand here. Keep playing.

810
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,380
Yes.

811
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,460
Director, let's talk.

812
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,060
I'm tired of talking.

813
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,580
You said that I can decide the news editor.

814
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,060
You didn't remember?

815
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,300
It's you who decide. Not everyone.

816
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,460
So you like to play with language and art.

817
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,460
SNK News.

818
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,540
Not Zhang Jiayan News.

819
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,460
We serve the audience.

820
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,340
Of course we should consider their feelings.

821
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,740
Moreover, the public platform has reported it.

822
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,260
Wen Huixin has reported it.

823
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,300
That's the standard.

824
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,720
Yoona Noritama

825
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,880
Yoona passed the first level.

826
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,980
Over a total of locations.

827
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,300
Is it possible that they don't��

828
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,100
be so ridiculous that...

829
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,980
they give thisiiiiislố into the country to sell that money?

830
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
What's wrong?

831
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
What's wrong?

832
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,300
Did I get a second chance?

833
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,300
What did you do?

834
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,300
So amazing.

835
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,300
It's the Kesa Cacophony.

836
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
All the letters are in the same number.

837
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,300
Yes.

838
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,300
No one would have found out such a simple method.

839
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,300
The example in this book

840
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,300
is to open a document.

841
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Open a document?

842
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,300
Open a document?

843
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Just move it by these numbers.

844
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,300
You will get the first set of letters of the Http.

845
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
It's the second level of the website.

846
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,300
Children's books.

847
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,300
So, the fans don't want smart, but stupid.

848
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,300
It's from 1998.

849
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,300
People who can read this book and understand it.

850
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,300
I guess the person who wrote the book is over 30 years old.

851
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,300
No need to say that.

852
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,300
But you need to have a sense of humor.

853
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
Recall the past.

854
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,300
As long as we find this book,

855
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,300
if there's anything special,

856
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
we can find this person.

857
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,300
You keep going to the second level.

858
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,300
I'll check it.

859
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,300
I'm so confused.

860
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,300
I found a mirror.

861
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Somewhere in my heart.

862
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,300
Beautiful. It's beautiful.

863
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Deep inside my heart.

864
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,300
Try to brighten up your eyes.

865
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,300
Cause the truth will never lie.

866
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,300
Just wipe away and make it clear.

867
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,300
In my mind.

868
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,300
It's hard just to have got to try.

869
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,300
Cause the truth will never die.

870
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:11,300
For always, all the way, all the time.
