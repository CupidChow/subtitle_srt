1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,700
 Instead of getting it now, I'd prefer to wear it when I get married someday. 

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,640
"Someday"... and when is that?

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm home.

4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,850
Welcome back.

5
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,310
Nice timing. I made stir-fry udon for dinner.

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,290
Thanks. I love stir-fried udon.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,620
Let me go put my stuff down first.

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,770
Marriage...

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,580
What?

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,580
Saito is getting married. She texted me.

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,250
Just so you know, she sent the invitation to my company email address.

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,210
- I haven't contacted her since that day. 
 - I didn't say anything.

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,960
Actually, I wanted to talk about that as well.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,690
The man Saito is marrying is Yoshida?

15
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,830
I was also surprised when I heard that.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,160
So will you be attending?

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,910
- Erm... 
  - Does he still have a grudge against Yoshida? 

18
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:29,160
 But Yoshida is my senior. And if I'm the only one not going, I'll stand out even more. 

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,260
Are you okay with it, Koyori?

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,950
Huh?

21
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,650
 He was actually worried about me? 

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,000
Hey. Don't poke someone's cheek when they're eating.

23
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,660
I'll be fine.

24
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,330
Sure, I was depressed when he broke up with me.

25
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:55,920
But ever since the day you and I... did that,

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,070
you're all I could think about. Even I was surprised.

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,110
Is that so?

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,670
So I'm perfectly fine.

29
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,790
I'm happy you are.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,130
What about you? What do you think of Saito getting married?

31
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,040
Hm? I'm happy for her.

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,630
Wait. Why are you asking?

33
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,190
My relationship with her ended back in junior high.

34
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,200
It sure did, but to me...

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,450
Huh? But to you... what?

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,680
Enough about that. Let's eat.

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,730
- But to you... 
 - But to me...

38
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,980
- This stir-fried udon is delicious. 
 - Delicious, huh?

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,750
 Koyori. 

40
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,270
What's the matter?

41
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,060
Which tie should I wear?

42
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,880
It's been so long since I saw you in a suit, it's blinding me!

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,820
Am I so blinding?

44
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,070
But I haven't even put on my tie.

45
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,030
Help me pick, Koyori.

46
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,800
This one, I guess.

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,260
Let's see... This way, right?

48
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,970
Then... Hang on a sec.

49
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,890
You look as pretty as ever, Koyori.

50
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,190
Come on, I can't do your tie when you hug me like that.

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,880
Stop there.

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,280
We're still not done dressing up.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,400
Sorry, I'm really bad with the tie. Do it yourself, okay?

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,530
- Huh? 
 - Go get ready.

55
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,480
Or we'll be late.

56
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,940
- The bride looks pretty. 
- Over here, Ms. Hoshi.

57
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,900
Hey there, Enomoto. Looking sharp.

58
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,480
Thank you. Long time no see, Mr. Akiyama.

59
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,900
Likewise.

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,730
This is my coworker, Kihara. She always looks out for me.

61
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,410
The name's Akiyama. Nice to meet you. Thank you for taking care of Koyori.

62
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,720
Hello, I'm Kihara. Hoshi often tells me about you.

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,520
- She brags most of the time, though. 
 - I do not! Jeez, Kihara!

64
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,830
- Let's go prepare for bingo. 
 - Great idea.

65
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,100
- Come on. 
 - Right.

66
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm so excited.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,600
   
   

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,130
Ladies and gentleman, thank you for waiting.

69
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,320
The bride and groom have arrived.

70
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,420
Please put your hands together and give them a warm welcome!

71
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:53,030



72
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,290
Nice one, Sosuke!

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,100
Really?  I'm so jealous!

74
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,930
Hoshi, we're about to start bingo.

75
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,640
- Got it. 
 - See you later.

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,070
Make sure you win the game, Hijiri.

77
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,020
Mr. Akiyama.

78
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,680
May I have a word with you?

79
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:28,980
   

80
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,100
What number will it be? 
    

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,990
- Number 25! 
 - There you go! Number 25!

82
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,080
That's a nice number.

83
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,720
- Anyone win with Number 25? 
 - No one.

84
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,480
Looks like no one has gotten bingo yet. Let's carry on and roll the numbers.

85
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,320
- You see... 
 - Y-Yes?

86
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,310
Thank you for coming to our wedding.

87
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,770
Thank you for inviting me. Congratulations on your wedding.

88
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,910
Thank you for the well wishes.

89
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,840
And, well...

90
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you both.

91
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,740
You don't have to apologize.

92
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,990
- What? 
 - Congratulations!

93
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,110
- This is great! 
 - Congratulations.

94
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,890
Because I never planned on giving up Koyori,

95
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,630
nor did I think she'd go back to you.

96
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,200
I see.

97
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,800
I kind of expected it anyway.

98
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,790
I could tell by looking at her.

99
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:00,330
Or rather, I couldn't tell because I wasn't looking at her.

100
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,230
Wait. Is it okay for you to be over here?

101
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,180
- Perhaps it's time toãƒ¼ 
 - I was shocked, you know.

102
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,780
Pardon?

103
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:19,590
She brazenly declared you were the person she loved, even when you weren't around.

104
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,950
I've never introduced anyone as "the person I loved," especially now as an adult.

105
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,050
People normally introduce their partners as "boyfriend" or "girlfriend," don't they?

106
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,570
But for Hoshi...

107
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,150
- Here you go. Big congrats to you. 
 - Congratulations.

108
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,500
 If you do anything to hurt the person I love, I won't forgive you. 

109
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,930
Koyori said that?

110
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,760
Whether you two were dating or not,

111
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,840
to Hoshi, you were always "the person she loves".

112
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,660
I wonder if I'll ever experience that sort of passion with someone myself.

113
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,390
How can you say that? You're the groom.

114
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,770
What?

115
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,160
That "someone" to you would be Saito, no?

116
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,040
- Oh. 
 - What do you mean "oh"?

117
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,700
A lot has happened between us.

118
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,130
I was lied to and being strung along.

119
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,880
Right... What?

120
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,890
Our relationship was always ambiguous, romantic or otherwise.

121
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,170
Heck, I didn't even plan for marriage.

122
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:41,160
W-Wait a minute... Then what changed your mind?

123
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,320
When we were having dinner at my place...

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,110
 Representative Tsuki has held a press conference regarding his adultery scandal. 

125
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,900
 - What should be done moving forward... 
 - Not another affair. 

126
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,650
Seriously, it's unbelievable.

127
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,810
I could see us keeping up this lifestyle we'd carved for ourselves.

128
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,540
Then I said it.

129
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,970
 Let's get married. 

130
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,600
 Erm... 

131
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,590
I was expecting her to snort with laughter.

132
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,480
But then...

133
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,100
 I've... 

134
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,380
 been mean to you all this time. 

135
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,030
 Yet you're saying such nice words to me? 

136
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,460
 Aw, don't cry. 

137
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:05,120
 But you're the first person I've ever been with... 

138
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,130
 who's proposed so easily to me! 

139
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,480
When I saw her bawling like a baby...

140
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,750
My heart melted.

141
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,070
Simple enough.

142
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,970
Well, it wasn't at all that grand, I know.

143
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,370
More like just another one of those days in your life.

144
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,930
I see.

145
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,210
Simple, huh?

146
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,460
Just keep it simple, right?

147
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,630
It's good to keep it simple, Mr. Akiyama.

148
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,930
It'll be a disaster if you go overboard and mess it up.

149
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,240
Take this advice from me.

150
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,170
This concludes our game of bingo. Thank you all for participating.

151
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,380
Thank you, Ms. Kaede, for the wonderful number toss.

152
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,350
- Hijiri, you didn't get a bingo. 
 - Koyori, you're back.

153
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,080
- Thanks for your help, Hoshi. 
 - Why are you over here?

154
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,990
- The perfect duo, huh? 
 - Stop it, Kihara.

155
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,340
It's the bride and groom's turn next, right? Hurry up and get ready.

156
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,480
Sosuke.

157
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,340
Coming right over.

158
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,780
Is everything okay? What did he say to you?

159
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,660
Nothing. We were just chatting.

160
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,970
Really?

161
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,390
- She is pretty. 
 - Thank you. She's lovely, right?

162
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,070
Thank you.

163
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,450
I'm so nervous.

164
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,940
Don't worry.

165
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,080
I know it's in the past. But still, I'm jealous.

166
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,010
I get how you feel.

167
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,200
She was your first girlfriend, after all.

168
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,920
Huh? You've got it wrong. I didn't mean that.

169
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,900
Huh? Then what are you jealous about?

170
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:10,190
I'm jealous when I see you talking to Mr. Yoshida.

171
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,260
What? Even though I told you I have no feelings for him?

172
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,590
I know that.

173
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,740
I'm just jealous that you talk to him without holding back.

174
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,270
You were like that with me when we were kids.

175
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,380
So I'm just feeling melancholic.

176
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,460
 Is that how Hijiri sees it? I honestly think I'm being rude to the guy. 

177
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,220
 Hang on. Was that really how I treated Hijiri when we were kids? 

178
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,500
 Koyori, come out and play with me. 

179
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,980
 Let's play a game. 

180
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,170
 Don't wanna. You always end up crying. 

181
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,180
 Maybe it was my attitude? 

182
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,110
But even so...

183
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:59,550
I'd never want to go back to the kind of relationship we had in the past.

184
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,250
I don't want that either.

185
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,590
Ladies and gentlemen,

186
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,580
let's welcome our bride and groom to say their vows to each other.

187
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,390
Please give them your respectful attention.

188
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,720
I lack confidence in myself.

189
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,600
As a result, I often tested the love of others.

190
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,450
I had also tried to test your love, too.

191
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,160
Even after you proposed,

192
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,830
I kept testing your love for me.

193
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,970
You must have been fed up after hearing me ask the same question over and over again.

194
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,040
Yet, you told me...

195
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,900
"Test me as many times as you want".

196
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,610
 I'll use this lifetime to prove my love to you. 

197
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,450
Those words alone were good enough for me.

198
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,980
I promise you...

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,480
that I will never again have to put your love to the test.

200
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,160
Yours sincerely, Kaede Yoshida.

201
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,890
Thank you, Kaede.

202
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,660
And I promise to stay with you forever,

203
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,470
so you will never have to break that vow.

204
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,250
Yours faithfully, Sosuke Yoshida.

205
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,280
I had a drop too much.

206
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,320
The two of them looked really happy.

207
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,550
Yeah. Saito looked lovely in her wedding dress.

208
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:05,060
But it's amazing. They gave you vouchers to a five-star hotel for your help at the party.

209
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,100
I know, right? We tried to reject their offer, but Saito said...

210
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,510
 I absolutely insist you all take one. 
   

211
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:17,390
 The hotel gave us a little discount, since we held our wedding here. 

212
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,040
 So please feel free to use it. 

213
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,260
 Kaede. 

214
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,940
 Is that so? Then we shall help ourselves. 

215
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,200
 - That sounds so fake. 
 - Wow. 

216
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,330
And that's how I ended up with one.

217
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,160
- Well, it's nice to have. 
 - I suppose.

218
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,380
- Let's go get changed. 
 - Yeah.

219
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,870
 Hijiri. 

220
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,310
- What's wrong? 
 - Sorry, could you help me undo my necklace?

221
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,560
- Sure. 
 - Here.

222
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,640
Do you want to use the bath first?

223
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,660
Hijiri, are you listening?

224
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,470
Oh, thanks.

225
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,800
I want to do it.

226
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,910
But I haven't taken a bath yet. I'm still dirty.

227
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,950
You're not dirty.

228
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,540
You're pretty, Koyori.

229
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,450
You won't regret the fact that I didn't clean up first?

230
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,450
Of course not.

231
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,800
 It's good to keep it simple, Mr. Akiyama. 

232
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,240
 Take this advice from me. 

233
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:14,020
 It could have been Koyori standing beside Yoshida today, and not Saito. 

234
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,440
 The thought of that makes me impatient. 

235
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,280
 I wish I could have every part of Koyori soon. 

236
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,850
Koyori.

237
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,350
Let's get married.

238
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,920
Huh?

239
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,780
Hijiri, w-what did you just say?

240
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,930
 Let's get married. 

241
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,680
No... Sorry... I...

242
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,560
Wait.

243
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,220
Pretend that never happened.

244
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,460
Guess I'd better go take a bath first.

245
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,980
Sure.

246
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,060
 Koyori, let's get married. 

247
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,010
 Oh, Hijiri! 

248
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,970
 Will you accept this ring? 

249
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,760
 Of course! 

250
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,730
 That was supposed to be the plan! 

251
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,860
Why did that guy suddenly appear in my head?

252
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,420
 It's good to keep it simple, Mr. Akiyama. 

253
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,630
 Take this advice from me. 

254
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,040
Ugh... I'm such an idiot.

255
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,560
Akiyama.

256
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,410
Are you okay?

257
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,420
The chief's looking for you.

258
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,440
 I get the "wait" part. 

259
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,030
 Pretend that never happened. 

260
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,990
 But what did he mean, "pretend that never happened"? 

261
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,840
To pretend it never happened, means it won't happen, huh?

262
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,610
 Even so... 

263
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:38,550



264
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,380
What did you want to talk to me about?

265
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,630
Nothing serious. Come sit.

266
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,400
What is it? Are they shutting down the app?

267
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,620
But it's doing well!

268
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,260
Calm down. No app is shutting down.

269
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,010
Have a seat.

270
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,930
If the app's not shutting down, then what's the matter?

271
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,470
Do you want to be the team leader for a new project?

272
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,320
But I am a team leader.

273
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,550
I said "new," didn't I?

274
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:13,260
Huh? "New"? Then what about the current team?

275
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,860
You may need to handle both roles concurrently for now,

276
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,810
but I plan to let Enomoto take over eventually.

277
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,580
And this is assuming my idea is green-lit in our in-house competition?

278
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,370
You don't have to take part in the competition.

279
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,780
Management wants to proceed with your proposal.

280
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,180
It means they've recognized your abilities as a leader.

281
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,250
Thank you for the support.

282
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,180
Excuse me.

283
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,570
Sir, you wished to speak with me?

284
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,560
â™«  Hey, your eyes are perfect  â™«

285
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,940
See you.

286
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,130
Hoshi, hold up.

287
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:05,610
Kaede wanted me to thank you for helping out at the party.

288
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,030
The party turned out to be really wonderful.

289
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,150
Is that so?

290
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,020
I'm relieved to hear that.

291
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,010
You both looked really happy after Saito gave her speech.

292
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,950
I hope to see that sort of happiness on Hijiri's face, too.

293
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,740
I see.

294
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,580
Until recently, I felt indifferent about weddings.

295
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,030
They say attending a wedding can change your mind, but I never thought it'd happen to me.

296
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,360
Well, I guess that's just how it is.

297
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,610
Anyway, I'm not the one you should be telling this to.

298
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,110
â™«  Oh baby, say "I do"  â™«

299
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,660
â™«  Yeah, baby, you know I love you  â™«

300
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,330
Would you consider transferring to our main office in Hiroshima?
