1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,980
Would you consider a transfer to our main office in Hiroshima?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,570
You've been requesting to go there, no?

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,640
Your wish has finally come true.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,040



5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,930
   

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,640
He'll be late, huh. 
    

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,130
   

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,820
He had an early day today. I hope he doesn't tire himself out.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,190
   

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Thank goodness!

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,140
 Until recently, I felt indifferent about weddings. 

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,400
 They say attending a wedding can change your mind, 

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,150
 but I never thought it'd happen to me. 

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,790
 Koyori. 

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,080
 Let's get married. 

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,540
 No... Sorry... I... 

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,550
 Pretend that never happened. 

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,620
 He'd been acting a little awkward since then, 

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,140
 but now he's back to the same ol' Hijiri. 

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,640
Hijiri is really late.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,420
I don't want to go to sleep without seeing him.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,660
That's it.

23
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,670
Maybe I'll use this voucher .
    

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,960
 Please feel free to use it. 

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,490
We can talk about marriage when we're at the hotel.

26
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,150
I'm home.

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,350
Welcome back.

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,480
Should I heat up the curry?

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,320
Or since it's late, should I keep it to make ochazuke tomorrow?

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,590
I'll have the curry now.

31
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,400
Then I'll go heat it up.

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,740
Hijiri?

33
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,610
Say, how about we take a short staycation at a hotel?

34
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,510
A hotel?

35
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,360
I received a voucher at Yoshida's wedding, remember?

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,210
Oh, that voucher.

37
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,650
Work will get busier for me soon, so I figured we could recharge a little before that.

38
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,830
- You're gonna get busier? 
 - Yup.

39
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,750
I'm going to be a team leader for a new project.

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,340
I don't need to join the competition this time.

41
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,980
That's great, Koyori.

42
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,020
I'm glad work's going well for you.

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,280
Thanks.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,600
- All the more reason you need a good night's rest. 
 - Huh?

45
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,830
I'll heat up the curry myself.

46
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,990
Just go to bed and rest.

47
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,740
But I'm only heating it up.

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,390
That's why I'll be fine.

49
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,460
What about the staycation?

50
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,570
I'm in. Let's do that.

51
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,860
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,770
Ouch!

53
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,510
Bon appetit.

54
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,420
She's working hard in her career, huh?

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,150
 I have to tell her soon. 

56
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:47,170
   

57
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,720
Wow, this room is amazing!

58
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,800
They even provided champagne.

59
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,050
 Would you consider a transfer to our main office in Hiroshima? 

60
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,790
These beds are huge.

61
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,230
What?

62
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,360
Saito is really something.

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,910
Why suddenly mention her?

64
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,140
I don't think I've ever slept on such a huge bed before.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,380
We can sleep on it together.

66
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,150
You said dinner will be at a restaurant in the hotel?

67
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,840
Yup. I've made reservations for 7:00 p.m.

68
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,540
Looks like we have plenty of time until then.

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,480
What do you think we should do?

70
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,410
What?

71
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,660
Koyori, I love you.

72
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,630
I love you, too, Hijiri.

73
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,580
 I'm sure my love for him will never fade, even after all these years. 

74
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,100
 I've come to see so many different sides of Hijiri so far. 

75
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,830
 I want to discover a side of him that I've never seen before. 

76
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,380
Hijiri, let's get married.

77
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,260
Oh no, I said it.

78
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,020
I was planning to say that when we were at the restaurant.

79
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,950
Just so you know, I don't mean "someday". I mean, rather soon.

80
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,440
Hijiri, look at me.

81
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,330
I want to be with you forever, Koyori.

82
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,480
Ever since we moved in together,

83
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,870
you'd keep the lights on whenever I worked late.

84
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,950
And on your late days, I'd go to pick you up.

85
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,160
When we both have late hours, we now head home together.

86
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,770
Yup.

87
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,140
I hope this will continue even after we get married. I want to be with you forever.

88
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,810
So is that a yes?

89
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,680
Huh? Of course, it is.

90
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,570
If anything, I was the first to blurt out the "getting married" thing.

91
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,420
You told me to pretend that never happened.

92
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,210
Sorry, I got impulsive, and felt like the timing was all wrong.

93
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,640
But I just did the same thing.

94
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,020
Did I propose at a bad time, too?

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,460
Absolutely not.

96
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,190
Your timing was perfect.

97
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,950
I originally planned to propose with this night scenery as the backdrop.

98
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,630
Did you really?

99
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,100
And I thought of getting you a ring as your birthday present.

100
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,440
But you said you didn't need it.

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,330
Well, I didn't say I don't need it.

102
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,450
That's why I'm happy today.

103
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,800
Me too.

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,120
I'm really happy that you said you wanted to get married.

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,490
I know you're happy. You just told me.

106
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,190
I'll say it as many times as I want.

107
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,070
Some people might think that marriage is just a contract on paper,

108
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:06,630
but to me, it's one more thing that binds two people together.

109
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,130
And with that, I want to take responsibility for your future.

110
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,320
Hijiri, don't say that.

111
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,620
What?

112
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,570
Don't see my future as your responsibility.

113
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,100
Koyori...

114
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:36,420
You and I will walk down this path, together.

115
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,550
If one of us trips and falls along the way,

116
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,630
we'll support each other and walk on together.

117
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,670
You said something similar, remember?

118
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,200
 We live together because we want to support each other. 

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
That won't change, even when we're married.

120
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,910
Sorry, I may have said too much.

121
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,140
I love you so much.

122
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:16,300
I love you so much, too.

123
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,570
Our staycation was amazing, wasn't it?

124
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,950
What did you say?

125
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,140
Our staycation was amazing.

126
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,180
Yup, it was the best.

127
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,960
I almost forgot. When should we tell our parents?

128
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,370
Might as well contact them now.

129
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,050
If our ultimate goal is to tell our folks in person,

130
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,020
we'll need to check their availability anyways.

131
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,840
You're right.

132
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,750
I'll call them now, then.

133
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,580
 Everything was going smoothly as we worked towards our wedding. 

134
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,090
 Or so I thought. 

135
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,320
I'm thinking of using the hotel voucher to ask Sachi out.

136
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,340
What were the highlights of your stay?

137
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,680
Anything you'd recommend?

138
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,750
Visit the terrace. The night skyline was beautiful.

139
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,770
Whoa... I'll bring her there for sure.

140
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,810
But I'm glad to hear you're getting along well with her.

141
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,350
She suggested you two start off as friends, so I thought...

142
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,070
Huh? What is it?

143
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,100
It's nothing.

144
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,260
I'm meeting Sachi later, so I'll get going.

145
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,290
- Sure, bye. 
 - See you.

146
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,070
My dear Sachi... Oh, Ms. Kaede. Hey, there.

147
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,500
- Thanks for your help the other day. 
 - Don't mention it.

148
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,490
- Hi, Hoshi. 
 - Saito!

149
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,460
- Thanks for your help at the party. 
 - Of course.

150
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,320
Are you meeting Yoshida?

151
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,920
Yup. I told him there's a restaurant I wanted to visit, so he made reservations.

152
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,650
I see.

153
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,150
- By the way, how are you taking the news? 
 - Huh?

154
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,110
Hijiri was asked to transfer to the Hiroshima HQ, right?

155
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,190
It'll be a long-distance relationship for you two.

156
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,580
 What? But just the other day... 

157
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,830
 I want to be with you forever, Koyori. 

158
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,120
 That was what he said, no? 

159
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,090
Hoshi?

160
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,290
- How did you know? 
 - I heard it from our producer.

161
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,980
They offered Hijiri's team a game development project,

162
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,780
but he had turned it down, saying he was relocating.

163
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,890
Wait. Has Hijiri not told you?

164
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,510
Well, I...

165
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,650
Kaede, sorry to keep you waiting.

166
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,880
Huh? Hoshi, why are you here?

167
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,560
We bumped into each other when I was about to leave.

168
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,380
I have to go. See you, Yoshida.

169
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,280
Gosh, I think I've said something unnecessary.

170
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,200
Did she say something about me?

171
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,850
I'll make curry fried rice for today.

172
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,440
I'm home.

173
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,590
You scared me, Koyori.

174
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,710
I didn't hear you open the door.

175
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,490
Hijiri,

176
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,780
are you being transferred to Hiroshima?

177
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,480
Oh, you heard it from Saito, didn't you?

178
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,600
That's odd.

179
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,770
I've already told our producer the rumors aren't true.

180
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,210
Maybe they haven't informed Saito's office yet.

181
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,810
Huh?

182
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,410
I've rejected the offer to transfer.

183
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,440
Can such a thing be rejected?

184
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,250
It wasn't an official order from HR.

185
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,580
My supervisor was only casually asking me.

186
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,200
Is that so?

187
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,490
That's right.

188
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,020
So...

189
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,250
Don't make such a long face, Koyori.

190
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,240
Okay?

191
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,860
All right. Now go and get changed.

192
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,970
I'm making curry fried rice tonight.

193
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,590
Hijiri.

194
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,040
I was hoping you could inform me, even if you turned it down.

195
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,620
I was shocked to hear the news from Saito.

196
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,690
Sorry, Koyori. I should have.

197
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,250
We're going to be husband and wife, after all.

198
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,680
That's right.

199
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,230
I'll make sure to tell you everything from now on.

200
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,700
- Yes, please do. 
 - Got it.

201
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,750
I'm starting to feel peckish. I'll make us a salad.

202
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,190
Sure. Thanks.

203
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,530
 So he rejected the offer. 

204
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,450
 That's great. 

205
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,360
 But is it right for me to feel relieved? 

206
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,580
 He was offered a transfer to their HQ in Hiroshima. That means... 

207
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,920
 Koyori? Long time no see. 

208
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,470
 Why are you here, Hijiri? 

209
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,840
 You're also here for an interview... in casual clothes? 

210
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,020
 I'm working part-time here. 

211
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,680
 That sounds cocky. So you've gotten an offer or two already? 

212
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,150
 I haven't been job-hunting. For now, I plan to keep on working at Kodan. 

213
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,200
 Koyori? 

214
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,080
 That's great, Hijiri! 

215
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,020
 You grew up loving Kodan games, right? 

216
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,130
 - Yup. 
 - But doesn't the Tokyo branch only work on mobile games? 

217
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,680
 Yeah, console games are handled at their main office. 

218
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,470
 But that's a step for later. 

219
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:09,270
 I figured if I could become a full-time employee, I'd transfer to the main office in Hiroshima. 

220
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,150
 - Wow... 
 - What? 

221
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,810
 You actually have a goal you're working towards. 

222
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,140
 I knew it. 

223
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,440
- It's not okay! 
 - Huh? What?

224
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,920
Was my curry fried rice no good?

225
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,120
Sorry about that.

226
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,990
Why did you reject the offer to transfer?

227
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,790
Was it because I wanted to get married? Is that it?

228
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,410
No.

229
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,390
Koyori, it wasn't because of your proposal.

230
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,300
I would've rejected the offer, even without your say.

231
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,530
I have you with me, and a job I love. I have the best of both worlds.

232
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,060
The two things that make me happy are here. That's why I rejected the offer.

233
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,290
Are you telling the truth?

234
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,360
Whenever a new game gets released,

235
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,230
won't you regret not being a part of its production?

236
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,350
Going to Hiroshima isn't a matter of being gone for one or two years.

237
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,040
After completing one project, another one may crop up.

238
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,920
And if that happens, I'd be stuck thereー

239
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,250
Then all the more reason you should go.

240
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,810
- Didn't you hear what I said? 
 - Yes, I did.

241
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,030
It's the chance of a lifetime!

242
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,420
Getting married to you is also the chance of a lifetime, no?

243
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,170
But I'll stay with you, no matter what.

244
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,410
I've already decided that you're the only one for me. Nothing will change my mind.

245
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,440
But this could be your only shot at your dream job.

246
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,600
Even if I do go to Hiroshima...

247
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,930
I can't bring myself to ask you to come with me.

248
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,740
- You've been working so hardー 
 - I'll go, too.

249
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,160
H-Huh?

250
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,910
I mean, not immediately, of course.

251
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,180
I'll join you after I'm done with my current and upcoming projects.

252
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,390
- But... 
 - That'll take me around a year or two, perhaps?

253
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,650
I may even switch jobs if a good opportunity comes along.

254
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,240
This isn't a decision you should make so easily.

255
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,410
Really?

256
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,370
But staying with you is so obvious, I knew my answer right away.

257
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,140
We may be apart for the time being, but it won't stop us from being together eventually.

258
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,830
Thank you, Koyori.

259
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,050
That settles it. I have to go to bed.

260
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,060
Sleep here with me tonight.

261
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,850
 Three days later, Hijiri received the official letter to transfer to Hiroshima. 

262
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,090
    
 We have decided to get married.

263
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,620
Oh, my!

264
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,310
 We also informed our parents of our plan to get married. 

265
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,010
 Followed by news of Hijiri's transfer, 

266
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,610
 and my plan to move to Hiroshima in a few years. 

267
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,610
 They were initially worried, but... 

268
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,820
- I think it's great. 
 - As long as you two have thought it through together.

269
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,270
Oh, Dad...

270
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,320
- Right? 
 - Ah, well.

271
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,470
 Hijiri also bought me a ring. 

272
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,220
- I'm putting it on. 
 - Okay.

273
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,100
Thank you.

274
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,640
This is my first time receiving a ring.

275
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,410
I want to put it on for you, too.

276
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,500
Lower your head a little.

277
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,620
I'll wear it at all times.

278
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,410
Likewise, I won't ever take it off.

279
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,020
I want to spend time with you as much as possible before you leave for Hiroshima.

280
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,120
Okay.

281
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:27,160



282
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,760
 Two weeks flashed by before we knew it. 

283
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,740
 When tomorrow comes, it's time... 

284
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,170
What time will you be leaving tomorrow?

285
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,110
My flight is at 9:00 a.m., so around 7:00 a.m., I guess.

286
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,860
You don't have to send me off, since you still have to go to work.

287
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,040
Koyori?

288
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,330
I'm sorry for crying.

289
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,190
The tissues...

290
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,150
I was the one who encouraged you to leave, but...

291
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,300
I know. Now, now...

292
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,940
If I fall asleep now, tomorrow will come.

293
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,280
Koyori...

294
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,160
I didn't expect you to cry.

295
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,670
- Sorry. 
 - I'm not admonishing you.

296
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,290
You encouraged me to go, even though it'd make you cry.

297
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,960
That makes me love you all the more.

298
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,060
I won't cry anymore.

299
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,150
I'll bid you goodbye with a smile tomorrow.

300
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,850
- Really? 
 - Yup.

301
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,670
♫  Hey, your eyes are perfect  ♫

302
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,260
♫  Like the warm trees lining the street  ♫

303
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,330
♫  Babe, you're always by my side, and so kind  ♫

304
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,510
This is it. I'm off.

305
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,400
Take care.

306
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,440
♫  Oh, this is gonna be my screenplay, I want to see it more  ♫

307
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,950
♫  A monologue in my heart sings of my love  ♫

308
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,800
♫  It says that you're all over my mind  ♫

309
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,930
♫  Shockingly  ♫

310
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,590
♫  Only you can bring me a love  ♫

311
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,300
♫  that will change my life  ♫

312
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,450
 I must also do my best. 

313
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,600
   

314
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,070
♫  Do you wanna be my lady?  ♫

315
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,490
♫  Oh baby, say "I do"  ♫

316
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,580
It's so bright.

317
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,050
 The ring that Hijiri gave me,  

318
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,020
 is no longer on my finger.
