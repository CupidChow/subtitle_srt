1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,350
Good evening and welcome. This way, please.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,030
Koyori?

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,580
Hoshi?

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,030
 What's going on? 

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,240
Why are you here, Saito?

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,840
And why are you here, Hoshi?

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,390
I have a call. Give me a minute.

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,310
I'm here for a work meeting.

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,860
So am I.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,010
But the other party couldn't make it, so they called in someone else.

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,970
- And that would be me. 
 - You're the one who came in their place?

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,680
What a coincidence, right? I was shocked to hear my coworker mention you.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
So that means you're working at Tint Games?

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,610
Tint Games?

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,380
Is that so? I understand.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,100
We'll handle it on our end. Yes, take care.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,600
Koyori, our dinner meeting with Tint Games has been cancelled.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,940
The rep on their end has fallen ill.

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,260
- You don't have to raise your voice. 
 - Were you also supposed to meet a colleague of mine?

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,190
Our reservation includes a course menu, so cancelling it will incur a fee.

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,700
- Might as well settle our dinner here. 
 - Huh? What are you talking about?

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,130
If you don't mind, may we join your booking?

23
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,990
- We only made reservations for seats. 
 - What?

24
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,930
In that case, why don't the four of us have dinner together?

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,210
- Huh? 
 - Let us discuss the future of social games, together.

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,950
Sounds like a great idea!

27
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,910
Over here, please.

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,710
A toast to our meeting.

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,340
Cheers.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,070
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

31

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,850
   

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,060
 What the heck is going on here? 

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,880
   

35
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,490
   

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,940
Say, Sosuke...

37
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,990
Do you want to get back together with your ex?

38
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,470
Huh? What are you talking about?

39
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,150
The woman in that photo is currently my first love's girlfriend.

40
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,890
Come again?

41
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,000
Hang on a sec.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,210
Your ex is my ex's current boyfriend?

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,870
That's right. What a small world indeed.

44
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,420
I'll do you a favor and hook you up with Hoshi.

45
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,860
So help me in return.

46
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,660
It's your fault we broke up in the first place.

47
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,500
You lied to me about being pregnant.

48
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,420
Right back at you. You were two-timing me.

49
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,730
- That's because... 
 - You thought you could start things over with Hoshi.

50
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,990
But she latched onto another guy quickly, and that annoys you.

51
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,650
Am I wrong?

52
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,300
You wanted my help. What do I have to do?

53
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,020
First off, invite her to dinner.

54
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,950
Even if I do, Koyori won't agree.

55
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,880
If it's for work, she can't exactly turn you down, no?

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,170
Just say you both need to attend dinner with a client.

57
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,160
Then I'll get my colleague to set up a meeting with Hijiri,

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,360
and go meet him on their behalf that day.

59
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm once again reminded of what a terrifying woman you are.

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,020
What? That's mean.

61
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,220
Do you really like this Hijiri guy that much?

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,550
Yup.

63
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,370
 Could this really be such a coincidence? 

64
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,040
 There's something fishy about this. 

65
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,020
 But Yoshida and Saito most likely haven't met before. 

66
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,550
 I shouldn't be suspicious them. 

67
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,350
Koyori, stop.

68
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,230
Do you plan to finish the entire bottle all on your own?

69
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,930
You know you get carried away when you're deep in thought.

70
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,870
- Stick to drinking water. 
 - Fine.

71
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,170
Mr. Yoshida, I'm surprised you call Hoshi by her first name.

72
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,510
Yes, but she gets mad at me when I do that.

73
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,740
It's an old habit I can't shake off.

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,100
- Mr. Yoshidaãƒ¼ 
 - Wait, could it be that you two...

75
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,060
Yes. We were dating until recently.

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,270
- Did you have to mention that? 
 - There's no use hiding it.

77
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,160
Which means we're currently sitting with your ex and current boyfriend?

78
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,030
This is Harukaze carpaccio in two-color style.

79
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm so sorry, Hoshi. I shouldn't have asked to join you two.

80
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,660
This must be awkward for you.

81
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,980
It's fine. Thanks to you, we didn't have to cancel this reservation.

82
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,040
By the way, were the three of you close in junior high?

83
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,390
- Kind of. 
 - In fact, the two of us also dated back then.

84
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,870
- Right? 
 - What? Really?

85
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,080
This brings back memories.

86
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,100
Hijiri, you waited for me at the shoe shelves to confess. Right?

87
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,320
 Hijiri was the one who took the initiative? I didn't know that. 

88
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,800
I was dumped a few months later, though. We had exams to focus on.

89
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,230
Right, I did.

90
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,150
- But I still regret it. 
 - Huh?

91
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,700
Sometimes I wonder if we hadn't broken up back then,

92
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,990
maybe we would still be together now.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,410
It's pointless to think of the "what ifs".

94
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,220
True, but...

95
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,590
The one I'm dating now... is Koyori.

96
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,120
Jeez, of course I know that.

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,850
There are many things I regret about the past.

98
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:19,050
So now, I want to cherish the present. To live without regrets.

99
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,130
 I feel like crying. 

100
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,920
Excuse me. I need to go to the washroom.

101
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,400
Hey, are you okay?

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,090
I'll go and check on her.

103
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,850
 I thought I knew everything about Hijiri, but I didn't. 

104
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,150
 I want to cherish the present. 

105
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,060
 That's why those words moved me. 

106
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,560
Hoshi?

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,910
Are you all right?

108
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,280
If you don't mind, use this.

109
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Thanks.

110
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,180
That day was when we first met each other. Right?

111
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,280
 I hope we can start over. 

112
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,820
 Request denied. 

113
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,410
I didn't expect you to reject me on her behalf.

114
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,690
That's because Koyori seemed to be at a loss for words.

115
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,310
She started going out with you after that, right?

116
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,200
That's right.

117
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,060
Damn...

118
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,810
What is it?

119
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,200
I'm shocked.

120
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,330
Koyori told me she didn't want a breakup.

121
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,190
Yet she started dating you right after.

122
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,000
Was she lying to me or what?

123
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,040
I don't really understand.

124
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,570
You love Koyori, don't you?

125
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,290
Yeah, so?

126
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,410
Then don't speak ill of the woman you love.

127
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,460
I'll take my leave first.

128
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,240
Here is my share of the cost.

129
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,620
- Koyori, let's go home. 
 - You sure?

130
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,090
It's fine. This isn't work-related anyways.

131
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,750
Thanks.

132
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,630
- Sorry about that. 
 - I'm terribly sorry.

133
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,990
Hijiri, what's wrong?

134
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,240
Nothing in particular.

135
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,100
But...

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,550
Did he say something mean to you?

137
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,080
It's my mom.

138
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,000
She and Dad are down with the flu, and they want me home.

139
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,630
I'll be fine on my own, so go check on them.

140
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,830
Thanks for understanding.

141
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,460
- Sorry about that. 
 - It's okay.

142
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,990
See you.

143
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,180
   

144
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,200
That woman is clearly targeting your boyfriend.

145
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,280
I know, right?

146
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,080
But since she knows we're together, why go through all that trouble?

147
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,840
Some people want something because it belongs to someone else.

148
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,960
I see...

149
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,650
That's why you should be firm and stay away from her.

150
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,540
They said mackerel or bonito would do.

151
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,260
Mackerel? No, dried sardines are definitely the correct choice.

152
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,060
I'll pass on your enthusiasm.

153
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,110
Please do.

154
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,660
- Koyoriãƒ¼ 
 - I won't go to such dinners anymore. So stop it.

155
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,800
If you do anything to hurt the person I love, I won't forgive you.

156
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,990
The person you love, huh?

157
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,960
 Then don't speak ill of the woman you love. 

158
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,840
- I'm done. 
 - What?

159
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:23,250
People my age hardly say stuff like "the person I love".

160
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,600
I'm sorry, Hoshi.

161
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,010
Huh?

162
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,760
 Thanks for the other day. 

163
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,960
 It's a pity I didn't get to chat more with you after that. 

164
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,110
 If you're free tonight, want to catch up over dinner? 

165
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,130
 The one I'm dating now is Koyori. 

166
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,500
Hoshi, over here.

167
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,610
Hey, there.

168
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,220
I went ahead and ordered a drink. The food here is good.

169
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,330
You must be hungry.

170
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,070
I'll just have a drink.

171
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,110
- One coffee, please. 
 - Of course.

172
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,450
I came only because I have something to tell you.

173
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,040
Is that so?

174
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,340
I figured it would be easier to talk about more... touchy topics over food, though.

175
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,620
Touchy topics?

176
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,150
Hijiri had approached me during our reunion the other day.

177
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:59,320
I was getting a little tipsy and left for some fresh air when Hijiri came after me.

178
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,350
He said, "Let's do what we couldn't do in junior high," and tried to kiss me.

179
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,440
He did that even though he already had you.

180
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,570
Though I say we broke up because of "exams,"

181
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,910
the real reason was because I saw him eyeing other girls.

182
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,320
Thank you for waiting. Here is your coffee.

183
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,750
You two bought these as a pair, didn't you?

184
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,140
Hijiri was laughing, you know? He called you childish for being happy with a keychain.

185
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,830
How did that end up with you?

186
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,210
Hijiri said he didn't need it anymore, so he gave it to me.

187
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,590
Hoshi,

188
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,490
I'm saying this for your own good.

189
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,910
You should break up with Hijiãƒ¼

190
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,900
Hijiri wouldn't do such a thing.

191
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,190
So are you saying I'm lying?

192
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,420
Yes, I am. Sorry.

193
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,580
How can you be so sure?

194
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,860
Did Hijiri saying something about me to you?

195
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,140
No, he didn't. I just trust Hijiri. That's all.

196
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,370
Then how do you explain this?

197
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,960
He probably dropped it and you picked it up.

198
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,230
 - Hey, are you okay?  
  - I'll go check on her. 

199
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,410
 Thanks. 

200
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,180
 - Sorry about that.  
  - I'm terribly sorry. 

201
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,770
How can you trust him without testing his love for you?

202
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,390
- I bet you don't love Hijiri after all, do you? 
 - Pardon?

203
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,130
From the way you behave around Hijiri, you don't look like you love him.

204
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,970
I do love him.

205
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,830
 I love you, Koyori. 

206
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,700
He never hesitates to speak his mind.

207
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,890
 You look really pretty. 

208
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,620
I love how straightforward he is.

209
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,430
 The one I'm dating now is Koyori. 

210
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,150
 I want to cherish the present. 

211
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,250
He's so straightforward, it makes me blush.

212
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,180
I couldn't even look him in the eye when we first started dating.

213
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:46,510
If I give others the impression that I don't seem to love Hijiri,

214
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,360
then so be it.

215
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,880
 I'll always understand. 

216
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,790
As long as Hijiri knows that I love him.

217
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,000
So...

218
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,390
What is it about Hijiri that you like?

219
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,440
Come again? What are you talking about?

220
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,430
I mean, I'd love to know of other good traits Hijiri has, that I haven't noticed.

221
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,260
Are you still in junior high or what?

222
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,900
You're acting like we're junior high girls gushing about our favorite seniors!

223
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,160
I hate it when someone likes the same person that I do!

224
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,550
You want to fight with me? Bring it on!

225
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,560
S-Saito?

226
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,620
In short, I don't have any feelings for Hijiri whatsoever.

227
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,680
How can you not fall in love with him?

228
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,280
Whatever...

229
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,160
I'm really exhausted by all this, Hoshi.

230
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,220
You can have this back. Now leave!

231
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,870
Thank you.

232
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,150
- I told you not to come without telling me. 
 - As if telling you would make a difference.

233
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,180
Jeez! This is so absurd.

234
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,290
- What is? 
 - Hijiri and Hoshi.

235
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,870
The reason for our breakup wasn't exactly a lie.

236
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,960
When Hijiri and I were dating,

237
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,680
I noticed that his gaze was always on Hoshi.

238
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:52,420
Later on, I told Hijiri that I wanted to breakup so that I could focus on exams.

239
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,980
- So you were actually... 
 - That's right. I was testing him.

240
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,200
I test people because I don't trust them.

241
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,180
So then? How did he respond?

242
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,230
Hijiri said...

243
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,840
 Is that so? 

244
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,040
 I understand. You'll pass your exams, I'm sure of it. 

245
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,280
 You have my support. 

246
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:26,110
Back then, if I had told him I didn't want to break up after all...

247
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,790
Anyway, it's too late now.

248
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,950
But I'm still annoyed.

249
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,030
How can those two be so stupidly trusting of each other? I don't get it.

250
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,900
Where did it go?

251
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,350
 Woah! Made it in time! 

252
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,670
Huh? Hijiri, are you all right?

253
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,790
 Sorry. 

254
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,840
My phone was a distance away, so I kind of dove over to get it.

255
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,490
What? Should I call later?

256
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,260
No, it's fine.

257
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,400
I like getting to see you.

258
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,690
Actually... would it be okay if I go over to see you now?

259
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,980
Huh?

260
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,780
 - I can't?  
 - Sure, of course.

261
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,280
Really? I'll head over right now then.

262
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,710
No, I'll go over to your place.

263
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,610
It's fine, I'll go.

264
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,180
No, don't.

265
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,260
I don't want anything to happen to you.

266
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,580
But I was the one who suggested it.

267
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,670
- Are you listening? 
 - I've already left my house.

268
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,050
You're lying. That was too fast.

269
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,750
 I may have gone too far. 

270
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,010
 He's probably halfway here by now. 

271
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,810
Screw it.

272
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:29,420
   

273
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,610
 I can't wait. 

274
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,490
 I can't wait. 

275
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,230
 - To see him.  
  - To see her. 

276
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,790
- Koyori? 
 - Hijiri!

277
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,860
What are you doing here? I told you to wait for me at home.

278
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,470
â™«  Another captivating moment  â™« 
 â™«  If this were a movie, how many times would it be?  â™«

279
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,930
What's wrong? You hardly take the initiative.

280
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,120
Seeing your face over the phone made me want to see the real thing.

281
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
The real thing, huh?

282
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,810
â™«  A monologue in my heart sings of my love  â™«

283
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,890
Hijiri, you see...

284
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,270
Hm?

285
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,180
I also want to cherish the present with you.

286
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
Koyori...

287
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,050
I love you, Hijiri.

288
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,200
I wish I could be in your arms forever.

289
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,040
- What? Koyori, youãƒ¼ 
 - Don't look at my face.

290
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,380
â™«  Oh baby, say "I do"  â™«

291
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,060
Wanna stay over at my place?

292
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,840
Huh? Of course, I do.

293
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,270
â™«  Yeah, baby, you know I love you  â™«

294
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,950
Let's go.

295
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,890
Wait, but I have a meeting first thing tomorrow morning.

296
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,240
I'll have to make the last bus back home.

297
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,100
I see.

298
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,830
- Sorry for disturbing you. 
 - Don't be.

299
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,960
Seeing your face perks my day up.

300
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,460
Hijiri, you came with your towel still around your shoulders!

301
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,930
You're right.

302
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,640
I rode the bus looking like this.

303
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:24,240
I almost forgot. You dropped this.

304
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,990
There it is! I was looking for it.

305
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,930
I told myself if I still couldn't find it, I'd go down on my knees and apologize to you.

306
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,860
Don't you lose it again.

307
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:49,970
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 ðŸŽ€The bonds of love ðŸ’ž Team@Viki.com 

308
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,760
I wish we could spend more time together.

309
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,450
Likewise.

310
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,090
Koyori.

311
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,660
Want to move in together?
