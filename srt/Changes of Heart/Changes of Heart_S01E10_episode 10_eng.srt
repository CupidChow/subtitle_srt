1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,120
 It's been six months since I took off the ring that Hijiri gave me. 

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,950
 At times, I find myself checking my ring finger, 

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,600
 wondering if our breakup had been a dream. 
   

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,670
 And I would immediately regret it. 

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,680
Ms. Hoshi!

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,340
- Morning. 
 - Good morning.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,100
- Great weather today. 
 - Yeah.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,170
I hope this weather stays for the game expo.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,870
I know, right? I'm so excited for it.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,020
Mr. Akiyama will be coming, too. Right?

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,510
S-S-Sorry, Ms. Hoshi! I meant to ask you about console games.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,190
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,400
 Did I make the right decision? 

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,860
 Where did we go wrong? 

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,530
 At first, our long distance relationship was quite enjoyable. 
   

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,840
 - Hey, Aoi!  
 - Hey, Hijiri.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,460
 Hijiri and I would call every night before bed. 

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm home!

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,790
You're back, Hijiri!

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,670
 He visited a month after moving out, too. 

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,660
It's great to be back.

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,220
I want us to live together again...

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,660
I'll try to look for a suitable job so I can move over soon.

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,500
Oh, sorry.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,640
While I want you to join me, focus on what you love, too. All right?

26
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,060
The next time we move in together, we'll be married.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,640
Do you want to hold a wedding?

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,390
Maybe nothing too grand. That'd be a bit embarrassing.

29
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,430
 We talked a lot about our future. 

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,570
 But things started to get busier for the both of us. 

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,510
   

32
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,200
Looks like Hijiri can't call again.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,200
 Hello? Ouch! 

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,270
Hey, Hijiri.

35
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,330
I dozed off at my desk.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,690
Is everything okay? You look tired.

37
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,810
I'm fine. Sorry, I couldn't answer the phone sooner.

38
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,640
Don't be. I understand you're really busy.

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,480
But I'm glad that I could chat with you today.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,380
Yeah.

41
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,110
Which reminds me. This has happened before, remember?

42
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,310
I called you, and you answered while tripping over.

43
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,290
Yeah, I remember.

44
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,750
Then you came to meet me with that towel still draped over your shoulders.

45
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,980
I was in a rush.

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,270
We were within reachable distance back then.

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,730
 About the day after tomorrow... 

48
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,440
Oh, sorry I forgot to tell you.

49
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,080
I couldn't apply for leave from work.

50
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,430
 I'm really sorry. An urgent issue cropped up. 

51
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,310
 Have you already applied for leave on your side? 

52
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,300
I couldn't take time off either. We have maintenance that day.

53
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,860
- Really? 
  - Yup, yup. I'm fine. 

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,060
- You're not forcing yourself? 
  - Of course not. 

55
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,110



56
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,730
I guess I should go to sleep.

57
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,360
Make sure you sleep on a bed.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,670
Okay. Good night.

59
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,230
Good night.

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,000
I was hoping I could meet him.

61
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,450
When will be the next time we see each other?

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,280
- He's so far away. 
 - She's so far away.

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,680
At least give me a reason for why I'm being rejected.

64
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,760
 My search for a job in Hiroshima was a disaster. 

65
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,430
I got rejected again.

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,110
What's wrong? This isn't like you.

67
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,410
I'm starting to panic after getting rejected so many times.

68
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,860
It's like none of my work is getting recognized. I'm losing my confidence.

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,340
You're doing fine work, trust me.

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,840
Kihara...

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,350
   
   

72
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,200
She's trying to put up with it, huh?

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,280
   

74
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,660
Not another rejection. 
    

75
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,080
   

76
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,040
Not now. I don't want him to see my disappointment.

77
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,830
 Hey, there. 

78
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,020
Huh? Koyori, you didn't turn on your camera.

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,920
My face looks puffy today, so I'd rather not.

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,350
You're not feeling well?

81
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,010
 I'm fine, don't worry. 

82
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,960
I went to Hiroshima for an interview the other day.

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,080
 What? 

84
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,750
You should have told me. I missed you.

85
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,160
 Sorry. It was a weekday anyway. 

86
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,920
 I see. Sorry for whining. 

87
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,640
Next time I'm there, I'll take a day off and stay over at your place.

88
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,440
By "next time", you mean...

89
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,820
 I got rejected again. But I'm fine. I'm looking for other jobs now. 

90
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,940
Hijiri?

91
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,790
Do you remember how you encouraged me to take this job?

92
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,280
You asked me...

93
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,900
whether I'd regret not being a part of a game's production

94
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,130
 every time a new title was released. 

95
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,060
Well...

96
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,010
I'm different from you.

97
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,960
 You're not. 

98
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,270
 To tell you the truth,  

99
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:35,950
 I did initially reject their offer because you proposed to me. 

100
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,260
But then you told me this job was, "the chance of a lifetime".

101
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,000
That this was the only chance I may ever get,

102
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,230
 to pursue my dream. 

103
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,750
 I believe you also love your job. 

104
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,180
So I don't think it's right...

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,900
that I get to do the work I love, while you have to quit.

106
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,700
But then...

107
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,210
I won't be able to go over and be with you.

108
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,760
I know, and that's okay.

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,650
 Let's break up. 

110
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,100
 Okay. 

111
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,140
 I came to a realization after my talk with Hijiri. 

112
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,340
 I was telling him I was fine, because I didn't want him to worry. 

113
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,510
 But instead, those words were pushing him away. 

114
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,740
 I knew there was no way I could make Hijiri happy the way I was. 

115
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,170
   

116
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,200
All right, here we are. 
    

117
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,450
Come on in, Toko.

118
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,880
Thank you.

119
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,440
Sorry about that. It's heavy, isn't it?

120
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,070
- Not at all. 
 - Really?

121
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,900
I see.

122
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,200
I get it now.

123
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,300
You're back.

124
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,100
I'm home.

125
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,070
I'll pass for today.

126
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,170
I'm going to take a bath.

127
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,210
Hijiri... is getting married.

128
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,630
Is that so? I'm happy for him.

129
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,380
They could have been a little more assertive.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,460
Both Koyori and Hijiri.

131
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,050
Getting married, huh?

132
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:31,950
 Maybe we should have pretended we never slept with each other that day. 

133
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,360
 Koyori, want to do it with me? 

134
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,700
 Maybe I could've given him my blessing if we pretended nothing happened, 

135
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,000
 and remained childhood friends. 

136
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,380
Nah...

137
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,330
Even then I'd probably realize I had feelings for Hijiri, and get depressed.

138
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,670
Like how I did back in junior high.

139
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,570
 I feel sad and lonely. 

140
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,570
 And I'm regretting it, even right now. 

141
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,890
 However... 

142
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:40,070
 I feel nothing but happiness when I recall all those times we were together. 

143
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,350
 I would've never experienced that happiness if we had kept things status quo. 

144
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,410
 But now you'll never get to see Hijiri again. 

145
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,190
The same would've happened if we remained childhood friends.

146
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,470
 That's why... 

147
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,290
I'm glad that Hijiri and I had once dated.

148
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,980
 Let's end this. I'll smile and give him my blessing. 

149
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,280
 Please... come outside, Hijiri. 

150
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,120
You scared me.

151
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,300
Hello, there.

152
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,200
Hello.

153
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,060
Blankets.

154
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,290
Huh? What did you say, Hii-kun?

155
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,490
I've brought you blankets.

156
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,540
You'll get cold if you open the balcony door.

157
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,380
Oh, right. I saw your neighbor.

158
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,960
What?

159
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,390
Huh?

160
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,390
Looks like she's gone back in.

161
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,190
What fine weather! Perfect for a wedding, and tossing bouquets.

162
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,770
Isn't that right, Hoshi?

163
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,400
Why...

164
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,390
Of all places, why hold it here on the same day? 
      

165
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,170
What a small world indeed.

166
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,850
Did I do something wrong? Is this my punishment?

167
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,610
Come on, calm down. It may not be that Akiyama.

168
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,100
He's right. It could be someone else with the same surname.

169
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,620
Let's go inside.

170
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,710
- That lady... 
 - Thank you. How have you been?

171
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,950
She's Hijiri's...

172
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,690
Hoshi, once Enomoto's wedding is over, I'll listen to whatever complaints you may have.

173
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,090
But for now, let's focus on giving our blessings to Enomoto.

174
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,700
She's right. You should do that.

175
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay.

176
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,730
 I don't think I can tell you this directly, so I'll say it in my heart. 

177
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,140
 Farewell, Hijiri. 

178
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,620
 Congratulations. 

179
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,850
 - Congrats! 
 - Thank you. 

180
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,770
 - Congrats! 
 - Congratulations! 

181
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,150
I'm going to toss the bouquet!

182
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,400
Are you all ready? Please gather here.

183
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,620
 - Toss it to me.  
 - Move forward!

184
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,410
Are you not participating?

185
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:03,010
We're fine. The bouquet ought to go to friends of the bride.

186
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,630
Miss, you're Enomoto's friend?

187
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,960
That means we're friends, too.

188
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,590
I don't think so, actually...

189
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,920
- Enomoto... 
 - Let's get to know each other inside.

190
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,070
No, wait...

191
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,650
Wait...

192
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,810
She came here with me. Could you please let her go?

193
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,140
What? So you have a boyfriend, huh?

194
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,110
Hijiri...

195
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,790
- Kiharaー 
 - I'll be over there.

196
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,230
Sorry.

197
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,480
That guy didn't look like he was backing off, so...

198
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,670
Thanks for helping me out.

199
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,720
- Congrats on your wedding. 
 - Congrats on your wedding.

200
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,370
- Huh? 
 - Huh?

201
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,480
Isn't today your wedding? I saw your fiancée earlier.

202
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,590
My dad also told me that you were getting married.

203
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,930
Your dad told me that you were getting married.

204
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,630
 ...is getting married. 

205
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,220
- I see. She's your cousin. 
 - Yup.

206
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,090
I'm so sorry my dad played this trick on you.

207
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,790
I don't know why he lied. I don't even have a boyfriend.

208
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,220
You don't?

209
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
No, I don't.

210
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,040
Is that so.

211
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,740
How's work? Going smoothly?

212
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,610
Yup. What about you?

213
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,550
Yeah, same here.

214
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,790
I see.

215
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,370
Glad to hear that.

216
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,640
I should have thought it over more carefully.

217
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,700
I was naive to say that I'd quit my job to be with you.

218
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,720
That's not true at all.

219
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,990
I was happy to know you'd do that for me, so we wouldn't have to be apart.

220
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,150
I'm also at fault for not thinking carefully about our future.

221
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,790
It's because I didn't think things through, that we...

222
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:50,190
It's because you thought it over, that you suggested we break up. Right?

223
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,490
Thanks to that, I'm enjoying every bit of my work.

224
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,420
I didn't want to quit my current job,

225
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,600
but I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

226
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,780
When we broke up, a part of me actually felt a little relieved.

227
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,390
I felt relieved, but...

228
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,850
I know it's a decision I'll regret for life.

229
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,000
Even now, I regret my choice.

230
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,040
Because I still...

231
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm so sorry for breaking up with you.

232
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,350
It's okay if we're apart,

233
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,350
as long as you're the first one I see when I come back.

234
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,540
Koyori, will you marry me?

235
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,280
Yes!

236
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,380
I finally said it!

237
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,030
I still remember it was an epic fail the first time I proposed.

238
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:49,450



239
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:57,280
 The next day, Hijiri came over to my parents' place, with wedding registration in hand. 

240
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,420
I don't get why you'd tell such a lie.

241
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,170
A lie? I just minced my words a bit.

242
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,380
- That was more than a bit. 
 - That was more than a bit!

243
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,300
You shouldn't have broken up if you two were going to get married after all.

244
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,650
He's right. I can't believe you announced your marriagethe moment you came home yesterday.

245
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,710
- Right? 
 - Right.

246
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,030
Give them a break. You know they couldn't wait another day.

247
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,230
That they couldn't.

248
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,010
Dear, write your name down under the witness section.

249
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,670
- Your name. 
 - I get it already. I'm writing it down.

250
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,670
- This is delicious. 
 - I know, right?

251
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,640
Done.

252
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,590
Congratulations.

253
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,590
 We have finally become husband and wife. 

254
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,610
Say cheese.

255
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,790
 As for my job... 

256
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,060
- You don't have to quit your job, you know? 
 - Huh?

257
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,210
The director is currently considering remote work options.

258
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,500
Thank you so much!

259
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,150
That's great to hear, Hoshi.

260
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,410
We can still continue to work together!

261
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,310
- That's too close for comfort. 
 - You're too loud.

262
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,660
- I'm sorry! 
  - In the not-too-distant future, 

263
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,720
 it looks like I can go to Hiroshima to be with Hijiri, and still keep my job. 

264
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:30,040
 Two weeks later, we took a wedding picture with just the two of us. 

265
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,710
We look good in this photo.

266
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,610
You're now married. Has that set in yet?

267
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,420
Not yet, I guess.

268
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,710
Maybe it'll take forever to set in.

269
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,990
Forever?

270
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:57,320
Every time we reach a certain milestone in our lives, I'll be reminded of our marriage.

271
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,300
Be it when we move back in together,

272
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,860
when we build our family years later,

273
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,460
when our kids leave the nest,

274
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,800
or when it finally becomes us two again.

275
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,190
It'll take a lifetime to feel like I'm really married.

276
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,400
A lifetime I get to spend with the girl I love, my childhood friend.

277
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,650
Yeah.

278
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,550
 Even when these hands become wrinkled, 

279
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:39,440
 I'll continue to walk on with the boy I love, my childhood friend. 

280
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,370
Hijiri, I love you.

281
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,900
Koyori, I love you more.

282
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,340
Hey, that's unfair. I love you more.

283
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,240
No, I love you more.

284
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,910
