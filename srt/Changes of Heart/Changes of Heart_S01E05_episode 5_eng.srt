1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,290
Ms. Hoshi! Ms. Koyori Hoshi!

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,560
He's heading over here.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,390
Kihara...

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,360
Ms. Koyori Hoshi.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,980
Yes?

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,090
I love you.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,570
Excuse me?

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,490
Wait, who are you?

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,500
Hey, hey, hey! You're too loud.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,400
What are you doing?

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,780
I was loud?

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,560
Hoshi, I'll explain to you in the meeting room.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,050
Okay.

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,450
My proposal was green-lit as part of our in-house competition?

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,450
That's right. The proposal you submitted, and the one by himãƒ¼

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,640
Nice to meet you. I'm Shu Enomoto.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,670
- I became your fan after reading your proposal. 
 - Too close, too close!

18
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,580
Keep quiet, both of you.

19
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,930
What's going on?

20
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,170
Management was split between your proposal and his. Untilãƒ¼

21
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,780
I read your proposal,

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,600
and realized our ideas and ambitions were the same.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,250
What he said.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,720
Besides, I love all the games you've created so far.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,700
My proposal is nothing compared to yours.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,230
Enomoto, you're a promising lad indeed!

27
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,050
Thank you for the compliment!

28
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,620
- So in short, Hoshi... 
 - Yes?

29
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,180
You'll be leading this project as the team leader.

30
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,250
I want you to see this game through, with Enomoto as your planner.

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,430
Are you up for the challenge?

32
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,920
Yes, sir!

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,590
- Sorry for interrupting. 
  - I started dating my childhood friend, Hijiri. 

34
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,290
- I guess it'll be fine if you two stick together. 
 - Oh, Dad...

35
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,200
 Things have been going smoothly in both my work and love life. 

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,070
 - And now, we're finally moving in together.  
 - Right here.

37
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,950
- It's better to put these on opposite sides, right? 
 - Yeah.

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,750
- The TV. 
 - Ready, and up.

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,250
- Where do I put this? 
 - Inside here, I guess.

40
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,840
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 ðŸŽ€The bonds of love ðŸ’ž Team@Viki.com 

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,360
Ta-da.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,770
   

43
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,290
What now?

44
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,870
We're finally moving in together.

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,520
   

46
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,350
   
  &nbsp;
   

47
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,210
Team leader? 
    

48
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,360
That's amazing, Koyori.

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,270
Thanks for the praise.

50
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,480
What game did you come up with?

51
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,090
I can't be spilling our projects to other companies now, can I?

52
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,020
Ah, right.

53
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,870
Sorry about that.

54
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,640
But this role does come with some pressure.

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,860
Yeah, I guess it does.

56
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,750
But even if you hit a wall, don't dwell on it. Make sure to confide in your planner.

57
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,750
Yup, will do.

58
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,130
Things will get busier for me, even though we just moved in. Sorry.

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,950
Don't be. I've also just joined a new team, so that makes us even.

60
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,400
If anything, we moved in at the perfect time.

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,730
Even if we're both busy, we will still see each other at home.

62
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,520
You're right.

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,350
All right. A toast to our first day of living together.

64
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,830
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

65
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,140
Let's dig in. It looks delicious.

66
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,300
Bon appetit.

67
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,330
Yummy.

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,520
Delicious!

69
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,180
Speaking of, how do we split the chores?

70
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,050
Let's see. For starters, we'll clean our own rooms.

71
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,450
As for the common areas, I guess whoever notices the mess can clean it.

72
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,240
Why are you sighing? Or should we properly assign responsibilities?

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,970
I'm just bummed we're sleeping in separate rooms.

74
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,670
Come on, Hijiri...

75
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,660
Oops, I'm sorry!

76
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,640
You're right. It's better for us to sleep in separate rooms.

77
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,630
Since we may go to bed at different timings.

78
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,230
Sorry, I know we already talked about this.

79
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,640
I was also really conflicted about it, to be honest.

80
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,900
But for tonight...

81
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,140
shall we sleep together?

82
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,000
 - Hijiri, I'm coming in.  
 - Go ahead.

83
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,660
Whenever you're ready.

84
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,680
Koyori?

85
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,840
This feels awkward. It's been quite some time, you know?

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,960
Huh? What do you mean?

87
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,290
The mood just screams we're going to do it now, so... yeah.

88
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,640
- Huh? We're doing it? 
 - We're not?

89
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,770
Good night!

90
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,920
Wait, hang on.

91
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,860
Koyori, let's do it.

92
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,560
From now on, we won't have to go home separately on our days off.

93
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,250
Oh no! Hijiri, wake up!

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,310
- Oh shit! 
 - Hurry!

95
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,560
- We're going to be late. 
 - No...

96
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,120
Koyori, I'll get going first. Make sure to lock up before leaving.

97
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,640
Got it. See you.

98
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,320
- Bye. 
 - Take care.

99
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,650
Jeez, I wanted to prepare breakfast.

100
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,510
   

101
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,300
Hoshi, please say a few words.

102
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,520
I'm Hoshi, the team leader for this project.

103
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,770
I look forward to working with you all.

104
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,840
The team may be small now, but more folks will be joining,

105
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,440
so do your best in the meantime.

106
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,900
Will do. If anything, I'm prepared to complete this game with our current team.

107
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,920
I'll follow you all the way!

108
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't push yourself too hard, yeah?

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,830
I'm so glad you're in this with me, Kihara.

110
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm stuck with a clique-ish team, huh?

111
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,950
- Mr. Kawano. 
 - What is it?

112
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,010
It's my first time being a team leader, so I may trouble you in a variety of ways.

113
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,960
If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.

114
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,090
I'll welcome any advice.

115
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,650
Sure.

116
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,900
All right, let me start by giving an overview of the game.

117
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,460
 With the development team set up, we've begun working towards launch. 

118
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,540
 Meanwhile, Hijiri was also busy in his own way. 

119
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,510
I'm off to work.

120
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,890
Jeez... the sofa will get moldy if this goes on.

121
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:12,080
 Though we live together, the only time I get to see Hijiri is just before I go to bed. 

122
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,830
I'm off.

123
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,230
- Welcome back. 
 - I'm home.

124
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,460
 On days when I get home late, Hijiri will pick me up at the bus stop. 

125
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,620
Did you eat already?

126
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,720
- Yeah, a little. 
 - A little?

127
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,370
I was eating when you texted that you were on your way home.

128
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,470
What? You should have carried on with your meal.

129
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,350
It's fine. I wanted to eat together with you.

130
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,770
 Really? 

131
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm turning in first. Good night.

132
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,100
Good night.

133
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,780
 I hope he's not pushing himself too hard just to live together with me. 

134
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,770
But why?

135
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,300
 I mean, it's just a towel. Whoever notices can hang it back up. 

136
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,120
 Still... 

137
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,070
This happens every day. Does he really not notice?

138
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,200
- Ms. Hoshi! 
 - D-Don't raise your voice so suddenly like that!

139
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,760
Sorry about that.

140
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,540
I've made a flowchart for the game. Can you review it?

141
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,020
Oh, right. Thanks.

142
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,410
- I'll email it over to you. 
 - Sure.

143
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,010
   

144
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,120
It's good.

145
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,950
Glad to hear that.

146
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,760
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave then.

147
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,750
- Sure. See you. 
 - Bye.

148
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,950
Planners like you sure have it easy, huh?

149
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,790
Always heading home before us.

150
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,440
Guess I'll stay back and do a little more work.

151
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,930
- Just go home, Enomoto. 
 - But...

152
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,180
Mr. Kawano, don't make your junior feel guilty for heading home.

153
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,160
I'm just stating the facts.

154
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,210
Enomoto is only going home early because he has completed his work during office hours.

155
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,620
Are you saying I wasn't doing work during office hours?

156
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,030
- No, she isn't... 
 - Mr. Kawano.

157
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,130
You were the one who often said, "I can just stay back", no?

158
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,350
I was obviously joking, could you not tell?

159
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,900
- Then can you explain to me why you're staying back right now? 
 - Erm...

160
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,880
That's because my team leader,

161
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,940
Ms. Hoshi, was late in giving us the development schedule!

162
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,050
We work according to that schedule.

163
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,280
You keep tweaking around with the characters and specs.

164
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,220
I'm the one doing the programming.

165
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,850
My work will never end if you don't come to a compromise.

166
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,860
Point noted. I'll simplify it further then.

167
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,040
You don't have to compromise, Ms. Hoshi.

168
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,090
What?

169
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,470
The game will no longer be fun if you compromise on the important parts.

170
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,960
Besides, I love the programs that you write, Mr. Kawano.

171
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,290
You make the characters' movements look so sleek.

172
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,810
Say what?

173
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,250
I believe you can build a user-friendly system that will be the key to this game's success.

174
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,920
Well, yeah... That's what I've been trying to achieve.

175
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,770
I knew it! I'm right, aren't I?

176
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,880
Sorry about what I said earlier.

177
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
Nah, don't worry about that.

178
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,450
Same to you too, Ms. Hoshi.

179
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,020
No, likewise, I'm at fault.

180
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,210
All right, let's grind, shall we?

181
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,020
Okay...

182
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,040
Koyori, welcome back.

183
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,250
What's wrong?

184
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,970
Did something happen at work?

185
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,960
I see. I've gotten that sort of envy too, about going home early.

186
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,960
But I've finished my work. Of course, I'll leave.

187
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,440
So whether it's your junior or you, don't be bothered by it and head home.

188
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,530
- Okay. 
 - If you could leave earlier, I wouldn't need to pick you up either.

189
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,600
As long as you clearly explain why such specs are necessary, I'm sure they'll understand.

190
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,120
You've always been frank with me, right?

191
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,700
- So be frank with them, too. 
 - I can't.

192
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,550
Koyori?

193
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,210
We're behind schedule because I haven't been leading them properly.

194
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,200
I can't be frank, knowing I'm the reason for their stress.

195
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,930
I see.

196
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,220
It's the same with you.

197
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,640
There's no way I can be entirely frank with you.

198
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,210
Of course, I know that.

199
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,360
Oh my god.

200
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,600
Huh? What did Iãƒ¼

201
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,230
I feel so stupid for getting irritated and worked up all on my own.

202
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,130
You don't have to force yourself to hold back your frustration.

203
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,340
Aren't you the one who's forcing yourself?

204
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,670
I don't think I am, though.

205
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,930
You said you wouldn't "need" to pick me up if I left earlier.

206
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,150
Oh, I meant it as we could leave together from the office instead.

207
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:17,230
I still feel bad making you come to get me whenever I work late.

208
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,930
Wait. You don't want me to pick you up?

209
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,640
Not that I don't want you to.

210
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,430
But you have early mornings and still come to get me, even if you're in the middle of dinner.

211
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,740
Just like you're worried about me,

212
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,970
I'm also worried about you.

213
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,990
I was going home on my own when I lived alone, so I'll be fine.

214
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,980
I get it now. I won't pick you up anymore.

215
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,780
But promise you'll call if you see anyone suspicious nearby.

216
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,040
- I will. 
 - Good.

217
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,590
Let's go.

218
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:15,610
By the way, you always leave your towel hanging on the sofa.

219
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,500
Stop that bad habit, all right?

220
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,240
Sorry, I'll hang it back where it belongs next time.

221
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,740
- So there's nothing else? 
 - Yup. Everything's good.

222
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,950
 As long as we're frank with each other, everything will surely be fine. 

223
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,230
 How could he forget after just one day? 

224
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,420
 Maybe we were better off... 

225
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,070
 "Better off..."? 

226
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,280
Hoshi, let's call it here and grab some drinks.

227
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,460
You need to unwind once in a while.

228
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,100
- Huh? 
 - Or did you have plans with your boyfriend? It is Friday.

229
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,680
I don't have any plans in particular.

230
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,970
Let's do that. It's been a while.

231
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,840
All right!

232
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,990
- Do you want to join us, Enomoto? 
 - Yes, please!

233
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,130
- Ooh... 
 - Yay!

234
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm working on a personal game, so I'll pass.

235
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,840
Gotcha!

236
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,590
- Thanks for the hard work! 
 - Cheers!

237
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,910
- Ms. Kihara, when you go "boom" like that, you're really cool. 
 - You're too loud.

238
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,230
And what do you mean by "boom"? Call me "mature," why don't you?

239
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,770
But I get what you mean.

240
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,860
Hey. Then, Enomoto, what vibe does Hoshi give you?

241
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,910
- Huh? 
 - Don't bother. Enomoto's sound effects don't make sense.

242
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,950
You agreed with his "boom," though.

243
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,000
For Ms. Hoshi, it's like a "whoosh" feeling.

244
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,850
- "Whoosh"? 
 - "Whoosh"?

245
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,890
And what does that mean?

246
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,750
"Whoosh," as in when you ride a roller-coaster?

247
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,320
It's the excitement before the drop,

248
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,100
the thrill and adrenaline rush when you fall, and the relief when it's all over.

249
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,500
That's how I feel when working with Ms. Hoshi.

250
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,090
I hope to keep having this kind of feeling moving forward.

251
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,470
 Could it be that he... 

252
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,700
Sorry.

253
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,530
I was the one who invited you guys, but I have to leave now.

254
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,180
- What? 
 - My share. Let me know on Monday if it's not enough.

255
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,500
- Wait a minute... 
 - Sorry, Hoshi.

256
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,480
I forgot that my cat is waiting for me.

257
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,220
You have a cat? Since when?

258
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,410
- Ms. Hoshi! 
 - Y-Yes?

259
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,100
- You see, I... 
 - Listen!

260
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,070
I have a boyfriend.

261
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,970
I know that.

262
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,560
You mentioned you have a date or something with him. Right?

263
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,010
 Gosh, I misunderstood him! 

264
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,370
Are you sighing because of your boyfriend?

265
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,080
You've been sighing the entire time today.

266
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,950
- Are things going south with him? 
 - Wrong.

267
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,380
Sorry.

268
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,390
Have you ever moved in together with a girlfriend?

269
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,830
No.

270
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,110
- You're living with your boyfriend, Ms. Hoshi? 
 - Yeah.

271
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,460
We moved in together not long ago.

272
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,780
Despite our long history, I'm only now realizing our different habits bother me.

273
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,350
He's my childhood friend, soãƒ¼

274
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,290
- Your childhood friend? 
 - Too loud.

275
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,560
Speaking of, who was the one who confessed first?

276
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,540
- Him. 
 - Wow!

277
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,310
What's with that reaction?

278
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,560
He's your childhood friend?

279
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,840
I'm so envious.

280
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,540
Let's go, shall we?

281
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,530
Do you have any plans after this?

282
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,690
What?

283
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,100
I'm home.

284
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,940
I forgot about it again.

285
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,020
I guess I should stop using my towel in the living room.

286
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,410
I'll apologize to Koyori when she gets back.

287
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:30,010
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 ðŸŽ€The bonds of love ðŸ’ž Team@Viki.com 

288
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,240
   

289
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,090
Almost forgot.

290
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,550
I'm so tired.

291
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,680
 Do you have plans after this? 

292
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,180
 What? 

293
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,250
 Do you normally have supper after drinking? 

294
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,140
 Huh? No, I don't. I'm leaving. 

295
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,780
 - But why? Let's go get supper. 
 - Go home. 

296
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,490
Why does being around you always tire me out?

297
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,960
I didn't realize we both lived close by. What a coincidence.

298
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,320
But your home is in that direction, no?

299
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,590
Let's part ways here.

300
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,570
I can also go home by this route.

301
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,310
I'll walk you home on the way.

302
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,740
Is that so? Thanks.

303
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,950
- Mind if I drop by the convenience store? 
 - Go ahead.

304
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,360
 Sorry, Hijiri. 

305
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,260
 Let's eat it together. 

306
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,050
â™«  Only you can bring me a love  â™«

307
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,260
â™«  that will change my life  â™«

308
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,610
I can't decide.

309
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,770
Hijiri!

310
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,400
â™«  A casual moment makes me wonder  â™«

311
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,930
Ms. Hoshi?

312
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,050
â™«  But one thing is for sure  â™«

313
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,980
â™«  Do you wanna be my lady?  â™«

314
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,060
Hijiri?

315
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,410
â™«  Oh baby, say "I do"  â™«
