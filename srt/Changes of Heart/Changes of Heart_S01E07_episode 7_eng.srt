1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,850
- Thanks for dinner. 
 - Sure thing.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,950
I'll go wash the dishes.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,830
Let me wash them.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,910
Should we do it together? It'll be faster that way.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,910
Sure. Let's quickly wash them,

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,510
- and take a bath togetherãƒ¼ 
 - Absolutely not.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,660
- What? Don't be stingy. 
 - I'm not.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,400
Bring the cups over.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,180
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - Thanks.

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,650
- Towel... 
 - What?

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,080
I see you've stopped draping your towel on the sofa.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,030
I'm a good boy, aren't I?

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,090
Good boy, indeed.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,570
- It's thanks to you. 
 - Huh?

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,190
- You're a good girl, too. 
 - Really?

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,940
I'll get going.

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,250
Okay. Be careful.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,580
 Ever since our fight that day, life has been peaceful 

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,360
 without any issues whatsoever. 

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,130
The deadline for submitting our idea was...

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,630
 I almost forgot. Hijiri's birthday is coming up! 

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,240
What should I get him?

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,250
 Ever since we started working, I've been getting him gift cards. 

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,020
 But now... 

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,720
What's wrong? You're sort of clenching your phone.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,910
Take one.

27
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,830
Onsen manju*! Thank you. 
  (*Hot spring steamed buns) 

28
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,270
You went on a trip?

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,910
Kind of.

30
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,630
A hot spring does you good. It gets rid of your exhaustion after a day's work.

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,290
A hot spring, huh?

32
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,100
That's it!

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,810
What is?

34
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,950
A trip?

35
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,450
Yup. Which hot spring do you prefer?

36
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,590
I figured we'd go for your birthday.

37
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,350
What? I'm not getting a gift card this year?

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,620
- Wow, a whole trip... 
 - Sorry for the boring gifts until now.

39
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,950
A hot spring sounds incredible.

40
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,680
Let's definitely go.

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,760
Then here, take your pick.

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,600
Jeez, I'm overwhelmed with choices.

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,810
- Wait, a hot spring? 
 - Yeah.

44
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,850
- At the hot springs, with Koyori? 
 - This one says it's perfect for couples.

45
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,390
- Sounds nice. 
 - We're here.

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,840
This place looks wonderful. 
    

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,070
We have been waiting for your arrival. This way, please.

48
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,770
- We look forward to your care. 
 - We look forward to your care.

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,840
- Looks amazing. 
 - Right?

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,530
The weather today is divine.

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,050
- It is. 
 - Truly.

52
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,280
Thank goodness.

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,100
Dinner tonight will be our local specialty, boar meat hotpot.

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,510
Boar? As in, that boar?

55
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,210
Right. You've never had it before, have you?

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,130
Enjoy your stay.

57
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,560
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

58
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,850
Let's rest for a bit before going out to explore.

59
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,440
I've looked up local activities, and...

60
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,250
We're not going out.

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,540
We're here solely to enjoy the inn's facilities and services.

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,770
Enjoy the inn's facilities and services?

63
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,070
On normal days, we'd cook our own meals and clean up the house, no?

64
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,990
So I thought it'd be nice to have a day where we don't do anything for once.

65
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,590
- Not onboard? 
 - No, I totally am.

66
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,150
You came up with this itinerary for me, right?

67
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,430
So let's slowly enjoy our time here today.

68
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,470
Yes, let's.

69
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,150
Shall we check out the bathhouse?

70
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,280
Good idea. Let's go.

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:43,760

 ðŸŽ€The bonds of love ðŸ’ž Team@Viki.com 

72
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,040
I almost forgot.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,020
I heard this inn has private baths that we can rent.

74
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,020
I've already made reservations.

75
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,110
Let's take a bath together this evening.

76
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,490
- What? 
 - Let me go change first.

77
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,430
Koyori!

78
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,820
I said it. How embarrassing!

79
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,100
 Let's take a bath together. 

80
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,160
Thank God for birthdays!

81
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,750
A bath...

82
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,840
What just happened?

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,480
She's so cute!

84
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,250
Koyori actually said, "Let's take a bath together"!

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,760
Better take the keys with me.

86
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,020
   

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,820
I hope Koyori will be happy about that.

88
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,170
There you are, Hijiri. That was fast.

89
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,290
Well, I can always go back anytime.

90
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,410
Is that so?

91
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,510
Wait, why do you have this yukata?

92
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,340
They had patterned yukatas for rent, so I got us a pair.

93
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,980
Really? Thank you!

94
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,600
If you don't like that design, you can exchange it for another one.

95
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,490
No, I like this one.

96
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,520
Glad to hear that.

97
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,610
Looks delicious.

98
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,880
- Bon appÃ©tit! 
 - Bon appÃ©tit.

99
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,940
It's really delicious, Koyori.

100
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,420
- How's the tempura? 
 - It's perfect.

101
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,340
I'm really enjoying myself.

102
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,080
I'm glad you are.

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,380
Thanks for arranging this today, Koyori.

104
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,750
I had a lot of fun.

105
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,660
Really?

106
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,530
We were supposed to be celebrating your birthday,

107
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,150
but I got plenty of gifts from you instead.

108
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,100
Huh? I don't remember giving you any gifts.

109
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,310
You got us these yukatas, for one.

110
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,800
And seeing you enjoy dinner felt special, too.

111
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,310
You're wrong. I'm the one who got plenty of gifts.

112
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,860
What?

113
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,280
I got to see you arrange this trip,

114
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,180
I got to see you double-checking our train and bus schedules,

115
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,570
and I got to see you planning with my well-being in mind.

116
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,670
You've given me plenty with all these feelings.

117
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,900
Oh, Hijiri...

118
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,200
This is the best birthday present I've ever gotten.

119
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,420
I'm glad you love it!

120
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,470
Maybe it's about time we go take our bath.

121
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,070
Yes, let's.

122
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,340
I'm all warmed up now.

123
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,590
This was my first time taking a bath together with a guy.

124
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,900
Thinking about it still makes me blush.

125
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,900
That makes one more piece of "Koyori" that's only mine.

126
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,380
Hijiri, happy birthday.

127
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,150
Koyori, can I have one last present from you?

128
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,940
What would you like? I'm not sure if the shop is still open, though.

129
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,840
What did you think I wanted?

130
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,260
What I want... is you.

131
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,470
I'm already this full so early in the morning.

132
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,390
- It was super delicious, right? 
 - Yeah, it was.

133
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,690
Man, I had so much fun.

134
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,430
Me too.

135
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,690
Wanna take a bath together when we get home?

136
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,630
Your birthday privilege is officially over.

137
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,530
What?

138
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,670
I told you to be careful, didn't I?

139
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,990
Scared me out of my wits! Good thing you were holding my hand.

140
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,260
Ah, they look so lovey-dovey.

141
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,580
Just like us.

142
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,620
At this point, we may still be fine when we stumble.

143
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,700
But as we grow older into our golden years,

144
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,100
I want to be there to tell you that I'm glad I held onto your hand.

145
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,960
By that, you mean...

146
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,530
Let's hold hands and walk on together until then. Okay?

147
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,230
Sure.

148
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,550
Hijiri, can I sleep in your room...

149
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,450
Yeah, sure.

150
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,720
Sorry for interrupting whatever you were doing.

151
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,010
I'll sleep in my own room, after all.

152
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,290
Hang on. I think there's been a misunderstanding.

153
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,790
You were watching porn, weren't you?

154
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,850
I was not.

155
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,910
Come on in. Lie down with me.

156
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,840
Don't look at me like that.

157
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,320
Here. In you go.

158
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,450
- Make yourself comfy. 
 - Thanks.

159
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,310
Your feet are cold.

160
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,930
Today feels colder than usual.

161
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,030
Did you come into my room to warm yourself up?

162
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,440
Come here.

163
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,750
- Warm your feet under mine. 
 - Wow, they're so warm.

164
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,330
Hijiri, what are you doing?

165
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,070
Sorry, nothing in particular.

166
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,950
Not that it's nothing, I just thought that your hand felt cold.

167
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,860
I-Is it?

168
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,590
 Hijiri has been acting strange lately. 

169
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,770
What should we eat for dinner tonight?

170
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,860
 Even when we're together, he's often distracted. 

171
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,540
Are you listening?

172
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,850
Of course.

173
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,650
It's getting closer, it's scary. Better lower the volume.

174
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,810
 He's normally not on his phone when we're together, but lately... 

175
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,110
 He is. 

176
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,920
 His behavior... Why do I get this feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu? 

177
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,440
Hoshi, do you have a minute?

178
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,100
 It's this guy. 

179
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,800
Why are you glaring at me like that?

180
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,640
I haven't done anything.

181
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,750
 This dÃ©jÃ  vu feeling comes from him! 

182
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,990
His behavior is like Yoshida's when he was cheating on me!

183
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,200
- Hello? Hoshi? 
 - No, impossible!

184
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,900
- What now? 
  - Hijiri would never cheat on me. 

185
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,690
 And if he did, he's serious about her. 

186
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,480
No, I can't think that way!

187
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,620
What on earth is wrong with you?

188
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,000
 No, I can't let it keep bugging me. 

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,600
 I'll just ask him directly. Calm down, calm down... 

190
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,640
I need to ask you something, too, Kihara. Can we discuss it during lunchtime?

191
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,890
- Nope. 
 - Why not?

192
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,580
- Our precious lunch time, our freedom. 
 - I agree.

193
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,840
You're finally responding.

194
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,820
Mr. Yoshida, I'm all ears if you need me!

195
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,080
Enomoto, you're a good man!

196
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,400
- Sorry, could you get out of the way? 
 - Oops, sorry.

197
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,020
 But when should I pop the question? 

198
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,430
 I don't want him to feel like I don't trust him. 

199
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,260
Koyori, we need to talk.

200
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,210
Sorry to scare you. Are you okay?

201
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,980
I'm fine.

202
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,700
What is it?

203
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,980
You see...

204
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,250
 Don't tell me he really has someone else, and wants to break up? 

205
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,670
- I don't want to break up! 
 - About the birthday...

206
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,040
- Huh? 
 - Huh?

207
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,600
Break up? Why?

208
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,510
- I don't want to break up. 
 - Birthday?

209
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,020
- Whose birthday? 
 - Yours.

210
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,220
- Oh, I forgot about that! 
 - How could you forget?

211
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,980
And what's all this about breaking up?

212
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,940
Erm... I... I thought you wanted to break up with me.

213
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,400
What? Of course not.

214
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,640
Then why were you acting like this was going to be a difficult conversation?

215
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,580
Because I was worried you wouldn't like what I had planned for your birthday.

216
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,560
I really liked the trip you'd planned for me, so I'd also been doing research.

217
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,180
I thought we could go shopping together, to get something you'd like.

218
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,150
So that explains your weird behavior lately.

219
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,170
Huh? Weird?

220
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:17,130
You'd hide your laptop, secretly check your phone, and constantly get distracted.

221
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,010
- So I thought... 
 - You thought?

222
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,280
No, it's nothing.

223
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,490
 Sorry for not trusting you, Hijiri. 

224
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,980
This Saturday, let's go shop for your present,

225
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,960
and eat out at a nice restaurant.

226
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,910
How about we have dinner at home?

227
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,690
Sure. Then let me do the cooking.

228
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:46,430
But that will be too troublesome for you. We can just get food from the mall.

229
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,350
Then wouldn't it be better to eat out?

230
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,030
What's on your mind?

231
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,280
I figured you could pamper me if we ate at home.

232
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,990
- Let's settle dinner at home then. 
 - Okay.

233
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,210
I'm craving some cured ham.

234
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,500
- Cured ham? 
 - Yup.

235
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,400
Let's get plenty of that, then.

236
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,030
Found anything that you fancy?

237
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,850
I haven't seen anything I feel is "the one".

238
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,460
And I've already bought clothes and shoes lately.

239
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,450
- In that case, let's head over there. 
 - Huh?

240
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,780
Where?

241
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,000
Over there.

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,240
Over there?

243
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,230
Here, that is. 
    

244
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,900
Here?

245
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,660
Will "the one" be in here?

246
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,830
I'm not sure about that.

247
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,390
Look, they have earrings.

248
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,400
And, um... rings, too.

249
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,240
Let's go to the mall. To get dinner.

250
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,930
The mall.

251
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,130
Right.

252
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,930
Everything looked delicious. Dinner will be a tough choice.

253
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,990
Can we also get a cake?

254
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,990
Of course. But after we get your present.

255
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,460
- I can't seem to find anything I like. 
- What?

256
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,030
I mean, you've already given me everything that I wanted.

257
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,310
Seriously? I don't think so, though.

258
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,950
You gave me the matching keychain at the aquarium, and stationery when we were kids, too.

259
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,780
And you're content with that?

260
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,180
It's not only the material stuff.

261
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,850
Ever since we started dating, you've given me nothing but happiness every day.

262
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,200
The one I want is already right in front of me.

263
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,970
Koyori...

264
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,810
There's still something I haven't given you yet.

265
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,540
Like...

266
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,990
a ring.

267
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,290
Were you trying to measure my ring size?

268
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,200
I was.

269
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,770
I wanted to secretly get you one for your birthday, but I didn't know if you'd like it.

270
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,340
Then I figured we'd go get it together, but nothing caught your eye, so I started to panic.

271
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,970
Sorry about that.

272
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,010
So what do we do now? Shall we go back to the jewelry shop?

273
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:10,170
Instead of getting it now, I'd prefer to wear it when I get married someday.

274
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,250
Is that so?

275
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,660
In that case, let's go buy the cake and head home.

276
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,900
Yeah, sounds good.

277
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,980
Your fried egg looks good.

278
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,370
Huh? Y-You want my egg?

279
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,010
- May I? 
 - No, not mine.

280
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,710
- No? 
 - You really like eggs, don't you?

281
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,090
- Yes, ma'am. I love my proteins. 
 - I see.

282
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,730
Here, have some.

283
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,780
That's rare, coming from you.

284
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,540
Oh, thanks.

285
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,720
- Looks delicious. 
 - Thank you very much!

286
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,400
Wow, cookies.

287
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,850
- They look so fancy. 
 - I'll take a bite.

288
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,740
- It's delicious. 
 - Glad to hear that.

289
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,960
Thank you for the cookies.

290
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,700
I need to ask you guys a favor.

291
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,170
Wait, that's why you gave us cookies?

292
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,830
Oh no, I ate them.

293
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,680
Actually, I'm getting married.

294
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,510
Hoshi, wanna check out that new bar under the bridge?

295
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,380
Ah, that one. Let's go check it out.

296
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,660
Congratulations!

297
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,310
I really appreciate it, Enomoto.

298
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,310
Will you be holding a wedding ceremony?

299
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,590
Yes. That's why I'm asking you guys a favor.

300
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,700
No, you want us to do some lame performance at your wedding?

301
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,480
She's your ex, for goodness' sake!

302
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,370
- Ms. Hoshi! 
 - Sorry about that.

303
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,230
- Are you okay? 
 - Have some water, Ms. Hoshi.

304
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,850
Thanks.

305
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,280
What do mean by "your ex"?

306
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,640
- We don't have to go there. 
 - Oops, sorry.

307
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,750
We plan to do away with the reception, and just have a small ceremony with close relatives.

308
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,310
- But we may hold an after-partyãƒ¼ 
 - And we're supposed to do the lame performance there?

309
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,450
Let's forget the performance, shall we?

310
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,010
What I need help with is handling the reception desk, emceeing at the after-party,

311
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,540
and maybe prepping some bingo-game prizes.

312
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,290
In other words, you're asking for our help at the after-party, right?

313
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,230
Of course, I'll repay you all, and I know it's a troublesome favor.

314
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,110
But I hope you can help.

315
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,030
Sure, we'll help.

316
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,320
I'll be there for you!

317
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,410
I'll go since Hoshi agreed.

318
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,140
Congratulations on your wedding.

319
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,270
Thank you.

320
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,660
- I'll leave the delivery schedule to you. 
 - Got it.

321
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,670
- See you. 
 - Bye.

322
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,430
- Thanks for agreeing to help. 
 - No worries.

323
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:07,660
By the way, I forgot to ask. Who is your wife-to-be?

324
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,400
Did I not tell you?

325
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,460
- It's Saito. 
 - Huh?

326
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,840
That Saito?

327
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,150
Yeah, we had a lot going on, so.

328
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,690
I see...

329
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,210
Sorry, Hoshi.

330
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,090
Why are you apologizing?

331
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,520
You ought to have gotten married before I did.

332
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,930
You're sorry you got ahead of me? How condescending.

333
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,900
- No, you're wrong. 
 - Oh yeah?

334
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:43,620
Since he's your childhood friend, I just figured you'd skip the whole dating step.

335
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,140
Of course we did think about that, but...

336
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,060
But?

337
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,990
As childhood friends, we may have known each other for a long time.

338
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,420
But our time together as a couple has only just started.

339
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:08,200

â™«  Oops! Another captivating moment  â™«

341
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,720
A text from Saito?

342
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,230
She's getting married?

343
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,530
"I hope you and Ms. Hoshi can attend our wedding."

344
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,480
I'll ask Koyori when she gets back.

345
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,310
â™«  It says that you're all over my mind  â™«

346
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,460
â™«  Shockingly  â™«

347
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,900
â™«  Only you can bring me a love  â™«

348
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,380
Marriage, huh?

349
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,870
 Instead of getting it now, I'd prefer to wear it when I get married someday. 

350
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,220
"Someday"... and when is that?

351
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,600
â™«  Do you wanna be my lady?  â™«

352
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,630
â™«  Oh baby, say "I do"  â™«

353
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,520
 At the time, I thought we were headed in the same direction. But...
