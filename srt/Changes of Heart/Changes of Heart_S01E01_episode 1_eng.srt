1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,920
Darn the alarm...

2
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,760
I've turned it off.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,850
Thanks.

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,000
What? Hijiri?

5
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,610
Why am I in bed with you?

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,080
And we're naked.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,640
Don't you remember what happened yesterday, Koyori?

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,110
What?

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,420
 Yesterday, I broke up with my boyfriend of two and a half years. 

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,550
 Seriously, this is so screwed up! 

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,850
 He's having a baby? What's going on? 

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,020
 But I'm not pregnant. Wait, so he was cheating on me. 

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,970
 I totally didn't realize it at all. 

14
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,320
 What did you say to him? 

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,760
 "I guess that can't be helped then." 

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,040
 Can you blame me? I was panicking! 

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,500
 I'm so stupid. 

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,230
 I don't think you're stupid, though. 

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,980
 Oh, Hijiri... 

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,810
 But I do think he was cheating 'with' you, and not 'on' you. 

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,330
 Wait a minute. He never stayed over for Christmas. 

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,780
 He'd also say he had "work" on her birthdays. 

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,190
 Our dates always ended up being at my place, too. 

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,060
 I get it now. 

25
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,210
 He wasn't sleeping with me, but with someone else. 

26
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,050
 You two never had sex? 

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,910
 We did. In the beginning. 

28
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,410
 This always happens to me. 

29
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,030
 Even when I do get a boyfriend, our relationship ends up sexless. 

30
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,950
 They all say I'm more like a friend, and just lose their drive. 

31
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,630
 But I... 

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,410
 I want to have sex. 

33
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,010
 Koyori. 

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,990
 Want to do it with me? 

35
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,180
 No way. Impossible. You're like a sibling to me... 

36
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,800
 But I want to do it. With you. 

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:04,110



38
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,030
I did something terrible to you! I'm sorry!

39
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,110
After getting dumped, I got drunk and slept with you in the heat of the moment.

40
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,410
I'm so sorry, Hijiri!

41
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,360
It may have been in the moment, but I suggested it...

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,510
Forget what happened yesterday. I still want us to remain friends.

43
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,060
Pretend this never happened.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,370
So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to work.

45
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,700
- Just leave whenever. 
 - But it's Saturday.

46
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,190
I still have work. Don't peep!

47
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,810
Gotta go.

48
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,750
Just drop the key into the mail box.

49
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,620
Have a great day.

50
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,830
   

51
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,140
   

52
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,860
 What should I do? 

53
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,350
 I love you, Koyori. 

54
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,480
 Hijiri Akiyama and I are childhood friends. 

55
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,740
The cat and the rabbit are...

56
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,520
together.

57
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,720
 He's my neighbor, and we've been together for as long as I can remember. 

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,940
 We were together throughout elementary, junior high, and high school, as well as college. 

59
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,170
 We're even in the same line of work as game planners. 

60
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,250
 Though the companies we work for are different, they're housed in the same building. 

61
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,520
Morning.

62
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,700
Hey, Hoshi. Do planners also work on weekends?

63
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,510
Sort of.

64
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,600
Didn't you say yesterday, "I'm never gonna work in the same company as that two-timing jerk"?

65
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,560
He's here today, you know.

66
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,260
No way. You forgot about that?

67
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,960
- But I'm glad. 
 - Excuse me?

68
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,990
You turned up at the office that you proclaimed you'd never go back to.

69
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,190
I guess your breakup didn't affect you much after all.

70
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,000
Does it seem that way to you?

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,600
If I were you, I'd cut his thing off, place it on his head,

72
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,180
and spend a month planning how to turn it into a chonmage*. 
 (A topknot haircut worn by men during the Edo period)

73
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,350
I'd love to see that.

74
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,600
Focus, focus.

75
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,940
 I love you, Koyori. 

76
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,500
 Agh, I keep thinking about it. 

77
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,900
 What did he mean when he said, "I love you"? 

78
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,320
 I always thought Hijiri and I would be friends forever. 

79
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,690
- Koyori. 
 - Koyori.

80
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,180
Good work.

81
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,530
Why are you here?

82
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,280
I also had weekend work.

83
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,930
I just finished, so I was waiting for you.

84
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,640
- Why? 
 - Just because.

85
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,140
Who's that guy?

86
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,520
Don't tell me you were two-timing, too.

87
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,230
Excuse me? You're the one who's two-timing. He's my childhood friend.

88
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,650
Is that so.

89
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,910
About the girl I told you yesterday, turns out she was five-timing me.

90
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,790
She also lied that she's pregnant.

91
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,240
I know it's selfish of me to say this,

92
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,350
but I hope we can start over.

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,380
Request denied.

94
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,910
- Hijiri... 
- Let's go, Koyori.

95
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,480
- Wait... 
 - If you'll excuse us.

96
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,260
Hey.

97
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,910
You were dating that kind of jerk? I wish I'd known sooner.

98
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,930
Let go of me.

99
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,480
Hey, that's rude.

100
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,650
Why did you reject him on my behalf?

101
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,780
What? You wanted to get back together with him?

102
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,060
No way in hell.

103
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm just saying you had no right to interfere.

104
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,750
But I have every right.

105
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,440
Come again?

106
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,390
Koyori, go out with me.

107
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,630
Why should I?

108
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,660
Well, I don't have a girlfriend, for one.

109
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,440
Besides, though it was a casual fling, we did sleep together.

110
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,230
I should take responsibility.

111
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,000
So, let's go on a date next weekend.

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,350
Wasn't there a cat cafe you'd been eyeing? Let's go there.

113
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,990
- Casual fling, huh. 
 - I've looked it up...

114
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,590
There are couples who date after they've slept with each other. 
    

115
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,440
True, but still...

116
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,620
What? Did you want him to act like it never happened?

117
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,780
That'd be sort of scummy of him.

118
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,630
But he said...

119
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,940
 Though it was a casual fling, we did sleep together. 

120
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,150
He said that. A casual fling. I feel stupid for getting all excited.

121
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,050
What do our years of friendship mean then?

122
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,350
He doesn't care about my feelings.

123
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,990
I see.

124
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,090
So he's precious to you.

125
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,110
What?

126
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,440
 These precious feelings, though subtle, have been buried deep in my heart. 

127
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,600
 When we were in the third year of junior high... 

128
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,310
Sorry, Koyori.

129
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,900
- I can't go home with you today. 
 - Huh?

130
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,930
See ya.

131
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,040
 Hijiri got himself a girlfriend. 

132
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,600
Damn, he beat me to it.

133
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,550
 Later on, I had a boyfriend too, so Hijiri and I hung out less often. 

134
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,090
I haven't spoken much to Hijiri lately.

135
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,980
 That was when I started to feel lonely. 

136
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,420
Wait, why do I...

137
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,880
Don't tell me...

138
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,770
No way!

139
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,950
 Just when I realized that, Hijiri got dumped by his girlfriend. 

140
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,710
Where shall we go today?

141
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,080
You're not going with him?

142
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,030
It's fine. Let's go.

143
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,090
 I was scared. 

144
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:13,210
 We were close buddies not long ago, yet now we didn't even make eye contact. 

145
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,990
 Even if I told him how I felt, those feelings would only fade away eventually. 

146
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,820
 In that case, it was better to keep things status quo. 

147
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,770
 So I put my feelings aside. 

148
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,360
I see. You cared so much that you've made things worse.

149
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,610
Made things worse?

150
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,880
- Goodness! 
 - You okay? Here, take a wet wipe.

151
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,340
Thanks.

152
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,570
This is the worst.

153
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:51,780
No use crying over spilt milk, huh?

154
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,230
What did you say?

155
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,840
I have no choice but to move on.

156
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,620
I guess I'll go on a date with him.

157
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,750
Sounds good.

158
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,300
What do you think I should wear for my date, Kihara?

159
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,440
Huh? Haven't you gone out on a date before?

160
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,450
But he's my childhood friend. What should I do?

161
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,300
- Show leg. 
 - That's vague.

162
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,200
   

163
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,650
Guess she's not coming.

164
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,650
Koyori.

165
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,150
Koyori? I'm coming in.

166
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,250
Koyori?

167
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,090
What's going on?

168
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,950
Why aren't you dressed?

169
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,810
Sorry for not turning up.

170
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,400
I was hoping you'd at least inform me. What happened?

171
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,850
I had no idea what to wear for our date.

172
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,250
What?

173
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,350
Since it's a date, I figured I'd wear something different.

174
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,650
But if I do, then you'd wonder why I got all dolled up.

175
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,880
- But I wouldn't. 
 - Then I thought if I dressed up like always,

176
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,450
you would...

177
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,510
I just wanted you to think I looked pretty.

178
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,030
Sorry, I'm just blabbering nonsense.

179
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,650
Koyori, you see...

180
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,430
You have a fever.

181
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,240
Come on.

182
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,920
Lie down.

183
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,240
I'll go buy some medicine. Our date can wait.

184
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,780
 I couldn't even properly say "sorry" or "thank you" to him. 

185
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,550
 Why can't I be myself in front of Hijiri? 

186
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,070
Here's your order.

187
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,050
- It's delicious. 
 - I know, right?

188
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,670
- One ramen, please. 
 - Coming right up.

189
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,130
What? Why are you here?

190
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,720
I heard rave reviews about this place.

191
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,140
And why sit beside me?

192
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,570
Doesn't matter where I sit.

193
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,370
- Move. 
 - Your ramen's getting soggy.

194
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
Jeez, Koyori.

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,130
Your hair is getting into the soup.

196
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,860
Stop it. Hands off. Go away.

197
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,310
Why are you being so snippy?

198
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,010
Sorry, Kihara. Gotta go. I'll pay you back later.

199
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,750
Hijiri.

200
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,340
Thanks for taking care of me when I was sick. I'm all better now.

201
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,220
Really? Glad to hear that.

202
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,440
About our date...

203
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,070
How about this weekend?

204
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,830
Sorry, but work is starting to get busier.

205
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,790
- Huh? 
 - I'll contact you again.

206
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,130
Hijiri...

207
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,640
Can you stop pestering Hoshi already?

208
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,840
Does it even matter?

209
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,420
Hoshi's busy re-experiencing her first crush. She's got no time for you.

210
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,350
Excuse me? First crush?

211
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,960
How nice.

212
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,430
To care about someone so much that you don't know what to do about it.

213
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,550
It feels like you're in love purely on instinct.

214
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,670
 He hasn't texted at all. 

215
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,520
Guess I'll text him then.

216
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,660
What do I say?

217
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,440
Will I come across as a pushover?

218
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,850
What should I do?

219
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,120
   

220
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,060
"when you'll be free. Okay?"

221
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,020
All right, sent!

222
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,230
   

223
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,840
It's been one week and he hasn't replied.

224
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,590
 Is everything going to end just like that? 

225
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,610
 Back then, it didn't have anything to do with me, but... 

226
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,150
 When we were childhood buddies, 

227
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,370
 he could ignore me for a month and I wouldn't have cared. 

228
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,220
 But now, only one week in and it feels like... 

229
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,300
 My entire head is filled with thoughts of Hijiri. 

230
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,310
I'm moping around all on my own and it's pissing me off!

231
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,610
   

232
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,480
   

233
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,820
Hijiri?

234
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,960
What are you doing here?

235
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,380
What are you doing here?

236
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,550
My parents are away on holiday, so I'm looking after Mike.

237
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,270
I see.

238
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,870
All right then, see ya.

239
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,810
If you have no plans,

240
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,660
you want to come over to my place for dinner?

241
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,980
   

242
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,090
   

243
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,900
How did you grill this?

244
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,820
The same way as always.

245
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,730
I'll pour you more tea.

246
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,230
I don't know what to do about Hijiri.

247
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,620
He says he never has time for chores, and always ends up dropping by.

248
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,030
Indeed. Defeats the purpose of him moving out.

249
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,760
If only someone could be there by his side, we'd feel more assured. Right?

250
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,170
Don't say such unnecessary things.

251
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,760
Oh, right. I've been given a huge bunch of apples.

252
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,120
- Want to eat some, Koyori? 
 - Yes, please.

253
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,610
- I'll help peel them. 
 - You sure?

254
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,980
- You can bring some home. 
 - Really?

255
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,820
- Come, take some. 
 - I'll help myself then.

256
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,180
They're really juicy.

257
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,000
- See? 
 - Wow, they look delicious.

258
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,060
Maybe it's better for us to remain childhood buddies, after all.

259
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,860
 I guess that's how Hijiri feels too, seeing that he's grown distant. 

260
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,790
 Work is starting to get busier. 

261
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,210
 I'll contact you again. 

262
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,690
Screw it. I'll go ask him.

263
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,040
If he rejects me, so be it.

264
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,610
Huh? A cushion?

265
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,280
What are you doing, Koyori?

266
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,810
You gave me a scare back there.

267
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,280
Koyori?

268
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,930
Do you really want us to go back to being childhood buddies?

269
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,460
Say what?

270
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,280
I was dumped that day, and you were feeling sorry for me. Right?

271
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,630
And then we had that fling...

272
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,430
No.

273
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,840
Sorry.

274
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,440
You were feeling down about being dumped, and I took advantage of that.

275
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,020
What?

276
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,440
You wanted to pretend it never happened,

277
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,410
so I figured that summed it up to a fling.

278
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,250
It felt embarrassing that I was the only one who was thrilled about it.

279
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,530
- You were thrilled? 
 - Hell yeah, I was.

280
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,290
If we remain childhood friends, we could stay together forever.

281
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,340
That was why I gave up on chasing you.

282
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,540
But the truth is, I've liked you since way back.

283
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,140
But then, why?

284
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,780
Why haven't you contacted me for a week?

285
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,120
Because I saw you both... at the ramen store.

286
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,420
Your ex was stroking your hair.

287
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:51,160
And it felt like my spot closest to you was taken away from me.

288
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,300
No way I'd allow a jerk like him to be closest to me.

289
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,760
To be honest, I was actually afraid.

290
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,670
We've been together all this time,

291
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,140
and that really matters to me.

292
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,250
But you kept your distance...

293
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,030
and I thought you didn't like me anymore.

294
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,300
I thought maybe I'd never see you again, and I...

295
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,100
Koyori, can you step back from the railing?

296
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,260
Huh?

297
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:42,090



298
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,710
Hey, that's dangerous! If you fallー

299
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,720
♫  Hey, your eyes are perfect  ♫

300
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,150
I'd never come to dislike you.

301
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,420
♫  Babe, you're always by my side, and so kind  ♫

302
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,840
You matter to me, too.

303
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,000
I can't imagine not being able to see you.

304
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,550
♫  I want to see it more  ♫

305
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,070
Yeah.

306
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,940
♫  A monologue in my heart sings of my love  ♫

307
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,890
Let me say this to you again.

308
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,370
I love you, Koyori.

309
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,890
Will you go out with me?

310
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,140
Okay.

311
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,900
♫  A casual moment makes me wonder  ♫

312
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,460
♫  But one thing is for sure  ♫

313
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,710
♫  Do you wanna be my lady?  ♫

314
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,300
No, I can't do this when I'm sober!

315
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,800
What?

316
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,370
 Can we ever behave like lovers? 

317
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,400
♫  Yeah, baby, you know I love you  ♫
