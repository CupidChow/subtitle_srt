1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,880
 I'll head over right now, then. 

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,560
 No,  I'll go over to your place. 

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,430
 - I can't wait...  
  - I can't wait... 

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,290
 - to see him.  
  - to see her. 

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,550
I wish we could spend more time together.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,440
Likewise.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,110
Koyori.

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,230
Want to move in together?

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,450
- Are... 
 - Are?

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,990
Are you sure?

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,260
Living together means exposing our flaws to each other...

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,010
I'm very sure, that's why I asked.

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,870
My apartment is supposed to be the perfect size for one.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:13,020
But now it feels especially huge when you're not around.

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,300
This shows how important your presence has become, more than ever before.

16
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,590
So, will you move in together with me?

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,710
- Hijiri, I alsoãƒ¼ 
 - Besides,

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,070
I've already seen plenty of your flaws.

19
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,600
- Say what? 
 - You use the remote with your feet,

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,060
you get into a bad mood when you lose to me in games,

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,270
- and also... 
 - You don't have to list them out.

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,560
But I also share the sentiment about moving in together.

23
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,020
Koyori.

24
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,410
Before we move in together, we should let our parents know of our relationship.

25
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,630
And when do we do that?

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,130
As soon as possible, I guess.

27
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,310
How about next weekend?

28
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,250
Yup, sounds good.

29
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,570
While we're at our parents' place, let's drop by Yuhigaoka Park.

30
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,200
- Great idea. 
 - That's settled then.

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,670
   

32
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,410
You're announcing your relationship to your parents before moving in with your boyfriend?

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,800
What's so scary about that?

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,940
Things are going too smoothly.

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,750
- I get it. You're showing off. 
 - Don't ignore me, Kihara.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,210
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing.

37
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,690
Anyways, I can't help but feel nervous.

38
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,190
What should I wear there?

39
00:02:52,030 --> 00:03:01,070



40
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,810
Maybe I'd better wear a suit to meet them.

41
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,170
Like I said, you don't have to go overboard. Just be yourself.

42
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,290
- But still... 
 - Oh, right.

43
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,410
My dad will be away at work tomorrow and won't be home.

44
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,950
Looks like he'll only be back the day after.

45
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,630
In that case, is it all right if we meet my parents first?

46
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,670
Good.

47
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,720
Are you relieved to hear that my dad's not around?

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,070
Well...

49
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,350
Being nervous about meeting him is one thing.

50
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:51,380
But I've also never been... great at dealing with him?

51
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,270
I get it now. My dad's always been strict towards you. Right?

52
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,620
Rather than strict, he was...

53
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,480
Anyway, it's nothing.

54
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,750
Koyori, do you remember this?

55
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,710
Fortune-telling with straw wrappers.

56
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,890
I remember. It's to find out who loves who more, right?

57
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,850
Yup. This end is you,

58
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,950
- and this end is me. 
 - Okay.

59
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,740
All right. Here goes.

60
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,150
I knew it. I'm the one who loves you more.

61
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,520
What? I am the one who loves you more!

62
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,520
- She said she loves him more. 
 - Koyori?

63
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,350
That's so cute.

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,690
Stop laughing. It's embarrassing.

65
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,190
Sorry. But you were really adorable.

66
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,740
Was it that funny?

67
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,380
Seriously, stop!

68
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,850
 Hijiri and I are childhood friends who grew up together. 

69
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,270
 However... 

70
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,780
 I've liked you since way back. 

71
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,220
 I love you, Hijiri. 

72
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,750
 I love you, Koyori. 

73
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,140
 Will you go out with me? 

74
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,610
 When he laughs, I end up laughing with him. 

75
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,810
 And now, we're about to take the next step in our lives together. 

76
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,220
 But before that, 

77
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,770
 there's something we need to settle first. 
   

78
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,870
- I'm back. 
 - Welcome home.

79
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:52,180
Oh, my! You said you're bringing your girlfriend, and it's Koyori?

80
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,920
You don't have to be so surprised.

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,070
Come on in. Please have a seat.

82
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,970
- Make yourself comfortable. 
 - Hello, Mrs. Akiyama.

83
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,380
Wait! When you came over for dinner the other day, were you both already dating?

84
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,640
About that... I'm sorry we didn't tell you sooner.

85
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,290
No, no worries at all. We should apologize for not realizing.

86
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,650
- You two have been together since you were kids, after all. 
 - That's true.

87
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,900
Good for you, Hijiri. Back in the day, you'd only obsess over her constantly.

88
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,650
Enough about that.

89
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,370
Here's a little something for you.

90
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,350
Why, thank you.

91
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,700
So, Koyori and I plan to move in together. Will that be okay?

92
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,770
Sure.

93
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,780
Make sure you take care of each other.

94
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,950
Yes, ma'am.

95
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,390
What a relief!

96
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,290
My parents are open-minded folks.

97
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,760
My parents should be fine with it, too.

98
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,610
I sure hope so.

99
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,340
Koyori, you don't understand how I'm feeling.

100
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,110
I promise it'll be fine. Let's head to the park. Okay?

101
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,480
As I was saying...

102
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,320
- How nostalgic. 
 - Seriously.

103
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,460
- Hurry up, let's go. 
 - Koyori, wait.

104
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,140
- That was close. 
 - That gave me a fright!

105
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,280
I was the one who got a fright.

106
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,390
Sorry.

107
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,170
I'm just so excited we're back. The park makes me feel like a kid again.

108
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,810
Here.

109
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,780
Let's take our time, Koyori.

110
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,390
 Why do I feel like Hijiri has become so much more mature? 

111
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:34,150
 One time when we were kids, the two of us got lost play-fighting with sticks. 

112
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,860
 Don't worry. 

113
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,560
 Hijiri... 

114
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,230
 I'll protect you, Koyori. I promise. 

115
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,150
 He never let go of my hand back then as well. 

116
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,860
- Koyori. 
 - Yes?

117
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,410
Look.

118
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,520
 He never left my side back then either. 

119
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,300
 - Hijiri. 
 - Hm? 

120
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,420
 - Thank you. 
 - Yup. 

121
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,410
Hijiri, thank you.

122
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,320
I never thought I'd visit this park again with you.

123
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,780
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

124
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,820
Although we might have visited as "childhood friends".

125
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,580
Or maybe not.

126
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,120
It's my first time back here as an adult anyways.

127
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,820
Yeah. I probably wouldn't have come here if we hadn't started dating, either.

128
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:09,640
Before this, we used to just go out for drinks if we bumped into each other.

129
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:16,180
That's why I never thought I'd be visiting this park again.

130
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,250
Yet here I am now, sharing this moment with you.

131
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,460
I'm a happy man.

132
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,380
Stop!

133
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,730
- What the hell are you doing? 
 - Dad!

134
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,780
What were you doing with your hand? What did you do?

135
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,430
Why are you here? Weren't you coming home tomorrow?

136
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,470
My only daughter is visiting. Of course, I'd wrap up early to see her.

137
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,150
You didn't tell me.

138
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,960
I was hiding by the entrance this whole time to surprise you.

139
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,260
- You were? 
 - But I saw you two coming out of the Akiyama residence.

140
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,320
You came out flirting, and then at the park...

141
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,000
Dad, let's talk about this at home.

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,490
Hijiri, I'm really sorry.

143
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,900
Come on, walk properly.

144
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,480
- Dad, be quiet! Sorry. 
- You didn't hear about this?

145
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,090
I had no idea.

146
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,320
I really had no idea.

147
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,490
   

148
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,460
I was wondering where you'd gone.

149
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,600
Turns out you had been on a rampage.

150
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,620
So...

151
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,530
You plan to move in together?

152
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,330
Yes, ma'am. Koyori and I are serious aboutãƒ¼

153
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,780
It's perfectly fine. No need to act so formally.

154
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,790
Just be yourself.

155
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,160
- Mrs. Hoshi, Koyori and Iãƒ¼ 
 - Absolutely not.

156
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,680
Dear.

157
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
I can't entrust Koyori to someone

158
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,470
who can't follow through with being formal, just because he's told to "be himself".

159
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,830
Besides, Koyori has been engaged to someone since before she was born.

160
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,560
- What? 
 - What?

161
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,640
Just kidding.

162
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,440
- Whatever. 
 - That wasn't funny.

163
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,780
Hijiri, stay over for the night.

164
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,250
Pardon?

165
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,160
I'll give you an entire night to convince me.

166
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,240
Yes, sir.

167
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,210
Sorry about that, Hijiri. He's one troublesome old man.

168
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,320
It's okay.

169
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,130
Just so you know, I'm all for you two moving in together.

170
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,460
- If anything, it's better to get this resolved before the wedding. 
 - Huh?

171
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,800
Feel free to let yourself in when you bring your stuff over.

172
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,670
Yes, ma'am. I'll be back.

173
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:09,210
 This is Travis Japan's... Walk Around! 

174
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,840
They sure look energetic.

175
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,390
So Koyori's dad is a tough nut to crack, huh?

176
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,580
I won't exactly say tough.

177
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,980
I've just never really understood him.

178
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,580
He's always telling these weird lies, too.

179
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,830
Perhaps he's feeling lonely, no?

180
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,730
Maybe. Koyori is his only child, after all.

181
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,820
- That, and because of you as well. 
 - Me?

182
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,090
Mr. Hoshi used to always play with you,

183
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,490
especially when your father was busy with work.

184
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,280
But as you grew up, you made more friends,

185
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,120
and gradually stopped playing with Mr. Hoshi.

186
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,240
So although you've grown up,

187
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,990
you're still a kid in his eyes.

188
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,330
Then you started dating his daughter,

189
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,500
and even came to announce you're moving in together?

190
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,880
Of course, he's both shocked and lonely.

191
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,850
 Hey, Hijiri. 

192
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,450
 Hijiri, come here. 

193
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,750
 Today's the day Momotaro is going to be drifting down the river. 

194
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,510
 - Really? 
 - Yeah. Let's go see him together. 

195
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,390
 - Okay! 
 - Go get ready. 

196
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,960
 Got it! 

197
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,610
 That's impossible. 

198
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,530
 He's not drifting over here? 

199
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,040
 Forget about that. Let's play dodgeball. 

200
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,150
 Ever since I was little, he'd make up all sorts of weird lies. 

201
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,990
 But when I'd come crying after a fight with Koyori... 

202
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,400
 Hey, little man, what's wrong? 

203
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,240
 Not fair! Koyori always wins our games. 

204
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,840
 Aw, don't cry. 

205
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,610
 All right, come on. 

206
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,100
Thanks for having me, again.

207
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,530
 Jeez, what's wrong with you? 

208
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,390
 Quit messing around with Hijiri, and listen to what he's trying to say. 

209
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,180
I never said I wouldn't listen.

210
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,440
However...

211
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,800
What exactly do you want, Koyori?

212
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,170
Huh?

213
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,630
When you were a kid, you used to say, "I'm never gonna be with Hijiri!"

214
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,040
What?

215
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,460
 Don't use my childhood against me. 

216
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,600
My feelings were complicated then. You wouldn't understand anyway.

217
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
What's so complicated about that?

218
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,630
Just keep it simple.

219
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,780
Huh? I don't get what you mean.

220
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,060
When you kids were about five, Hijiri came up to me and said this.

221
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,380
"It's fun being with Koyori. I want to marry her."

222
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,220
He did?

223
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,840
 I can't possibly entrust Koyori to you if you keep on crying. 

224
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,350
 Come on, give me a punch. 

225
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,220
 If you can get stronger, she may want to marry you. 

226
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,030
 Atta boy. One more. 

227
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,760
 That's it. Harder! 

228
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,800
 Give me one more! 

229
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:04,830
From then on, I'd let him throw a punch or two whenever he felt like crying.

230
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,070
 Why does Koyori win all the time? 

231
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,280
 You crying again, Hijiri? 

232
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,850
 Come here. 

233
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,960
 Hey, listen up. 

234
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,790
 If you like Koyori, you can't keep crying so easily like this. 

235
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,630
 You have to be able to protect her when I'm not around. 

236
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,560
 All right? Come, give me the usual. 

237
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,160
 Come on, harder! 

238
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,750
 That's it! Harder! Good. 

239
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,280
 Give me another one. 

240
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,430
 Harder, harder. Go for it! 

241
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,890
But as he grew older, the punches got less and less.

242
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,210
The kid's gotten all wishy-washy after years of not seeing him.

243
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,670
Can't he just keep it simple with me?

244
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,630
Dad...

245
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,850
- Excuse me. 
 - Hijiri?

246
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,190
I'm dating Koyori because I love her.

247
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:44,200
Dad, I'm dating Hijiri because I love him, too.

248
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,840
Koyori...

249
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,800
The two of you have really grown up, huh?

250
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,520
Back then...

251
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,870
 Hey, hey, hey... Are you both okay? 

252
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,900
 The two of you would walk and fall down together. But now... 

253
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,970
You could support each other in an instant.

254
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,040
I guess it'll be fine if you two stick together.

255
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,670
Oh, Dad...

256
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,020
No one knows what will happen in future, though.

257
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,210
Jeez, Dad!

258
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,470
What a relief...

259
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,660
At least that's one problem down.

260
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,370
You've worked hard today.

261
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,130
Sorry about my dad's behavior.

262
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,780
Don't be.

263
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,670
Still, I'm glad we got to hear stories about us we never knew.

264
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,550
Koyori,

265
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,450
can I go over to you?

266
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,530
But...

267
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,890
I want to cuddle with you while I sleep.

268
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,180
â™«  It says that you're all over my mind  â™«

269
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,090
â™«  Shockingly  â™«

270
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,920
â™«  Only you can bring me a love  â™«

271
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,220
â™«  that will change my life  â™«

272
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,650
â™«  My hearts flutters just thinkin' bout you, girl  â™«

273
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,590
â™«  A casual moment makes me wonder  â™«

274
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,290
Koyori.

275
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,400
â™«  Do you wanna be my lady?  â™«

276
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,980
Hey, why are you two sleeping together?

277
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,390
- Mom was the one who laid the mattresses. 
 - That's right.

278
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,170
Hijiri will be sleeping with me. Right?

279
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,560
- Dad, why are youãƒ¼ 
 - If you'll excuse me.

280
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,610
Hijiri, you okay? Dad, go sleep on your own.

281
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,560
Why should I? Hijiri, bring out your mattress and follow me.

282
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,930
- Yes, sir. 
 - Jeez...

283
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,150
Sorry about that, Hijiri.

284
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,360
Let's check out some apartments when we get back.

285
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,930
Okay.

286
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,950
 Hijiri, what's taking you so long? 

287
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,680
Coming! Right away!

288
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,690
Thanks.

289
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,530



290
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,930
   

291
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,200
You're moving this weekend?

292
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,580
Yeah, I'm swamped with all the packing.

293
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,310
You complain, but you're glowing with happiness.

294
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,820
Wait, for real?

295
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,680
Ms. Hoshi! Ms. Koyori Hoshi!

296
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,420
- Who's that? 
 - I finally found you.

297
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,140
He's heading over here. He's walking towards you.

298
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,700
Kihara...

299
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,490
Wait, calm down.

300
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,500
- Who is that? 
 - He's kind of dramatic.

301
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,900
- Ms. Koyori Hoshi. 
 - Yes?

302
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,950
I love you.

303
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,510
Excuse me?
