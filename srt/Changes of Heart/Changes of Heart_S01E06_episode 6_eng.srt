1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,390
Hijiri?

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,050
Ms. Hoshi, this gentleman here is...

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,790
Well, he's...

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,070
The name's Hijiri Akiyama.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,810
Like he said.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,340
I'm Enomoto. Ms. Hoshi and I are coworkers.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,970
I presume he's your boyfriend, right?

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,440
That means my role ends here. See you.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,060
Thanks again.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,460
See you, too, Mr. Boyfriend.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:49,650



12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,730
Let's go, shall we? We're blocking the entrance.

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,720
Didn't you come here to buy something? With him.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,250
Huh?

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,620
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,000
There's no point hanging the towel after you get home.

17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,140
You told me not to pick you up.

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,000
 I feel bad making you come to get me whenever I work late. 

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,580
Turns out you wanted other guys to send you home.

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,350
You'd have to leave the house to pick me up. He was walking me home on his way back.

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,790
Didn't I tell you that picking you up was no trouble at all?

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,930
Like I said, I was worried that you'd be tired from work.

23
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,790
Don't go assuming how I will feel.

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,200
Why are you trying to put up a wall between us?

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,150
A wall?

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,330
We're living together.

27
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,580
Can't you let down your guard around me?

28
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,010
If I'd known...

29
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,710
What?

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,670
If I'd known we would argue like this, maybe we should've stayed childhood friends.

31
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,040
No, I mean...

32
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,030
Why are you talking like we're going to break up?

33
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,750
Hijiri, are you awake?

34
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,620
Hijiri...

35
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,630
His shoes are gone.

36
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,980
Wait. He ran away from home?

37
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,380
No way... No way...

38
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,920
   

39
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,590
He's not here.

40
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,470
What should I do?

41
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,320
Maybe I'll go look forãƒ¼ 
    

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,360
Oh, right. The phone, the phone... 
    

43
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,600
   

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,110
Thank goodness.

45
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,360
He sent me a text.

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,550
   

47
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,160
A proper talk... What does that entail?

48
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,040
   

49
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,030
 My boyfriend and I, who were getting along only hours ago, 

50
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,730
 are now fighting over something trivial. 

51
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,440
 We may even be on the verge of a break up. 

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,510
   

53
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,750
Thanks for the meal.

54
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,600
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,940
- Good morning, Ms. Hoshi. 
 - Morning.

56
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,560
Good morning.

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,320
Was everything okay last week?

58
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,780
What?

59
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,360
I mean, your boyfriend saw us walking home together.

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,890
He seemed sort of put-off by it, too.

61
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,990
So I was really hoping I didn't cause any trouble.

62
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,870
Oh, that. We're fine.

63
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,790
Thank goodness!

64
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,160
I was so worried, I only ate two bowls of rice instead of the usual three.

65
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,910
I think two is more than enough, though.

66
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,390
- Have you gotten used to each other's habits? 
 - Huh?

67
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,120
I figured I'd learn a tip or two for future reference.

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,030
Since you're more experienced in "childhood-friend romances."

69
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,580
You're also going out with your childhood friend?

70
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,730
Well, about that... um...

71
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,240
Sort of! We haven't reached the point of dating each other yet, though.

72
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,720
But your experiences have inspired me to make my move.

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,780
Is that so?

74
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,370
Still, I'll have to mentally prepare myself.

75
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,830
Since I may very well destroy our friendship by doing so.

76
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,820
That's why I have a deep respect for your boyfriend.

77
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,470
Respect?

78
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,300
He must have been really scared when he confessed to you.

79
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,210
Mr. Yoshida! Good morning, Mr. Sosuke Yoshida!

80
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,170
Don't call out my full name so loudly in here!

81
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,780
 I love you, Koyori. 

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,020
I'm home. I've bought you dinner. 
    

83
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,140
Sorry to disturb you when you're so busy with work.

84
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,380
Ow, ow, ow...

85
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,440
Of all times, your dad had to be on a work trip when this happened.

86
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,870
- Ouch... 
 - Don't push yourself too hard.

87
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,550
It's funny that I'm feeling hungry even though I can't move.

88
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,290
Here you go. 
    

89
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,840
My, my...

90
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,080
You've always loved pudding, haven't you?

91
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,030
- Yeah... 
 - I remember you and Koyori once had a huge fight over it.

92
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,110
- You okay, Mom? 
 - Ow...

93
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,630
 Hijiri, want some pudding? 

94
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,220
 After I clear this round. 

95
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,250
 Yes! I cleared it! 

96
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,170
 It's pudding time! 

97
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,540
 It's gone! 

98
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,860
 There's no more for you. 

99
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,150
 Koyori, you ate my share! 

100
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,410
 Welcome back, Koyori. 

101
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,620
I'm home.

102
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,200
What should I eat for dinner?

103
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,280
This pudding...

104
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,590
 Koyori, you ate my share! 

105
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,910
 You just wanted to eat together with him, right? 

106
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,540
 I know, I know. 

107
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,580
 Listen, Koyori. 

108
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,820
 Tell Hijiri the truth, and apologize to him. All right? 

109
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,280
 Sorry, Hijiri. 

110
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,200
 Let's eat it together. 

111
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,880
 Okay! 

112
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,910
 - It's yummy, right? 
 - Yup! 

113
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,060
 He must have bought it to apologize for the towel. 

114
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,720
 Now that I think about it, there were never dishes here when I got home. 

115
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,360
 Hijiri must have been washing them without complaint. 

116
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,980
 I've been relying on him so much, I took his help for granted. 

117
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,130
Mom? I'll be heading over there today.

118
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,220
Yup. No need to cook dinner for me.

119
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,660
 I was a child who wasn't used to relying on others. 

120
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,550
 Will they allow me to take the day off? 

121
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,570
 It's kind of hard for your dad to apply for leave, too. 

122
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,040
 I'll be fine. 

123
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,950
 You attended the last one. 

124
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,740
 Both my parents worked full-time. 

125
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,190
 I could feel their love for me, but I'd learned to hold back my true feelings. 

126
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,920
 Koyori, your parents aren't coming? 

127
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,840
 Yup, because they have to work. They attended last term anyways. 

128
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,600
 In that case, I'll stand behind you and watch you perform. 

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,020
 What? 

130
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,120
 Hey, wait a minute. 

131
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,580
 I was secretly happy, yet too shy to say "thank you" to him. 

132
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,910
 I haven't managed to get rid of this habit I picked up as a child. 
   

133
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,600
 And now, I've made the same mistake again. 

134
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,640
 Why are you trying to put up a wall between us? 

135
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,660
 Hijiri was always expressing himself with his words and actions. 

136
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,210
 I love you, Koyori. 

137
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,370
 So this time, I should be the one... 

138
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,150
 Today, we've introduced to you the wonderful Momiji Park. 

139
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,170
 - Momiji manju!  
 - They're so funny.

140
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,170
My back is feeling much better now.

141
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,920
Thanks, Hijiri.

142
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,060
Your dad is also back, so I'll be fine now.

143
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,870
- But still, don't push yourself and move too much. 
 - Yes, sir.

144
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,210
And you should lose some weight.

145
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,030
You can't afford to let Dad sprain his back, too.

146
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,100
Hey, that's rude.

147
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,870
It's also for your own health.

148
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,840
Not you too, Dear.

149
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,350
Hijiri, you should get to bed. You have to work early tomorrow morning.

150
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,350
- You're both ganging up on me. 
 - Thanks, Dad. Good night.

151
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,310
Hijiri...

152
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,150
Must be my imagination. It can't be.

153
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,110
I was just about to call you.

154
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,260
Erm...

155
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,960
I wanted to wait for you to come home.

156
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:16,180
But I was worried you wouldn't come home at all, so I came instead.

157
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,680
No...

158
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,580
It's not like I didn't want to go home.

159
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,370
I didn't mean to make you worryãƒ¼

160
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,900
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,250
I feel bad about the way I reacted about the towel.

162
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,290
I always leave the dishes in the sink,

163
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,830
and you would wash them without complaint.

164
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,750
I'm sorry, too.

165
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,510
I forgot to hang the towel, even though you've reminded me about it.

166
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,010
And we only fought because of what I had said.

167
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,090
When I was feeling down about work and took it out on you,

168
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,290
you just accepted all of my frustration.

169
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,600
All this time, even when we were just childhood friends,

170
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,030
you've always cared about me.

171
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,700
Yet I couldn't even properly tell you how I truly felt.

172
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,780
I've always been taking you for granted.

173
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,310
It's okay to take me for granted.

174
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,830
You've...

175
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,600
always been special to me.

176
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,700
You were special as my first crush.

177
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,100
You were special, even when I'd resigned to staying friends.

178
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,440
And you were special, when I realized I loved you after all.

179
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,640
But you became even more special when you became my girlfriend.

180
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,710
So take me for granted, because I want to take care of you.

181
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,720
Koyori?

182
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,990
What are you doing, Koyori?

183
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,610
- I'm going over to you. 
 - It's dangerous. Let me go over.

184
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,870
- Don't wanna. 
 - "Don't wanna"?

185
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,330
This time, I'm going over to you.

186
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,980
Fine then. Grab my hand and don't let go.

187
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay.

188
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,660
â™«  Babe, you're always by my side, and so kind  â™«

189
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,970
â™«  Oops! Another captivating moment  â™«

190
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,200
â™«  If this were a movie, how many times would it be?  â™«

191
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,920
â™«  Oh, this is gonna be my screenplay, I want to see it more  â™«

192
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,320
I'm not letting go.

193
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,580
â™«  It says that you're all over my mind  â™«

194
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,250
I'm gonna be the one spraining my back this time.

195
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,550
- Is your mom feeling better? 
 - Yup. The pain is gone.

196
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,550
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

197
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,330
So I'll be going home tomorrow.

198
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,030
Okay.

199
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,450
â™«  But one thing is for sure  â™«

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,900
Your nose is cold.

201
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,780
â™«  Oh baby, say "I do"  â™«

202
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,420
I'll let you warm it when we get back.

203
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,800
- What was that just now? 
 - Shut up! Can't you see I was trying to rely on you?

204
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,480
Do that again, Koyori.

205
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,900
No way.

206
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,100
6:00 p.m. Good.

207
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,760
- Hoshi, about the proposal... 
 - Talk tomorrow. See you.

208
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,230
- Bye! 
 - Hang on a sec.

209
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,270
What the hell?

210
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,030
- I'm home. 
 - Welcome back.

211
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,450
I'm back.

212
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,620
- Smells nice. 
 - Guess what it is?

213
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,100
What?

214
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,410
That was delicious.

215
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,050
- Thank you for the meal. 
 - Sure.

216
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,290
Hijiri, let's eat the pudding.

217
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,830
Okay.

218
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,120
Yummy.

219
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,210
I knew it. Pudding tastes better when eaten together.

220
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,990
Agreed.

221
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,730
 - It's yummy, right?  
  - Yup! 

222
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,860
Hijiri.

223
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,490
I love you.

224
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,400
Thank you for confessing to me first.

225
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,300
Huh? You're suddenly being so honest that it's scaring me.

226
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,750
I just don't want you to assume I want to break up ever again.

227
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,220
I love you.

228
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,980
- I love you. 
  - If we had remained childhood friends, I would regret it one day. 

229
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,380
 Together, we'll move forward and stay connected, 

230
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,000
 stronger and deeper than before. 

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,480
I love you, Hijiri.

232
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,390
- You don't have to say it anymore. 
 - What?

233
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,490
I didn't know sighs can be happy, too.

234
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,660
You're easy to read. It's fun watching you.

235
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,360
What are you talking about?

236
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Ms. Hoshi!

237
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,610
Hey, watch it.

238
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,610
- Thank you, thank you. 
 - Why are you praying to me?

239
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,260
I succeeded in asking my childhood friend out.

240
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,250
 Enomoto? 

241
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,460
 - Sorry, did you wait long? 
 - No, not at all. 

242
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,270
 A-Aizawa, you feeling hungry? 

243
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,630
 Well... I feel like eating something sweet. 

244
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,950
 Great idea! Let's do that. 

245
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,260
 What should we eat? 

246
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,980
 This can't do. I must be more assertive. 

247
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,440
 Aizawa! 

248
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,620
 Can I call you by your first name again? 

249
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,260
 Huh? 

250
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,940
 I called you by your first name back in elementary school, remember? 

251
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,080
 But our friends teased me about it, so I switched to calling you by your family name. 

252
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,370
 I don't mind whatsoever. 

253
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,340
 But why now? 

254
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,670
 Because I like you, Sachi. 

255
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,920
 Since when? 

256
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,100
 Since... way back? 

257
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,620
 Why do you make it sound like it's a question? 

258
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,930
 'Cause we made a few detours along the way... 

259
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,230
 Are you being serious? 

260
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,420
 Will you go out with me? 

261
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,690
 Take your time with your answer. 

262
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,270
 I hope you can think about it. 

263
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,190
 If we start off as friends, then I'm fine with it. 

264
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,250
 Really? Yes! 

265
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,280
 I did it. That's one step forward. 

266
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,140
 Come on! Let's go in, shall we? 

267
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,790
 Okay! 

268
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,400
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Hoshi.

269
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,230
Is that considered a win?

270
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,430
- I guess it is, seeing that he's so happy? 
 - You're right.

271
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,560
- I'm happy for you. 
 - Congrats.

272
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,760
Thank you!

273
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,690
- Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 - Hey there.

274
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,440
Shall we go?

275
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,450
You're okay with waiting for me?

276
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,970
- Totally. 
 - Is that so?

277
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,920
What about me picking you up?

278
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,680
Do you not like it after all?

279
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,380
On one hand, I'm worried that it'll be too much trouble for you.

280
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,920
I also realized I won't have time alone to think about stuff.

281
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:08,000
But to be honest, I felt lonely going home alone while you were at your parents' place.

282
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,600
I'm selfish, huh?

283
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,640
No, it's normal to feel that way.

284
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,130
I also think about the stuff that frustrated me,

285
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,080
and mentally reset on my walks home.

286
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,600
Koyori.

287
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,980
Make sure you confide in me about these things, too.

288
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,730
In that case,

289
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,710
can I start telling you about my day on our walks home?

290
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,200
Sure thing.

291
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,560



292
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,960
Living together not only means we can spend more time with each other.

293
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,750
It also means two people can share the burden together instead of struggling with it alone.

294
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,090
We live together to make up for each other's shortcomings,

295
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,200
and to support one another.

296
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,380
Well said.

297
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,180
Cool, aren't I?

298
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,330
So, how was your day?

299
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,010
Today, Enomoto told me...
