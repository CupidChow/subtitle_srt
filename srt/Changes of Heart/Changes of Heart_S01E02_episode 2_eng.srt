1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,900



2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,960
   

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,970
She's not coming.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,050
Hijiri, sorry to keep you waiting.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,300
Sorry, I'm late.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,890
Koyori, you're wearing... a skirt?

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,360
I wore skirts for school, remember?

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,810
That was your uniform, this is different.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,830
You look really pretty.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,010
 Why can't I look him in the eye? 

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,880
 Hijiri and I are childhood friends who grew up together. However... 

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,290
 I've turned it off. 

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,160
 - Hijiri? 
 - Don't you remember what happened yesterday? 

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,010
 I did something terrible to you! I'm sorry! 

15
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,300
 I've liked you since way back. 

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,020
   

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,480
 I love you, Koyori. 

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,060
 Will you go out with me? 

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,340
 And so, we've decided to date each other. 

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,390
- Let's not go to a cat cafe. 
 - Why?

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,020
I figured we should go somewhere new for our first date.

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,810
Like where?

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,350
The aquarium, perhaps.

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,510
That's so cliche.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,290
I know, right? That's settled then. Okay?

26
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,980
Okay...

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,990
Fine!

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,010
Good. Let's go then.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,090
Sorry! I was a little startled.

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,350
It's not that I don't like holding your hand.

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,030
It's refreshing to see you blush.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,750
What?

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,710
That makes me all the more certain that I love you.

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,680
Huh?

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,380
Back then, you had a boyfriend.

36
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,030
So you acted completely unfazed, even when I got close.

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:24,480
But now, you're here next to me, your face as red as a tomato.

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,920
I can't help but enjoy this moment.

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,530
So, it's fine.

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,910
Take your time.

41
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,820
We'll have lots of time to spend with each other.

42
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,060
 Hearing him say that makes me all the more aware of him. 

43
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,530
All right, let's go.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,670
 Who knew he'd gotten so mature? 

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,380
 I should take the initiative this time. 

46
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,480
- Say, Koyori... 
 - What?

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,880
- What are you doing? 
 - N-Nothing.

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,270
- Are you hungry? 
 - Yeah. Maybe.

49
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,970
Same here.

50
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,980
What shall we eat?

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,990
Yummy!

52
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,400
The aquarium sure was fun.

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,970
You've got cream on your face.

54
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,050
Yummy.

55
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,280
Which animal was your favorite, Koyori?

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,910
What about you?

57
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,330
Let's say it together. Ready, and...

58
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,660
- The small-clawed otter. 
 - The small-clawed otter.

59
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,890
- The otters, right? 
 - Yeah.

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,620
I almost forgot.

61
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,060
This is for you.

62
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,060
- Sorry, hold this for a moment. 
 - Sure.

63
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,990
I bought these earlier.

64
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,280
A matching pair. We'll each take one.

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,180
Thank you.

66
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,000
You'll take the one with the ribbon.

67
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,260
 I must get used to looking into his eyes, and tell him I love him. 

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,290
By the way...

69
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,750
Did you receive this, too?

70
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,540
   
   

71
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,310
   
   

72
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,550
Koyori, is that you?

73
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,290
Long time no see!

74
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,590
- Have you been well? 
 - Yeah, things are good.

75
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,570
You haven't changed at all.

76
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,000
- Really? 
 - She's right.

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,940
Hoshi, you look exactly the same as you did back in junior high.

78
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,900
I could recognize you in an instant.

79
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,020
You are...

80
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,890
I'm not surprised you've forgotten me.

81
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,660
We were in different classes, after all.

82
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm so sorry.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,090
If I tell you I'm Hijiri's... You'd probably know.

84
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,020
You're Hijiri's...

85
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,270
Our relationship didn't last long because entrance exams were coming up.

86
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,060
Ah, you're Hijiri's...

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,410
 Ex-girlfriend. 

88
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,980
   

89
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,550
   

90
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,090
I remember now. Kaede Saito.

91
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,080
Sorry, I didn't recognize you. You look so different now.

92
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,100
What? But everyone else says I haven't changed a bit.

93
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,120
- Is that so? 
 - Yeah. They all say I look exactly the same.

94
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,730
But you look much prettier now.

95
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,850
Really? Thank you, you're the only one who thinks so.

96
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,980
Say, how is Hijiri? Is he doing well?

97
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,740
Well... Hijiri is...

98
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,770
Or perhaps both of you are no longer as close as before?

99
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,540
- Koyori. 
 - Hey, Hijiri.

100
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,600
They have ham. It's your favorite, right?

101
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,300
- Thanks. 
 - You're eating it all?

102
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,120
- I'm kidding. 
 - Let me know when you're leaving. We'll go home together.

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,050
Yeah, sure.

104
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,590
Hang on. Are the two of you... dating?

105
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,050
What? Which two?

106
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,800
She's talking about Hoshi and Hijiri.

107
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:56,050
That's right. I, Hijiri Akiyama, and Koyori Hoshi, are dating.

108
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,590
Wait, Hijiri...

109
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,790
- What's with the formal tone? 
 - And since when?

110
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,490
- Wait, hang on a second. 
 - I knew it.

111
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,290
I figured Hijiri would eventually end up with Hoshi.

112
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,070
Long time no see, Hijiri.

113
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,010
Saito?

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,060
You haven't changed at all. You still look like how you did in junior high.

115
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,790
 Sorry, Koyori. 

116
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,980
 I can't go home with you today. 

117
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,260
- Koyori? 
 - Huh? What?

118
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,230
You're spacing out. Feeling okay?

119
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,100
I'm fine.

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,540
Really?

121
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,680
It's nothing.

122
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,680
- Ako, shall we move to the next table? 
 - Yeah, let's.

123
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,040
It's all so nostalgic.

124
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,140
But, Hijiri, will you be okay?

125
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,650
- You're away from your girlfriend and sitting beside your ex. 
 - He's right.

126
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,520
Saito has become a real beauty.

127
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,430
Maybe this will rekindle that spark, eh?

128
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,860
Some couples get back together after meeting again at reunions.

129
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,140
- Trust me, it's possible. 
 - Guys...

130
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,610
That won't happen.

131
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,400
- No? 
 - Enough about me. What about you?

132
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,670
I just got married recently.

133
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,450
Wanna see some photos?

134
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,930
You two look wonderful here.

135
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,200
- I know, right? 
 - Where did you meet her?

136
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,060
- She's my senior at work. 
 - You were coworkers?

137
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,400
Nice.

138
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,620
- She's older than you? 
- Yeah, older.

139
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,450
 That was close! I hope she didn't catch me watching them. 

140
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,640
 It was ages ago when they dated each other. 

141
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,850
 There'll be no end to it if I keep dwelling on the past. 

142
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,270
 It'll be fine. 

143
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,020
 Everything will be okay. 

144
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,390
 Don't worー 

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,830
 They're gone! 

146
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,990
 Huh? Why? 

147
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,990
 Calm down, Koyori! 

148
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,390
Koyori, you're quite the drinker.

149
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,730
Want more?

150
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,240
Saito, what are you doing here?

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,210
I think I'm a little drunk.

152
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,970
In that case, maybe a little fresh air outside will do you good.

153
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:54,190
But I'm scared of going out there alone, so if you'll accompany me...

154
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,790
Does Hoshi... really love you?

155
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,140
What?

156
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,160
She seemed unfazed when I was sitting beside you.

157
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,840
She even averted her gaze when you were concerned.

158
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,760
That doesn't look like love to me.

159
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,150
- Maybe I should stick closer to you. 
 - Huh?

160
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,500
If we can get Hoshi to feel jealous, it'll prove that she loves you.

161
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,830
What are we trying to achieve by doing that?

162
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,680
You'll be able to know how much she loves you, no?

163
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,770
I'll know how much she loves me, and then what?

164
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,960
Won't you feel assured then?

165
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,330
Testing someone's love just to make oneself feel assured...

166
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,390
The one who's testing this love is precisely the one who lacks it.

167
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,190
I'll be fine. No need to worry about me.

168
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,740
Akiyama, come over here.

169
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,340
- Koyori? 
 - She suddenly got too carried away with drinking.

170
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,060
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

171
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,280
Koyori, you don't really drink outside. What's wrong?

172
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,710
- I got too excited, so... 
 - Liar.

173
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,850
I'm not lying. I had a blast, really.

174
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,060
You never drink until you're tipsy, even when you're having fun.

175
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,200
- Did anythingー 
 - Hijiri!

176
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,490
Let's go for another round. Just us guys.

177
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,120
- Nah, I'm good. 
 - Aw, don't be such a killjoy.

178
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,380
- What? You're putting your girl over our friendship now? 
 - Stop teasing.

179
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,620
- Join them. You guys don't meet often. 
 - Huh?

180
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,610
I'm feeling better already.

181
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,710
- I'll get going. Bye. 
 - See you.

182
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,650
Where shall we go?

183
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,010
Koyori.

184
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,060
- Let's go. 
 - One more round of drinks!

185
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,490
Hey.

186
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,900
Sorry for suddenly dropping by.

187
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,330
I'll make myself at home.

188
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,900
I'm enjoying the green curry that I cooked.

189
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,640
Green curry, again?

190
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,960
How was the class reunion?

191
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,640
Was your first love there as well?

192
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,580
He was, but he was sticking to his childhood buddy. So boring.

193
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,060
Say what?

194
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,600
Is dating your childhood friend the rave nowadays?

195
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
Why ask such a question?

196
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,560
Well...

197
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,530
 I hope we can start over. 

198
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,350
 Request denied. 

199
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,950
My ex has also started going out with her childhood friend.

200
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,940
Speaking of, what kind of girl is your ex?

201
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,820
I want to see what she looks like.

202
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,890
Let me see.

203
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,670
Give it back.

204
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,120
Say, Sosuke...

205
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,020
Do you want to get back together with your ex?

206
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,450
- Delicious, right? 
 - Yeah.

207
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,870
Want to try some of mine?

208
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,460
Koyori?

209
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,150
What's on your mind?

210
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,040
Oh, nothing in particular.

211
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,730
   

212
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,030
 What should I do? 

213
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,320
 I hope we can start over. 

214
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,050
 I don't want Hijiri to worry too much about this. 

215
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,400
You're not answering it?

216
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,760
It was just spam. I've been getting lots of those recently.

217
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,860
Is that so?

218
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,520
- After this... 
 - Yeah?

219
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,430
- How about coming over to my place? 
 - Huh?

220
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,620
Thanks for having me.

221
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,690
- Tea? 
 - Sure.

222
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,860
- Just make yourself at home. 
 - Okay.

223
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,850
Koyori.

224
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,870
Sorry, you startled me.

225
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,680
I've been feeling uneasy.

226
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,690
You were lost in thought all day today.

227
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,670
 Koyori? 

228
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,550
If there's something bugging you, tell me.

229
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,750
Where did you and Saito go during the class gathering?

230
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,180
It looked like both of you had left your seats,

231
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,490
so I was just wondering.

232
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,240
- I wasー 
 - Not that I don't trust you.

233
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,010
It's just that seeing you two together reminded me of your relationship.

234
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,820
 Sorry, Koyori. 

235
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,380
 - I can't go home with you today.  
  - Huh? 

236
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,820
 See ya. 

237
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:29,800
So I drank to distract myself from overthinking things, and ended up having a drop too much.

238
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:36,660
Sorry. I never meant for you to see my unpleasant feelings.

239
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,800
It's perfectly fine to show them to me.

240
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:53,910
I don't want you to end up hating me for not realizing you were bottling things up.

241
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,770
There's nothing between me and Saito.

242
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,000
Got it.

243
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,850
Sorry. I lied to you earlier.

244
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,170
What?

245
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,250
That call was from Yoshida.

246
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,190
He wants to get back together with you?

247
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,830
I highly doubt that's why he called.

248
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,310
Koyori, thank you for telling me.

249
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,020
Hijiri...

250
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,540
Will you be okay?

251
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,970
It must be uncomfortable for you, since you're coworkers.

252
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,970
Totally not. Don't worry, I'm not bothered at all.

253
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,060
Really?

254
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,060
- It's thanks to you, Hijiri. 
 - What?

255
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,130
I was really depressed when I was dumped.

256
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,750
But in a night, you became the only person on my mind.

257
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,460
And all the unhappiness that I felt before had vanished.

258
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,650
Let me say this now. I love you, Hijiri.

259
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,020
And it's because I love you...

260
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,640
That I've become too aware of my feelings for you.

261
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,160
I'm sorry that I struggle to be honest.

262
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,600
I know.

263
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,690
I know why you avert your gaze.

264
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,170
No matter what others say, I alone will know.

265
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,930
And that's enough for me.

266
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,360
Hijiri...

267
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,010
Can you repeat what you just said?

268
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,450
I love you, Hijiri.

269
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,900
Okay, I looked into your eyes and said it.

270
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,980
- Ten more seconds. 
 - What?

271
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,840
- That wasn't long enough. 
 - Wait, the water is boiling.

272
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,700
- I'd better switch it off quickly. 
 - It's going to catch fire.

273
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,240
- The sky is already dark. 
 - Right? That was quick.

274
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,460
 I can do it this time. 

275
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,390
 Here goes! 

276
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,840
What are you doing?

277
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,800
Jeez...

278
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,700
- You noticed? 
 - I did.

279
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,770
We're here.

280
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,560
Thanks for inviting me over today.

281
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,230
- You could have stayed the night. 
 - Huh?

282
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,930
Just kidding.

283
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,460
Oh, you caught me off guard.

284
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,310
We'll go at your pace. Okay?

285
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,830
Okay.

286
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,270
- For you. 
 - What?

287
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,200
The key to my house. Just come over whenever you feel like it.

288
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,450
- Not whenever I feel like it. 
 - Huh?

289
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,790
Sometimes we need our alone time after a long day of work.

290
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,840
I'll make sure to let you know if I want to come over.

291
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,650
Don't worry about saying no to me.

292
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,980
Got it.

293
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,920
But if I want to go over no matter what, I'll tell you so. All right?

294
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,290
Sure.

295
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,030
♫  A casual moment makes me wonder  ♫

296
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,700
♫  A casual moment makes me wonder  ♫

297
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,330
♫  But one thing is for sure  ♫

298
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,250
♫  Do you wanna be my lady?  ♫

299
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,620
 I really am Hijiri's girlfriend now. 

300
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,020
♫  Baby, say "I do"  ♫

301
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,500
Stop glaring at me, Koyori.

302
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,940
Don't call me by my first name.

303
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,400
And contact me via our team's group chat. Now, if you'll excuse me.

304
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,210
The sales rep from Tint Games wants to meet with you.

305
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,200
You mean the company that develops romance games?

306
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,800
We might be in charge of developing an app for Tint,

307
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,850
and their sales rep is apparently a fan of the games you plan.

308
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,290
They wanted to meet you over dinner.

309
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,880
You should have told me earlier that this was about work.

310
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,300
I got it.

311
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,160
Keep your schedule free for this Friday.

312
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,840
Sure thing.

313
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,370
That went well.

314
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:32,700



315
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,710
Good evening. Did you make a reservation?

316
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,270
Yes, under the name "Yoshida".

317
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,620
Welcome, Mr. Yoshida. This way, please.

318
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,420
Koyori?

319
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,600
What?

320
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,730
Koyori, what are you waiting for? Hurry up andー

321
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,090
Hijiri, sorry to keep you waiting.

322
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,010
Saito?

323
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,780
Hoshi?

324
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,990
 What the heck is going on?
