1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,970
Your pre-test result is out.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,680
It calculates the likelihood that you will be accepted into your preferred faculty.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,510
You need to work harder.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,560
Don’t lose hope yet.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,180
But we’re having the school festival today.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,180
I’ll be there just to look around.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,190
By yourself?

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,290
Atom.

9
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,420
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,420
I’m at ease now.

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:29,960
Even though he can’t make it, I know now that someone is right by his side, supporting him.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,710
Is there anything you haven’t done today?

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,300
There’s one thing, actually.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,750
(Mudmee told me this shrine is very sacred.)

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,250
(Her mom often comes here to make a wish whenever something important is coming up.)

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,710
They say that if we hang it like this, the god will hear our wishes.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,510
(Please let me pass the university entrance exam. – Atom)

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,260
Hey.

19
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,330
What?

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,530
Where are you going?

21
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,750
Gosh. Don’t you move.

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,180
Atom, watch out!

23
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,000
The fish is dead.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,940
Kongthap.

25
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,160
Fish!

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,160
Are you okay, fish?

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,080
It’s dead.

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,170
It’s alright.

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,150
I’ll buy you a new one.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,950
Don’t.

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,680
It’s probably a message from the god telling me to give up.

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,640
It’s not.

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,820
If the god wants you to give up, this wish wouldn’t be hanging safe and sound here.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,160
(Please allow Kongthap and Atom to study at the same university.)

35
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,350
Gosh, you.

36
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,010
Aren’t you embarrassed telling the god so much?

37
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,590
I was going to tell you after the exam,

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,560
but since we're talking about it, I'll just tell you now.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,160
Tell me what?

40
00:03:47,742 --> 00:04:01,990
UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAM DAY

41
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,990
(...ongthap)

42
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,210
Since we're talking about it, I'll just tell you now.

43
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,410
I looked into some dormitories around the university.

44
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,450
I found a nice room suited for two people.

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,840
Why are you telling me?

46
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,710
Once we get accepted, will you share it with me?

47
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,970
(...ongthap)

48
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
The exam is finally over.

49
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,530
No more books.

50
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,100
No more headaches.

51
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,100
Thanks a lot, Mudmee.

52
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,990
The exam included a lot of what you taught me.

53
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,520
Yeah?

54
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,800
Kongthap, how did you do?

55
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,130
It was okay.

56
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,510
The exam covered plenty of what I'd read.

57
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,470
Hey.

58
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,000
Why does everyone seem so confident?

59
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,480
Why?

60
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,940
Are you not confident?

61
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,560
Not really.

62
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,990
Guys, my dad’s here.

63
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,320
Half, he asked if you wanted to join us for a meal.

64
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,960
Coming?

65
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,960
I am.

66
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,890
We’re taking off now.

67
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,990
Don’t panic.

68
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,310
I think studying at different universities isn’t that bad.

69
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
You guys can experience a long-distance relationship like us.

70
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,060
Let’s go.

71
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,320
Come on.

72
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,960
Kongthap, I want to be like that.

73
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,280
Like what?

74
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,080
Do you want to have a long-distance relationship?

75
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,020
No.

76
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:35,930
I mean, I want our families to know about us too.

77
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,440
Ah.

78
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,830
Why don’t you tell your mom then?

79
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,000
It’s not that easy.

80
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,790
My mom isn’t as nice as yours.

81
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,460
Then why don’t we start with my mom?

82
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,590
Have dinner with us this Saturday.

83
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,110
She keeps asking you to come.

84
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,050
Really?

85
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,850
Let’s wait here for a bit.

86
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,950
He should be here any minute.

87
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,720
Shit.

88
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,390
I’m sorry. I don’t think I can go with you.

89
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,040
What?

90
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,320
Why?

91
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,920
I already have plans.

92
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,240
Plans with who?

93
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,280
Ah! My family.

94
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,770
Yeah?

95
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,470
That’s right.

96
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,700
I should go now.

97
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,170
Please tell your dad I’m sorry.

98
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,350
Yeah, that’s fine.

99
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,650
Plans with his family?

100
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,980
When?

101
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,540
That’s suspicious. It’s his secret lover for sure.

102
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,540
No. It can’t be.

103
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,850
He might have actually made plans with his family.

104
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,990
- Sure!
- Sure!

105
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,280
I don’t know. I trust him.

106
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,970
I don’t think he’s that kind of guy.

107
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,150
Is that Half?

108
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,000
Who is she?

109
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,280
Do you know her?

110
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,150
I don’t.

111
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,860
She’s probably asking him for directions.

112
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,480
What?

113
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,330
She can be a traveler, right?

114
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,420
Are they holding hands?

115
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,500
Really?

116
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,430
Look.

117
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,910
Something is going on.

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,970
Well?

119
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,970
Do you still trust him?

120
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,360
What?

121
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,980
Hey.

122
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,960
Where did she go?

123
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,360
Half.

124
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,570
Get out of the car and talk to me.

125
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,710
Jeez, Mudmee.

126
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,680
So you had plans with her?

127
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,560
(GMD Driving School)

128
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,820
Then this lady must be…

129
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,410
This is Kae, my driving instructor.

130
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,050
Hello, Kae.

131
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,260
What a nice car.

132
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,280
You guys should talk. I’ll wait in the car.

133
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,560
I’m sorry.

134
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,970
I was hoping it would be a surprise.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,640
Hm?

136
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,980
Surprise for me?

137
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,100
Yes.

138
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,800
So I can drive to see you often when we go to different universities.

139
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,980
I planned to tell you after I got my license.

140
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,960
I’m sorry.

141
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,810
If you want my forgiveness,

142
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,270
after I have my license, you have to let me take you for a ride.

143
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,210
Of course.

144
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,060
I’ll clear my schedule just for you.

145
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,940
You said it.

146
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,020
Promise?

147
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,330
Promise.

148
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,760
Ma’am.

149
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,280
Kongthap and I…

150
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,770
are boyfriends.

151
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,780
Even Mommam doesn’t give a rat's ass about me.

152
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,790
Your mom isn’t going to like me for sure.

153
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,320
Mommam dislikes everyone.

154
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,430
Not true.

155
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
He’s so clingy to you.

156
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,590
Not to me.

157
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,690
He just likes this.

158
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,970
If you don’t believe me, feed him.

159
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,640
See?

160
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,990
He likes you now.

161
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,700
What about your mom?

162
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,460
Will she like me?

163
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,020
She will.

164
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,780
Stay calm.

165
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,440
Drink this first.

166
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,900
I like you.

167
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,250
Of course, my mom likes you too.

168
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,600
Trust me.

169
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,800
Kids, the food is ready.

170
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,760
Gosh.

171
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,000
What the--

172
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,120
Calm down.

173
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,250
Stay there.

174
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,560
I’ll get you a new shirt.

175
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,210
Hold on.

176
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,500
I want to go home.

177
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,520
I want to go home. I wanna go home.

178
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,950
I can’t do this.

179
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,790
Make yourself comfortable.

180
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,050
That sweatshirt looks familiar.

181
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,210
Is it Kongthap’s?

182
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,450
Atom spilled the drink on his. I lent him mine.

183
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,880
I embroidered it myself.

184
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,280
It looks better on you than on Kongthap though.

185
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,390
Ma’am…

186
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,450
Oh, right, Atom.

187
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,070
I’d like to know if Kongthap is dating someone.

188
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:27,980
Ah.

189
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,410
Here’s the thing.

190
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,790
I’ve been observing.

191
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,790
He talks to someone on the phone at night, making a cute sound.

192
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,790
He refuses to say who when I ask.

193
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,710
I guess he discusses homework, ma’am.

194
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,170
I don’t think so.

195
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,360
He always dresses as if he's going on a date.

196
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,010
He wears so much perfume that it lingers around the room.

197
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,610
Mom, stop it.

198
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,010
I don’t mind if Thap is dating. I’m just worried.

199
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,150
I raised him myself. I know how he is.

200
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,660
Thap always overthinks.

201
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,320
He doesn’t know how to say no to people.

202
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,630
I’m afraid he will get tricked.

203
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,200
I won’t… I mean he won’t get tricked.

204
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,960
Does that mean you know who he’s talking to?

205
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,430
I don’t.

206
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,300
I don’t know at all.

207
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
Uh…

208
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,620
But let’s say that Kongthap is dating someone.

209
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,210
What do you expect that person to be?

210
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,470
If I could choose, I’d expect a competent and smart person.

211
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,560
Just like Thap.

212
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,360
That would ease my worry.

213
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,810
They will share the same brain and take care of each other.

214
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,890
Have some chicken.

215
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,790
Sure.

216
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,310
Atom.

217
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,750
Don’t think too much about what my mom said.

218
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,960
Kongthap.

219
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,300
I cannot not think about it.

220
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,990
Competent, smart, and with leadership skills.

221
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,440
Doesn’t sound like me at all.

222
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,960
But my mom likes you.

223
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,280
As her son’s friend, yes.

224
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,600
Not as her son’s boyfriend.

225
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,110
Atom.

226
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,620
I should get going.

227
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,490
I will wash this shirt and return it later.

228
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,720
Atom, doing laundry?

229
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,300
Why didn’t you ask me to do it?

230
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,990
Ah, it’s okay, Mom.

231
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,400
For this one, I wanna do it myself.

232
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,980
Holy shit, Mom.

233
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,390
Mom, it’s ruined.

234
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,970
Let me see.

235
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,990
It’s an embroidered sweatshirt. It should be hand-washed.

236
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,990
But you put it in the washing machine. Of course, it’s ruined.

237
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,640
I didn’t know that, Mom.

238
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,360
Kongthap lent it to me.

239
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,450
Which brand is it?

240
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,950
I’ll buy him a new one in return.

241
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,260
No, Mom.

242
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,920
Kongthap’s mom embroidered it herself.

243
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,640
It can’t be bought anywhere.

244
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,190
Then you go apologize to her. Say that you didn’t mean to.

245
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,730
I can’t, Mom.

246
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,980
I am already a loser in her opinion.

247
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,760
If she knows this, she’s going to forbid me from associating with Kongthap.

248
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,780
Atom.

249
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,450
Here.

250
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,300
No, Mom.

251
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,500
Can you return it to Kongthap’s mom for me?

252
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,680
Please.

253
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,840
Please, Mom.

254
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,740
Return it to Kongthap’s mom for me.

255
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,990
Please.

256
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,590
Pretty please.

257
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,700
Atom, stop.

258
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,610
And stop being so whiny.

259
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,190
Losers are those who lack the courage to correct their mistakes.

260
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:47,790
To me, I’m willing to give a second chance to someone who takes responsibility for their actions no matter how big the mistake is.

261
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,490
Here.

262
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,280
GRADUATION DAY

263
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,200
Atom, smile.

264
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,990
Smile, son.

265
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,240
Here we go.

266
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,250
One, two.

267
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,790
One more.

268
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,980
That’s Kongthap.

269
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,980
Ask them to take photos with us.

270
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,200
Hi, ma’am.

271
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,560
Hello.

272
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,170
You must be Kongthap’s mother.

273
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,580
I’m Atom’s mom.

274
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,280
We finally meet.

275
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,970
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

276
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,280
I really appreciated your son helping mine with his study.

277
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,860
I should be thanking you.

278
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,340
If he wasn’t tutoring Atom, he barely picked up his books.

279
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,530
Right, son?

280
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,430
Yes.

281
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,950
Would you like some photos together, ma’am?

282
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,660
Let’s snap some photos together.

283
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,390
Come on.

284
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,280
Look at the camera.

285
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,640
One, two.

286
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,580
One more, please.

287
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,980
One, two.

288
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,640
Would you like to check?

289
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,210
Very nice.

290
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,110
Atom.

291
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,620
His mom seems nice.

292
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,220
Ma’am…

293
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,450
Mudmee, you’re getting into medical school, right?

294
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,880
That’s right, ma’am.

295
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,250
Wow, you’re so smart.

296
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,460
In the future, I won't have to go to the hospital when I'm sick.

297
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,920
I’m flattered. Thank you, ma’am.

298
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,990
Mom, it’s almost 4 p.m.

299
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,680
Oh. Really?

300
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,990
Okay.

301
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,490
We are meeting Kongthap’s aunt.

302
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,490
She closes her shop just to celebrate her nephew’s graduation.

303
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,810
Please excuse us.

304
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,490
- Of course.
- Goodbye.

305
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,970
- See you.
- See you, Atom.

306
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,380
Goodbye, ma’am.

307
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,630
I’ll see you later.

308
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,410
See you, Kongthap.

309
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,890
Atom, my dad’s here.

310
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,700
I need to go. See you later.

311
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,090
Goodbye, ma’am.

312
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,980
Goodbye, dear.

313
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,150
Atom, don’t leave it unfinished.

314
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,520
Here.

315
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,470
I’ll be right back, Mom.

316
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:42,970
Ma’am.

317
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,670
Jeez!

318
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,970
Atom, what is it?

319
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,180
I almost hit you.

320
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
I’m returning the shirt, ma’am.

321
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,000
You could’ve done it later.

322
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,000
Cutting me off like that is dangerous, you know?

323
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,970
I didn’t know I shouldn’t. I threw it in my laundry machine.

324
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,600
So it’s…

325
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,720
I tried to fix it, but this is the best I could do.

326
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,040
I’m sorry.

327
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,290
I know…

328
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,350
that I’m not smart enough

329
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,590
or good enough.

330
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:43,310
But I promise that one day I’ll be smarter.

331
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:51,710
I’ll become a leader like you expect me to be.

332
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,990
When the day comes,

333
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,700
will you please allow me to take care of Kongthap?

334
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:31,980
Atom, didn’t I tell you that I wanted someone competent, smart, and with leadership skills to take care of my son?

335
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,360
I have only one child. I worry about him.

336
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,620
I want him to get the best thing.

337
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,730
Mom.

338
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:01,280
I’m sorry, ma’am, that I’m not that.

339
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,550
But I’ll try my best.

340
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,980
Please don’t make us stop seeing each other.

341
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,810
At first, I did think you two weren’t a good match.

342
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,390
But Thap told me that

343
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:14,740
you helped your friend with the stage play.

344
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,580
You cared for him at the camp after he was bitten by a snake.

345
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:38,980
More importantly, you are a leader to Thap.

346
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:51,790
Thap has changed so much and done so many new things because of you.

347
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,130
I’ve always noticed.

348
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:22,800
In my opinion, you are a very competent person.

349
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,940
From now on, please take care of Thap for me.

350
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,380
Yes, ma’am.

351
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,400
I will try my very best.

352
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,680
I promise.

353
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,370
Thank you, Mom.

354
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,120
 I think nothing is impossible 

355
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,750
 Love may take you by surprise 

356
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:58,000
 Someone might stand before you, confess to you 

357
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,500
 Like a dream come true 

358
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:07,350
 One day you might find your perfect match 

359
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,160
 The one to warm your soul 

360
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:20,930
 I tell myself each passing day 

361
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,200
 My chance will soon unfold 

362
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,880
Please get in.

363
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,500
Allow me to be the host and take a half-Japanese girl traveling around the city today.

364
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,720
Of course.

365
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,970
Onegaishimasu.

366
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,040
Should we go?

367
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,570
Yes.

368
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,960
What?

369
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,970
Ah, I shifted to the wrong gear.

370
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,010
You scared me.

371
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,890
I’m sorry.

372
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,440
There. Our engine is starting.

373
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,340
You got it, right?

374
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:40,470
Before we go, I must check the side mirror and the rearview mirror.

375
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,990
I must be focused.

376
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,170
Always look out for pedestrians crossing the road.

377
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,230
Lastly, don’t forget to be kind to other drivers.

378
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,540
Be careful.

379
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,590
I used up all of my energy going up there.

380
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,980
Not yet.

381
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,370
We are ending this one-day trip with a sunset at the dam.

382
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,820
At the dam?

383
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,160
That sounds so romantic.

384
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,080
Should we go now?

385
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,750
Let’s go.

386
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,280
Yes, we should.

387
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,290
It won’t start.

388
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,380
Did you forget to shift the gear again?

389
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,990
This is the right gear.

390
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,180
Let me try again.

391
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,820
Well?

392
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,300
It still won’t start?

393
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,780
It won’t.

394
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,930
How is it?

395
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,670
Something must’ve been broken.

396
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:30,800
Yeah?

397
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,990
Why today?

398
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,880
Half, it’s alright.

399
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,100
I did have so much fun today.

400
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,710
I’m serious.

401
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:48,720
But I promised to take you to see the sunset.

402
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,290
It’s not like you intended to break the promise.

403
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,740
It’s totally fine.

404
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,290
Let’s just call a garage and go home together.

405
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,260
Please.

406
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,870
Let’s go home.

407
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,690
My phone’s in the car.

408
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,240
Half, what are you doing?

409
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,340
Taking you to see the sunset.

410
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,390
By pushing it? It’ll be too late by the time we get there.

411
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,670
Let’s go home.

412
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,280
Please.

413
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,800
Trust me.

414
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,350
Trust me.

415
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,770
This is our last trip before we part.

416
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,240
I want it to be a good memory.

417
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,980
A good memory…

418
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,700
should be created together.

419
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,980
Like this.

420
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,660
See?

421
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,180
The Hulk just came to rescue you.

422
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,470
Mudmee, keep going.

423
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,060
We’re here.

424
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,260
We’re here, Mudmee.

425
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,990
Go on, Mudmee.

426
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,170
The last push.

427
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,600
Wow.

428
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,990
This is truly romantic.

429
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,070
I’m sorry.

430
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,220
Hm?

431
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,970
It would've been better if we didn’t have to push the car here.

432
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,740
Without the car, it wouldn't have been called a sunset ride.

433
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,350
Right?

434
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
There you are smiling.

435
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,230
Thanks.

436
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,440
You’re welcome.

437
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
You’re the coolest today, Half.

438
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,200
You’re cool too, Mudmee.

439
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,020
Thanks.

440
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,790
Here’s your drink, kids.

441
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma’am.

442
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,080
Make yourselves at home.

443
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,390
- Yes, ma’am.
- Yes, ma’am.

444
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

445
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

446
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,100
Why are we checking the results at my house?

447
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,330
I invited them here.

448
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,600
I knew you’d be nervous so I asked them to come and support you.

449
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,500
Even more nervous now.

450
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,220
If I am the only one who doesn’t get accepted,

451
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,830
what do we do?

452
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,480
Guys, the results are out.

453
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,770
Should we see them now?

454
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,620
Yeah.

455
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,960
Yes! I got accepted into medical school.

456
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,960
- Congrats.
- I’m so happy.

457
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,670
Yes.

458
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,670
I got accepted into Veterinary Medicine too.

459
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,380
- Congratulations.
- Yay!

460
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,100
It’s just us left.

461
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,040
That’s right.

462
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,320
You see yours first.

463
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,770
You check yours first.

464
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,530
No. Please check yours first.

465
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,820
No. You check yours first.

466
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,990
- You first.
- You first.

467
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,270
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

468
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,690
- You first.
- You first.

469
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,460
Mom sent me a message.

470
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,240
I passed.

471
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,980
Yes.

472
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,000
Congratulations.

473
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,190
Congrats.

474
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,240
It’s just me then.

475
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,240
Jeez. Please don’t look at me like that.

476
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,960
I’m too afraid to tap it.

477
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,540
Gosh!

478
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
I’m too afraid to check it.

479
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,300
I don’t wanna be the only one left behind.

480
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,000
It’s okay.

481
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,740
Even if you failed, we would never leave you behind.

482
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,070
Trust me.

483
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,290
I got accepted!

484
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,940
Yes!

485
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,160
We did it!

486
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,990
We did it!

487
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,920
We did it!

488
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,680
We did it!

489
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,890
Let me open the gate for you.

490
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,160
We’re off now.

491
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,260
Bye-bye, Kongthap.

492
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:14,870
Bye.

493
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,000
See you when we get the graduation certificate.

494
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,990
Get home safe.

495
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,850
See you, Atom.

496
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,370
Bye-bye.

497
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,320
Bye.

498
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,570
It all ended well.

499
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,290
There’s still something left unsolved.

500
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,640
About your mom?

501
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:41,510
I want to tell her before I go to Bangkok.

502
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,830
Hey.

503
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,100
Leaving already?

504
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,720
Mom, there’s something important I want to tell you.

505
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,350
I…

506
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,350
I should send Kongthap home.

507
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,680
Come on.

508
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,800
I’ll go prepare dinner then.

509
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,430
Excuse me, ma’am.

510
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:55,370
Atom would like to tell you something before he leaves for Bangkok.

511
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,000
What is it, Atom?

512
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,410
Well…

513
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,240
Kongthap and I are dating.

514
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,120
You’re not mad at me, are you?

515
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,520
Thanks, Atom.

516
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,220
I thought you would never tell me.

517
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,730
Atom.

518
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,750
I am afraid.

519
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,950
I don't want to be the last person in the world you feel safe sharing something with.

520
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:28,540
I want to be the mom you can tell anything to, like always.

521
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:33,940
I was afraid

522
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,760
that you would be upset with me.

523
00:45:49,323 --> 00:45:51,323
I was afraid you wouldn’t be okay with who I am.

524
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,930
Please don’t be mad.

525
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,080
Atom.

526
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,750
I’m okay.

527
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,550
I’m okay with anything you choose.

528
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,240
Your happiness is my happiness.

529
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,190
Thanks, Atom, for letting me know that you’re happy.

530
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,140
Congratulations.

531
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,310
Your high school life has officially been completed.

532
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:19,240
Thank you so much for always helping me, sir.

533
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,770
There’s one more envelope for you.

534
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Gosh!

535
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,580
You and Sin are getting married?

536
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,240
Mm.

537
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,090
Congratulations.

538
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,660
Tell Kongthap he’s invited too.

539
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,240
The wedding theme is green.

540
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,480
Sin chose it.

541
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,180
Guys, take care of our club.

542
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,470
Don’t cry.

543
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,470
We’ll visit as often as possible.

544
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,680
Khao-pan.

545
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,560
Dude!

546
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:17,410
They’re not crying. You are.

547
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:19,710
Yeah?

548
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,730
Hey! How dare you date before me?

549
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,640
I’m sorry, sir.

550
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,640
Not just me though.

551
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,580
Khao-pan is dating too.

552
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,000
Hey.

553
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,770
You too?

554
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:39,410
Seriously?

555
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,960
You and Clair are dating?

556
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,400
I told you I’d leave the market before you.

557
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,180
I wish you two a long and loving relationship.

558
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,680
I’m telling you…

559
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,190
Did you bring the token with you?

560
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,190
Start with me, then.

561
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,890
It’s our stage play ticket.

562
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,768
Destirella.

563
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:02,480
Wait.

564
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,564
Should I bury the Beauty and the Beast ticket instead?

565
00:49:05,822 --> 00:49:07,475
Just pick one.

566
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:11,253
Whatever you put in, I’ll put in the other one.

567
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,240
Aw!

568
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,071
As for me…

569
00:49:16,106 --> 00:49:17,413
Just put it in.

570
00:49:17,448 --> 00:49:18,346
Pass it around.

571
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,982
You brought your eraser too, Atom?

572
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:26,960
Mm.

573
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,768
What did you bring?

574
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,680
Half and I agreed to bury our exam cards.

575
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:37,991
If we hadn’t forgotten the exam cards then,

576
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:40,053
it wouldn’t have been us now.

577
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,217
Kongthap.

578
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:48,951
What did you bring?

579
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:55,297
I brought this.

580
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,617
Come on.

581
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,964
I threw it away.

582
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,306
Did you pick it up?

583
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,004
Of course, I did.

584
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,973
This is your first sketch of me.

585
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:19,386
Aren’t you guys going to miss it?

586
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,395
We will not see it again for 10 years.

587
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:34,382
Atom, if you feel like it’s a shame, you can bury this instead.

588
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:43,804
This eraser might be mine, but it’s the beginning of you and Kongthap.

589
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,337
Take it.

590
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,320
I brought it just for you.

591
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,560
What are you doing?

592
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,773
Ah, nothing.

593
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,991
I just came to take a look at our classroom.

594
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,484
I remember that one student resigned in Grade 10.

595
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:32,204
So the teacher moved me to sit next to Half.

596
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,417
In Grade 10, I sat here.

597
00:51:49,955 --> 00:51:51,950
In Grade 11,

598
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:56,097
do you remember?

599
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,950
I sat right here.

600
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,684
Then I got moved again.

601
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:15,502
In Grade 12,

602
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,653
we’re back together again.

603
00:53:01,884 --> 00:53:05,795
(For generations, humans have sought out

604
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:10,373
tricks to make their longing for love a reality.)

605
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,613
(One of the most favored and easiest tricks

606
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,751
is to write down your crush's name…)
Grade 12 Class 3 Batch 28
Close: April 3, 2025
Open: April 3, 2035

607
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:33,750
(On an eraser.)

608
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,977
(Then, with the power of the eraser,

609
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,991
you and that person…

610
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,097
will fall in love forever.)

611
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,031
(Thank you, Eraser.)
