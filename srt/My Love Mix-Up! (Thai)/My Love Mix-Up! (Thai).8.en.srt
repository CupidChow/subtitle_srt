1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
You guys aren’t just friends, are you?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,780
I was the one that asked him out.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,140
But we broke up now.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,380
I have friends.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,730
Why can’t I tell them?

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,110
Atom, are you embarrassed to be with me?

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,240
Let’s end it here.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,530
Every time you’re not around, I feel like something is missing.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,000
Atom.

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,320
I like you.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,390
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,420
You have completed the course Erase to Get Love.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,620
I have nothing further to teach you.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,680
You have far surpassed a master like me, my disciple.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,940
Thank you so much, Master.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,660
I had no idea I’d come this far either.

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,780
I still remember the day you sought advice from me here.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Thank you, Mudmee.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,500
Without you, what I imagined would not have come true.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,950
What you imagined?

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,330
Like what?

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,750
Well, like,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,302
I used to think it’d be nice to ride home with someone I dated.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That, you have done.

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,090
I would spend time with my special one on Valentine’s Day.

26
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,850
That, you’ve done too.

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,470
There’s one more thing left.

28
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,430
What is it?

29
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,460
Well…

30
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,690
It’s…

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,830
What?

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,160
I should go home.

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:06,810
Hey.

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,990
What just happened?

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,360
I just…

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,270
I just want to go home.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,270
But why are you turning red?

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,270
And why don’t you wait for me?

39
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,140
Just like that, he left.

40
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,840
Hey.

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,720
Don’t slack off.

42
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,380
Help me paint.

43
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,020
I’m not slacking off.

44
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,020
I’m ordering food.

45
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,460
Yeah?

46
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,610
That’s good.

47
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,140
I am tired. I need delicious food to fill my stomach.

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,750
What do you want to eat?

49
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,490
Just…

50
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,940
anything.

51
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,440
How about burgers?

52
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,430
I’m sick of burgers.

53
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,320
Somtum with grilled chicken?

54
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,670
Too spicy.

55
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,580
How about some noodles?

56
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,170
We can just have that in our cafeteria.

57
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,290
What do you want to eat then?

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,700
Anything.

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,320
Here you go.

60
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,500
We got everything.

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,450
Thank you.

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,110
You said you were sick of burgers.

63
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,170
Yeah?

64
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,410
I said that?

65
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,349
I can’t remember. I’m just gonna eat.

66
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,050
Starving.

67
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,610
So good.

68
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,870
Atom.

69
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,270
(Wait a minute.)

70
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,590
(I just talked to Mudmee about kissing.)

71
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,790
(Is Kongthap going to…)

72
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,460
(And why do I always think about kissing?)

73
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,970
(He’s probably not kissing me.)

74
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,040
(I should just close my eyes, to be safe.)

75
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,610
What?

76
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,520
What did you just do?

77
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,370
You got sauce on your mouth.

78
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,500
I cleaned it for you.

79
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,450
I know, but…

80
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,790
That’s it?

81
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,420
What else do you want me to do?

82
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,290
What?

83
00:06:58,977 --> 00:06:59,740
What is it?

84
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,110
Come on.

85
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,250
It’s… that.

86
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,220
What?

87
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,120
That.

88
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,320
What?

89
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:09,440
Gosh.

90
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:10,920
I’m not talking to you.

91
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,250
Hey.

92
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,570
Atom.

93
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,670
Why are you mad?

94
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,640
Jeez.

95
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,240
Will you take it down a notch, mama?

96
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,770
It’s for the school’s Sports Day, not the Olympics.

97
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,530
That was nothing.

98
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,670
This last one is the real deal.

99
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,940
Come on, Tan.

100
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,200
Okay.

101
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,680
Ready?

102
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:11,413
Half!

103
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,270
Shit.

104
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, gosh.

105
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,770
Half!

106
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,360
Are you okay?

107
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,950
I’m sorry.

108
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,470
No worries. It’s fine.

109
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,504
Holy shit.

110
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,580
Did you spike that?

111
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,440
Mm.

112
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,330
That’s incredible.

113
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,270
I can’t call you Mudmee anymore.

114
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,460
You should be called The Hulk.

115
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,730
Well, I am not that strong.

116
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,580
Our Team Green will be just fine.

117
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,280
We have The Hulk on our team.

118
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,410
We’re not going to lose.

119
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,160
You’re our hope, The Hulk.

120
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,440
Noted.

121
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,310
Excuse me. I’m going to the bathroom.

122
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,070
See you.

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,810
Why are you happy?

124
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,320
Didn’t you see?

125
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,780
He was complimenting me.

126
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,440
He gave me a nickname too.

127
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,010
Back to your senses, girl.

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
When he said you were The Hulk,

129
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,170
you’re labeled as a beefy muscular chick.

130
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,310
Is that what you guys think?

131
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,420
Heck, yeah.

132
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,100
Guys like to lead.

133
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,210
They want to be with someone they can protect,

134
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,540
not muscular females who protect them.

135
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,960
Damn it.

136
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,800
What should I do?

137
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,020
From now on,

138
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,610
get rid of The Hulk in you and become a damsel in distress.

139
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
I promise you it’ll work.

140
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,720
Right!

141
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,470
I know it.

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,160
What’s up with you?

143
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,280
I just realized why Atom is mad at me.

144
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,770
Took you long enough.

145
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,080
This morning, while working on the Sports Day sign,

146
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,660
his mouth got messy.

147
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,180
I reached out and cleaned out the sauce for him.

148
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,200
Suddenly, he’s mad at me.

149
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,960
He must be thinking you were kissing him.

150
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,860
How do you know?

151
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,910
It’s a classic scene.

152
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,280
How do you not know?

153
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,340
Well…

154
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,050
When do you think

155
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:19,240
people in a relationship should have their first kiss?

156
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,210
You guys haven’t done it?

157
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,960
Should they wait for a year or two?

158
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,840
Buddy, listen to me.

159
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,400
The first kiss isn’t about when, but about why.

160
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,250
Why?

161
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:49,990
When the time comes, you will find out.

162
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
That’s all I can say.

163
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,408
Because I have no idea either, I read it somewhere.

164
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,720
(Why are you staring at me?)

165
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,380
(Are you trying to fix your mistake this morning?)

166
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,090
(Finally, you’ve figured it out.)

167
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,050
(But if I kiss him now, he won’t know.)

168
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,850
(All I can do now is…)

169
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,810
I’m sorry. I thought you were asleep.

170
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,460
Don’t apologize.

171
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,250
Why are you apologizing?

172
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,840
Are you okay with it?

173
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,170
Why shouldn’t I be?

174
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,190
We are boyfriends.

175
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,970
Kissing is fine, right?

176
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,610
Hold on. I didn’t just kiss you.

177
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,070
I was touching your lips with my fingers.

178
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,080
What?

179
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,400
I am not Mommam.

180
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,120
Why do you like to mess with me so much?

181
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,870
Wait. I wasn’t messing with you.

182
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,210
Then why did you do what you just did?

183
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:39,180
If I really kissed you, would you be okay?

184
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,800
As I told you, this is fine.

185
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,430
You’re the one making it weird.

186
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,460
I’m sorry.

187
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,000
Wait.

188
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,440
Lately, Mommam has seemed quite lonely.

189
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,040
Do you want to come play with him?

190
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,690
Is it you or Mommam that wants me to come?

191
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,340
I can come.

192
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,150
I wanna see Mommam.

193
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,110
Keep reminding yourself, Mudmee.

194
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,710
You’re a fragile little girl.

195
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,980
I can’t open this snack package. It’s so hard.

196
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,490
Mudmee, what’s the matter?

197
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,370
Half, it’s good you’re here.

198
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,760
I can’t open this snack package. I don’t have the power.

199
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,280
Can you help me with it, Half?

200
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,090
But I saw you opening it yourself the other day.

201
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,650
You’ve mistaken me for someone else.

202
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,400
I don’t have enough strength to do it.

203
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,250
Will you help me?

204
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,580
Of course.

205
00:18:57,955 --> 00:19:02,210
Um.. I wonder where my bag is.

206
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,370
I just saw it somewhere.

207
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,430
Is that the one?

208
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,300
It’s too high.

209
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,700
I can’t reach it.

210
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,310
Half, will you help me get it?

211
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,430
How did it get up there in the first place?

212
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,140
Right. Exactly.

213
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,340
I didn’t think about it.

214
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,660
Ah!

215
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,640
I was just tossing it around for fun and it got stuck up there.

216
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,800
Let me get it.

217
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,040
Thanks.

218
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,089
You’re being bullied, aren’t you?

219
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,098
What?
You’re being bullied, aren’t you?

220
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:07,620
What?

221
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,780
Gosh.

222
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,820
This has gone so wrong.

223
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,800
Here. Take the snack.

224
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,690
And give me my bag.

225
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,620
Give it.

226
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,860
I’m going home.

227
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,260
What did I do wrong?

228
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,440
Mommam, do you miss me?

229
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,290
Hm?

230
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,690
You wanna play?

231
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,590
Hey.

232
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,180
You said he was lonely.

233
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,180
He doesn’t even look at me.

234
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,580
See?

235
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,130
He doesn’t care about me.

236
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,942
That’s alright.

237
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,995
I’ll play with you.

238
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,960
Seriously?

239
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,808
Hello.

240
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,506
Yes, Mom.

241
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,075
You’re not coming home tonight?

242
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,582
(Did he know from the start that it would be like this?)

243
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,320
(So he invited me here to…)

244
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,440
Okay.

245
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,271
Yes, Mom.

246
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,835
Bye.

247
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:05,466
Atom.

248
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:07,982
Atom.

249
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:08,871
Atom.

250
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,942
- Atom!
- Holy shit!

251
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:14,648
Damn, what should I do?

252
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:15,422
I’m sorry.

253
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:15,946
I really am sorry.

254
00:22:15,982 --> 00:22:17,493
I didn’t mean to.

255
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:18,515
What should we do?

256
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:19,626
That’s okay.

257
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,688
What are you doing?

258
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,724
Taking my shirt off.

259
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,060
No way. Why would you take it off in front of me?

260
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,697
One second.

261
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,724
You’re back?

262
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,208
Is that you?

263
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:56,293
Are you decent?

264
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:01,057
No.

265
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:07,013
(It’s not about when. I just need to find the reason why.)

266
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:13,870
You haven’t changed yet?

267
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,648
Hey.

268
00:23:49,352 --> 00:23:50,340
You’ve changed.

269
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,822
Come on.

270
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:55,360
Why do you like messing with me so much?

271
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:58,746
If you’re going to be like this, don’t invite me here next time.

272
00:23:59,057 --> 00:24:01,342
Am I the only one who takes things seriously?

273
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,648
I’m sorry, Atom.

274
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,222
Just hear me out.

275
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:09,120
Just get out.

276
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,937
I don’t wanna hear it.

277
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,937
Hey, don’t.

278
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,995
It’s your place.

279
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,146
I should leave.

280
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,084
Let me take you home.

281
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,320
No need.

282
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,577
Next will be the three-legged run.

283
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:52,248
Our athletes are getting ready on their running track.

284
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,573
Each team, please stand by.

285
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,253
Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, is everyone present?

286
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:09,128
If you are all set, the staff will tie your legs.

287
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,568
Team Green, are you ready?

288
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,995
Can you wait a bit? My friend isn’t here yet.

289
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:16,515
Okay, but you must hurry.

290
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,057
I’m here.

291
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,120
I’m his partner.

292
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,568
Hey, why are you here?

293
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,973
I told Mudmee I’d like to run with Toon instead.

294
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,400
I also told Mudmee that I wouldn’t let you pair up with anyone else

295
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:53,862
but me.

296
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,564
So everyone is at their starting point.

297
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,168
Now the staff will tie your legs together.

298
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,173
How should we give each other the signals?

299
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,808
Do whatever you want.

300
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,577
Just run.

301
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,617
Get it over with.

302
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:28,062
Now, if you are ready, pay close attention to the command.

303
00:26:30,328 --> 00:26:31,440
On your mark.

304
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:34,497
Ready.

305
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,462
Set.

306
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,071
Each team starts sprinting now.

307
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,013
Team Red is in the lead.

308
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,937
Followed by Team Yellow and Green.

309
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:50,693
Red and Blue are going fast.

310
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,004
Oh, no. Team Green just fell.

311
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,164
Hope they’re okay.

312
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,204
Atom, are you alright?

313
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,866
Your knee.

314
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:05,146
I’m fine. It’s nothing.

315
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,280
You give the signals.

316
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,280
Alright. I’ll count ‘One, two’.

317
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,640
Let’s see if they can get up and go on.

318
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:25,457
They’re up and start running again.

319
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:26,293
One, two.

320
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,971
- One, two.
- Team Red is in the lead now, followed by Green

321
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:31,851
One, two.

322
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:32,765
One, two.

323
00:27:32,788 --> 00:27:34,342
One, two.

324
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,097
And they’ve finally reached the finish line.

325
00:27:58,871 --> 00:27:59,537
Atom.

326
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:01,946
Thanks a lot for that.

327
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,475
I just didn’t wanna hold you back.

328
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,151
I’m sorry.

329
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,986
Mudmee, what is the matter with you?

330
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:16,568
It was an easy ball. Why didn’t you get it?

331
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,382
I think you should sit on the bench.

332
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,133
I’m so sorry.

333
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,728
I’m out then.

334
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,755
Mudmee, how’s it going?

335
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,970
Hey, Half.

336
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,644
Nice to see you here.

337
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,862
Could you puncture it for me?

338
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:49,440
- I can’t do it no matter how hard I try.
- 		What?

339
00:29:49,502 --> 00:29:52,062
Are you asking me to puncture it?

340
00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:53,173
Yeah.

341
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,737
Are you kidding me?

342
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,151
No.

343
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:02,960
I don’t have the energy.

344
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,404
My hand hurts.

345
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:06,444
Here.

346
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:08,266
Thanks.

347
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,497
Are you sick today, Mudmee?

348
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:21,537
Hm?

349
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,475
Why does The Hulk seem so weakened?

350
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:32,130
You sound kind of weird too.

351
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,342
Nah.

352
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,777
I think I’m usually like this.

353
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:44,897
I’m not The Hulk at all.

354
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,217
What are we gonna do with the badminton match now?

355
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,835
What badminton match?

356
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:53,840
The mixed doubles that we signed up for together.

357
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,293
Dang!

358
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,622
I completely forgot about that.

359
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:04,266
I heard our competitors are the province champions.

360
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:07,550
We’re gonna lose.

361
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:20,826
Guys, I need your advice on something.

362
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,248
What is it?

363
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,888
I forgot that I signed up for mixed doubles badminton with Half.

364
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,728
Now I don’t know what to do.

365
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:32,942
If I keep pretending to be cute and weak, Half will lose.

366
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:37,244
But if I become The Hulk, Half will be scared of me.

367
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,004
Do you want a medal or Half?

368
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:43,920
Half, of course!

369
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,146
That’s it.

370
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,942
Here. Let me teach you.

371
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,850
Act cute.

372
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,751
Yes.

373
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,533
Right.

374
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,786
How should she play?

375
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:02,240
Don’t hit the shuttlecock.

376
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:03,342
Try to miss it.

377
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,888
Hey, Atom.

378
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,595
Will you stay after badminton to cheer on Kongthap in the basketball final?

379
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:15,208
No.

380
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,026
You guys are not fighting, are you?

381
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,128
No.

382
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,537
Well.

383
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,093
Kongthap came for my help regarding you the other day.

384
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,253
I don’t want to know.

385
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,106
What did he say?

386
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,933
He wasn’t being very specific.

387
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:49,560
But he is serious about you.

388
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,817
Kongthap has never been with anyone.

389
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:55,422
For certain things, he doesn’t know how to start.

390
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,053
Especially things about you, Atom.

391
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,515
He isn’t very good at reading people's feelings.

392
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:06,426
That’s why he uses his head more than other people do.

393
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,226
Sometimes he might upset you.

394
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,537
But please don’t be angry with him.

395
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:34,942
Oops.

396
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,857
I’m sorry.

397
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,804
That’s okay.

398
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:41,120
Let’s try again.

399
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,675
It’s okay, Mudmee.

400
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,240
Mudmee!

401
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:26,986
Gosh!

402
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,124
Half.

403
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,213
Are you alright?

404
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,288
I’m fine.

405
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:35,280
It’s nothing.

406
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:36,462
Don’t worry.

407
00:34:42,053 --> 00:34:44,460
She-Hulk is back in her now.

408
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,004
You guys are doomed.

409
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:14,497
We won.

410
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,391
We won.

411
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:17,531
Good job, Half!

412
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:21,280
We won!

413
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,137
Well done, The Hulk.

414
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:43,191
What did I just do?

415
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,635
Hey, Mudmee.

416
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:50,604
Where are you going?

417
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:53,851
What?

418
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,200
What’s wrong with her?

419
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,662
Mudmee, are you okay?

420
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:19,875
Don’t come any closer.

421
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,226
Mudmee.

422
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,044
Do you hate me now, Half?

423
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,506
Why would I hate you?

424
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,248
Because I’m The Hulk.

425
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,186
I’m like a strong, beefy muscular girl.

426
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:45,540
Not a fragile little girl.

427
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,226
What’s wrong with being The Hulk?

428
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,426
The Hulk is my favorite superhero.

429
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,995
Really?

430
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,666
Yes, really.

431
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:15,751
And the Mudmee I know is strong, protective, and extremely helpful to others.

432
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:22,168
I totally like that about you.

433
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,506
This,

434
00:38:04,844 --> 00:38:06,844
we got it because of you.

435
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:13,546
Today, you did incredibly well.

436
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,657
Thanks to you too.

437
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,231
Sure.

438
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,995
Actually, you’re not The Hulk.

439
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,284
The Hulk doesn’t have as cute a smile as you.

440
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:49,182
But if you like the Hulk that much, I’ll be that for you.

441
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,111
I’m the Hulk.

442
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,315
Promise?

443
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,200
Mhm.

444
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,657
The first two quarters have ended.

445
00:39:57,714 --> 00:40:00,411
The current score is 15 vs 36.

446
00:40:00,457 --> 00:40:03,588
Team Green has been playing defense the entire time.

447
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:08,811
Let's see if they can turn the game around in the second half of the game.

448
00:40:24,217 --> 00:40:26,240
I thought you were on the school team.

449
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,020
But all Team Red players are on the school team.

450
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,885
Let’s do this.

451
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:47,725
If you can lead our team to win, you can ask me for anything.

452
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:48,460
One thing.

453
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:54,080
Anything?

454
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:12,940
Anything.

455
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
Here. I’ll keep it for you.

456
00:41:30,468 --> 00:41:31,417
No.

457
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,291
I’m keeping this bottle with me.

458
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:26,137
Yeah!

459
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,091
What’s got into Kongthap?

460
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,520
He’s become a different person.

461
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,937
Hey.

462
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,451
That’s foul.

463
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,280
Wow, this is a blast.

464
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:01,942
Number 11 on Team Green is on fire.

465
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:03,725
He’s leading his team to a tie game.

466
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:05,211
How’s that possible?

467
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:07,188
We have three minutes left here.

468
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:09,908
Let’s see who the winner is.

469
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,788
This game is truly cutthroat.

470
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,651
Kongthap!

471
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:25,650
Hey!

472
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,097
Kongthap.

473
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,360
Kongthap.

474
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,405
How are you feeling?

475
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:48,240
I’m okay.

476
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,491
Did the last ball make it into the hoop?

477
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,434
Did we lose?

478
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,457
I’m sorry.

479
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,310
You made an effort to be there for me.

480
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:38,411
Khao-pan said you’ve been overthinking about me.

481
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:42,868
Yeah.

482
00:44:45,531 --> 00:44:48,240
I’ve never been in a relationship before.

483
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,480
Whatever problem I have, I bring it to him.

484
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:00,514
What piece of advice did he give you?

485
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:14,128
He said that certain things are not about when we should do them, but rather why.

486
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,024
I didn’t get it at first.

487
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,048
But now, I think I do.

488
00:45:32,426 --> 00:45:43,992
All these times, I’ve always thought about when we should have our first kiss.

489
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:54,736
But you made me realize that I don’t want to wait anymore.

490
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,232
As long as it’s you, Atom,

491
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:10,376
it doesn’t matter when or where.

492
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,440
You know,

493
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,680
that last ball you shot actually got in the hoop.

494
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:29,832
What?

495
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,800
So that means…

496
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,256
You won.

497
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:53,640
Now what is it that you want to ask?

498
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,288
I can ask for anything?

499
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,952
Even a difficult thing.

500
00:47:14,336 --> 00:47:20,744
(This past year, many things have happened to me.)

501
00:47:24,872 --> 00:47:27,216
(I experienced my first heartbreak.)

502
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,760
(I performed my first stageplay.)

503
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,960
(I made my first love confession.)

504
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,990
(I am in a relationship for the first time.)

505
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,664
(And I finished Grade 11 with our first win.)

506
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,928
(So this is what victory feels like.)

507
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,400
This year is going to be a good year.

508
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,864
Not good at all.

509
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,152
It totally sucks.

510
00:48:50,288 --> 00:48:51,240
It’s Half.

511
00:48:51,272 --> 00:48:53,240
Nothing happened between us.

512
00:48:53,272 --> 00:48:56,688
I’m not her boyfriend. What could I have done?

513
00:48:56,992 --> 00:48:57,896
Who was that?

514
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,376
Khao-pan.

515
00:48:58,408 --> 00:49:00,616
He’s looking for a place for a birthday party next week.

516
00:49:00,632 --> 00:49:01,864
His birthday is next week?

517
00:49:01,896 --> 00:49:02,632
No, it’s mine.

518
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:04,304
Why didn’t you tell me?

519
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,856
There’s no day more important than your birthday.

520
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:12,408
You being here with me is the most special present ever.
