1
00:00:00,337 --> 00:00:01,720
Khao-pan’s birthday is next week?

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,942
No, it’s mine.

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,617
What?

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,300
A junior asked Mudmee to watch the shooting stars with him.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,520
Someone just hit on your girlfriend, dude.

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,520
I’m not her boyfriend.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,170
What could I have done?

8
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:17,128
A relationship is about two people having good feelings for each other.

9
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,840
That’s all it takes, isn’t it?

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,980
I like you, Mudmee.

11
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,420
There’s no day more important than your birthday.

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,490
You being here with me is the most special present ever.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,230
Oh!

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,290
Would you like to join us for an open house on Saturday?

15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,810
Sriracha University is having its open house.

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,590
Good idea.

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,960
I’m also interested in applying there.

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,230
Let’s go together then.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,580
Hey, Kongthap.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,780
Good timing.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,250
We are discussing Sriracha University’s open house this Saturday.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,490
This Saturday?

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,190
I’m attending an open house too, but at a different university.

24
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,170
What?

25
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,390
Why didn’t you tell me?

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,130
Where are you going?

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,080
Let me show you.

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,940
Whoa!

29
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,490
It’s a top university.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,400
Hold on.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,200
You are studying in Bangkok?

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,780
Hm?

33
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,470
Mhm.

34
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,650
Why didn’t you say anything about this?

35
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,980
I already told you.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,130
When?

37
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,570
You haven’t told me.

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,890
If you had, I would’ve remembered it.

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,210
It’s okay if you don’t remember.

40
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,210
Do you wanna go with me though?

41
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,450
I’m thinking of staying one night there so we don’t have to hurry back.

42
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,390
Come on.

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,960
I can’t join this uni.

44
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,690
My grades are terrible. There is no hope for me.

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,160
That’s alright.

46
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,810
I can go by myself.

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,690
Hey.

48
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,910
Kongthap.

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,760
Kongthap.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,830
Oops.

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,910
Kongthap.

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,110
Kongthap.

53
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,360
Dang it.

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,240
And you just walked away?

55
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,680
Why were you so mad?

56
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,970
I wasn’t mad.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,210
But…

58
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah. You’re right.

59
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,350
Why?

60
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,270
Maybe you were upset

61
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,550
because your boyfriend didn’t remember what you guys talked about.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,110
No.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,580
It just felt weird when I learned that he wasn’t attending school in Bangkok with me.

64
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,860
Maybe you feel lonely?

65
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,360
You don’t want to study alone.

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,630
My dad is working abroad.

67
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,140
I’ve been alone since I was a kid.

68
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,520
Then I don’t know, man.

69
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,690
But I think you guys should talk.

70
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,690
I know that you don’t talk very much.

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,340
But if you don’t talk at all, how can Atom understand you?

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,000
I can’t even understand myself.

73
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,360
I’ve prepared some medicines for you.

74
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,850
Anti-allergy and antidiarrhoeal pills.

75
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,230
In case of emergency.

76
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,910
Alright.

77
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,560
Thank you, Mom.

78
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,290
Do you have everything?

79
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,770
Sure you don’t forget anything?

80
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,550
I don’t. I have my checklist.

81
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,080
This is so you. You’ve been like this since you were little.

82
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,640
You don’t let me help you with anything.

83
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,140
I don’t want to bother you.

84
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,610
How cold.

85
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,320
Who are you going to Bangkok with?

86
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,120
With a friend.

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,140
Atom?

88
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,440
Yes.

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,420
Just the two of you?

90
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,420
That’s right.

91
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,200
Take good care of yourself.

92
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,670
If there’s anything, give me a call, okay?

93
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,430
Okay.

94
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,350
May I please sit with you?

95
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,630
Hey.

96
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,910
How come you’re here?

97
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,520
I asked my mom for permission to come.

98
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,550
Easy-peasy.

99
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,930
Who else is going?

100
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,200
Kongthap, Mom.

101
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
We’re planning to stay one night.

102
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,620
Huh?

103
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,460
I’ve got all the info here.

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,490
This is the accommodation detail.

105
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,850
This is the train timetables.

106
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,710
This is the itinerary.

107
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,910
If the hard copy hurts your eyes, I sent you the PDF file already.

108
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,333
Please let me go.

109
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,782
Please, please.

110
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,350
I have decided to take care of you throughout this trip.

111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,080
Whether it’s food or attractions, you’re gonna love it.

112
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,160
Starting from this,

113
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,240
the energy booster before the trip starts.

114
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,360
Take it.

115
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,160
I’ve got one more.

116
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,720
Aren’t you going to share?

117
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,210
I’m here trying to make it up to you.

118
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,960
You should stop sulking already.

119
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,950
Why?

120
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,020
Why don’t you drink with me?

121
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,960
I’ve also bought one.

122
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,650
Thanks.

123
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,500
Does this mean you’re not mad anymore?

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I wasn’t mad at you to begin with.

125
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,200
And seeing you here makes me feel even better.

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,810
Hi, guys.

127
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,060
Welcome to the Faculty of Medicine Open House.

128
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,010
This is a basic life-saving procedure known as CPR.

129
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,890
What you do is join your hands like this.

130
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,970
It is up to you whether you place your left or right hand on top.

131
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,280
This is a blood pressure measuring device.

132
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,260
I will let you try it.

133
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,340
Can I listen to your heart?

134
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,190
Ah, sure.

135
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,840
Go for it.

136
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,850
Half, are you doing okay?

137
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Your heart beats really loud.

138
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,770
Ah. It’s just very hot in here.

139
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,890
It's 15 kilometers from here to the university.

140
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,680
Should we get a cab?

141
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,160
Hey.

142
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,740
Since we are in Bangkok, we should travel like the locals do.

143
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,090
Come on.

144
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,600
This is the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine's large animal hospital.

145
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,550
It’s like our second home.

146
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,840
Today I’ll be showing you a horse x-ray.

147
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,470
This is an x-ray film of a buffalo's broken leg caused by an accident.

148
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,180
This device is used to show the x-ray results.

149
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,730
We’re doing an ultrasound here. Can you see the heart?

150
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,040
The heart?

151
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,780
Why is his heart right there?

152
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,660
This is the horse’s chest and where it contains the heart.

153
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,230
You’re standing right in the recovery room.

154
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,400
And this is the operation room.

155
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,910
Kongthap.

156
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,480
So how is it?

157
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,850
How do you like Veterinary Medicine here?

158
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,390
It’s alright.

159
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,820
It’s a shame they provide too little information though.

160
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,980
Well, tomorrow they will have a workshop.

161
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,570
They are taking you to the real animal clinic.

162
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,490
Would you like to stay on?

163
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,190
But you are going back home tomorrow.

164
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,760
Right?

165
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,830
Right, but that’s okay.

166
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,100
I can travel home alone.

167
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:03,800
Come on.

168
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,500
Guys, the registration table is over here.

169
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,270
Excuse me.

170
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,330
He would like to register for the workshop tomorrow.

171
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,320
Of course.

172
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,320
Write down your name over here.

173
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,910
Oh, wait a second.

174
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,180
The workshop tomorrow is fully booked.

175
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,490
I’m so sorry.

176
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,310
What?

177
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,730
Can’t you add just one more?

178
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,040
It’s really full.

179
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,220
I really am sorry.

180
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,350
That’s fine.

181
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,090
Now we can go home together.

182
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,890
How nice.

183
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,310
Come on.

184
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,370
Thank you so much.

185
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,360
Sorry, guys.

186
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:53,946
No worries.

187
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,440
Kongthap.

188
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,490
Are you hungry?

189
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,320
I'm taking you to eat rolled noodles soup in Chinatown

190
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,220
and a giant dish of basil stir-fry in Banthat Thong.

191
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,740
Then we’ll have Pad Thai in Pratu Pi.

192
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,500
Aren't you going to check out the Food Business you wish to join?

193
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,350
Come on.

194
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,270
I told you I would never get accepted.

195
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,800
Let’s go eat.

196
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,990
Before all the restaurants are closed.

197
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,760
Come on.

198
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,410
Atom.

199
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,220
We’ve come all the way here. We should at least have a look.

200
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,500
Really?

201
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,150
Trust me.

202
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,540
But…

203
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,670
Come on.

204
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:41,970
Move.

205
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,960
We're so lucky to get to try out every piece of equipment

206
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,600
in both my and your faculty.

207
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,320
Right.

208
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,200
I really like it here.

209
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,100
Really?

210
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,240
Me too.

211
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,670
Should we study here together?

212
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,980
Gosh, I’m thrilled just to think of it.

213
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,780
Same here.

214
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,870
We have checked out Medicine and Communication Arts.

215
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
Are there any more places you want to check out?

216
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,880
I want to stop by the cafeteria.

217
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,560
What?

218
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,490
Sorry.

219
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,840
I’m kind of hungry.

220
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,020
I’m hungry too.

221
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,810
Let’s go grab something delicious.

222
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,910
Let’s do it.

223
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,890
You don’t have to hurry home, do you?

224
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,680
Nope.

225
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,260
Today I have no urgent business at home whatsoever.

226
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,540
I’m gonna use the bathroom real quick.

227
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,280
Sure.

228
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,360
Wait for me here.

229
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,340
Of course, take your time.

230
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,340
I’m gonna list the restaurants for Half to choose from.

231
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,940
What? Hey!

232
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,850
- Wait. - Give it.

233
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,422
- Let go. - Give it to me.

234
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,930
Where are you taking me? I’m not going.

235
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,920
Give me that.

236
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,300
Let go.

237
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,840
- Give it here. - 		What are you doing?

238
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,140
Let go of my bag.

239
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,010
Why are you so strong?

240
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,690
Give it back.

241
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,040
I’m not going with you.

242
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,680
Hey!

243
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,350
What are you doing? Let go!

244
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,170
Half.

245
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,140
Easy.

246
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,100
It’s okay, Mudmee.

247
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,700
I can handle him.

248
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,230
I’ve watched many action movies. It’s fine.

249
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,650
Half, that’s my dad!

250
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,310
Hello, Dad.

251
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,050
You have no right to call me that.

252
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,450
I’m so sorry, Dad.

253
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,220
I thought you were a thief.

254
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,040
I’m really sorry.

255
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,591
I didn’t realize.

256
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,710
You, go home.

257
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,520
Hold on. I told Half we would eat together.

258
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,360
Your mom is preparing food for you at home.

259
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,510
Eat at home.

260
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,510
Today?

261
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,430
Today.

262
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,440
Right now?

263
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,180
Right now.

264
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,330
Come on.

265
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,980
Why are you not moving?

266
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
Are you talking to me, sir?

267
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:24,480
Yes.

268
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,520
Walk.

269
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,800
Take the bag. I’m not carrying it for you anymore.

270
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,630
Dad.

271
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,810
This is the cooking section in our food academy.

272
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,260
Would you like to showcase your cooking skills?

273
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,370
We are just passing by.

274
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,040
Go.

275
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,570
Please take care of him.

276
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,430
Of course.

277
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,980
Give me your backpack.

278
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,910
First of all, add butter to the pan.

279
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,750
Give it a stir.

280
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,300
Once it melts, mix it with pork.

281
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,040
How should I flip it?

282
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,710
Slowly.

283
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,910
- Be careful.
- 	Ouch.

284
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,480
Kongthap.

285
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,720
Ow.

286
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,550
Sorry.

287
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,550
How is it?

288
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,840
It’s good.

289
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,120
Yeah?

290
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:29,740
Try it.

291
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,170
You know, I was so nervous.

292
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,210
It’s my first time doing serious cooking.

293
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,420
I’m sorry.

294
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,430
For what now?

295
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:13,000
For forgetting that you already told me you would study in Bangkok.

296
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,000
I really can’t remember.

297
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,370
I honestly thought you would come sightseeing only.

298
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,480
It’s fine.

299
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,960
But if you really want to study here in Bangkok, that's fine with me.

300
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,770
Actually, I'm still deciding where to study.

301
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,490
But when I found out you wouldn't be coming here with me,

302
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,870
I felt this strange feeling.

303
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,530
Like something's missing, right?

304
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,100
Exactly.

305
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,370
That’s the feeling.

306
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,970
How did you know?

307
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,180
I felt the same way when you said you were thinking about studying here.

308
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,000
It’s like something was missing.

309
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,770
I’m sorry.

310
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,020
Did I make you feel bad in any way?

311
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,260
No.

312
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:55,220
Come to think of it, we felt that way because we’re special to each other.

313
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,070
Special to each other.

314
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,530
Right.

315
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,060
It’s such a special day today.

316
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,010
Would you like to purchase your photo as a souvenir?

317
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,040
Let’s see.

318
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,770
How much is it? I’m buying.

319
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,260
300 baht.

320
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,560
The profit will be contributed to volunteer work.

321
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:47,680
Here you go.

322
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,260
Thank you, handsome.

323
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,000
Hope to see you next year.

324
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,000
Hey, Kongthap.

325
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,810
Why did you buy it?

326
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,810
So expensive.

327
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,390
It’s a souvenir.

328
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,170
It’s our first time in Bangkok together.

329
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,220
It’s cute.

330
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,190
Give it to me.

331
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,390
I’m keeping it.

332
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,670
Mudmee talks about you a lot.

333
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,120
It’s good to finally meet you.

334
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
You’re a good-looking young man.

335
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,240
Huh?

336
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,060
She said you’re good-looking.

337
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,970
My mom is Japanese. Her Thai isn’t very fluent.

338
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,680
Ah, that’s why.

339
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,570
Let’s eat.

340
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,670
Itadakimasu.

341
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,290
Itadakimasu.

342
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,720
Eat.

343
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,720
Wow, this is so delicious.

344
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,840
Ma’am, how do you say ‘delicious’ in Japanese?

345
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,360
Oishii.

346
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,760
Oishii.

347
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,120
You’ve never told me your mom is such a good cook.

348
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,380
I cooked that one.

349
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,240
Still, it’s really good.

350
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,090
No wonder why Mudmee is such a good cook.

351
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,080
She got it from you, Dad.

352
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,840
When she was younger, I’d take her to the kitchen whenever I cooked.

353
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,930
She'd assist me chop this and that.

354
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,140
Wait.

355
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,740
You don’t have the right to call me Dad.

356
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,150
Noted, Dad.

357
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,010
Father.

358
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,030
Uncle.

359
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,870
Auntie.

360
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,170
Mudmee, may I use the bathroom?

361
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:10,890
Of course.

362
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Once you’re out, turn left. The bathroom is on your right.

363
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,290
Okay.

364
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,740
Gosh.

365
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,690
What a near-death experience.

366
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,260
Wait. Which one is the bathroom?

367
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,000
I will just do this.

368
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,580
Which. One. Is. The. Bathroom?

369
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,210
Must be this one.

370
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,360
You’ve seen everything?

371
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,150
I’m so dead.

372
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,568
I’d originally reserved a double bed,

373
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:03,146
but I requested that it be changed to twin beds.

374
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,510
Before you booked, did you thoroughly check it?

375
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,900
Check what?

376
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,820
That.

377
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,240
Supernatural thing.

378
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,950
You mean ghosts?

379
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,510
Hey.

380
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,550
Shh.

381
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,020
Don’t say it out loud.

382
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,328
There is no need to check.

383
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:23,555
Come on.

384
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:26,630
People always look into that stuff.

385
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
Especially hotels like this one.

386
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,750
Oh.

387
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,000
Looks like people talk about this hotel online.

388
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,720
They say there’s a tale of a long-distance relationship that took place here.

389
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,180
That sounds romantic.

390
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:06,530
They also say there’s a housekeeper who hung herself after learning her lover was leaving her to work overseas.

391
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,310
Since then, the room’s telephone always rings at night.

392
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,980
Once someone picks it up, they hear a female voice saying…

393
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,550
- Don’t you dare leave me!
- Jeez!

394
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,300
I’m joking.

395
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,680
Sorry.

396
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,110
Do you want to go somewhere else?

397
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,420
It’s fine.

398
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,820
Let’s stay here.

399
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,220
You already paid for it.

400
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,580
I’m sorry, sir.

401
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,330
I got into the wrong room.

402
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,100
But I did not see anything.

403
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,450
Now that you know, do you still want to date my daughter?

404
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,160
I do, sir.

405
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
That’s nothing. I can take it.

406
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,300
But I can’t.

407
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,020
My daughter’s boyfriend should be someone who can protect her.

408
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,420
But look at you.

409
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,420
Skinny like a meatball stick.

410
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,560
But I can protect Mudmee, sir.

411
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,780
Are you sure?

412
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,340
I am, sir.

413
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,450
Good.

414
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,580
Punch me in the gut.

415
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,700
If you can make me bend, you can date my daughter.

416
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:57,730
So?

417
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,140
Yes.

418
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,240
Don’t you wanna date my daughter?

419
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,040
I do.

420
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,930
Right here.

421
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,150
Go ahead. Right in the gut.

422
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,280
I can’t.

423
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,850
How could I hit Mudmee’s father?

424
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,570
Good.

425
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,650
You’re a good man.

426
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,490
I’ll hit you instead.

427
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,260
What?

428
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:42,080
If you can take my 50% punch, you can date my daughter.

429
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,240
Yes, sir.

430
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,660
Pull your shirt up.

431
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,570
Tighten your core.

432
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,260
Enough already.

433
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,760
Stop messing with him.

434
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,880
Like mother, like daughter.

435
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,120
Hold on.

436
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,660
I feel like I’ve seen you somewhere, sir.

437
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,560
Ah, you’re the villain from the movie Tom Yum Kai.

438
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,420
You know my dad?

439
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,200
I do.

440
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:33,920
This pose.

441
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:34,450
Right?

442
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,000
Of course, I do. I'm an action movie lover.

443
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:42,140
Your dad is a famous movie star, Mudmee.

444
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
So those stuff are…

445
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,720
Props.

446
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,210
For movies.

447
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,420
My dad always acts tough when he’s thrilled.

448
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,940
He’s actually really nice.

449
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,950
That’s right.

450
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,330
He’s always like this.

451
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,550
He wasn’t going to punch you for real.

452
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,270
He just tried to be intimidating.

453
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,210
Is that right, honey?

454
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,280
It’s not.

455
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,950
Is that right?

456
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,810
That’s right, honey.

457
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,260
Let the kids be.

458
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,480
See?

459
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,600
I told you, my dad is nice.

460
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,820
Are you doing okay, Half?

461
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,670
You’re sweating so much.

462
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,740
The weather is hot.

463
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,050
Sorry if my dad did something weird.

464
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,610
He actually likes you, Half.

465
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,240
For real?

466
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,250
Yes.

467
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:01,020
He said your awkwardness reminded him of the first time he hit on my mother.

468
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,490
That’s why he liked to mess with you.

469
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:08,410
Please tell him I’m glad to see him.

470
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,590
Sure.

471
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,900
He’s the reason I know a lot more about you.

472
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,050
Really?

473
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,000
Yes.

474
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,440
What did he tell you?

475
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,290
He told me that

476
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:29,540
when you were younger, you’d see him leaving for his movie shoots and returning with injuries.

477
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,090
That's why you want to become a doctor.

478
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,720
You want to take care of him.

479
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:37,960
Right?

480
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,550
Dad.

481
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,040
He talks too much.

482
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,080
Don’t be embarrassed.

483
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,610
It’s cute.

484
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,490
You’re cute too today.

485
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,570
When you shut your eyes so tight out of fear that my dad might hit you.

486
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,240
I’ve done so much today.

487
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,520
Calling me ‘cute’ alone isn’t gonna compensate for it.

488
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,120
What do you want then?

489
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,390
Come closer. I’ll tell you.

490
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:19,980
What?

491
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,440
What did you do?

492
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,670
I’m sorry, sir.

493
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,800
Mudmee, it’s time for me to leave.

494
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,430
Bye-bye.

495
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,120
Where are you going?

496
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,580
Dad.

497
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,440
Should I leave the light on?

498
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,910
Come on. I’m not a kid anymore.

499
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,280
I’m not scared of your story.

500
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,200
Shit.

501
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,310
Relax.

502
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,250
The power is just out.

503
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:51,680
Kongthap.

504
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,440
Gosh!

505
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,120
Calm down. It’s just a phone call.

506
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,130
Kongthap.

507
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,380
It’s like the story you told.

508
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,020
Once we answer, there will be a female voice talking.

509
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,710
Hello.

510
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,820
Thank you.

511
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,040
A hotel staff called. He said the transformer had broken down.

512
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,130
That’s why the lights are out.

513
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,050
What a relief.

514
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,440
They’re fixing it right now.

515
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,530
Atom.

516
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,160
You can let go of me now.

517
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,150
Oh.

518
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,090
Sorry.

519
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,640
Kongthap.

520
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,300
Kongthap.

521
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,730
Are you asleep?

522
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,720
No.

523
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,580
What is it?

524
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,100
Will you sleep with me here?

525
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:39,850
What?

526
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,820
I’m not scared of ghosts.

527
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,000
I’m just unfamiliar with this place.

528
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
That’s why I can’t sleep.

529
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,690
Sure. Of course.

530
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:09,520
Should we turn our backs against each other?

531
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,640
That’s fine.

532
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,640
Good.

533
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,250
Kongthap.

534
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,060
Hm?

535
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,600
Do you think they’re real?

536
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,360
Ghosts?

537
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,910
I don’t know.

538
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,710
I’ve never seen one.

539
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,990
No.

540
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
I mean long-distance relationships.

541
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,000
I don’t know that either.

542
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,160
My dad’s been working in Japan for many years now.

543
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,080
He doesn’t seem to want to break up with my mom.

544
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,300
Do you think we will break up?

545
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,400
Um…

546
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,640
Well…

547
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,340
Kongthap.

548
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,170
I’m not scared

549
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,080
as long as it’s you.

550
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,350
I believe we can make it through.

551
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,670
Yes.

552
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,690
That’s what I was about to say.

553
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,070
Atom, are you sleeping?

554
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,350
 I don't know if it's a little thing called love

555
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,270
 This feeling that's building up inside our hearts

556
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,800
 The little thing we shared that day

557
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,660
 Started from nothing and grew in every way

558
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,660
 As long as I have you by my side

559
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,560
 No matter where this world takes us on a ride

560
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:55,640
 My arms will hold you tight

561
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,520
 You’ve been on my mind

562
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,520
They need to check the room for a bit.

563
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,430
Alright.

564
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,150
Kongthap, here.

565
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,040
Have a snack first.

566
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,840
Then we’ll get food at the train station.

567
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:30,710
Okay?

568
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,250
Thanks.

569
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,870
Whoa.

570
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,260
Did you get any sleep at all?

571
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:48,610
It’s you.

572
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,120
Me what?

573
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,110
Hm?

574
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,560
Kongthap.

575
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,340
What is it?

576
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,360
Why are you smiling?

577
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:12,790
Hello.

578
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,030
Someone gave up their spot in the workshop?

579
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,980
But I’m going home.

580
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
Hey. You can go.

581
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
I’ll go home by myself.

582
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,880
Are you sure?

583
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,530
Yes, it’s totally fine.

584
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,260
You should stay.

585
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,260
I can get home alone.

586
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,360
Be safe.

587
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:56,560
Call me when you get home.

588
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,050
I told you not to worry.

589
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,680
You can go to the workshop now.

590
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,600
(If we attend different schools, we’ll have to part ways like this every year.)

591
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:55,410
(If we attend different schools, we’ll have to feel this way every year.)

592
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,410
I know that you don’t talk very much.

593
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,520
But if you don’t talk at all, how can Atom understand you?

594
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,780
Do you think they’re real?

595
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,740
I mean long-distance relationships.

596
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:29,580
Do you think we will break up?

597
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,160
Kongthap.

598
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,400
I’m not scared

599
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,400
as long as it’s you.

600
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,720
I believe we can make it through.

601
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,850
(I don’t want this train to leave the platform.)

602
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,750
(I don’t want this train to leave the platform.)

603
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,430
Kongthap.

604
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,010
I’ve made up my mind.

605
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,150
I will study in Bangkok with you.

606
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,360
I’ve never set high goals before because I’m afraid of disappointment.

607
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:21,320
But right now, I’m more afraid of not trying my best.

608
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,830
In the end, I might not get accepted.

609
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,710
But I want to try.

610
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,630
It’s better than letting you go without trying to do anything.

611
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,300
Thanks.

612
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,190
I want to be with you too,

613
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,440
but I was afraid that if I said it, it’d put pressure on you.

614
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,480
I do feel pressured.

615
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:42,090
But after hearing you say that, I feel a lot more encouraged.

616
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,300
Study here with me, Atom.

617
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,800
Yes. We will study together.

618
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,790
Actually, you could have just called.

619
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,930
You didn’t have to get off the train.

620
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,580
I’m afraid your mom will scold you.

621
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,240
No. I must.

622
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,510
It’s something important.

623
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,020
I have to tell you in person.

624
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,590
I can catch the next train

625
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,480
and still get home by the curfew.

626
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,590
Really?

627
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,550
You better drink up.

628
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,070
You still have the workshop to get to.

629
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,900
Let me finish it first.

630
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,840
Kongthap, are you trying to drink slowly?

631
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:21,930
How do you know?

632
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,080
How can I not know?

633
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:24,800
Give it to me.

634
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:25,850
I’ll finish it.

635
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,100
Then you can get going.

636
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,230
When did you become like this?

637
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:47,706
Our stage play has come back around.

638
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,351
This year we will perform Beauty and the Beast.

639
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:52,462
I’m nervous

640
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:54,808
and I’m not even on the stage this year.

641
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:58,880
Those two will have a special moment like we did.

642
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,871
Half, are you okay?

643
00:55:01,128 --> 00:55:05,253
I’m…not attending the same university as you.

644
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,560
Kongthap, you and Atom are close, aren’t you?

645
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,471
How long have you guys been close?

646
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,133
Don’t worry about my pre-test result.

647
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:17,288
I’ll try my best anyway.

648
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:19,831
You being here with me is already enough.
