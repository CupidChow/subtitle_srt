1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,100
I've heard many of our seniors formed relationships during this camp.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,320
The man who will take care of us during our stay here is

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,420
Sergeant Yod!

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,980
Do you know why you two failed?

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,300
It’s because you are cowards.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,980
You give up before you even start.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,200
Isn't it amazing how powerful love is?

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,600
I also want to have someone.

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,300
Half.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,310
I know that it might be too late to say it now.

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,700
Before I know it, I like you already.

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,890
Would you go out with me?

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,710
What?

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,300
Thinking alone wouldn’t give me the answer.

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,270
Is that enough reason for us to be in a talking stage?

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,100
We can try.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,460
(Have you ever wanted to wake up earlier just to see someone?)

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,980
(For me, it happened just this morning.)

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:14,500
(I’m going to see the one I like as the person he’s talking to.)

20
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,620
Atom.

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,500
Can I get through?

22
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,850
Hi.

23
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,400
Yeah, hi.

24
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,020
Half.

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,890
Did we really go to that camp?

26
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,760
We did.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,880
Why?

28
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,810
It’s him.

29
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,240
We are two people in a talking stage, but there’s zero progress.

30
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,360
Dude, you’re not his boyfriend yet.

31
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,580
Do you want him to surprise you with flowers?

32
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,980
No, but…

33
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,510
there should be some changes.

34
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,960
You’ve got a point.

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,640
You should tell him directly.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,670
Are you crazy?

37
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,920
Who would have the guts?

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,900
If you can’t say it, you can send him a message.

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,060
Hey.

40
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,810
That’s right.

41
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,610
This is the first time I find you clever.

42
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,500
- Asshole. - Thanks a lot.

43
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,340
Regardless of what I seem, I have something to worry about too.

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,100
Hey!

45
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Are you listening to me?

46
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,150
Damn, this guy.

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,970
(Are we really in a talking stage?)

48
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,610
(Sent)

49
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,200
Shit!

50
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,620
Unsend.

51
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,309
(Read)

52
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,980
Crap.
(Read)

53
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:18,989
(Read)

54
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,199
He read it so fast.
(Read)

55
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,770
(Read)

56
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,330
(Let’s talk face-to-face.)

57
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,900
Is he going to break up with me?

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,060
No.

59
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,310
Hey!

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,670
You.

61
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,410
How long have you been here?

62
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,610
Since your first message.

63
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,740
So…

64
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,510
Are we really in a talking stage?

65
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,660
Yes, we are.

66
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,300
Then how come I don’t see any changes?

67
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,010
Is it necessary for us to change things?

68
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,610
It is.

69
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,150
Our relationship has been upgraded.

70
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,280
I’m sorry.

71
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,660
I’ve never been with anyone before.

72
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,770
Where should I start?

73
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,460
Please.

74
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
How do you not know this?

75
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,810
Like…

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Like what?

77
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,760
You haven’t really talked to anyone before either, right?

78
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:35,980
Whatever.

79
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,670
But I know who I should go to when it comes to love.

80
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,420
There you are, Mudmee.

81
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,700
I need your advice about something.

82
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,340
Atom, Half rejected me.

83
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,530
Kongthap and I…

84
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,910
What?

85
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,210
What did you say?

86
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,330
What did he say to you?

87
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,100
- At the camp, you had the courage to do something for Kongthap.
- Half!

88
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,860
It inspired me to confess my feelings to Half.

89
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,020
I…

90
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,300
There’s something I wanna tell you.

91
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,150
I’ve liked you for so long.

92
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,280
What?

93
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,970
By “like,” you mean more than friends?

94
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,640
Hold on a second.

95
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,620
Since when?

96
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,920
Since that day.

97
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,080
The high school entrance exam day.

98
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,110
We met in front of that school building.

99
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,300
Ah, the entrance exam.

100
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,530
Entrance exam.

101
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,770
Entrance exam.

102
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,500
Entrance exam.

103
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,860
Wait.

104
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,750
You don’t remember?

105
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,250
I’m sorry, but are you sure you haven't confused me for someone else?

106
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,160
I’m sure.

107
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,360
I was so nervous that day.

108
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,820
If it weren’t for your help, I wouldn’t be attending this school.

109
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,110
Are you sure that was me?

110
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,500
There.

111
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,800
You remember it wrong, don’t you?

112
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,760
Then just forget about what I just said.

113
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,280
I’m really sorry.

114
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,110
Hold on, Mudmee.

115
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,000
That asshole.

116
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,620
How could he do that?

117
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,410
Mudmee, I will scold him for you.

118
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,450
It’s okay, Atom.

119
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,410
It’s not Half’s fault.

120
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,900
It's my fault for being too unremarkable for people to recognize.

121
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,170
I’m sure it’s not like that, Mudmee.

122
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,800
I’ve accepted it, Atom.

123
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,160
I’m just air.

124
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,710
No one sees me.

125
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,280
No one cares.

126
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,790
- No one cares. - Mudmee.

127
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,150
At least I never forget about you.

128
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,540
Air can’t hear anything.

129
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,490
Air doesn’t have feelings.

130
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,550
- It’s nothing. - Hey.

131
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,460
It will disappear.

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,020
Gosh.

133
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,620
Half!

134
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,010
It’s you who did that to Mudmee.

135
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,520
What could I have done?

136
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,050
I don’t really remember it.

137
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,970
Do you want me to lie to her?

138
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,110
Think deeply about what you did.

139
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,430
Do it.

140
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,250
Ah, I know.

141
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,920
You forgot to pay me back the lunch money yesterday.

142
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,770
I remember it now.

143
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,820
I meant stuff about Mudmee.

144
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:10,200
Otherwise, our lovely Mudmee will completely become air.

145
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,110
Who is lovely?

146
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,300
Ah.

147
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,520
No one.

148
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,270
I didn’t mean it that way, Kongthap.

149
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,300
It was before I met you.

150
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,650
Who you think is lovely doesn't concern me.

151
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,270
But Mr. Suea wants to see you in his office now.

152
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,350
That’s all.

153
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,700
This is Mr. Annop.

154
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,850
He is filling in for Mrs. Ruthai, the student counselor on maternity leave.

155
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,700
Hello, sir.

156
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,660
He’d like a word with you.

157
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,030
I’ll leave you guys to it.

158
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,800
Thank you.

159
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,100
Let’s cut to the chase.

160
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,260
Mrs. Ruthai asked you all to do the aptitude test.

161
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,510
You’re the only one who turned in blank paper.

162
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,700
Because I didn’t know which faculty I wanted to join.

163
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,300
How about we start with the subject you’re good at?

164
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,260
I’m not good at any subject.

165
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,360
That’s why I don’t know what I should study.

166
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,870
Alright then.

167
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,200
Why don’t we try finding your passion or what you want to be?

168
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,950
Passion?

169
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,300
I have no passion.

170
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:50,440
Does getting into the same university as someone I like count?

171
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,780
I was just babbling.

172
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,920
Don’t mind me, sir.

173
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,190
Hey, don’t be embarrassed.

174
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,110
When I was your age, I had a crush on my classmate too.

175
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,350
So I studied hard and got accepted into the same university as them.

176
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,460
Whoa.

177
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,030
You’re my idol, sir.

178
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,690
Let’s try the aptitude test again.

179
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,030
But don’t take it too seriously.

180
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,560
It might help you find yourself.

181
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,380
Yes, sir.

182
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,310
I’ll try.

183
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,320
Thank you so much.

184
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,900
See you.

185
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,200
Sir, since you’re my idol, can I ask you something?

186
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes?

187
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,350
What do people in a talking stage do?

188
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,610
Eat lunch together?

189
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,200
Yes.

190
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,980
It is said to be one of the things that people in a talking stage do.

191
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,610
What exactly is this so-called “talking stage”?

192
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,030
We were just friends at first,

193
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,040
but then our relationship developed, and we have no idea how to act.

194
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,630
I see.

195
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,840
How about starting with an activity that will help tighten your relationship?

196
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,090
Like eating together.

197
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,980
Let’s eat.

198
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,530
I’ll go get you food.

199
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,440
Tan, eat this.

200
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,170
No, you eat first, Toon.

201
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,980
- You first.
- No, you first.

202
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,020
The capsaicin is good for your health.

203
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,470
- Toon, just eat.
- No, you eat.

204
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,670
Here. Eat this.

205
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,060
Do we need to do that too?

206
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,580
Let’s not go that far.

207
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,400
What about that?

208
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,660
Nice weather today.

209
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,850
And we have some privacy here.

210
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,110
Yeah.

211
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,870
The sun is a bit too strong though.

212
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,330
What are you looking at?

213
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,980
Ah.

214
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,400
Nothing.

215
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,700
I’m not looking.

216
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,400
Eat together and then what, sir?

217
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,260
The situation will tell you what your next move is.

218
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,950
I was grabbing the milk.

219
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,720
But your drink is over there.

220
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,840
I forgot.

221
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,760
Look at those rain clouds.

222
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,820
Atom.

223
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,710
There are no rain clouds.

224
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,980
So, why did you take me here?

225
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,610
Is this the place we first met?

226
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,500
Can you tell me what happened on that day?

227
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,510
Please, please.

228
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,010
It’s important and I want to remember it.

229
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,770
Please.

230
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,720
Pretty please.

231
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,180
Please.

232
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,100
Please.

233
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,210
Please, Mudmee.

234
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Please.

235
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,910
Fine.

236
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,570
As I told you, it was the day of our school's Grade 10 entrance exam.

237
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,700
I forgot my exam card and stood here, whining.

238
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,850
Right here where we’re standing.

239
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,560
I was banging my head against the board.

240
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,230
Like this.

241
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,600
You walked in and asked me…

242
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,410
Hey, are you okay?

243
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,820
Hey, are you okay?

244
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,510
Are you sick?

245
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,050
Hey, it’s starting to ring a bell.

246
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,310
Did you wear a red skirt that day?

247
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,570
Right?

248
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,220
I was wearing a navy blue skirt.

249
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,390
You were carrying a tote bag.

250
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,680
I was carrying a backpack.

251
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,890
You had long hair.

252
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,300
I’ve always had this hairstyle.

253
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,250
Let’s stop.

254
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,850
It’s a waste of time.

255
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,230
Hold on.

256
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,700
Well…

257
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,510
Even though I can’t remember what happened that day,

258
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,510
there’s one incident I’ve never forgotten.

259
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,460
It’s Valentine’s Day when we were in grade 10.

260
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:57,167
Huh?

261
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,800
Valentine?

262
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,660
Come here.

263
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,410
Here.

264
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,720
There.

265
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,260
I remember we met here on Valentine’s Day last year.

266
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,820
You stood there and I stood here.

267
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,220
Half.

268
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,470
Hey, Mudmee.

269
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,670
We made a lot in our Home Economics Club.

270
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,890
You can grab one if you don’t mind.

271
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,160
But I don’t think you’d like it.

272
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,160
Never mind.

273
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,270
- I’ll just leave. - Wait.

274
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,420
Easy.

275
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,970
Is that a cupcake?

276
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,640
Mhm.

277
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,500
It’s my favorite.

278
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,420
Really?

279
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,010
I haven’t got any cupcakes yet.

280
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,310
Can I have that?

281
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,770
Of course.

282
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,600
Thank you.

283
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:30,521
You’re welcome.

284
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,010
People gave you tons of sweets that day.

285
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,220
Do you still remember mine?

286
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,670
Of course, I do.

287
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,880
I remember that I was so glad.

288
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,630
Really?

289
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,410
I also remember that it tasted…

290
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,700
It was…

291
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,700
It was?

292
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,710
It was…

293
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,360
I don’t recall.

294
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,010
But I remember I ate everything I got.

295
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,220
How could I not remember eating the cupcake?

296
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,620
So you didn’t eat it?

297
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,960
Do you have any idea how much courage I needed then?

298
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,510
I had people taste it first before giving it to you.

299
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,520
But in the end, you threw it away?

300
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,140
No!

301
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,420
You don’t have to remember anything anymore

302
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,970
because from now on, I will forget everything about you too.

303
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:12,397
Mudmee.

304
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,765
Damn it.

305
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,790
Mr. Nop,

306
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,240
can you extend the deadline for my aptitude test to no deadline at all?

307
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,970
I’ve lost my passion for doing it.

308
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,970
Wait a minute.

309
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,410
Take it easy.

310
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,750
What happened?

311
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,160
I asked someone I like to eat on the rooftop.

312
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,810
Once I reached out to grab their hand,

313
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,400
they pulled it away.

314
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,870
Does that mean I am heartbroken?

315
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,110
Alright, alright.

316
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,210
Calm down.

317
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,600
Maybe it was because you guys were in school.

318
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,980
They might have felt insecure.

319
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,000
Possibly.

320
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,060
What should I do?

321
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,230
Why don’t you ask them to spend time out of school?

322
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,030
Go out and relax.

323
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,020
It’s good for your relationship.

324
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,110
Are you saying…

325
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,660
I should ask them out on a date?

326
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,010
Why don’t you ask them to spend time out of school?

327
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,820
Go out and relax.

328
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,810
It’s good for your relationship.

329
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,900
(Wanna go on a date on Saturday?)

330
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,710
(It’s too blunt.)

331
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,420
(I should just start with…)

332
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,800
(The weather is nice today.)

333
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,150
Hey!

334
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,150
Again?

335
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,410
It’s good I didn’t hit send.

336
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,370
What are you sending?

337
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,720
A message asking you on a date.

338
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,640
Ah.

339
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,980
No.

340
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,170
I didn’t mean it that way.

341
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,880
Okay.

342
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,880
I’m free this Saturday.

343
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,100
Wait up, Mudmee.

344
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,520
Please hear me out.

345
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,670
Who are you?

346
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,870
I don’t know you.

347
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,750
But I remember now that I really didn’t eat your cupcake.

348
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,760
I also know the culprit that prevented me from eating it.

349
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:21,980
Culprit?

350
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,270
Where is he?

351
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,980
He told me to wait here.

352
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,600
Well, the wait is over.

353
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,110
Let’s start with this.

354
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,710
Hey! Don’t!

355
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,980
This is mine.

356
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,430
That one is mine.

357
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,210
Hey.

358
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,240
Atom!

359
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,160
Come on.

360
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,730
I haven’t had a bite.

361
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,720
Don’t lie.

362
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,110
It’s mine.

363
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,450
Mudmee just gave it to me.

364
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,140
I put it right here and went to the bathroom…

365
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,410
Nothing is here. Look.

366
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,110
Don’t tell me that one is mine.

367
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,100
Sorry, man.

368
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,000
I must’ve dropped it while putting things down.

369
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,830
It’s okay to eat yours then.

370
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,530
We’re even.

371
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,240
Even, my ass.

372
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,750
I haven’t tasted it yet.

373
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,280
What a pity.

374
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,720
What a pity.

375
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,120
I like cupcakes.

376
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,100
Here.

377
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,870
If you don’t believe me, you can look at this photo.

378
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,610
Atom took it to tease me.

379
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:36,160
I know that no explanation can make you feel better.

380
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,400
But…

381
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,360
I want you to know

382
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,970
that I would never throw away the cupcake you gave me.

383
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,610
Mudmee.

384
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,570
Don’t cry.

385
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,300
What kind of person looks so sad over a cupcake?

386
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,540
And you even took a photo.

387
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,010
Half.

388
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,512
Seriously.

389
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,850
Don’t you feel embarrassed showing it to me?

390
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,730
Are we cool now?

391
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,500
Yes.

392
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,610
It’s not even your fault actually.

393
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:53,150
You don’t remember me because I’m too plain to be noticed.

394
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,840
That’s not true.

395
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,510
To me, you’re a very lovely person.

396
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,410
Perhaps it was because we didn’t get to talk much before.

397
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,500
But now I am glad we are friends.

398
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,560
Friends?

399
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,910
As of now.

400
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,150
I’m sorry.

401
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,290
It’s totally fine.

402
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,580
I get you.

403
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,970
If we are settled here, then I should go.

404
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,940
Half!

405
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,590
From now on, I'll make an effort to talk to you more

406
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:45,160
and let you learn more about me.

407
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,210
Looking forward to it.

408
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,280
Hey, are you okay?

409
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,120
Rock paper scissors!

410
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,360
Right!

411
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,060
That smile.

412
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,670
I remember it now.

413
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,400
I’m so happy you and Half are back on good terms.

414
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,970
Does that mean you guys are in a talking stage?

415
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,850
I don’t think we’re there yet, Atom.

416
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,280
Let’s talk about you first.

417
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,460
You’re going on a date with Kongthap tomorrow, aren’t you?

418
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,510
Ah.

419
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,610
That’s right.

420
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,340
I haven’t decided on what color I should wear.

421
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,590
Let me.

422
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,700
It’s your first date. I’ll help.

423
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,500
What do you think?

424
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,210
It’s good, Atom.

425
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,380
What about this?

426
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,440
Aw, it’s great too.

427
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,260
That one is also cute.

428
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,410
I like that color.

429
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,510
What should we do?

430
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,680
Let’s do this, Atom.

431
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:46,290
Remember, the best color is the one you choose yourself from the auspicious colors table for each day.

432
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,260
How is that called ‘choose it yourself’?

433
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,380
Hey, it depends on what you want to enhance.

434
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:01,860
Like, if you wanna be lucky tomorrow, you must wear red.

435
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,940
If you want to be attractive, wear white.

436
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,510
If you want to be splendid, wear green.

437
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,100
Everyone wants to be lucky.

438
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,580
But it’s important to be attractive too.

439
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,260
And tomorrow has to be splendid.

440
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,860
What should I wear?

441
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,910
I can’t decide.

442
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,630
Why don’t you wear every color? Enhance everything.

443
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,350
You will be lucky, attractive, and splendid.

444
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,610
It’s your first date. You have to make it grand.

445
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,100
Yes?

446
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,980
I’ve got you a new package. You are running out.

447
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,710
I’ll put it right here.

448
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,410
Thank you so much.

449
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,910
Look at you all dressed up.

450
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,870
Do you have a date?

451
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:55,980
It’s just a movie.

452
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,020
Let me see.

453
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:07,510
Can you tell me how your first date with Dad went?

454
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,200
We were both nervous.

455
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,010
Dad was wearing a suit and tie.

456
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,560
His hair was middle parted with lots of gel.

457
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,660
I was afraid he wouldn’t like me so I wore every auspicious color.

458
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,950
I looked like a spirit house wrapped around by colorful clothes.

459
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,660
You look great now.

460
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,040
Okay.

461
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,170
I’ll be taking off then.

462
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,110
Enjoy the date…

463
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:36,700
No.

464
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,890
Enjoy the movie.

465
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,130
Yes, Mom.

466
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,910
(Gosh, I totally look like Christmas.)

467
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,370
(Will people think I’m crazy?)

468
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:13,970
(The only thing left to do is wish Kongthap would not wear black since it is unlucky.)

469
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,720
Have you waited for long?

470
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,780
(White pants, white T-shirt, we’re fine.)

471
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,550
(But he’s wearing a black jacket.)

472
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,300
(Why would he wear it?)

473
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,010
(It’s totally ominous.)

474
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,010
(But he looks so good in it.)

475
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,410
No, not long at all.

476
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,700
Should we go?

477
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,310
It’s almost showtime.

478
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,047
- Thank you. - Thank you.

479
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,900
Hey, the movie starts in five minutes.

480
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,605
Hey.

481
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,371
Hm?

482
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,920
It will be out before we hit the theater.

483
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,360
But it’s so good. Can I have one more bite?

484
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,460
Whoa.

485
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,460
Take it easy.

486
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,070
You’re all messy.

487
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,920
Is it that good?

488
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,320
Yes.

489
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,510
Hey!

490
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,100
What are you doing?

491
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,320
What?

492
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,890
I said don’t.

493
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,730
Enough already.

494
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,160
It’s embarrassing.

495
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,100
So what is this movie about?

496
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,930
Ah.

497
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,900
I did my homework.

498
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,983
The movie is called

499
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:19,802
My Cat President.

500
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:27,120
The main character is a cat named Mametaro,

501
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,440
similar to your cat Mommam.

502
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,380
Mhm.

503
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,210
You’re quite attentive to me.

504
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,120
No!

505
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,640
Not at all.

506
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,970
I just happen to like cats too.

507
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,870
Let’s go see the movie.

508
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,820
It’s starting.

509
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,480
Come on. Hurry up. We’re late.

510
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,210
Shit!

511
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,600
Hey!

512
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:01,831
(Mametaro.)

513
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:03,976
(Please don’t die, Mametaro.)

514
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,460
How did that crash happen?

515
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,570
Gosh.

516
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,200
That damn director.

517
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,980
How could he let the cat die in the end?

518
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,800
Atom.

519
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:29,982
Here are some tissues.

520
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,980
I’m sorry.

521
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,220
For what?

522
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,310
It’s supposed to be a good day today.

523
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,100
But I took you to see this stupid movie.

524
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,650
Sorry.

525
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,940
I just wanted to comfort you.

526
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:05,980
It’s not that.

527
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,560
I just thought you were afraid people would see.

528
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,170
Why would I be afraid?

529
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,980
Back when we were on the rooftop,

530
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,450
I was trying to hold your hand.

531
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,800
You seemed startled.

532
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,400
Like you were afraid people would see.

533
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:40,960
Ah.

534
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,220
I was grabbing my milk.

535
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,850
I see.

536
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,800
That?

537
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,500
I got startled because I felt a static shock.

538
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:03,210
I haven’t held your hand since because I didn’t want to shock you again.

539
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,210
Good to know that.

540
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,360
I thought you were disgusted by it.

541
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,980
I looked up how to avoid static electrical shocks.

542
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:26,800
They say we should first make contact with our clothes to discharge the electricity.

543
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,400
Then move down to a physical part.

544
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,970
Now we can hold hands.

545
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,590
Where next?

546
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,920
Actually, there is one more place to visit

547
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:17,310
But can we stay like this a little longer?

548
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,110
You see, this temple is full of ribbons.

549
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,110
People tie these ribbons and make wishes.

550
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,910
Each color benefits you differently.

551
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,550
Let’s say you wanna win a basketball match, choose an orange ribbon.

552
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,970
So we write our names on the ribbons and tie them?

553
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:23,864
Yes, but it’s said that the higher you tie it,

554
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,974
the higher chance your wish has of being granted.

555
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,150
Do you see there?

556
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,760
We will tie our ribbons on the mountaintop.

557
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,860
That’s pretty high.

558
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:40,240
Can you handle it?

559
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,810
I’ve been running around the football field every week to prepare for this.

560
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,060
But if you think you can’t make it, just let me know.

561
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,260
Come on.

562
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:05,660
Oops.

563
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,610
Gosh.

564
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,310
Is this a stairway to the mountains or heaven?

565
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,868
- Are you okay? - It’s too tall.

566
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,260
If you’re hot, take off your jacket.

567
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,040
I can’t.

568
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,260
I want to be attractive.

569
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:35,750
How is that relevant?

570
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:40,480
I’ve been told that white clothing would enhance my attractiveness.

571
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,800
Take it off.

572
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,120
But…

573
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,560
You are attractive, no matter what you wear.

574
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,450
Take it off or you will faint.

575
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,210
Were you serious when you said I was attractive?

576
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,300
Or you just wanted me to take that jacket off?

577
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,900
Have I ever lied to you?

578
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,900
Here.

579
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:15,830
Use this for now.

580
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,410
There’s white on it too.

581
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,200
See? You are attractive indeed.

582
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:26,970
Let’s go.

583
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,610
They said the highest point to tie ribbons was up there.

584
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,710
We must cross this bridge.

585
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,400
What’s the matter, Atom?

586
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:09,910
Kongthap.

587
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,010
I didn’t know the bridge was made of glass.

588
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,970
I thought after the Hell Tower, you wouldn’t be scared of heights anymore.

589
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,690
Oh please.

590
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,160
I became brave because I was afraid you’d die.

591
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,310
But acrophobia isn’t something that can be treated.

592
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,880
Hey.

593
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,850
Can you take my ribbon with you and tie it?

594
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,310
I’ll be waiting right here.

595
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,620
This is one of those things you have to do yourself.

596
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,600
Otherwise, it won’t hold any meaning.

597
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,260
Come on.

598
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,190
I can’t even take a step right now.

599
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,100
Come here.

600
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,710
Take it easy.

601
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,550
Don’t look down.

602
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,040
Look into my eyes.

603
00:47:12,442 --> 00:47:13,113
Okay?

604
00:47:18,994 --> 00:47:19,710
Ready?

605
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:25,040
 Can’t erase you from my mind 

606
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,900
 No matter how hard I try 

607
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,500
 I keep saying it 

608
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,160
 But never manage to do it 

609
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,580
 Erase you from memory 

610
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,120
 How many times I’ve said it 

611
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,960
 It always ends like this 

612
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,550
 You’re written in my heart 

613
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,070
 No one knows but me 

614
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,070
 The more I erase, the more I love you 

615
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,080
 Can’t erase you from my mind 

616
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,890
 No matter how hard I try 

617
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,510
 I keep saying it 

618
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,200
 But never manage to do it 

619
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,600
 Erase you from memory 

620
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,140
 How many times I’ve said it 

621
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,980
 It always ends like this 

622
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,600
 You’re written in my heart 

623
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,210
 No one knows but me 

624
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,080
 The more I erase, the more I love you 

625
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,120
 Can’t erase you from my mind 

626
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,970
 No matter how hard I try 

627
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,580
 I keep saying it 

628
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,270
 But never manage to do it 

629
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,690
 Erase you from memory 

630
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,520
Hey.

631
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,010
Pink ribbons are for love wishes.

632
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:28,720
How do you know?

633
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,750
I chose this color as well.

634
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,324
Come on.

635
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:02,090
(Kaweewat) / (Achira)

636
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:25,410
Not letting go?

637
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,400
Still afraid of heights?

638
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,420
I want to hold your hand.

639
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:34,710
We don’t get to do this back in school.

640
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,900
So can I hold it a little longer?

641
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,350
Don’t let go until we’re home.

642
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:43,900
Alright.

643
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,460
Whoever lets go first is the loser.

644
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,410
Oh.

645
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:06,610
Mr. Annop.

646
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:39,760
Gosh.

647
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,110
When will we get there?

648
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,920
Or I’ll take off my clothes again.

649
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:46,780
Stay calm.

650
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,160
We should be close already.

651
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:52,670
I should’ve worn yellow too.

652
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,230
Why?

653
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,300
Because it is said that yellow would enhance liveliness.

654
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,550
We might’ve been more refreshed.

655
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,980
That’s right.

656
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,750
Speaking of yellow, I’ve got something here.

657
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:10,540
Here.

658
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,360
I bought it down the hill.

659
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,810
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

660
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:21,980
Can I drink it?

661
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,610
Yellow makes me feel more refreshed, indeed.

662
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,260
You can have it. It will keep you refreshed.

663
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,900
But I don’t want to be refreshed alone.

664
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,800
Sorry, I bought only one.

665
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,980
Would you like to drink with me?

666
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,110
I can feed you.

667
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,010
Let’s do this.

668
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,540
You hold this side of the bottle.

669
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,300
Now we can possess something yellow together.

670
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,170
Should we go?

671
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,000
Yes.

672
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,183
Valentine’s Day is approaching.

673
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,843
What kind of chocolate do you like, Half?

674
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:23,607
I want to try chocolate cupcakes this year.

675
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,253
What kind of chocolate do you like?

676
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:27,065
What about you?

677
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,214
What flowers do you like?

678
00:52:30,307 --> 00:52:30,806
Atom!

679
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,724
- You’re burning it! - Atom!

680
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:36,800
The chef made this after I almost burned their kitchen down.

681
00:52:37,527 --> 00:52:39,980
I’d like to have a word about the other day.

682
00:52:40,218 --> 00:52:42,611
I told you not to tell anyone about this.

683
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:44,614
Are you embarrassed to be with me?

684
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:47,978
What’s going on between you two?
