1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,770
(LOVE.)

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,250
(LOVE.)

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,930
(LOVE.)

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,063
My Love Mix-Up.

5
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,308
Write Love with Eraser.

6
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:22,991
Yeah!

7
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:30,991
My Love Mix-Up, or Write Love with Eraser in Thai.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,599
“Eraser” serves as the theme of the story here.

00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,515
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
“Eraser” serves as the theme of the story here.

10
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:33,752
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

11
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:36,889
So I was thinking, “What can erasers write, in terms of love?”
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,748
So I was thinking, “What can erasers write, in terms of love?”

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,498
In reality, erasers are supposed to erase things, right?

14
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:42,209
But we wanted to use it to write something.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,999
Everything in this series happens because of this.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,114
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
Everything in this series happens because of this.

17
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:47,974
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

18
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:49,114
Not my fist.
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

19
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:49,740
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,570
It’s an eraser.
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:50,680
It’s an eraser.

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,998
This eraser has a magical power that can help you with your love wish.

23
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,559
It’s Japanese tradition.

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:57,820
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)
It’s Japanese tradition.

25
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:57,834
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

26
00:00:57,835 --> 00:00:59,609
It’s their well-known belief.
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

27
00:00:59,610 --> 00:00:59,652
It’s their well-known belief.

28
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:05,503
If you like someone, write down their name, nickname or first name, on an eraser and use it up.

29
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:09,284
The more you use it, the better your chances of getting close to them.

30
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:13,526
When you use it up, they will fall in love with you and you’ll become a couple.

31
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:14,839
Atom is an 11 grader.

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,116
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
Atom is an 11 grader.

33
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:15,337
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

34
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:18,709
He falls in love with a girl named Mudmee.
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

35
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,730
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

36
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:20,806
Mudmee has a very lovely personality,

37
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:26,659
and Atom thinks she’s right for him.

38
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:29,222
Thus, he intends to pursue her.

39
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:32,790
One day, Mudmee is taking an exam and hands me her eraser.

40
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:38,092
But I see that there’s the name “Kongthap” on it.

41
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:42,301
I suddenly think Mudmee likes Kongthap.

42
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:43,719
Then Atom drops the eraser.

43
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:43,916
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
Then Atom drops the eraser.

44
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:44,175
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

45
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:45,409
I pick it up and see my name on it.
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

46
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,079
I pick it up and see my name on it.

47
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:50,034
And I think Atom is the one who wrote it down.

48
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:55,507
I’m not happy with that so I plan to get rid of Kongthap.

49
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,747
But as the plan goes, I get to know more about him

50
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:02,804
and realize I’m not a good match for Mudmee.

51
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:05,888
I think Mudmee should be with someone better than me.

52
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:11,323
So I try to help match them up, Mudmee and Kongthap.

53
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,689
Why did you take a peek at my eraser?

54
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:16,448
I didn’t take a peek. You made it too obvious.

55
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,313
Mudmee likes Kongthap, not me.

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,307
So I’m heartbroken right on the first day of school.

57
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,516
The series title ‘Mix-Up’ says it all.

58
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:28,476
Everything is a mix and a mess.

59
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,984
The storyline is pretty chaotic.

60
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:34,241
It’s about people who have their crushes.

61
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:38,902
But it’d be too simple if two people secretly liked each other and then went out, right?

62
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:43,165
So there’s a love triangle and some other things involved.

63
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:48,199
Besides, My Love Mix-Up, Write Love with Eraser isn’t just about erasers.

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,837
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)
Besides, My Love Mix-Up, Write Love with Eraser isn’t just about erasers.

65
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:48,861
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

66
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:53,241
When I first heard the title, I thought of its double meaning.
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

67
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:53,258
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

68
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:53,970
I thought of people in love but too afraid to say it.
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

69
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,919
I thought of people in love but too afraid to say it.

70
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:59,311
They are too scared to confess it.

71
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,830
It’s like using an eraser to write a confession.

72
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:03,830
No matter how hard you try, it’s invisible to the person you like.

73
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:11,920
In this series, I play the character named Atom.

74
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,310
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
In this series, I play the character named Atom.

75
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:13,330
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

76
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,569
Atom is a bit dorky.

77
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:17,847
He can’t do anything.

78
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,408
He doesn’t excel at anything.

79
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:20,993
He lacks leadership skills.

80
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,983
He, however, is cartoon-like, super energetic and all.

81
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:28,700
When he’s upset, he’s overly upset.

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
When he’s sad, he’s overly sad.

83
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,935
When he’s happy, he’s overly happy. Something like that.

84
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:34,970
He’s just very expressive.

85
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,479
Atom is full of energy. He’s an ultimate optimist.

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,860
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
Atom is full of energy. He’s an ultimate optimist.

87
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:37,880
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

88
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:38,730
He loves his friends.
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

89
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:40,617
He loves his friends.

90
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:41,944
He’s lively and lovely.

91
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,808
He’s a dork. When he blushes, it’s all over his face.

92
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,636
He just super overreacts.

93
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:53,414
Atom is eager to sacrifice anything for love.

94
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,156
He does anything for love.

95
00:03:56,487 --> 00:04:00,205
Atom is a classmate who sits next to me in grade 11.

96
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:03,375
He’s like a male version of Mudmee.

97
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:07,207
We’re both quite timid and dorky.

98
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:08,558
So we get along pretty well.

99
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,670
When I’m with him on set, it’s like I see myself in a different look.

100
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:18,057
We think alike. Our speaking rhythm is similar.

101
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:20,019
Everything just clicks and it’s probably because we’re the same type of people.

102
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:23,826
Apart from that, there’s one more similarity between Atom and Mudmee.

103
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:25,716
Atom is very animated.

104
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:29,038
He’s like a character walking out of a manga.

105
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,301
We’re both like characters walking hand in hand out of a manga.

106
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,038
We react so expressively.

107
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,449
We get startled so easily—that sort of thing.

108
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,208
Something is wrong with my arm.

109
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:39,120
What is?

110
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,052
It’s missing your arm.

111
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:40,360
Let’s walk together arm in arm.

112
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,148
(WALK ARM IN ARM.)
Let’s walk together arm in arm.

113
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,410
(WALK ARM IN ARM.)

114
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:43,360
Fourth has those sides to him sometimes; clueless but vibrant.

115
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:45,289
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
Fourth has those sides to him sometimes; clueless but vibrant.

116
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,206
Fourth has those sides to him sometimes; clueless but vibrant.

117
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:53,616
But behind the scenes, given what I mostly see, he’s pretty cool and composed.

118
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,812
When he played Atom, he had to build up his energy.

119
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,754
Sometimes we shot so early in the morning,

120
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:02,274
so he had to boost his energy and uphold his character.

121
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:03,744
I truly admire that.

122
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,771
Fresh veggie energy when rehearsing.

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,781
(FRESH VEGETABLE ENERGY!)

124
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:09,089
Wilted veggie energy when shooting.
(FRESH VEGETABLE ENERGY!)

125
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,900
Wilted veggie energy when shooting.

126
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:11,477
The sun withers it.

127
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:16,079
Yes. Yes. Yes.

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,126
(RISING STAR DANCER.)
Yes. Yes. Yes.

129
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:18,610
(RISING STAR DANCER.)

130
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:19,480
Atom is the complete opposite of Fourth.

131
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,729
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
Atom is the complete opposite of Fourth.

132
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:21,809
Atom is the complete opposite of Fourth.

133
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,371
Therefore, I instructed Fourth to get used to being loud.

134
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,436
“Hey, you’ll need lots of body movements so how about you go running or workout?”

135
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,694
“Try talking loudly.”

136
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:38,679
Those are things he must train in order for his character to kick in.

137
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,249
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
Those are things he must train in order for his character to kick in.

138
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,413
Those are things he must train in order for his character to kick in.

139
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:43,639
I think this is one of the most challenging roles for me.

140
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,449
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
I think this is one of the most challenging roles for me.

141
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,525
I think this is one of the most challenging roles for me.

142
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,710
I'd like to present my own perception of the character.

143
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:52,525
I want to establish a unique Thai version of him.

144
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,907
So I bear the fans’ expectations.

145
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,206
I feel pressured as I want to make this character fun.

146
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,637
I want everyone to fall in love with this character.

147
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:10,840
Kongthap is collected, calm, and straightforward.

148
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:12,249
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
Kongthap is collected, calm, and straightforward.

149
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,391
Kongthap is collected, calm, and straightforward.

150
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,391
He doesn’t express much.

151
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:21,165
But he is a generous guy.

152
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,766
He’s nice and optimistic.

153
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,599
He’s me but in a cool version.

154
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,620
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
He’s me but in a cool version.

155
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:29,730
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

156
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,590
But not a lot of people see that.

157
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:33,627
I don’t see this version of me much either.

158
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,039
To me, Gemini and Kongthap are the complete opposite.

159
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,649
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)
To me, Gemini and Kongthap are the complete opposite.

160
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:37,725
To me, Gemini and Kongthap are the complete opposite.

161
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:42,620
Gemini is a bubbly happy guy who plays a calm guy.

162
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:45,592
Kongthap is reserved.

163
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,498
He doesn’t try to be, though.

164
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:49,337
It’s who he really is.

165
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:53,883
He doesn't talk much. Instead, he thinks a lot.

166
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,396
So that makes him quite composed.

167
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,679
I really admire him.

168
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,702
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)
I really admire him.

00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:57,068
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)

170
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,969
Gemini is talented.
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)

171
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,080
Gemini is talented.

172
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:00,809
Behind the scenes, he’s a different person.

173
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,412
In the scenes, he switches back.

174
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:09,607
Gemini…

175
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:13,242
We all know that he’s extremely energetic.

176
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,640
He’s a nuthead.

177
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,399

He’s a nuthead.

179
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:16,492

(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

182
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:21,900
So what I told him to do was tone down his energy

183
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,611
and be more calm and cool.

184
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:29,476
He, many times, delivers magic moments.

185
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:33,947
He truly makes me think “Wow, this is Kongthap.”

186
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,647
He comes the closest to the image in my head.

187
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,458
(Ready?)

188
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:49,705
Don’t ruin my hair.

189
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:56,406
You can check the playback.

190
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,755
I stuck out my neck like this.

191
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,454
Right.

192
00:07:58,466 --> 00:07:59,198
I got a stiff neck.

193
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:00,996
And tight lips.

194
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,162
(SOMEONE IS TIGHT-LIPPED.)

195
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:02,290
No, not tight lips.
(SOMEONE IS TIGHT-LIPPED.)

196
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,923
No, not tight lips.

197
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:03,461
Soft lips.

198
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,117
Aww!!

199
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:09,639
Collaborating with Gemini once again is nice.

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,769
Working together is easy.
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

205
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:15,790
Working together is easy.

206
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:17,444
We connect easily.

207
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,978
We know what the other person will say and what his rhythm is.

208
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:25,932
I feel at ease when we read lines and play scenes together.

209
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:27,021
It’s very easy.

210
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,104
There’s no icebreaking needed

211
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:32,338
because we see each other every day.

212
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,792
We know each other’s style of acting.

213
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,019
We know what we both want

214
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,465
just by looking into each other’s eyes.

215
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:39,548
What do you want from me, bro?

216
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:46,845
So that was the icebreaking activity between Gemini and Fourth.

217
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:47,406
Not true.

218
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,200
We’ve known each other for years.

219
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,170
(THEY’VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS.)
We’ve known each other for years.

220
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:49,267
We’ve known each other for years.

221
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,959
Mudmee is the only female main character here.

222
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,159
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)
Mudmee is the only female main character here.

223
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,328
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

224
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,052
She has many different aspects.
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

225
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,011
But mainly, I feel like she’s a character in a manga.

226
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,006
She’s very comic-like.

227
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:16,769
She can be cute, angry, shy, deep, and many other things.

228
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:19,898
You will see those sides of her in each episode of the series.

229
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:22,655
Mudmee is like a Japanese girl.

230
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,495
From what we know, Japanese people are known to be polite and modest.

231
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:29,418
That’s the vibes Mudmee gives.

232
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:32,185
Her character is very sincere.

233
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,017
She always wants to help people out.

234
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:35,960
I think Mudmee is quite a charming character.

235
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,089
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)
I think Mudmee is quite a charming character.

236
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,532
I think Mudmee is quite a charming character.

237
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:40,917
She has different sides to herself.

238
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:46,208
She is smart and determined.

239
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:50,753
However, outside her safe zone where there are people she doesn’t know,

240
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,162
she becomes shy.

241
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:57,129
She might be cute on the outside,

242
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:59,906
but she’s very tough on the inside.

243
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,359
I first fall in love with Mudmee because of her kindness and generosity.

244
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,289
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
I first fall in love with Mudmee because of her kindness and generosity.

245
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,412
I first fall in love with Mudmee because of her kindness and generosity.

246
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:08,729
Like when we take an exam, she hands me her eraser.

247
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:11,314
She also gives me many other things.

248
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:15,388
That’s why Atom feels something for her and falls for her.

249
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:19,317
Mudmee has faith in love, just like Atom does.

250
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:25,358
She is willing to work hard for someone she likes.

251
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:28,729
That’s why they get along so well and become friends.

252
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,401
If we’re to analyze Mudmee’s character, she’s quite like Atom.

253
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:34,825
She’s a female version of Atom.

254
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,911
They’re both timid, overthinking, and wimpy.

255
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:43,047
Mudmee is nice and sweet.

256
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,759
But I've heard from those around me that I'm pretty gutsy.

(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

259
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,750
My and Mudmee’s personalities are different.

260
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:51,378
I have to adjust my facade as well as my inner attitude.

261
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:54,803
Mudmee is sweet and cute.

262
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,944
However, Pahn is ballsy.

263
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,903
Because we had to play close friends,

264
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:03,350
I learned that Pahn is a competent girl.

265
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:04,916
She did her homework seriously.

266
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:05,560
I saw her script.

267
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,407
(MUDMEE’S / PAHN-THITTA)
I saw her script.

268

(MUDMEE’S / PAHN-THITTA)

269
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,889
She would jot down little something on every page.

She would jot down little something on every page.

271
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:16,227
That made me glad to have worked with someone who gave her best to this series.

272
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:20,117
Every scene with Pahn was easy because she did her homework.

273
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,218
She memorized all her lines.

274
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,639
Sometimes I felt guilty seeing how hard she did her homework.

(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)

278

She’s incredibly detail-oriented.

279
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:32,114
For instance, the instructor asked us to describe our character.

280
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,606
The others wrote down one or two lines.

281
00:11:35,021 --> 00:11:38,407
P’Pahn wrote, like, 20 lines.

282
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:39,858
She’s so in detail.

283
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,128
It’s a wonder to have Pahn as Mudmee.

284
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:45,470
We did lots of casting for this character.

285
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:51,479
We wanted a girl who delivered the right chemistry in a BL series, someone the audience would love,

286
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,789
someone the audience would root for.

287
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:53,999
We called lots of people in for casting and we finally found Pahn.

290
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:57,738
Hello, everyone.

291
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:03,603
This is the very opening scene of Mudmee in My Love Mix-Up.

292
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:11,399
This is not just my first series, it’s my first anything in showbiz.

This is not just my first series, it’s my first anything in showbiz.

This is not just my first series, it’s my first anything in showbiz.

295
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:19,154
I’ve never worked on a filming set with so many staff before.

296
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:24,449
It’s challenging because, as I said, I don’t play myself.

297
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,292
I have to tune in a lot.

298
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:30,946
In the beginning, I had to learn to become Mudmee

299
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,190
when they needed me in front of the camera.

300
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,980
Pahn is a wonder girl.

301
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:39,009
It’s the first time she’s ever acted...

302
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,476
but her working process is like a pro.

303
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,607
She did her homework on her script and character.

304
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,159
She always asked how this character should be,

305
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,049

She always asked how this character should be,

307
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:54,350
how she should portray it, or how she should speak.

308
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:58,975
My workflow with Pahn was so smooth

309
00:12:59,018 --> 00:12:59,920
that I sometimes forgot that it’s her first project.

326

He’s like a personal counselor for Atom.

He always helps out with this and that,

328

including love issues.

329
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,082

He’s always in a good mood.

332

He’s chill.

333
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,987
However, his carelessness sometimes causes him to expect others to behave similarly.

334
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,279
Half has his own interjection that goes “Hmm!”

Half has his own interjection that goes “Hmm!”

336
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,098
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

337
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,307
and then he will scratch his head.
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

338
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:04,409
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

339
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,818
He’s smiley and straightforward.

340
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:09,619
He’s one lovely character.

341
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:11,479
Actually, he doesn’t think too much about things.

342
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,780
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)
Actually, he doesn’t think too much about things.

343
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:12,796
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)

344
00:14:12,797 --> 00:14:14,691
Just like me.
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)

345
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:18,421
What we have in common is our playful nature.

346
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:21,104
We’re both playful and funny.

347
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,766
I’ll teach you guys how to solve this.

348
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,319
So this number is divided by this number, right?

349
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,040
(MR. CHOKUN THE TEACHER.)
So this number is divided by this number, right?

350
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,057
(MR. CHOKUN THE TEACHER.)

351
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:32,010
Close your eyes and pick your choice.
(MR. CHOKUN THE TEACHER.)

352
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,538
Close your eyes and pick your choice.

353
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:33,683
It’s B.

354
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:35,346
(Clever.)

355
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,619
Chokun and Half?

356
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:41,987
I think he gets to play a character that resembles himself.

357
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:44,227
Half likes to mess around.

358
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,575
I don’t know if it’s intentional or not.

359
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:50,427
Chokun messes around too, but intentionally, I’m sure.

360
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:54,644
Overall, he’s just whimsical and playful.

361
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:57,168
He likes to tease and prank.

362
00:14:57,183 --> 00:15:00,709
I don’t know if he tries to keep his character or if it’s just who he really is.

363
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,698
I think he is a lovely kid.

364
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,966
He can play Half quite perfectly

365
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:07,574
because Half and Chokun share some similarities.

366
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,958
Chokun is quite a chatter.

367
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:14,543
He resembles Half in that sense.

368
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:15,435
How are you feeling today?

369
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:19,204
I’m glad and excited to play scenes with you.

370
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:21,520
Watch and learn, bro.

371
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:21,876
(AND SUDDENLY, HE’S A PRO.)
Watch and learn, bro.

372
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,010
(AND SUDDENLY, HE’S A PRO.)

373
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,279
Working with Chokun?

374
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,463
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
Working with Chokun?

375
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:24,478
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

376
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,829
He’s new. He’s a brand new newbie.
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

377
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:25,865
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

378
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:29,307
Everything is new to him.
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

379
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:29,330
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

380
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,744
But what’s good about him is that he’s just like Pahn.

381
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,900
He is determined.

382
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,702
He did his homework. He studied his script.

383
00:15:37,864 --> 00:15:38,759
He analyzed it.

384
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:45,524
And he tried his best to be perfect in portraying his character.

385
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:49,740
I must thank him for his attempt to fight.

386
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:56,007
There were a number of tough scenes but Chokun managed ot meet the standards.

387
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,810
(NAPPING COMFORTABLY.)

388
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,650
(AND SHE GETS SHY.)

389
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,697
There are many supporting characters in the series,

390
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:22,815
one of them is Khao-pan, played by Aungpao.

391
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,719
Khao-pan is Kongthap’s close friend from middle school.

392
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,489
(Aungpao, Ochiris As  Khao-pan)
Khao-pan is Kongthap’s close friend from middle school.

393
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,299
Khao-pan is Kongthap’s close friend from middle school.

394
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,593
Now they are in high school and still tight.

395
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:34,212
However, they’re in different classes.

396
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,354
They will get to meet at basketball practice

397
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:39,731
since Khao-pan captains the basketball team that Kongthap joins.

398
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:41,199
Each scene with Khao-pan was tiring

399
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,986
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
Each scene with Khao-pan was tiring

400
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:42,090
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

401
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:43,891
because I had to play basketball every time.
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

402
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:45,806
Khao-pan is Kongthap’s counselor.

403
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,805
He’s like my supporter.

404
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:53,230
He’s my wingman when it comes to love.

405
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:56,193
When there’s a love issue, I go to Khao-pan.

406
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,413
He’s a good adviser.

407
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,919
Khao-pan is reliable. He loves his friends.

408
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,733
(Aungpao, Ochiris As  Khao-pan)
Khao-pan is reliable. He loves his friends.

409
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:02,050
He has lots of friends and his friends also love him.
(Aungpao, Ochiris As  Khao-pan)

410
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:06,400
He has lots of friends and his friends also love him.

411
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,772
He’s with leadership qualities.

412
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,983
If Kongthap is the brain, Khao-pan is the mouth.

413
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,320
Kongthap is a calm thinker. He doesn’t talk much.

414
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:17,544
While Khao-pan knows what Kongthap thinks and speaks for him.

415
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:20,659
Sometimes, I’m the person he turns to when there’s trouble.

416
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:23,109
Kongthap doesn’t really talk, right?

417
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:29,020
So we must have a talkative character to balance that.

418
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,899
Then I saw Aungpao’s acting in Cooking Crush...

419
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:34,360
and liked it so much.

420
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,963
This crazy kid never stopped talking.

421
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:39,356
He rambled on and on.

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,470
I knew I wanted to work with him.

423
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:44,449
He’s charming when he talks.

424
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,408
He’s so chatty but cute.

425
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:48,173
It's odd.

426
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:53,184
I've never met someone who spoke so much, yet I wanted to listen.

427
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,910
Aungpao has a passion for working.

428
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,055
He’s one talented person.

429
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,194
He’s with high potential. I like that about him.

430
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:05,871
Whenever I saw him after shooting, I’d offer him a ride home.

431
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:09,074
Then we got to talking, and I discovered he’s a very lovely kid.

432
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:10,087
Let’s do this.

433
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,640
You stand over there.

434
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,113
(AUNGPAO IS BEING TEASED.)
You stand over there.

435
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:12,460
(AUNGPAO IS BEING TEASED.)

436
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,370
I’ll throw a dart.
(AUNGPAO IS BEING TEASED.)

437
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,822
Graze my earlobe?

438
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,901
I’ll go through your part here. It goes, “Vroom!”

439
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:20,221
Can you graze my earlobe instead?

440
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:21,043
You want it that way?

441
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:21,624
Sure.

442
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,409
Now stand there.

443
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:29,039
To me, the classmates are one of the highlights of the series.

444
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,752
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)
To me, the classmates are one of the highlights of the series.

445
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:30,772
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

446
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:31,570
Every time we shot the classroom scene, the fun added up
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

447
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:36,093
Every time we shot the classroom scene, the fun added up

448
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,854
because each one of them had their own character.

449
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,401
It’s chaotic but happy and memorable.

450
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:46,729
They made me think that if I had these fun people in my high school class,

451
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,071
I’d remember them until my last day.

452
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:51,882
It should have been great fun and very pleasant.

453
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,165
Mr. Suea is both a homeroom teacher for these 11 graders

454
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,443
and a basketball club supervisor.

455
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,689
Mr. Suea is our basketball coach, played by P’Na.

456
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:17,634
I’m Mr. Suea, the homeroom teacher and basketball coach.

457
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:21,440
Mr. Suea is a PE teacher, which I think P’Na fits perfectly.

458
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:24,304
P’Na enjoys talking.

459
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,522
He always talks about sports and asks me to play golf with him.

460
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,107
He’s a man with lots of experience.

461
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:36,027
When we eat together, he always tells me stories.

462
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:39,809
Na has the PE teacher’s energy.

463
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,512
He’s an MC who speaks loud and clear.

464
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:49,222
So I said to him, “Hey, join my series. I’d like to work with you.”

465
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:50,377
“I want your energy on screen.”

466
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:51,388
Hi guys.

467
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,829
This is what’s happening behind the scenes.

468
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,663
Our filming crew on the minibus.

469
00:19:57,756 --> 00:20:02,300
And then we have Papang as Mr. Annop.

470
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,925
He will appear when the kids reach 12th grade.

471
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:15,797
Mr. Annop will become their homeroom teacher in 12th grade.

472
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,867
Mr. Annop understands children.

473
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,258
He’s kind and optimistic.

474
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,312
When students come to him, of course, it isn’t about education.

475
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:26,710
It’s love.

476
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,981
I’ve known P’Papang before this.

477
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,816
We hang out together and stuff. We’re already close.

478
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:34,502
Now we’re working together.

479
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:36,928
I’m happy to collaborate with you, big bro.

480
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:42,238
Kongthap’s mom?

481
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,259
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

482
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,263
I’m not close to her in the series.
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

483
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:45,330
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

484
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:45,970
I want to grow up on my own and don’t feel the need to rely on her.
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

485
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:49,978
I want to grow up on my own and don’t feel the need to rely on her.

486
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:55,289
I shut her out most of the time. So, we’re not close.

487
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,274
P’Kratae?

488
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,261
She’s very pretty.

489
00:20:57,278 --> 00:21:01,264
She always gave me advice when we had scenes together.

490
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,333
She made me feel loosened up and at ease while filming.

491
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:09,770
I usually feel tense when I have scenes with elders

492
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,126
because the age gap is quite large and they’re seasoned performers.

493
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,509
I’m so happy to have worked with P’Lin

494
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:31,415
because I always learn something from highly experienced performers.

495
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:35,799
Atom’s mom is a bit strict, so he’s intimidated by her a little.

496
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,131
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
Atom’s mom is a bit strict, so he’s intimidated by her a little.

497
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:37,151
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

498
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,649
Nonetheless, she’s warm and he can come to her about everything
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

499
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,895
Nonetheless, she’s warm and he can come to her about everything

500
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:43,953
except love issues.

501
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,150
Atom is too afraid to talk to her about love.

502
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,734
He’d talk to his friends instead.

503
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:49,684
(P’Lin, how do you feel about your son here?)

504
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:50,582
He’s cute.

505
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,019
So cute.

506
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:54,086
Are you happy with that, son?

507
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,040
It’s our first scene together today.

508
00:21:56,576 --> 00:22:00,235
He works hard and portrays the loveliness of his character very well.

509
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:04,825
I am amazed by the development of these two; Fourth and Gemini.

510
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,567
They had scenes with highly experienced performers

511
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:19,261
but could hold the situations and blend in so well with them.

512
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,920
I was truly impressed.

513
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,377
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
I was truly impressed.

514
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:20,387
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

515
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:22,129
And those pro actresses were so kind for helping them a lot.
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

516
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,192
And those pro actresses were so kind for helping them a lot.

517
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:26,481
They advised them and conveyed their emotions

518
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:31,524
so well that the kids could reach the expectations and the right emotions.

519
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:35,708
I’m thankful to those two for helping out our young actors.

520
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:50,244
My Love Mix-Up is a manga that was later made into a series.

521
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,398
So, everyone already had the pictures.

522
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,816
When we had to adapt to a Thai version,

523
00:22:55,314 --> 00:23:00,732
I must admit I felt more pressured than when I worked on my previous projects.

524
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:06,326
When I learned it was a remake of a manga,

525
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:07,598
I felt kind of pressured.

526
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:09,403
But I’m glad to play this character.

527
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,579
It’s a new challenge for me.

528
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:15,153
Once I knew I was gonna play a part in this series,

529
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,149
I was quite stressed.

530
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:22,629
Then I was at the read-through with P’Au and the other cast members.

531
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:24,819
After the read-through, P’Au came to me and said,

532
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,212
“Fourth, this one is going to be a bit tough for you.”

533
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:30,055
The story is pretty much told through me.

534
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:32,544
90% of the story is told by Atom.

535
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,664
I told him to be prepared

536
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:37,101
because this series isn’t a piece of cake.

537
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:45,177
In terms of a more complexed acting and a character that’s not him at all.

538
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:47,459
It’s tiring and very tough.

539
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:50,455
However, I’m willing to be tired

540
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:56,246
because I want the fans to watch a good quality series.

541
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:58,793
I want them to enjoy the series.

542
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:02,701
So, yeah, I did my homework and worked hard on set for a great outcome.

543
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:09,227
This re-collaboration with Gemini and Fourth is harder than before

544
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:16,774
because this time, lots of audience and fans anticipate seeing the series.

545
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,875
That kind of puts pressure on me

546
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:24,658
and reminds me I must do my best for this project to meet everyone’s expectations.

547
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,852
The mood and tone are going to be different than My School President for sure.

548
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:31,486
You have to look at Atom as well.

549
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,102
Sure thing.

550
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:36,093
So that you see he’s going up to the rooftop.

551
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,626
Yes, sir.

552
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:37,839
So that’s the definition of a good director.

553
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,235
(HARD-WORKING DIRECTOR.)
So that’s the definition of a good director.

554
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,010
(HARD-WORKING DIRECTOR.)

555
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:40,120
This is the second time I’ve worked with P’Au.

556
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:42,423
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
This is the second time I’ve worked with P’Au.

557
00:24:42,424 --> 00:24:42,434
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

558
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:44,356
I’m happy every time I work with him.

559
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:44,370
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

560
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:45,050
He’s a very lovely director.
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

561
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,388
He’s a very lovely director.

562
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:49,808
I like his style of working.

563
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:51,206
He doesn’t make his actors stressed.

564
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:52,372
Everyone enjoys it.

565
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,720
We always talk things out and exchange opinions.

566
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:57,823
“Hey, I think this is not yet on point. I think this should be adjusted.”

567
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:59,024
He always says that to us.

568
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,981
I like that about him so much.

569
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:07,470
I can see he really put his best effort into making this series.

570
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:11,862
And he had to get it done in a short period.

571
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:15,349
It’s something that weighed on him and on me as well.

572
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:18,587
But he could work well under that pressure.

573
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:19,578
He’s awesome.

574
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:22,673
He even acts with his hands. Look at him.

575
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:24,407
Gemini is doing so great in his storyline.

576
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:26,050
(A BIG PRAISER.)

577
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:27,000
This second time working with P’Au,

578
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,129
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
This second time working with P’Au,

579
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,193
This second time working with P’Au,

580
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:30,703
I already knew his style of working.

581
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:33,500
When he says he wants this, I know how I should deliver it.

582
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:36,025
But this one is more difficult than My School President

583
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,458
as my and Atom’s characters are so much different.

584
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,302
So P’Au is more strict about it, accordingly.

585
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,959
No way in hell! I can’t get over this!

586
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,890
(GIVING IT HIS ALL.)

587
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:47,429
Easy there.

588
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:49,429
Do you get it? You must throw yourself on the bed.

589
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,743
Our director is so dedicated.

590
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:53,307
He is.

591
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,756
P’Au is pretty chill,

592
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,398
but when it’s time to get serious, he gets serious.

593
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:02,138
He’s a good director and advisor.

594
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:04,224
He guides me in my acting and suggests new things always.

595
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,980
P’Au…

596
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:10,803
When he instructed me or proposed changes, we communicated effectively.

597
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,630
He gave me clear pictures of what he wanted or how he wanted it to be.

598
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:20,218
With that being said, he gave us the freedom to design our characters as well,

599
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:22,406
design the picture we wanted to portray.

600
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,978
(New way of directing a series.)

601
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:27,005
Yes, a new way.

602
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,070

(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

607
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,689
Now that it’s adapted to the Thai series,

608
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,260
we added some Thai characteristics to it,

609
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,676
bringing different flavors to the show

610
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:57,651
and I’m sure you can relate to every character and its storyline.

611
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,617
We all went through high school and our teenage years.

612
00:27:02,803 --> 00:27:08,006
This series is going to bring you back to high school life.

613
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:10,404
Though it’s an adapted Thai version,

614
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,319
we chose the location that gave us some Japanese elements.

615
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,380
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
we chose the location that gave us some Japanese elements.

(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

617
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:20,166
And that is Sriracha.
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

618
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:20,170
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)

619
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:29,049
It’s an industrial city where lots of Japanese people come to work and reside.

620
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:35,305
That is why its culture is a combination of Thai and Japanese.

621
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:45,823
Wherever we go, we always see something that reminds us of Japan.

622
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:50,132
Therefore, Sriracha was chosen to be the main setting for this series.

623
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:53,864
If you’ve been there, you’ll know the city has mountains and seas.

624
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,624
So the name of the school should explain the geography of the place.

625
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:04,831
That’s why we named it Keerinsamutr School.

626
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:08,710
Keerin means mountains and Samutr means ocean.

627
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:10,745
That’s the meaning behind it.

628
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:15,476
The setting of our school is in Sriracha district, Chonburi province,

629
00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:16,449
which is my hometown.

630
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:17,000
I’m not from Sriracha specifically but I’m from Chonburi.

631
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:18,605

I’m not from Sriracha specifically but I’m from Chonburi.

(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)

633
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:21,225
We actually filmed there to make it realistic.

634
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,944
When we step out of the school, we’ll see the city's sights.

635
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:30,271
When friends gather, they do so at city landmarks.

636
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:35,802
Be it a mountain, a river, or a beach.

637
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:39,098
I’d like to encourage everyone to watch it because these locations are gorgeous.

638
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:40,800
I’m not advertising my hometown or anything.

639
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:43,953
We filmed the series in Sriracha.

640
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:47,026
So I got to see new places I’d never been to before.

641
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,199
I feel like I should visit those places again.

642
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,559
This series will be promoting our soft power.

(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

646
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:58,863
I think P’Au carefully handpicked Sriracha.

647
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:02,401
There are lots of stunning places in the city.

648
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:06,060
You might want to visit those places after watching the series.

649
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,402
There might be some places you know I’ve been to before.

650
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,796
You can visit and enjoy it.

651
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,828
(Is there anything you wanna say to your director?)

652
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:14,593
He chose the location so well.

653
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,084
There are tons of fruit flies here.

654
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:20,821
I don’t mind walking, but the fruit flies prevent us from filming.

655
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,204
- They fly into your mouth when you speak.
- They attack us.

656
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:27,604
Guys, I found a way to get rid of the fruit flies.

657
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,349
You can’t stay still otherwise they’ll bother you.

658
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,632
We must go on a ride.

659
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:31,916
Let’s go, bro.

660
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,195
We also add some Thai elements to the series,

661
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,730
for example, food, clothes, and music.

662
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:47,679
You will clearly see what Thai stuff we added to it.

663
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,889
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
You will clearly see what Thai stuff we added to it.

664
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,429
You will clearly see what Thai stuff we added to it.

665
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:58,946
We attempt to combine and blend Japanese and Thai concepts in one show effectively.

666
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:14,703
Aside from the characters of the actual characters,

667
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:16,911
the character of the location is also essential.

668
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:21,609
From time to time, we choose the setting as our protagonist,

669
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:24,190
in addition to the actual performers.

670
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:27,812
And one of the highlight locations is the school rooftop.

671
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:33,316
The rooftop is the place Atom likes to visit.

672
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:36,316
When he gets stressed out, he goes to the rooftop and vent.

673
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:41,064
When he’s in love or whatever he feels, he will just express it on the rooftop.

674
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,505
If you see Atom and the rooftop, you know something is happening.

675
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:49,206
Something urges him to go there.

676
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:56,880
Any scenes on the rooftop are tough.

677
00:30:56,905 --> 00:31:00,244
The rooftop is an important location in the series.

678
00:31:00,265 --> 00:31:03,302
However, Thailand's weather is not the same as in Japan.

679
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,695
It’s hot here.

680
00:31:04,716 --> 00:31:07,927
And the sun extremely burns.

681
00:31:08,057 --> 00:31:10,701
It made our job procedure more challenging.

682
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,056
Apart from the climate, which we cannot control,

683
00:31:15,592 --> 00:31:18,759
there was also noise disruption.

684
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:25,171
That’s because this school is located near a temple and an industrial factory.

685
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:27,630
Sometimes we would hear chanting from the temple.

686
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:31,062
Sometimes we would hear live music from the factory,

687
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,434
which was hosting an employee party.

688
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:35,387
We couldn’t film under that condition.

689
00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:38,547
If we stay quiet, we can hear folk music in the distance.

690
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,432
So we need to go home.
(GEMINI IS JUST HAVING SO MUCH FUN.)

691
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:42,050
(GEMINI IS JUST HAVING SO MUCH FUN.)

692
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:45,071
We were about to film a scene where…

693
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:51,704
It was always fun to film on the rooftop of the school.

694
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,585
I ran all the way here from home.

695
00:31:58,202 --> 00:31:58,860
Hold on.

696
00:31:59,409 --> 00:31:59,983
Wait.

697
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,785
Come on.

698
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:03,086
Don’t do this to me.

699
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:09,070
The next challenging location is the camp out of town.

700
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,360
We are here in Nakhon Nayok.

701
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,050
Yeah!

702
00:32:15,196 --> 00:32:17,521
So we had to go to camp in the series.

703
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:21,320
I’m not talking about a beautiful beach or anything.

704
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:23,583
It’s a brutal camp.

705
00:32:23,595 --> 00:32:29,379
The first thing I had to do there was lie down on the ground full of rocks at noon.

706
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,848
The team wanted the shot from different angles so it’s pretty hot for me.

707
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:36,790
Fourth and I must do a number of activities together.

708
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,231
This is like a real Boy Scout camp.

709
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:41,092
My Girl Scout camp was a lot milder than this.

710
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:43,178
I volunteer.

711
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:44,090
I volunteer.

712
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,530
(THIS IS HILARIOUS.)

713
00:32:46,735 --> 00:32:47,417
I volunteer.

714
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:51,852
I wanted them to have similar experiences as they would at a genuine scout camp.

715
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:59,809
So the place I chose was outfitted with actual obstacle setups.

716
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:01,578
Go.

717
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:03,578
Go on, man.

718
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:09,951
I want to cry.

719
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:10,947
(Are you scared?)

720
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:12,443
(Have you tried this before?)

721
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:13,981
I have. It was fun.

722
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,153
Are you still having fun now?

723
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:16,416
But we’re pretty messy here.

724
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:17,592
It’s the fun part.

725
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,999
Honestly, I didn’t think the obstacles would be that tough.

726
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,050
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)
Honestly, I didn’t think the obstacles would be that tough.

727
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,496
I thought they were gonna be like a children's camp,

728
00:33:22,508 --> 00:33:24,807
or a kids' playground or something.

729
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:25,927
Mild and easy

730
00:33:25,944 --> 00:33:27,615
But once I saw it, I thought, “Whoa, this is not right.”

731
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,978
We had to climb a 4-5 meters tall net.

732
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,792
It was tougher than the camp I went to in high school.

733
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:35,646
So in that last scene, I had to cheer for Atom.

734
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:39,821
He had to climb that to the top

735
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,363
and he would get scared.

736
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:45,129
So I encouraged him, “Calm down. Take it easy.”

737
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:48,246
But once the director said cut, I went, “All right. Stay there. Goodbye.”

738
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,999
That camp has been the most difficult part of my acting career.

739
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,731
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
That camp has been the most difficult part of my acting career.

740
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:54,770
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

741
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,276
I had to go through the woods and obstacles for love.

742
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:04,083
My character is usually a loser and too timid to do anything.

743
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:07,978
But there, I was told to crawl on the floor or climb trees,

744
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,413
and many other things.

745
00:34:10,472 --> 00:34:13,289
I was tired, but I had fun.

746
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:16,695
It's an experience I’ll never forget.

747
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:20,662
Please stay tuned for this scene because it’s one of the most fun scenes.

748
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:23,975
There is one more scene I’d like to proudly present.

749
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:25,832
The sports day scene.

750
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:32,935
We recruited lots of extras for the scene.

751
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:34,354
More than 100 people.

752
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:37,784
Just to create a realistic-looking sports day.

753
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:40,049
We also asked the actors to play sports for real.

754
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:42,507
Badminton, volleyball, and basketball.

755
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:46,905
They had to go through some workshops to learn how to play sports

756
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,619
before filming this scene.

757
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:52,880
Oops! I’m so sorry.

758
00:34:58,395 --> 00:34:59,260
And that’s a wrap.

759
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:00,793
Done by me.

760
00:35:01,157 --> 00:35:01,880
The series covers a wide range of sports.

761
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:03,644
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
The series covers a wide range of sports.

762
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:03,650
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

763
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,508
There are mostly badminton, basketball, and volleyball.

764
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:11,397
And there’s also a tug of war, running, and many more.

765
00:35:11,414 --> 00:35:14,970
But I was okay with that because I’m an athlete.

766
00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:18,072
However, I wasn’t much of a basketball player before.

767
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:20,713
I had played only a few times.

768
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:24,704
So this was about the longest basketball I’ve ever played.

769
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:28,351
I had to be able to compete with the real players on the court.

770
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,439
There was a scene where we went to a different school to compete.

771
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,799
(Aungpao, Ochiris As  Khao-pan)
There was a scene where we went to a different school to compete.

(Aungpao, Ochiris As  Khao-pan)

773
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:37,049
We’re on the school team, right?
(Aungpao, Ochiris As  Khao-pan)

774
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,756
We’re on the school team, right?

775
00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:44,298
And those who played our competitors were real basketball players.

776
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:47,664
I had to crane my neck to look at them.

777
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:49,865
And they ran so fast.

778
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:52,806
I was like, “Bros, this is a show, not an Olympics.”

779
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:53,915
“Can you take it easy?”

780
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:55,977
But we fought.

781
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,372
We put up a fight for the best pictures on camera.

782
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:03,797
I’m okay.

783
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:05,130
(How’s your rival team?)

784
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,599
Look at him.

785
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:12,318
He’s, like, 30 cm taller than me.

786
00:36:13,193 --> 00:36:16,214
We experienced a problem while filming a sports day scene.

787
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:20,079
Of more than 10 cues we’d shot, we’d never had a problem with the rain before.

791
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:23,806
But that day, suddenly it was pouring.

792
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:30,910
We couldn’t film. We had to gather our equipment and run for shelter.

793
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,652
It’s raining, guys.

794
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:35,228
No, it’s not. It can’t be.

795
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:36,404
Fourth is coming!

796
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:40,898
We intended not to film during the rainy season, but it rained regardless.

797
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:45,350
We had to wait until it was over and started filming the scene again.

798
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:54,508
There’s another scene where you’ll see beautiful cinematography.

799
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,101
It was shot at Hua Lamphong Railway Station.

800
00:36:58,123 --> 00:36:59,977
The place where the characters live isn’t the capital city.

801
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,338
So when they want to come to Bangkok, they have to take the train.

802
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:06,511
The stories happen in Sriracha.

803
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:11,186
So there is a scene where the characters have to travel to Bangkok for some reason.

804
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,978
So we chose to go with the classic and lovely transportation of Thailand.

805
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,411
The train.

00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,210

When they’re together, it’s chaotic.

 Just know that I’m a real deal, dear

00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,821
 But I’m having the flu again

816
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:03,713
 Because I woke up early and it’s about to rain

817
00:38:03,753 --> 00:38:04,473
 Yo!

818
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:05,470

827
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:20,141
Thailand is cold.

828
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,169
I feel cold in my heart… Shit!

829
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:25,977
I dodged just in time.

830
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,972

00:38:35,477 --> 00:38:38,590
If I had a friend who’s been working with me for a long time,

838
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:40,504
I believe the vibes would be similar.

839
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:42,107
They seem happy together.

840
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,090
(AWW!!)

841
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,849
The series' OST includes songs sung by Fourth, Gemini, and them combined.

(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
The series' OST includes songs sung by Fourth, Gemini, and them combined.

843
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:11,643
The series' OST includes songs sung by Fourth, Gemini, and them combined.

844
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:14,886
These three songs are different.

845
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:19,224
The first one to be released is called ‘Re-move On’.

846
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:20,985
Sung by both of them.

847
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:26,845
It’s the kind of song we don’t get to hear much from these two.

848
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:28,472
It’s fun and upbeat.

849
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:34,437
We made the song to fit the storyline

850
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:39,322
and the characters in the series.

851
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:42,972
Give it a shot and see how cute this song is.

852
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
So for the Thai version of the My Love Mix-Up,

853
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:58,689
(Kornprom Niyomsil - Director)
So for the Thai version of the My Love Mix-Up,

854
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,076
So for the Thai version of the My Love Mix-Up,

855
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:05,181
I’d like to encourage the fans to watch it and embrace new flavors.

856
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:10,682
Each actor, actress, and staff member worked hard

857
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,401
and with attention to detail.

858
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,704
What I expect the audience to get after watching each episode is,

859
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:22,653
the same as my previous projects, happiness.

860
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,694
You’ll go to bed smiling and have a good dream.

861
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:27,717
That’s the ultimate goal of making a series for me.

862
00:40:28,214 --> 00:40:32,765
I hope the audience is happy after each episode ends.

863
00:40:33,043 --> 00:40:36,803
Please tune into My Love Mix-Up.

864
00:40:37,073 --> 00:40:42,798
My Love Mix-Up not only provides entertainment, comedy, and romance,

865
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:50,276
but also inspires viewers to be brave enough to reveal their feelings to someone they like.

866
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:51,559
Let’s find out together if Mudmee’s love wish that she wrote down on her eraser will be granted.

867
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,330
(Pahn, Pathitta As  Mudmee)
Let’s find out together if Mudmee’s love wish that she wrote down on her eraser will be granted.

868
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:59,032
What I think the audience will get from watching this series is,

869
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:00,624
first of all, the fun.

870
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:02,080
Of course. That’s for sure.

871
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:09,219
And this series will take you back to the time when you were in school and had a secret crush on someone.

872
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:15,296
It might give the courage to someone who is still hesitant if they should confess.

873
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:19,119
In the first episodes, Half might be blunt and straightforward,

874
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,789
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)
In the first episodes, Half might be blunt and straightforward,

875
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:26,568
but I’d like you guys to keep watching and see that he isn’t that bad.
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)

876
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:26,570
(Chokun, Puttipong As  Half)

877
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:27,640
Please tune into this series.

878
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,564
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)
Please tune into this series.

879
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:28,579
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

880
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,049
What it will give the audience for certain is the fun.
(Gemini, Norawit As  Kongthap)

881
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,919
What it will give the audience for certain is the fun.

882
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:36,312
That’s the first.

883
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:41,464
But then there are scenes about family, love, and friends.

884
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:43,689
I can’t say what they are right now, but I’d like you to stay tuned for it.

885
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:44,959
The fun is guaranteed.

886
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,074
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)
The fun is guaranteed.

887
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:45,446
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

888
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:47,780
I believe the series will turn out so great
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

889
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:48,490
because everyone worked so hard on it.
(Fourth, Nattawat As  Atom)

890
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,489
because everyone worked so hard on it.

891
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:51,382
You might even get some thoughts from it.

892
00:41:51,402 --> 00:41:56,021
It probably seems like a series to watch for entertainment, but it’s not only that.

893
00:41:56,043 --> 00:42:01,461
I think Atom has taught me a lot about love.

894
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,595
If you watch it, I’m sure you will fall in love with this character.

895
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:06,851
Okay.

896
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,461
And that’s a wrap.

897
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:11,378
Yeah!

898
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:12,762
Thank you.

899
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,932
Thank you so much.

900
00:42:17,572 --> 00:42:19,085
I’ll see you guys.

901
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:20,217
See you.

902
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:20,955
Yeah. Bye-bye.

903
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,705
"For generations, humans have sought out

904
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:25,130
tricks to make their longing for love a reality."

"One popular trick is to write down

907
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,586
your crush's name on an eraser."

908
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,608
I'm sorry, Mudmee.

909
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:35,430
The one you like, I like him too.

910
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:36,144
What?

911
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,095
Hey, what are you doing?

912
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:38,150
Ouch.

913
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,304
I'll be helping you from now on, Atom.

914
00:42:41,613 --> 00:42:43,046
Kindly advise me, Coach.

915
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,177
THE MISUNDERSTANDING HE WANTS TO ERASE

916
00:42:45,178 --> 00:42:45,850
You have to use your eraser more often, Atom.
THE MISUNDERSTANDING HE WANTS TO ERASE

917
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:48,199
You have to use your eraser more often, Atom.

918
00:42:48,243 --> 00:42:49,817
The more you use,

919
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,652
the closer you'll get to the one you like.

920
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,050
BUT THE MORE HE ERASES, THE DEEPER HE FALLS

921
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,603
Oh!

922
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:02,526
Don't tell me you think he's cute, as in romantically.

923
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:04,099
Aw!

924
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:06,827
Can you wait for my answer?

925
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,638
I want to know more about you first, Atom.

926
00:43:08,925 --> 00:43:10,541
I'm starting to like you for real.

927
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,109
- Atom.
- Oh.

928
00:43:20,955 --> 00:43:21,910
Were you listening to me?

929
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:23,603
Who would be able to focus?

930
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:26,517
I'm in the room with someone I just confessed to.

931
00:43:26,831 --> 00:43:28,517
I'm allowed to get nervous, okay?

932
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:30,271
I've been told that

933
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:32,854
when we like someone, it triggers serotonin,

934
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:35,424
giving us butterflies in the stomach.

935
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:38,606
Would you...

936
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:40,834
go out with me?

937
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:42,107
What?

938
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,170
FROM A MEGAHIT MANGA IN JAPAN

939
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:48,810
Take it easy.

940
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:50,255
Don't look down.

941
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,979
It just felt weird when I learned that

942
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,679
Atom wouldn't attend school in Bangkok with me.

943
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:09,569
- I don't want this train to leave the platform.
- I don't want this train to leave the platform.

944
00:44:15,596 --> 00:44:16,538
I...

945
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,009
I've been having a crush on you, Half.

946
00:44:19,435 --> 00:44:19,981
What?

947
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:24,680
Why did you slap me, Mudmee?

948
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:27,512
At least I know that

949
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,060
love isn't always bad

950
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:31,808
if we find the right one.

951
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:33,808
The right one.

952
00:44:35,993 --> 00:44:38,513
You've always been the one to make the first move.

953
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:41,978
This time, let me be the one to do that.

954
00:44:50,726 --> 00:44:51,773
I’ll see you…

955
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:53,436
next week!
