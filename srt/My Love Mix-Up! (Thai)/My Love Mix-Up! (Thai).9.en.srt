1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,200
You have completed the course Erase to Get Love.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,040
There’s one more thing left.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,200
What?

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,400
That.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,000
When should people in a relationship have their first kiss?

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,280
The first kiss isn’t about when, but about why.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,440
Guys want to be with someone they can protect,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,400
not muscular females who protect them.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,720
The Mudmee I know is strong and protective of others.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,279
I totally like that about you.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,480
All these times, I’ve always thought about when we should have our first kiss.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
But as long as it’s you, Atom,

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,600
it doesn’t matter when or where.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,040
Hi.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,000
What are you looking at?

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,280
Our new seat allocation.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,200
The teacher has just assigned us.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,320
Wait.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,440
I need time to prepare myself.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,720
If we get separated again this year, we’re done for.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,160
(...Half, Kongthap…)
(...Mudmee, Atom…)

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,560
Yes, we’re sitting close to each other.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,640
Yes!

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,640
We’re sitting close to each other.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,680
Right, we are.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,080
Mudmee.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
This year is going to be great

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,240
because I get to sit next to you too.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,000
This year is not great.

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,280
It totally sucks.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,920
What’s wrong?

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,000
Why did you go over to the dark side?

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
I’m sorry.

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,400
I got carried away.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,480
It’s Half.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
What did he do?

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,120
I know you two went on dates together during school break.

38
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,760
Did something happen?

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,880
The problem is

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,040
nothing happened.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,720
Mudmee.

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
I’ve got a confession to make.

43
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,880
I like…

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,960
like…

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,840
I like…

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,000
the snack you’re holding.

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,680
Can I have a bite?

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,240
Mudmee.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,640
Would you…

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,640
Yes?

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,520
to be…

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
LYKN’s fangirl?

53
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,840
I love them.

54
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,920
Can we play their music while snacking?

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,720
I hope you don’t mind.

56
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
What a dumb stunt he pulled.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,920
Right?

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,320
We have been talking for about a year now,

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
yet he’s never asked me to be his girlfriend.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,040
Maybe, I haven’t used the eraser enough.

61
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,440
Hold on, Atom.

62
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,920
(..thap)

63
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Mudmee, I think you’ve used it a lot already.

64
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,440
Yeah?

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,920
I might need to use it more.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,000
Welcome to the final phase of high school life.

67
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,200
This year, I’ll be your homeroom teacher.

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,400
I hope the seating arrangement works in your favor.

69
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,080
Now, I’m going to hand out the aptitude test so that I know what your goal is.

70
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,560
Here.

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,200
(It’s my last year.)

72
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,760
(It’s time to answer this question, finally.)

73
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,640
So which faculty did you write down?

74
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,920
Me?

75
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I wrote…

76
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,320
‘Any faculty that can make me rich.’

77
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,240
Huh?

78
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,960
What?

79
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,280
Was it supposed to be a joke?

80
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
It’s not a joke.

81
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,560
I just couldn’t think of one.

82
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,480
As if you guys know what you're enrolling in.

83
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
I’m applying for Veterinary Medicine.

84
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,360
So that I can take care of Mommam too.

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,960
I’ve always wanted to be a doctor since I was a kid.

86
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,360
The class's cameraman like me is, of course, applying for Communication Arts.

87
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,200
How?

88
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
How did you guys figure it out?

89
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
I want to know mine too.

90
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,720
That’s alright.

91
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,480
You still have time.

92
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
Take your time to think.

93
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
You will find out.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,640
You can do it.

95
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,640
Let’s eat.

96
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,480
The restaurant?

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,920
I haven’t decided yet.

98
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,040
Yeah, sure.

99
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,000
I’ll look into it.

100
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,760
Mm.

101
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Who was that?

102
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,040
Khao-pan.

103
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,000
He’s looking for a place for a birthday party next week.

104
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,360
Yeah?

105
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,400
His birthday is next week?

106
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,680
No, it’s mine.

107
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,640
What?

108
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,320
Hey. Why didn’t you tell me?

109
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,560
It’s no big deal.

110
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,280
It’s just a birthday.

111
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,920
It’s not just a birthday.

112
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,920
There’s no day more important than your birthday.

113
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,480
There are tons.

114
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,000
Like…

115
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,640
The day we have to turn in our Biology assignment.

116
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
Let’s go back to class and finish it.

117
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Come on.

118
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,600
This Friday, our Astronomy Club is hosting a meteor shower watch party on the rooftop.

119
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,600
You guys can join.

120
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,280
Half?

121
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,680
Hm?

122
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,680
This activity is interesting.

123
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,320
Let’s go together.

124
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,280
Please.

125
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,280
Okay then.

126
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,160
Should we ask Kongthap and Atom to come along?

127
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,320
Those two seem quite busy these days.

128
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,080
Maybe it’s better if just the two of us go.

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why do you want it to be just the two of us?

130
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,920
Well…

131
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,320
I…

132
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Well…

133
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,280
It’s…

134
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,160
I…

135
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,000
Is it because you…

136
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,120
are having a fight with Atom?

137
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,720
That’s for sure.

138
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,520
It’s not that, Half.

139
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
I can’t even afford to take him out for a decent meal.

140
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,040
Atom.

141
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
What are you doing, son?

142
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
Reviewing my financial account, Mom.

143
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,200
Speaking of which,

144
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,080
can I get my money in advance?

145
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,440
What do you need the money for?

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
For a gift.

147
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,880
For who?

148
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,840
For…

149
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,640
It’s a gift for the New Year’s exchange gift activity.

150
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,120
But on second thought, I don’t need it right now.

151
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,640
It’s still months away.

152
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,360
Are you sure?

153
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,160
I am.

154
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,760
I’m gonna go take a shower.

155
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,560
(The Faculty Student Is Interested in Applying To)

156
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,920
(Any faculty that can make me rich.)

157
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,880
Any faculty that can make me rich?

158
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,240
You heard about the Astronomy Club activity?

159
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,240
Would you like to watch the shooting stars with me?

160
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
I’m serious.

161
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
Please at least think about it.

162
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,960
What was that?

163
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,400
Ah.

164
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,800
That junior was asking me to watch the shooting stars with him.

165
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Is he a junior from your club?

166
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,200
No.

167
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,000
I’ve never met him before.

168
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
He asked out of nowhere.

169
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,240
Took me by surprise.

170
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Do you wanna go?

171
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,520
Hm?

172
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,960
If you prefer to go with him, you can do that.

173
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,400
I’m okay.

174
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,160
Why would you say that?

175
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Did I say something wrong?

176
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,480
He did ask you to watch the shooting stars with him.

177
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,640
Right.

178
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,080
You’re not wrong.

179
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,400
It’s wrong of me to want to go places with you alone.

180
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,160
But from now on, I won’t ask you to go anywhere with me.

181
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,480
Your main duties are taking orders, serving, and cleaning tables.

182
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,360
Can you handle that?

183
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,120
I can.

184
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Thank you for helping out today.

185
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,040
Right timing. My employee happens to be on leave.

186
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,320
I should be the one thanking you, Sin.

187
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,000
If not you, I don’t know who else to turn to.

188
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,680
No worries. I understand.

189
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,440
I used to work part-time to save up for Nop’s present too.

190
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,240
No wonder why you are my idol, Sin.

191
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,400
Why don’t you try the kitchen hand position?

192
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,400
It pays better than a server.

193
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,120
Well, I’m not very good around the kitchen.

194
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,120
I better not do it.

195
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,880
Why not?

196
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,600
If you’ll excuse me, I need to go take orders.

197
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Hi. What would you like to order?

198
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,760
Did you get some sleep?

199
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,480
Hi, Mudmee.

200
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,359
Would you like to have lunch with us?

201
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,200
All of us.

202
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,280
I was about to ask you the same thing at first,

203
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,280
but I’ve changed my mind.

204
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,240
I’ll go with Tan.

205
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,680
Half.

206
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,280
What are you two fighting about?

207
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,600
Nothing.

208
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,240
It’s just that a junior asked Mudmee to watch the shooting stars with him.

209
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,080
So you got jealous and started a fight?

210
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
No.

211
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,279
I told her she could go with him.

212
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,200
It’s no big deal.

213
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,160
Damn it.

214
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,120
Half, why would you say that to her?

215
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,960
Someone just hit on your girlfriend, dude.

216
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,960
That’s the point. I’m not her boyfriend.

217
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,440
What could I have done?

218
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,120
And what are you waiting for?

219
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,960
Hm?

220
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,520
I’m not talking to you.

221
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,600
Kongthap.

222
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,240
I feel bad for Mudmee for being attracted to someone like Half.

223
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,640
Let them be.

224
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,520
We must let them deal with certain situations on their own.

225
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,520
What are you reading?

226
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,160
Ah.

227
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,320
It’s Sin’s instructions for getting the diner ready to open.

228
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,120
Sin is quite caring, huh?

229
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,840
Hey.

230
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,680
It’s nothing.

231
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,640
He just wants a smooth workflow.

232
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,960
What about you?

233
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,160
How have you been?

234
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
Same old stuff.

235
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,840
After basketball practice, I go home to study.

236
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:27,360
Is there anything specific that has caught your interest or something you want?

237
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
Trying to get a clue for my birthday present?

238
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,920
No!

239
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,120
I wasn’t sure at first, but I am now.

240
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
It’s fine. You don’t have to buy me anything.

241
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,840
Come on. It’s your birthday.

242
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,920
Of course, I have to prepare something special for you.

243
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,840
You being here with me is the most special present ever.

244
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,720
No.

245
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,280
I’ll get you a present no matter what.

246
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,560
And you won’t be able to reject it.

247
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,680
Happy 18th birthday, son.

248
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,840
You’re a grown man now.

249
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,480
Thank you.

250
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,080
Dad sent you a present. It should take a while to get here.

251
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,760
He said he’d call when he got time.

252
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,120
Yes, Mom.

253
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,680
By the way, have you chosen the faculty that you’ll apply to?

254
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,560
I’m thinking Veterinary Medicine.

255
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,800
Hold on.

256
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,320
There’s no Faculty of Veterinary Medicine here in Sriracha.

257
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Does it mean you have to go to Bangkok to study?

258
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,920
That’s right.

259
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,000
So you have to live far away from me too.

260
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
Dad is away.

261
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,560
You will be away as well.

262
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,720
I won’t be that far.

263
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Sriracha and Bangkok are only two hours apart.

264
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,200
Thap, if we are to be far apart from each other,

265
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,200
we should talk more.

266
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,560
So that when we’re not together, we won’t be lonely.

267
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,280
What do you think?

268
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,200
You can talk to me about anything.

269
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,600
Sure, Mom.

270
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,880
Dude, I’m your customer.

271
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,640
My bad.

272
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,280
I didn’t see you.

273
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
You’re ignoring me too?

274
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,000
I barely have anyone left.

275
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,280
If you don’t want to be ignored, apologize to Mudmee.

276
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,160
What should I apologize for?

277
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,320
I’m not her boyfriend.

278
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,320
I can’t be jealous.

279
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,760
Half, you know it isn’t just about that.

280
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,360
If you don’t want to get serious, just let her go.

281
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,960
Sin, hello.

282
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,480
Atom, a customer called this morning to book the place for a birthday party.

283
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,400
Will you hang the lights for me?

284
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes, of course.

285
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,360
Atom told me the story.

286
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,000
Having a fight with your girlfriend?

287
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
She’s not my girlfriend.

288
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
No?

289
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,480
Then why are you sitting here alone looking sad?

290
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
You like her too, don’t you?

291
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Why don’t you tell her honestly?

292
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
I guess I’m just afraid.

293
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Afraid of what?

294
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,040
She has changed a lot for me.

295
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,200
Atom has, too.

296
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,720
He usually gets scared so easily.

297
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,960
But he is willing to work in a place full of people.

298
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,120
Everyone is dedicated to someone they love.

299
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,680
That’s why I’m afraid I won’t be able to match what she’s done for me.

300
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
We can’t measure anything like this, can we?

301
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,400
Just because that piece of cake is bigger doesn’t mean it tastes better.

302
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:20,200
To me, a relationship is about two people having good feelings for each other.

303
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,520
That’s all it takes, isn’t it?

304
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,520
You’re right.

305
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,960
I gotta go.

306
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,880
Thank you so much.

307
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,320
Thank you.

308
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,880
Hope to see you again.

309
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,840
Thank you.

310
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,760
Oh. He left?

311
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,520
He did.

312
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,560
I guess the birthday party is here.

313
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,400
Hi, guys. Welcome.

314
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,560
Hey.

315
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,320
Hey, Atom.

316
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
You said we would celebrate after work.

317
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,760
I’m celebrating with my friends first.

318
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,000
Your outfit today is cute by the way.

319
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,320
Ah…

320
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,480
Don’t change the subject.

321
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,240
Go celebrate with your friends for now.

322
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,760
We’ll talk once I get off work.

323
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,960
See you.

324
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,880
Sure.

325
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,360
Any problem with the lights?

326
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,280
Kongthap, my friend.

327
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,000
You chose this place because you wanted to see your boyfriend, yeah?

328
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,800
No.

329
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,800
(Meteor Shower)

330
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,360
I’m signing in the wrong column.

331
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,800
Let me find my correction fluid real quick.

332
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,760
Where is it?

333
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,800
(...thap)

334
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,360
Did you come alone?

335
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,400
Would you like a company watching the stars?

336
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,280
It’s wrong of me to want to go places with you alone.

337
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,960
But from now on, I won’t ask you to go anywhere with me.

338
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,000
Go wherever you want and let’s not see each other again!

339
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,400
Hey, junior.

340
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,160
Where’s Mudmee?

341
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,800
She left.

342
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,720
She came, whined about something, and left.

343
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,880
Where is it?

344
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,880
Did it fall into the drain?

345
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,040
Mudmee.

346
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,040
Found it.

347
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,080
Let me see.

348
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,400
It’s a rock, Namkaeng.

349
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,760
Look closely.

350
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,720
The eraser has the word ‘thap’ on it.

351
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,040
An eraser with the name of a loser? Probably best thrown away.

352
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,840
I was thinking the same at first, Tan.

353
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,160
But now that I think of it again, Half isn’t at fault.

354
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Are you returning to liking him?

355
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,560
I do like him, but his feelings should take priority.

356
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,440
All this time, I've only thought about myself.

357
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:38,800
I don't care how Half feels or whether he's uncomfortable.

358
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,880
I think it’s time

359
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,680
to really let him go.

360
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,520
Excuse me.

361
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,240
Hello.

362
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
I’ll keep looking.

363
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,200
Okay.

364
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,040
Toon called.

365
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,680
I’m sorry, but I need to go back up.

366
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,680
It’s fine. You can go.

367
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,680
Namkaeng, you too.

368
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,200
Are you sure?

369
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,880
I will stay here for a bit.

370
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,160
I’ll see you up there.

371
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,480
Thanks a lot.

372
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,080
It should be around here.

373
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,160
Looking for this?

374
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,960
I want to let you know that

375
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
I’ve never felt forced.

376
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:20,240
All of my actions were done willingly for you, Mudmee.

377
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,200
I…

378
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,640
I’m not a romantic.

379
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,280
I can’t make cupcakes.

380
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,280
I can’t even serve food.

381
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,920
And I always say harsh things to you.

382
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,560
Now that you know all about me, will you still accept me?

383
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,200
Half.

384
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,000
Everything you mentioned, I have known for so long.

385
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,320
Yeah?

386
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,360
If you have known, why do you still choose me?

387
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,280
Do things like this need a reason?

388
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,480
I like you for who you are, Half.

389
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,400
Mudmee.

390
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,400
Yes?

391
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,600
Mudmee.

392
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,800
Hm?

393
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,360
A shooting star.

394
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,600
Where?

395
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,240
You’re right.

396
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,080
It’s pretty.

397
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,840
I like you, Mudmee.

398
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,680
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

399
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,960
Yes.

400
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,640
I would.

401
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,040
Aw, don’t cry.

402
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,720
Beautiful, aren’t they?

403
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah.

404
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,040
But not as beautiful as you.

405
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:03,595
Ouch!

406
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,515
Gosh.

407
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:21,515
Hey!

408
00:38:22,915 --> 00:38:24,035
Are you okay, Sin?

409
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:26,515
Just a little accident.

410
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:30,755
I don’t think I can cook today.

411
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,115
Would you do it instead?

412
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:36,635
I can’t.

413
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:38,915
It won’t be that hard.

414
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:40,675
All the ingredients are prepared.

415
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:41,875
I will stand by and instruct you.

416
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:50,682
It’s…

417
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:57,762
When I was a kid, I was making fried rice for the first time.

418
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,962
I almost burned the house down.

419
00:39:01,762 --> 00:39:03,722
My mom came to the rescue.

420
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:08,882
She got burned. It caused scars all over her body.

421
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:12,762
I’ve never cooked again since.

422
00:39:14,362 --> 00:39:18,322
I’m scared someone will get hurt.

423
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:21,882
I knew it.

424
00:39:22,122 --> 00:39:25,442
That explains why you were tensed up at the Home Economics Club.

425
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:30,962
I’m sorry, Sin.

426
00:39:32,722 --> 00:39:33,602
It’s all good.

427
00:39:34,962 --> 00:39:39,442
I’ll tell them to find a new venue for their birthday party.

428
00:39:39,802 --> 00:39:41,402
I really can’t tonight.

429
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:49,922
Wait.

430
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:53,482
Do you really think I can do it?

431
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:57,482
I do.

432
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:07,482
It’s an important day for your important person.

433
00:40:07,962 --> 00:40:09,202
I won’t let it fail.

434
00:40:16,442 --> 00:40:18,442
Why didn’t you tell me?

435
00:40:19,442 --> 00:40:21,082
It’s not just a birthday.

436
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:24,362
There’s no day more important than your birthday.

437
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:29,322
You being here with me is the most special present ever.

438
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:42,402
Cut it.

439
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:51,762
Keep stirring. Don’t let it get burnt.

440
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,442
That’s right.

441
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,202
Be careful. it’s hot.

442
00:41:12,562 --> 00:41:13,322
It’s good.

443
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:28,562
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

444
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:32,202
It’s fine. The food is worth it.

445
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:32,722
Right?

446
00:41:32,762 --> 00:41:34,002
I agree.

447
00:41:35,642 --> 00:41:36,242
Want some chicken?

448
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:42,922
Kongthap.

449
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:45,322
How is it?

450
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:46,682
Good.

451
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:47,922
Why?

452
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:53,162
I got into a little accident so Atom stepped in as a chef.

453
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:58,802
The chef was a bit nervous, but he did his best for the birthday boy.

454
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:03,202
Wow. I never knew Atom is such a good cook.

455
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:04,762
Make me something sometime.

456
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:08,202
Hey!

457
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,242
You’ve got yours.

458
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:11,402
Did you make that?

459
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:12,642
Yes.

460
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:15,602
Soup?

461
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:16,762
Stop asking questions.

462
00:42:18,722 --> 00:42:19,642
Hey.

463
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:21,642
Stop.

464
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:22,882
Your friends are looking.

465
00:42:23,122 --> 00:42:25,042
I’ll cook something for you next time.

466
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:42,722
We’re done with the food.

467
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:46,042
It’s time for dessert, the highlight of the day.

468
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,042
Uh…

469
00:42:48,962 --> 00:42:51,602
You aren’t making me do it, are you?

470
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:52,802
Not entirely.

471
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,362
The cake has been baked.

472
00:42:54,882 --> 00:42:56,522
Only the decoration is needed.

473
00:43:07,442 --> 00:43:10,722
I don’t really know how to do it.

474
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,962
It’s all fine as long as you pour your heart into it.

475
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:21,842
I believe that, for Kongthap, no gorgeous cake can beat the one you make for him.

476
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:16,362
Happy birthday to you

477
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:21,522
Happy birthday to you

478
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:27,162
Happy birthday, happy birthday

479
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:33,802
Happy birthday to you

480
00:44:34,202 --> 00:44:35,602
Whoa.

481
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:38,281
Thank you so much.

482
00:44:38,282 --> 00:44:40,882
Kongthap, happy birthday.

483
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:51,642
I didn’t bake this cake. I just decorated it.

484
00:44:52,202 --> 00:44:53,882
Yeah, I can tell.

485
00:44:54,722 --> 00:44:56,202
Very cute though.

486
00:44:59,122 --> 00:45:01,122
You mean the cake or what?

487
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:07,602
You should make a wish now.

488
00:45:17,962 --> 00:45:18,842
Happy birthday.

489
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,762
Thank you so much.

490
00:45:20,162 --> 00:45:21,362
Happy birthday.

491
00:45:32,202 --> 00:45:33,402
I should get going.

492
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:34,442
Thanks a lot for coming.

493
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,202
Waiter, please take care of my friend here.

494
00:45:37,882 --> 00:45:38,522
Thanks.

495
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:39,482
Bye.

496
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,802
Oh, crap.

497
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:47,762
I hung up the lights to celebrate your birthday.

498
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:49,402
I forgot.

499
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:51,001
It’s okay. We still got time.

500
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:51,722
Really?

501
00:45:58,562 --> 00:45:59,322
Ready?

502
00:46:08,042 --> 00:46:08,602
What?

503
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:13,202
I spent so much time on this.

504
00:46:13,242 --> 00:46:14,202
Why won’t they turn on?

505
00:46:16,962 --> 00:46:17,722
That’s fine.

506
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:19,602
Let’s sit over here.

507
00:46:34,522 --> 00:46:36,002
I kept one piece of cake for you.

508
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:38,002
For me?

509
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:39,002
Mhm.

510
00:46:45,442 --> 00:46:46,082
Hey.

511
00:46:47,882 --> 00:46:49,882
Did you keep the one with the carrot on purpose?

512
00:47:08,842 --> 00:47:10,202
Is it good?

513
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:12,722
It is.

514
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:19,242
Kongthap.

515
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:20,362
Mhm.

516
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:29,002
Can you tell me what you wished for?

517
00:47:30,362 --> 00:47:32,362
I don't have anything I want at the moment,

518
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:37,002
so I wished for you to finally figure out what you want to study.

519
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:38,482
What?

520
00:47:39,562 --> 00:47:40,762
Not again.

521
00:47:41,682 --> 00:47:43,442
It’s your birthday.

522
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:45,682
Why did you make that wish for me?

523
00:47:47,762 --> 00:47:48,442
Huh?

524
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:02,402
Today, you seemed so happy about the food you cooked.

525
00:48:03,242 --> 00:48:08,682
Why don’t you explore food-related faculties?

526
00:48:09,322 --> 00:48:10,322
They should fit you.

527
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:14,642
Well.

528
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:23,362
Actually, when I was young,

529
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:31,642
I dreamed of owning a tiny dessert café.

530
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:39,482
But then I almost burned the house down while cooking.

531
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,842
My mom got burned.

532
00:48:45,602 --> 00:48:47,602
She has scars all over her body.

533
00:48:52,002 --> 00:49:00,762
You know, seeing my mom, whom I love, get hurt

534
00:49:02,162 --> 00:49:05,402
is so heartbreaking.

535
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:19,282
After that, I don’t dare to think about food ever.

536
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:29,722
Come on.

537
00:49:36,642 --> 00:49:41,202
But today you have proved that you’re not the same Atom.

538
00:49:43,322 --> 00:49:44,562
Stop blaming yourself.

539
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:46,122
Your mom isn’t angry with you.

540
00:49:46,962 --> 00:49:47,762
Trust me.

541
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:51,602
Yeah?

542
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:53,762
Here.

543
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:02,482
Thanks.

544
00:50:03,642 --> 00:50:07,922
But it’s your birthday today.

545
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:11,682
The party isn’t over yet.

546
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,362
The birthday boy hasn’t opened his present.

547
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:27,722
Here you go.

548
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:31,442
I told you you don’t have to.

549
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,082
Not so fast.

550
00:50:33,482 --> 00:50:34,722
Who said it was for you?

551
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:38,282
Here.

552
00:50:39,962 --> 00:50:41,562
I bought it for Mommam.

553
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:45,642
The present for Mommam.

554
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:48,922
But hold on.

555
00:50:49,322 --> 00:50:54,242
It’s a buy-one-get-one-free product, so Mommam’s servant gets one too.

556
00:50:55,882 --> 00:50:56,522
Look.

557
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:58,802
See?

558
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:01,202
Ta-da.

559
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:11,962
You can’t turn me down now because I bought it for Mommam.

560
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:15,162
You can still reject yours though.

561
00:51:17,682 --> 00:51:19,722
It’s for Mommam, but it has our names on it.

562
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:22,602
Yeah.

563
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:24,762
Try it on.

564
00:51:25,722 --> 00:51:26,442
Thanks.

565
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:36,842
All done.

566
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:42,762
Why isn’t it plugged in?

567
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:55,162
Hey!

568
00:52:46,322 --> 00:52:47,162
What are you doing?

569
00:52:48,922 --> 00:52:50,282
Don’t look at me.

570
00:52:51,722 --> 00:52:52,602
Look at the lights.

571
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,602
Sorry, I came home late.

572
00:53:42,122 --> 00:53:43,602
Do you like your shirt?

573
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,162
So did you have fun?

574
00:53:46,282 --> 00:53:47,482
I did, Mom.

575
00:53:48,082 --> 00:53:49,522
I’ve got you a present.

576
00:53:50,202 --> 00:53:51,442
I’ll put it right here.

577
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:52,362
Go take a shower first.

578
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,522
Thank you so much.

579
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:57,922
You don’t have to bring these upstairs for me. I’ll do it.

580
00:53:57,962 --> 00:53:58,802
Alright, then.

581
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:47,922
(Any faculty that can make me rich.)

582
00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:51,922
(Bachelor of Food Business)

583
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:21,242
I don't know if it's a little thing called love

584
00:55:21,282 --> 00:55:25,242
This feeling that's building up inside our hearts

585
00:55:25,282 --> 00:55:28,802
The little thing we shared that day

586
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:32,562
Started from nothing and grew in every way

587
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:35,562
As long as I have you by my side

588
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:39,482
No matter where this world takes us on a ride

589
00:55:39,522 --> 00:55:45,642
My arms will hold you tight

590
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:49,442
You’ve been on my mind

591
00:56:09,842 --> 00:56:11,602
We’re discussing an open house.

592
00:56:11,642 --> 00:56:13,682
I’m attending an open house too.

593
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:16,522
Why is your heart beating so loud?

594
00:56:16,562 --> 00:56:18,082
Don’t do this. Give it back.

595
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:19,082
What are you doing? Let go!

596
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:20,562
That’s my dad!

597
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:22,362
Who are you going to Bangkok with?

598
00:56:22,402 --> 00:56:23,322
A friend.

599
00:56:23,762 --> 00:56:24,522
Atom?

600
00:56:24,762 --> 00:56:27,962
If you really want to study in Bangkok, I’m okay with that.

601
00:56:29,362 --> 00:56:30,482
I’m sorry.

602
00:56:30,802 --> 00:56:34,082
I’m not afraid, as long as it’s you.

603
00:56:34,922 --> 00:56:38,042
I believe we will make it through.
