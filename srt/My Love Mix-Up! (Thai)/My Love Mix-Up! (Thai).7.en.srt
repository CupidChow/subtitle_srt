1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,470
I’ve liked you for so long.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,250
Sorry.

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,320
Are you sure you haven't confused me for someone else?

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,680
From now on, you’re going to know more about me.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,360
That smile.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,040
I remember it now.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,930
I’ve lost my passion.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,640
Once I reached out to grab their hand,

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,920
they pulled it away.

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,170
Does that mean I am heartbroken?

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,680
I got startled because I felt a static shock.

12
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,860
We should make contact with our clothes to discharge the electricity.

13
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,750
Then move down to a physical part.

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,680
Now we can hold hands.

15
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,090
Don’t let go until we’re home.

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,120
Whoever lets go first is the loser.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,250
There are many industrial estates in the city I live in.

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,110
The reason why many Japanese people reside here.

19
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,430
The city has the nickname Little Osaka.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,710
It contains some Japanese influences on our everyday lives,

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:05,190
including the belief that writing your crush's name on an eraser will bring you luck in love.

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,390
Who would have thought this belief would mess up my life big time?

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,440
I asked you two here to discuss the incident the other day.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,840
Oh.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,180
Mr. Annop.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,030
Hi.

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,190
Hello, sir.

28
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,520
Goodbye, sir.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,030
Hey.

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,470
I would like to know what’s going on with you two.

31
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,130
Well…

32
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,080
We are going out.

33
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,330
Did you hear that, ma’am?

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,450
Kongthap.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,360
Atom.

36
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,290
Mom.

37
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,470
Atom, I’m so disappointed in you.

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,810
Why are you being like this?

39
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,170
I command that you two break up right now.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,150
- No!!
- No!!

41
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,570
Then our moms will transfer us to different schools.

42
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,140
Cut off our communication.

43
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,900
And we will not get to meet again for the rest of our lives.

44
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,430
Is it gonna be that bad?

45
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,950
It sure is.

46
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,170
It’s not like every adult can accept it.

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,860
Shouldn’t Mr. Annop be able to?

48
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,640
Guys.

49
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,950
Mr. Annop wants to see you guys in his office.

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,890
There.

51
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,570
What kind of trouble did you get yourselves into?

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,370
What the heck?

53
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,990
Have a seat.

54
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,710
Why do you want to see us, sir?

55
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,520
Nothing much.

56
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,590
We met the other day.

57
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,840
Do you remember?

58
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,780
I do.

59
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,970
You guys…

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
We are just friends!

61
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:21,870
Huh?

62
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,400
What you saw,

63
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,110
us holding hands,

64
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,560
was because my leg hurt.

65
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,510
So…

66
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,310
he helped me walk.

67
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,310
By holding your hand?

68
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,970
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,790
Well, I…

70
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,330
I fell.

71
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,770
Yes, I fell.

72
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,950
So Kongthap grabbed my hand.

73
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,280
Is that right, friend?

74
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,090
Yes,

75
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,230
my dear friend.

76
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,700
Right.

77
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:09,200
I asked you two here because you dropped this towel.

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,500
That’s all.

79
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,900
You can go back to your class.

80
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,160
Yes, sir.

81
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,480
Thank heavens!

82
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,510
Do you think he knew we were lying?

83
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,340
I don’t think he did.

84
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,340
We were so smooth.

85
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,380
Hey.

86
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,900
We should keep our distance for now.

87
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,150
I do not want to raise any suspicions.

88
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:18,970
Yeah.

89
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:26,750
Oops.

90
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,900
Hey!

91
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,530
Shit.

92
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,320
That’s alright.

93
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:46,770
Right.

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,840
I’m sorry.

95
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,350
I wasn’t thinking.

96
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,100
Hey.

97
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,780
But today, it’s OK.

98
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,460
Can you feed me again?

99
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,230
Can I have one more?

100
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,580
One more, please.

101
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:54,970
Gosh.

102
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,970
Why am I always like this?

103
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,250
What are you doing here?

104
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,320
Oh.

105
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,700
Half.

106
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
What are these?

107
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,440
Valentine's Day is approaching.

108
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,960
So the Home Economics Club is voting on what to sell.

109
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,550
Valentine's Day is approaching, indeed.

110
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,070
When I think about Valentine's Day, chocolate comes to mind.

111
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,810
Chocolate?

112
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,120
So what kind of chocolate do you like, Half?

113
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,600
Chocolate cakes?

114
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,970
Chocolate bars?

115
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,520
Or stuffed chocolates?

116
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,810
I’ve had a lot of those.

117
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,350
Yeah?

118
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,080
This year, I want to try chocolate cupcakes.

119
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,370
Cupcakes?

120
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,570
Yes.

121
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
It’s my favorite.

122
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,120
Sure thing.

123
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,240
I will…

124
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,300
We, the Home Economics Club members, will make them.

125
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,010
People are gonna love them.

126
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,260
Thanks for helping me choose.

127
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,520
You’re welcome.

128
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,190
Atom.

129
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,110
This way.

130
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,920
Sure.

131
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,170
Home Economics Club is making something to sell on Valentine’s Day.

132
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,460
Can you help us choose?

133
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,760
I’ll give you some samples.

134
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,100
Dessert samples?

135
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,750
Yes.

136
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,320
Wow. It’s my dream job.

137
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,130
Can you help me choose which flower I should get Tan this year?

138
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,020
But you gave her flowers last year.

139
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,500
Why don’t you try something different this year?

140
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,140
Don’t.

141
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Don’t make too many things, Mudmee.

142
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,390
I think chocolate will do.

143
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,810
Good idea.

144
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,830
How about…

145
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,880
cookies?

146
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,660
No.

147
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,590
No, not that flower.

148
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,590
For Valentine's, it should be roses.

149
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,390
It can be any color.

150
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,040
It can’t.

151
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,910
Each dessert holds a different meaning.

152
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,190
Right?

153
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,710
Why is Atom so invested in this year’s Valentine’s Day?

154
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,670
That’s true.

155
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,220
You don’t usually take an interest in this kind of stuff.

156
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,470
Do you have a secret crush or what?

157
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,430
Aw.

158
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,750
Do you, Atom?

159
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
Atom, liking someone?

160
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,260
Listen up!

161
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,000
The camp photos are out.

162
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,470
Come and get your photo.

163
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,460
Come on.

164
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,460
Don’t take Toon’s photos.

165
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,680
(Keerin Samutr High School)

166
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,090
(Camp Activities)

167
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,230
What kind of chocolate do you like?

168
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,620
What about you?

169
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,590
What kind of flower do you like?

170
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,260
This kind of thing is all about the giver.

171
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,890
I agree with that.

172
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,950
Well then.

173
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,380
We’ll see how it goes.

174
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,880
The first thing we need to have is this.

175
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,520
Our cups.

176
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,520
Guys, this is Sin, our former club president.

177
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,200
He’s back to teach us an exclusive class.

178
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,660
We need water.

179
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
If you don’t use water, the chocolate will get burnt.

180
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,860
Dessert Prince.

181
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:44,040
His dessert café is extremely popular on the internet.

182
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,500
If you want to buy his dessert, you must order well in advance.

183
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,100
220 degrees.

184
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,100
The oven has been warmed up, top and bottom.

185
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,160
Here we go, The Chocolate Lava Cakes.

186
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,390
- Aw.
- Aw.

187
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,230
- They look so yummy.
- They look so yummy.

188
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,990
I smell something, but I can’t tell what it is.

189
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,999
It’s some kind of alcohol mixed with orange peel.

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,450
It gives a bit of bitterness.

191
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,630
Yes, yuzu mixed with rum.

192
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,960
How do you know?

193
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,210
You’re good.

194
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,390
Have you taken classes?

195
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,440
No.

196
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,440
I haven’t.

197
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,550
But I liked to sneakily eat sweet stuff as a kid when my mom wasn’t watching.

198
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
Me too.

199
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,280
Come on. I’ll teach you.

200
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,050
That’s okay. I just came for a dessert tasting.

201
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,350
It won’t be that hard.

202
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,290
Try it.

203
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,830
Let’s not waste such good sense.

204
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,750
Before we begin, picture the face of the person you are making it for.

205
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,440
Now, let’s get started.

206
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Atom!

207
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,030
You’re burning it.

208
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,320
Hey!

209
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,920
Atom!

210
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,150
It’s burning.

211
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,870
Shit!

212
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,070
Water!

213
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,980
Atom!

214
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,480
Atom!

215
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,310
Put it out?

216
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,920
Turn it off?

217
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,640
How?

218
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:54,568
Right there!

219
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,062
Turn it off.

220
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,700
It’s almost Valentine's Day.

221
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,510
I hope you people practice hard and don’t get distracted by nonsensical stuff.

222
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,150
But here is what I’ve heard.

223
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,040
One of us is secretly dating.

224
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,420
I will count to three.

225
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,300
The one that abandoned his teammates in favor of dating, step forward.

226
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,000
One, two, three.

227
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,150
Guys, I’m sorry.

228
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,550
And the punishment for someone who is dating is…

229
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,310
you can have a day off on Valentine’s Day.

230
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,900
Yeah!

231
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,700
My man is not single anymore.

232
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,030
Who is the girl? Introduce us.

233
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,150
She is from an all-girls school.

234
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,970
I’ll introduce you guys to her friends later.

235
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,020
Nice!

236
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,320
Guys.

237
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,210
I…

238
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,450
I’ve got something to say.

239
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:25,890
Have a seat.

240
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,240
Hey.

241
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,410
Do you want some cake?

242
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,310
The Home Economics club had a class yesterday.

243
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,780
Try it.

244
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,720
Did you make it yourself?

245
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,120
It looks good.

246
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,880
I agree.

247
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,640
But I didn’t make it.

248
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,470
The chef made it

249
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,440
after I almost burned their kitchen down.

250
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,320
It’s good.

251
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,260
Hey.

252
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,020
Remember when I said I wasn’t free on Valentine’s Day because I had basketball practice?

253
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,750
Yeah.

254
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,680
I said it was fine.

255
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,460
We can go on a date some other day.

256
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,530
What I'm saying is that I can take the day off on Valentine's.

257
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,800
Really?

258
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
Why did they let you go?

259
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,550
I told them I had a prior engagement on Valentine’s Day.

260
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,190
Hold on.

261
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,720
Did you tell them about us?

262
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,920
Hey.

263
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,340
I told you not to tell anyone.

264
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,180
I didn’t tell them about us.

265
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,190
I just told them there’s someone I’m talking to.

266
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
I didn’t tell them it was you.

267
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,360
Look.

268
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,380
From now on everyone will suspect us.

269
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,050
In the end, we will be caught.

270
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,470
Don’t you get it?

271
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,680
No, I don’t.

272
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,400
I have friends.

273
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,530
Why can’t I tell them?

274
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,310
Come on.

275
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,290
You know why.

276
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,600
Atom, are you embarrassed to be with me?

277
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,060
No, I’m not.

278
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,090
I don’t want problems.

279
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,600
Isn’t what we are facing right now already a problem?

280
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,120
Huh?

281
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,740
Alright.

282
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,770
Let’s end it here.

283
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,470
We’re not boyfriends anyway.

284
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,520
Atom.

285
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,830
I don’t get it.

286
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,750
It’s for the best to end things here.

287
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,680
Atom.

288
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,380
Hey, Atom.

289
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,450
Come here.

290
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,960
Can you help check?

291
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,220
I haven’t done this kind of cupcakes before.

292
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,470
Not sure if they are okay.

293
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,460
Please.

294
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,680
By the way, have you figured out what kind of cake you’re making for Kongthap?

295
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,090
I…

296
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,460
I don’t think I’m making it.

297
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,440
What?

298
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,680
Why not?

299
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,120
Atom.

300
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,070
It’s okay.

301
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,890
Block him.

302
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,620
Thap, what’s wrong?

303
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
Are you missing your Valentine so much you get distracted?

304
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,700
Thinking about where you’d go and what you’d eat on Valentine’s Day?

305
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,310
Damn. You are making us jealous.

306
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,160
Atom.

307
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,240
Here you are.

308
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,210
Are you rushing somewhere?

309
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,300
No, sir.

310
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,400
Can I talk to you for a moment?

311
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,410
There is a small problem with the aptitude test you did.

312
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,560
What is it, sir?

313
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,430
Please be frank here.

314
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,940
Did you choose what you really like?

315
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,960
Guys, there’s something I wanna tell you.

316
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,960
Many of them are in conflict with each other.

317
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
It seems like you're hesitant.

318
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,820
Actually, I’m not dating anyone.

319
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,480
I said that because I just wanted some time off on Valentine’s Day.

320
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,630
But…

321
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:52,900
my mom is happy that the results indicate that I fit the criteria for Engineering.

322
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,350
What about you? Are you happy?

323
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,150
I’m okay.

324
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,570
Are you sure?

325
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,680
You have to stick with it for a long time.

326
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,990
What should I do, sir?

327
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,210
Ask yourself again.

328
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,400
Don’t think for others.

329
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,600
Ask yourself what you really like.

330
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,470
Dad ordered this cake as a surprise for me.

331
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,120
How lovely. Wish he were here.

332
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,480
Here is the Valentine's card.

333
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,480
Can you read it for me? I’ll go get water.

334
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,520
Sure, Mom.

335
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,240
It’s our 20th Valentine's Day together.

336
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,280
I might be far away, but my heart stays with you, always.

337
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,880
Aw, how cheesy.

338
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,320
Don’t you have a date with the one you went to the movies with?

339
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,610
No, Mom.

340
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,010
What?

341
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,260
It’s an important day.

342
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,360
We don’t talk anymore.

343
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,540
Atom, get up.

344
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,840
I said get up.

345
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,630
No.

346
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,630
You must, before the food goes bad.

347
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,470
Go eat.

348
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,680
No, I’m not hungry.

349
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,680
But you must eat.

350
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,470
Get out of bed.

351
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,550
You must eat.

352
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,290
No, I won’t eat.

353
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,860
Atom.

354
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Hey, what’s the matter?

355
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,640
What is this, a heartbreak?

356
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,530
Dumped or got dumped?

357
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,520
I dumped them.

358
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,430
Then what’s the reason to be this sad?

359
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,890
I got dumped by your dad and got past it.

360
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,890
Come on. Go take a shower.

361
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,810
Then eat.

362
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,160
Quickly.

363
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,310
One, two.

364
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:57,410
VALENTINE’S DAY, GRADE 11

365
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,680
I hope he likes it.

366
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,230
Half.

367
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,200
Valentine's chocolate for you.

368
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,610
I made it myself.

369
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,090
I’m sorry.

370
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,530
I don’t think I can take it.

371
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,280
Why not?

372
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,930
I got chocolate from someone I like this morning.

373
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,590
Hey, Mudmee.

374
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,680
Half.

375
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,400
I stopped by to grab a cupcake.

376
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,440
Am I too late?

377
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,980
You are.

378
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,830
Oh.

379
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,690
You sold them all?

380
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,060
No.

381
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,870
I threw them all away.

382
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:43,740
What?

383
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,620
Why?

384
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,980
Actually, I tried my best to bake that cake for someone.

385
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,610
But I just learned that he got a gift from the one he likes this morning.

386
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,410
Sorry.

387
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,350
I don’t think I can take it.

388
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,100
I got chocolate from someone I like this morning.

389
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,090
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. I’m sorry.

390
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,840
You don’t have to apologize.

391
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,940
It’s not your fault.

392
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,920
This cake might not be a success, but I put so much effort into it.

393
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,770
It shouldn’t get thrown away like this.

394
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,930
I’m so sorry.

395
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,230
You are crushed.

396
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,400
You’re all messy.

397
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,610
Mudmee.

398
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:06,390
Even though I didn’t ask for it, I know you made this cake for me.

399
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,480
I could tell from the way you asked me then.

400
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,290
Of course, I know.

401
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,090
That’s why I lied to everyone.

402
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,400
I didn’t want gifts from anyone anymore.

403
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,980
Except you.

404
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,880
Really?

405
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:48,780
Really.

406
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,170
Thanks.

407
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,720
I’m sorry.

408
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,010
I crushed it.

409
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,550
Why are you opening it?

410
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,560
Hey.

411
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,750
How is it?

412
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,650
It’s good.

413
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:21,866
Serious?

414
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,591
Yes.

415
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,124
I’ve been waiting for a year.

416
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,240
I’m glad you like it.

417
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:34,124
I got to eat it finally.

418
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,302
Glad to see you smile.

419
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,542
Perfect for Valentine's Day.

420
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,960
Thank you.

421
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,355
Thanks for helping me today.

422
00:35:16,604 --> 00:35:19,991
It’s so hard to find a helping hand on Valentine’s Day.

423
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,835
Ah, it’s okay.

424
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,391
Today,

425
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,573
I don’t have any plans.

426
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,657
Good.

427
00:35:32,702 --> 00:35:33,751
You’re better than me.

428
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:36,808
My partner is always mad at me on Valentine’s Day.

429
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,795
Well, I’m a pastry chef after all.

430
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,595
What’s up?

431
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,590
Are you buying dessert for your mom?

432
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,822
No.

433
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:57,084
I’m buying it for my girlfriend.

434
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,137
Girlfriend, huh?

435
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,786
Take your time and pick the one you like.

436
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,924
Sure.

437
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,840
Chocolate cakes, cookies, and brownies.

438
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:30,417
Chocolate cakes, cookies, and brownies, guys.

439
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:33,813
Special promotion, only for today.

440
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:36,622
You’re very hard-working. I should pay you more.

441
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,657
Of course, I am.

442
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,164
Chocolate cakes, cookies, and brownies.

443
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,382
Special promotion, only for today.

444
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:49,297
Chocolate cakes, cookies, and brownies.

445
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:52,124
Chocolate cakes, cookies, and brownies.

446
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:53,946
Special promotion…

447
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,940
Hey. Is that Atom?

448
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,568
Are you working a part-time job?

449
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,746
Yes.

450
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:11,230
Don’t you guys have basketball practice?

451
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,951
Come on. Look at the vibes here.

452
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:14,490
How could we practice?

453
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,490
We came to sing karaoke till dawn.

454
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,537
Isn't your date upset with you for working on Valentine's Day?

455
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,160
What date? I don’t have a date.

456
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,111
Then you can join us after work.

457
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:28,426
A party for single people.

458
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,226
I told everyone that I was joking.

459
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,302
You don’t have to worry about it anymore.

460
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,368
Your friend?

461
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,791
Ah, yes.

462
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:10,231
I’m going to the bathroom.

463
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,475
I’ll leave you in charge here.

464
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:27,555
(If I am like other people, we should be together now.)

465
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,826
I bought it from this shop.

466
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:10,364
This time, choose it yourself.

467
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:13,884
It can be anything.

468
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:14,666
What?

469
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,106
But you didn’t like the one I chose for you.

470
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:18,100
I don’t like cookies.

471
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,617
Did you forget or what?

472
00:39:19,662 --> 00:39:21,208
Then why did you say ‘anything’?

473
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,555
Sorry for being silly.

474
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:25,262
You can break up with me if you want.

475
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:26,782
Kids.

476
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:27,786
Do you think I won’t do it?

477
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:28,586
Fine, let’s break up.

478
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:29,520
Guys!

479
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,555
It’s Valentine’s Day.

480
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,902
You two have a chance to spend time together.

481
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,800
Why don’t you make it a good day?

482
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,182
Don’t you know that

483
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:47,537
some people don’t even have a chance to spend time together?

484
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,435
Are you okay?

485
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,773
Let’s go.

486
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,391
He’s unstable.

487
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,160
Hey.

488
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:16,000
Why do you look surprised?

489
00:40:16,284 --> 00:40:18,000
Are you working part-time here?

490
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,866
I am.

491
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,431
Right timing.

492
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:27,466
Since we are outside school, can I ask you one more time?

493
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:28,613
About Kongthap.

494
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,244
What is it, sir?

495
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,768
Actually, you guys…

496
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,088
aren’t just friends, are you?

497
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,706
Mr. Nop,

498
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,720
Kongthap isn’t at fault here.

499
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:57,146
I was the one that asked him out.

500
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,848
And the hand-holding thing,

501
00:41:00,435 --> 00:41:01,955
I forced him to do it.

502
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,057
But we broke up now.

503
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,008
This has nothing to do with Kongthap.

504
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:10,515
It’s not his fault. It’s my fault.

505
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,075
Hold on.

506
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,106
Take it easy.

507
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
I’m not condemning you or anything.

508
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:19,724
Hello, Nop.

509
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,826
Sin.

510
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:24,820
What brings you here?

511
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:29,310
I came to give someone my Valentine.

512
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:40,951
Thank you.

513
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:50,017
Wait.

514
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,302
When you said you dated someone from the same school,

515
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:00,986
you meant Sin?

516
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,573
I suspected you two were dating,

517
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:27,217
but you said you were just friends,

518
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,853
so I didn't push it further.

519
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:36,604
I was afraid that if everyone knew, things would get messy.

520
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,986
Our love isn’t like other people's love.

521
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,080
I don’t want people to look at Kongthap in a bad way.

522
00:42:50,124 --> 00:42:56,933
I told Kongthap to lie even when I knew he hated to lie.

523
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,248
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

524
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,435
You have the right to tell or not tell people.

525
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:11,440
However, you don't have the right to say if a certain type of love is right or wrong.

526
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,151
Let’s put it this way.

527
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:24,373
Your chocolate cake, Sin’s chocolate lava, and my chocolate brownie are all made of chocolate.

528
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:31,137
Their textures and intensity levels, though, are different.

529
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,675
It’s not wrong to like different things than others.

530
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,808
But it’s wrong to lie to yourself.

531
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,813
Especially on the day of love like today.

532
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,311
I get it now.

533
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,151
I have to go.

534
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,053
Not too fast.

535
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,591
It’s Valentine’s Day. You can’t go without chocolate.

536
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,822
Thank you so much. I’ll be right back.

537
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,050
You don’t have to come back.

538
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,795
I already have an extra hand.

539
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,786
Hi, Atom.

540
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,382
Where’s Kongthap?

541
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,173
Ah, he left.

542
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,857
Why?

543
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:18,862
Can you give this to him for me?

544
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,795
Atom.

545
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,720
I went to see you at the booth.

546
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,360
I met Mr. Annop.

547
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,057
He told me everything.

548
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,240
Now I know how much you care about me.

549
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,991
Kongthap, I’m sorry for being silly.

550
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:18,328
I’m sorry for making you lie to people.

551
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,968
No.

552
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,280
It’s my fault.

553
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,240
I told everyone without asking you first.

554
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,742
I’m sorry.

555
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:45,671
From now on, I will discuss things with you before I do anything.

556
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,440
From now on?

557
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,604
I used to think that if I went out with you,

558
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:12,106
I’d know how I felt about you.

559
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:19,395
But every time you’re not around,

560
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:24,551
I feel like something is missing.

561
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,013
It’s not as fun as when we’re together.

562
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,600
It’s a lot better when I have you.

563
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,111
Is this what they call love?

564
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:00,328
I understand.

565
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,848
You don’t have to say it anymore.

566
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:20,791
Atom.

567
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,604
I like you.

568
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,057
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

569
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,275
Sorry for keeping you waiting for the answer.

570
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,893
What about you?

571
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,991
Have you been waiting for my answer?

572
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:06,960
Come here.

573
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,288
Guys, we are boyfriends.

574
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,840
Finally, you two decided to tell us.

575
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,995
Guys, cheers to these two.

576
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:12,990
Woo-hoo!

577
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:21,040
 On the day the sky is gray 

578
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:30,444
 Some may feel their hearts dismay 

579
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,200
 Thinking love's a fleeting dream 

580
00:50:33,244 --> 00:50:40,737
 Drifting far away, or so it seems 

581
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:47,466
 Try opening your eyes 

582
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,008
Thanks for giving me a ride home.
 Gaze upon the sky 

583
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,955
 Forget and let go of all your fears 

584
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,271
And thanks for the cupcake thing today.

585
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:04,100
 You will know that true love is near 

586
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,808
I’ll just get inside.
 Do you believe me? 

587
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:07,610
Mudmee.

588
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,213
 I think nothing is impossible 

589
00:51:10,248 --> 00:51:10,933
What?

590
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:12,800
Nothing.

591
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,773
Time for me to go.

592
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,653
 Love may take you by surprise 

593
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:16,900
Goodbye.

594
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,582
Are you sure?

595
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,008
 Someone might stand before you, confess to you 

596
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:27,777
 Like a dream come true 

597
00:51:27,822 --> 00:51:33,431
 One day you might find your perfect match 

598
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:38,311
 The one to warm your soul 

599
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:47,191
 I tell myself each passing day 

600
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:52,151
 My chance will soon unfold 

601
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,804
 Try opening your eyes 

602
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,755
 Gaze upon the sky 

603
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,511
 Forget and let go of all your fears 

604
00:52:07,546 --> 00:52:14,337
 You will know that true love is near 

605
00:52:14,373 --> 00:52:17,831
 Do you believe me? 

606
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:23,493
 I think nothing is impossible 

607
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,391
 Love may take you by surprise 

608
00:52:28,435 --> 00:52:34,231
 Someone might stand before you, confess to you 

609
00:52:34,266 --> 00:52:37,840
 Like a dream come true 

610
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:39,484
Nop.

611
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:43,591
 One day you might find your perfect match 

612
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:48,568
 The one to warm your soul 

613
00:52:48,604 --> 00:52:56,986
 I tell myself each passing day 

614
00:52:57,031 --> 00:52:58,400
Happy Valentine’s Day.

615
00:52:58,444 --> 00:53:01,351
 My chance will soon unfold 

616
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,231
I love you.

617
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:05,422
Love you too.

618
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:13,786
 Have you ever mused on
What your life desires to find? 

619
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:23,502
 If it seems too far to hold,
Would you, like me, leave the doubts behind? 

620
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:28,910
 I think nothing is impossible 

621
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:33,724
 Love may take you by surprise 

622
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,653
 Someone might stand before you, confess to you 

623
00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:43,351
 Like a dream come true 

624
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:49,075
 One day you might find your perfect match 

625
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:53,875
 The one to warm your soul 

626
00:53:53,920 --> 00:54:02,737
 I tell myself each passing day 

627
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:07,128
 My chance will soon unfold 

628
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:12,417
 My chance will soon unfold 

629
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:18,497
 My chance will soon unfold 
 My chance will soon unfold 

630
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:33,751
You have far surpassed a master like me, my disciple.

631
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:38,737
Without you, Mudmee, what I imagined would not have come true.

632
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,373
There’s one more thing left.

633
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,271
What is it?

634
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:49,511
When do you think people in a relationship should have their first kiss?

635
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,493
Buddy.

636
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,266
The first kiss isn’t about when, but about why.

637
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:01,457
You will find out.
