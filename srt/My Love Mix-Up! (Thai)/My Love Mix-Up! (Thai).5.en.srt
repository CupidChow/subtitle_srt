1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,700
Good to know that it was a misunderstanding.

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,766
I was wrong too for jumping to conclusions too quickly.

3
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:05,503
Let’s…

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,500
end The Eraser Alliance here.

5
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:08,247
Hey.

6
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:09,304
Kongthap.

7
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:10,124
Hi, Clair.

8
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:11,278
We finally meet again.

9
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:13,590
Those two are going to confess for sure.

10
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:15,813
I really can’t let you win.

11
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:17,813
You like Khao-pan too?

12
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,012
I got it all wrong?

13
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,516
I've been told that when we like someone,

14
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:23,516
it’ll feel like we have butterflies in our stomachs.

15
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:27,980
When you like someone, your heart will tell you.

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,930
CAMP DAY

17
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:41,844
Whoo!

18
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:42,976
We’re here!

19
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,664
Come on.

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,556
Get off.

21
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:55,707
Let’s go.

22
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:57,987
Come on.

23
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,095
Come on, guys.

24
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,270
We will gather in the courtyard.

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,307
Let’s go.

26
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:07,146
- Your bag is so cute.
- Walk already.

27
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:14,209
We’re not there yet?

28
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:16,076
I can’t go on.

29
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,123
Can’t the camp come to us instead?

30
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:24,355
I thought we’d go to a beautiful beach camp.

31
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:26,918
Who would’ve thought we’d be left in the woods?

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,407
Doing alright?

33
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:31,606
Need some help?

34
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:33,606
Ah.

35
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:35,707
Thanks a lot.

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,860
I can lend you a hand too, Mudmee.

37
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:39,107
No problem at all.

38
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:47,976
I've heard many of our seniors formed relationships during this camp.

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,478
Seriously?

40
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:50,366
Yes.

41
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:58,673
Mudmee, maybe this camp will allow us to have sweet private moments with our crushes.

42
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,678
Listen.

43
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:41,006
This camp might be our chance to confess our feelings.

44
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:43,793
Confess?

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,415
Possibly.

46
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:53,187
Dear nature deities, please grant our wishes.

47
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,721
Sadhu.

48
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:00,603
Ouch!

49
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:04,407
That was probably the answer from the nature deities.

50
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:05,373
Ouch.

51
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,564
Run!

52
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,061
Don’t cut your life short here.

53
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:11,061
Ow!

54
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:18,134
The man who will take care of us during our stay here is

55
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,200
Sergeant Yod!

56
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,093
Get down.

57
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,990
Now!

58
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:25,185
I said get down.

59
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:26,107
Do it now.

60
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,548
Get down.

61
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:30,193
All of you, get down.

62
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:31,799
Quick!

63
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,894
You guys are too slow.

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,287
Kids from fancy schools like yours only know a life of luxury.

65
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:45,779
This camp will teach you the definition of ‘toughness’.

66
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:47,093
Repeat after me.

67
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:48,196
“The camp conqueror…”

68
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,647
The camp conqueror…

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,513
“can conquer anything.”

70
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,694
can conquer anything.

71
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:55,397
Louder!

72
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,159
“Louder!”

73
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:01,204
Are you all challenging my power?

74
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,030
Who do you think I am, your friend?

75
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:07,953
You want to be punished?

76
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:12,634
- The camp conqueror can conquer anything. - Atom. This is not a camp.

77
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,004
This is hell.

78
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,899
The teachers should know about this.

79
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:17,291
Oh, yeah?

80
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:19,291
The teachers should know?

81
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:23,928
I sent them all up to the mountain to party.

82
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:28,042
Right now, right here, I’m in charge.

83
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:29,885
Do you have a problem?

84
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:31,884
No, sir.

85
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:32,644
Great.

86
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:37,994
Today, you must complete all the obstacle courses I’ve set up for you.

87
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,368
Each course will earn you points.

88
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,590
Those who fail will be kicked out of this camp immediately.

89
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:49,136
What?

90
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:50,674
Got it?

91
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,807
Yes, sir.

92
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:55,080
- The camp conqueror can conquer anything.
- Dear nature deities, did I do something to offend you?

93
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,648
- The camp conqueror can conquer anything.
- Will I ever get a chance to confess?

94
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:03,340
The camp conqueror can conquer anything.

95
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:05,820
The first obstacle course is called The Hell Bridge.

96
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:08,285
All you need to do is cross it.

97
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:11,560
If you fall, 10 points will be deducted.

98
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,100
Go, go.

99
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:21,476
Look straight.

100
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:25,465
Hang tight.

101
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,827
Be careful.

102
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:28,094
Argh!

103
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:29,982
Mudmee, I can’t do this.

104
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,705
Atom!

105
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,757
Mudmee!

106
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:38,077
Slow down.

107
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,910
Oh, no.

108
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:46,788
They fell.

109
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,825
They have a life vest.

110
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,207
Calm down, okay?

111
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,504
Oh, shit! Something is nibbling me!

112
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:53,548
It’s underwater!

113
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,091
This is the last obstacle course for today, The Hell Wall.

114
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,702
If you fail, pack your bag and go home.

115
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:00,590
Go.

116
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,262
Gosh.

117
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,550
Atom, I can’t do this anymore.

118
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:06,364
Can I go home now?

119
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,937
Mudmee, don’t back down now.

120
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:13,300
Remember, this is our chance to confess.

121
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:18,644
Get a good grip.

122
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:20,604
Hurry up.

123
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:22,277
- Good job, Atom. - Climb. Make it quick.

124
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:24,831
Fight it.

125
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,588
Go on.

126
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:32,007
- Whoa. - Keep going, Atom.

127
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,814
Don’t look down.

128
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:40,084
You’re doing great, Atom.

129
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,696
Whoa!

130
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:47,096
Why is it so high?

131
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:48,299
Climb down slowly.

132
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,596
Atom, climb down.

133
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,156
Atom.

134
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,113
Stay calm, Atom.

135
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,285
Get down.

136
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:57,390
- Get down. - I can’t move my legs, Mudmee.

137
00:07:57,953 --> 00:07:58,768
Take it easy, Atom.

138
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:01,416
I can’t do this. I can’t. I really can’t.

139
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,159
Mom, Dad, anyone, please help me.

140
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,593
I can’t do this.

141
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:10,394
(F : Monticha Phonglaksamee, Achira Sophonpatima)

142
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,436
Well, it’s good.

143
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:19,200
At least we’ll keep each other company on the way home.

144
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:23,796
Oops!

145
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,760
Do you honestly think you’ll get to go home?

146
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,442
Wait a minute, Sergeant Yod.

147
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:35,113
Are you saying we can stay on?

148
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:35,851
Really, sir?

149
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:37,313
Yes.

150
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,682
You can stay on as long as you want,

151
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,888
but you will stay on as losers.

152
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:44,888
Got it?

153
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:46,902
Losers.

154
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:48,791
Losers.

155
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:49,600
Yes, you can stay.

156
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,499
Stay on.

157
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:51,800
Damn. I’m frustrated.

158
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:13,059
If we must stay on like this,

159
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,154
going home might be a better choice.

160
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:18,754
He didn’t even give us spoons.

161
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:19,860
How are we going to eat this?

162
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,690
Gosh, Sergeant Yod.

163
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,793
How are you doing?

164
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:35,097
He said members in the F group were not allowed to make eye contact with those in the A group.

165
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:36,433
Right.

166
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:40,359
It’s okay.

167
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,094
I already checked.

168
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:43,933
Sergeant Yod isn’t here.

169
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:45,394
Really?

170
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:46,500
Yes.

171
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,593
He asked someone to guard the food.

172
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:51,496
That’s all we could smuggle out for you.

173
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:53,188
You two should share.

174
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:12,805
Gosh.

175
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:17,242
Thank you so much.

176
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:21,114
I’ll be eternally grateful.

177
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:26,508
I promise I’ll get ordained to express my gratitude once we get back.

178
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:29,994
I’m serious.

179
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:32,367
I really am.

180
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:34,065
You don’t have to.

181
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:38,364
Mudmee.

182
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,993
Hm?

183
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:43,311
For me?

184
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:45,379
Thanks.

185
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:47,605
Don’t let the sergeant catch you.

186
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,471
We should go.

187
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:49,282
Bye-bye.

188
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:50,900
Bye, man.

189
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,287
If you need more help, let me know.

190
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,079
Thanks so much.

191
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:55,899
Come on.

192
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:21,100
Dear nature deities, thank you for showing us mercy.

193
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,456
Right.

194
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,694
Thank you so much.

195
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,357
You two will crash here tonight.

196
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:48,597
What about the others?

197
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,587
Winners get to sleep in comfy rooms, of course.

198
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:54,902
It is a truth of life.

199
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:57,917
The strong survive. The weak go extinct.

200
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:00,807
You two losers get some sleep.

201
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,490
Time for bed.

202
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:03,385
Get in.

203
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:10,954
Sergeant.

204
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,393
The zipper is stuck.

205
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:15,851
Really?

206
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:17,196
Really, sir.

207
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:21,160
It’s probably broken.

208
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,860
You can crash with your friends in the building then.

209
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,316
What?

210
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,316
Hey, Sergeant.

211
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,153
What about me?

212
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,177
Hey, like I said.

213
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,360
The strong survive. The weak go extinct.

214
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,559
Stop talking, loser.

215
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:34,291
Just go to bed.

216
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:35,244
You.

217
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,977
Follow me.

218
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:37,640
Hey.

219
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:41,431
Atom, I’m sorry.

220
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,253
Okay.

221
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:46,162
Don’t apologize, Mudmee.

222
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:48,048
It isn’t your fault.

223
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:54,220
Oh, jeez.

224
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:57,936
Hey!

225
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:00,999
Come on.

226
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:02,364
Ow!

227
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:10,108
Hey!

228
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:11,099
Hey!

229
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:12,036
Whoa.

230
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:13,602
I can’t.

231
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:24,091
I can’t do this anymore.

232
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,557
No!

233
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,457
It’s me.

234
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:45,622
Get your stuff. You’re sleeping with me.

235
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,364
I asked him to go fetch you.

236
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:06,362
He didn’t like the idea of you sleeping outside alone either.

237
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,991
These are our spots.

238
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:13,597
We will all share it tonight.

239
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:20,362
You sleep in the middle of Kongthap and me.

240
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:22,210
In the middle?

241
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,148
Are you sure?

242
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:26,148
I…

243
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,485
can take the side.

244
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:29,385
I feel bad.

245
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:31,820
- Just lie down, dude. Stop talking.
- Hey.

246
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:32,904
Get some sleep.

247
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:33,610
Yes.

248
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:53,291
Good night.

249
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:03,674
Peekaboo!

250
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:10,573
Why do I smell rule-breakers here?

251
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,887
What are you all doing?

252
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:14,468
Pretending to sleep, huh?

253
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:17,296
Look at you.

254
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,360
Very nice acting.

255
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:25,371
There.

256
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:27,684
Sergeant, I have a bad stomachache.

257
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:30,793
- What did you eat?
- Have you got some medicines?

258
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:32,060
How long has it been?

259
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:33,791
It happened just now.

260
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,694
Can you get me out of here?

261
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,251
- I’m taking you to the infirmary.
- Alright, sir.

262
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:39,405
Let’s go now.

263
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:40,942
Ow.

264
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:51,834
Don’t go yet.

265
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:55,288
Stay here until it’s safe.

266
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:11,911
The next thing I knew, I was right there with him.

267
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:13,496
Aw!

268
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:15,736
Atom, that was dope.

269
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,154
I’m so jealous.

270
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:20,259
What about you? How did it go?

271
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:23,351
We spent all night flipping cards to tell love fortunes.

272
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,405
The highlight, though, was the tale about the romantic firefly night.

273
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:31,894
The romantic firefly night?

274
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,328
Yes.

275
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:36,991
This place used to be home to tons of fireflies.

276
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:40,364
But once this camp was established, they were gone.

277
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:46,094
That spawned the tale that whoever spotted fireflies here together would fall in love.

278
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:47,685
What are we waiting for?

279
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:48,262
Let’s go.

280
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:48,904
Hold on.

281
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:51,493
It’s still noon.

282
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,796
You won’t be able to see them.

283
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:55,179
I went to look for them just now.

284
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:56,636
Yeah?

285
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:02,687
Fall in!

286
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,513
Quickly.

287
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,616
Make it quick!

288
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:08,988
Attention!

289
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,290
What’s our camp motto?

290
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:15,942
The camp conquerors can conquer anything.

291
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:17,000
Louder!

292
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,507
The camp conquerors can conquer anything.

293
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,477
Good.

294
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:24,107
I heard some of you say this camp is cruel.

295
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,337
So today…

296
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:27,199
We will get to rest?

297
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:28,854
We will get to rest. As if!

298
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:31,037
You’ve been trained for a day. Of course, you will not rest.

299
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,893
Today, we will work as a team.

300
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:36,193
Each team will have four members.

301
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:40,979
If any team member fails, the team as a whole loses points.

302
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,887
Got it?

303
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:47,500
Yes, sir.

304
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:48,693
Good.

305
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:49,882
Dismiss!

306
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:51,388
Go.

307
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,742
Who would join us?

308
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,784
The rest already have their teammates.

309
00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:59,065
Bingo.

310
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,179
We have four members here.

311
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:00,956
No.

312
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,899
I don’t want to hold you guys back.

313
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:05,687
Don’t think like that.

314
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:08,367
They want us to work as a team to help each other.

315
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,527
Right.

316
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:13,010
Let’s get going.

317
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:14,813
It’s going to be fun today.

318
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:15,657
Come on.

319
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:23,747
Mudmee.

320
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,573
Huh?

321
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:29,220
I think we shouldn’t drag those two down with us.

322
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:36,947
Dear nature deities, please grant us the courage.

323
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,236
- Sadhu. - Sadhu.

324
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,167
Faster!

325
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,637
- Atom, you can do it. - Faster!

326
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:48,844
Atom, go!

327
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,008
Go.

328
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,590
Argh!

329
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:54,791
Argh!

330
00:19:58,147 --> 00:19:58,808
Quickly!

331
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,173
Atom, watch your step.

332
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:07,694
Mudmee, you can do this.

333
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:11,484
Mudmee, you got this.

334
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,859
Yeah!

335
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:22,864
Three, two, one.

336
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:31,756
We did it.

337
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:34,370
- Good job. - We did it.

338
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,451
- Ouch. - Sorry.

339
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:38,588
Atom, you did great.

340
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:40,711
Sorry, did it hurt?

341
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,814
Wow.

342
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,584
What’s got into you guys?

343
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:46,196
You are not the same people as yesterday.

344
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:58,287
I guess I got great inspiration.

345
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:05,808
What great inspiration?

346
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:08,542
Can you tell me?

347
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:17,690
Let’s go.

348
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:19,145
I want to do the next course.

349
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:20,053
What?

350
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:21,882
Mudmee, hold on.

351
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:22,688
Tell me first.

352
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:26,257
What about you?

353
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:28,500
Did you have great inspiration like her?

354
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:35,256
I just wanted to turn into the new Atom.

355
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:37,233
Why?

356
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:39,094
What’s wrong with the old Atom?

357
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:45,102
The old Atom liked to keep his feelings to himself.

358
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:48,513
Like what?

359
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:50,705
I’m not telling you.

360
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:53,296
If you want to know, wait until I complete all the obstacle courses.

361
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:55,493
I’ll tell you then.

362
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:05,754
Oh, gosh.

363
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,593
My dear, please be alright.

364
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:12,360
You shouldn’t have gone up there.

365
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:20,359
Is the next course that bad?

366
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:30,356
Welcome to the most ruthless obstacle course in this camp.

367
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,367
This is called The Hell Tower.

368
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:38,050
If you fail this course, you fail all the courses you have completed.

369
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:39,604
What?

370
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:42,154
Why did we waste our time doing those courses then?

371
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,010
Hey!

372
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:44,207
Do not argue.

373
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,451
Send the bravest one out.

374
00:22:49,594 --> 00:22:50,657
What are we gonna do, Kongthap?

375
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:52,990
Should we do Rock Paper Scissors?

376
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,547
Mudmee.

377
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:57,357
We shouldn’t drag those two down with us.

378
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:04,850
I volunteer.

379
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:06,682
What?

380
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,550
Atom, can you handle it?

381
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:09,542
You sure?

382
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:12,670
Atom, did you think it through?

383
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:14,088
Atom.

384
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:19,797
Report!

385
00:23:21,242 --> 00:23:28,227
I, Achira Sophonpatima, am going up the 24-foot-tall tower.

386
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:30,851
Fight, fight, fight.

387
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,133
Fight, fight, fight.

388
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:45,596
Oh, boy.

389
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:51,105
This height will bring out the fear in humans.

390
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:52,851
It’s not that high.

391
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:54,745
Sit down.

392
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:00,271
Argh!

393
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,790
That’s awesome, Atom.

394
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:04,680
That’s my friend.

395
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:07,297
- You can’t just call him Atom from now on. - Hang in there, Atom.

396
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:09,645
Call him Atom the bravest.

397
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:13,084
You’re doing good.

398
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:14,224
Can you do it?

399
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,924
I can’t.

400
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:15,834
Are you brave enough?

401
00:24:18,447 --> 00:24:19,187
I’m going to fight it!

402
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,802
One, two, three.

403
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:29,547
- Atom! - Atom!

404
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:30,193
Hey.

405
00:24:35,722 --> 00:24:36,364
- Hey! - Atom!

406
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:36,934
Atom!

407
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:37,536
Atom!

408
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:38,291
Atom!

409
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:39,145
Atom!

410
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:40,099
Atom, can you hear me?

411
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,007
He’s fainted.

412
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,142
Anyone, please get a doctor.

413
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:43,353
Quickly.

414
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:44,730
Atom, please be alright.

415
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,560
Atom.

416
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:46,204
Atom.

417
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,994
Atom.

418
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:53,113
Can you hear me?

419
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:56,694
How are you feeling?

420
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:57,893
Atom.

421
00:24:59,113 --> 00:24:59,691
Oh!

422
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:02,954
How are you?

423
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:04,757
Slowly.

424
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:08,791
I’m okay.

425
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:11,291
What about the others?

426
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:15,345
Our team failed.

427
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:19,313
Half and Kongthap were sent into the woods to pick bamboo shoots.

428
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:23,994
It’s my fault.

429
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,691
I’m sorry.

430
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:28,004
Don’t apologize, Atom.

431
00:25:28,514 --> 00:25:30,268
You were great today.

432
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:34,699
If I were you, I wouldn’t even be able to walk up there.

433
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:42,516
I see you’re up.

434
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:43,988
Oh, jeez!

435
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,190
Why did you get down? I didn’t command you to.

436
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:54,091
Do you know why you two failed?

437
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:01,290
Because I’m afraid of heights.

438
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,648
Because I get frightened too easily.

439
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,640
Wrong!

440
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:09,290
It’s because you guys are cowards.

441
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:13,934
You always come up with excuses.

442
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,291
You give up before you even start.

443
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:24,147
Think of the river in front of you as your fear.

444
00:26:25,562 --> 00:26:27,540
All you need to do is cross it.

445
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:29,659
Then you will become a new person.

446
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,002
Alright, let’s do this.

447
00:26:40,744 --> 00:26:43,488
I have a specific task for you both.

448
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:51,868
However, this task takes the most courage.

449
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,890
You'll need more courage than you did on earlier obstacle courses.

450
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,359
Are you brave enough to do it?

451
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:02,239
If you succeed, you will receive a pass from me.

452
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,239
Really, sir?

453
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:06,791
Really.

454
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:10,634
What do you say?

455
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:29,013
The camp's final obstacle course is designed to test your bravery.

456
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:34,959
You all will need to pay respect to the nature deities.

457
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:39,122
If you’re ready, get going. I wish you good luck.

458
00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:41,659
But let me tell you.

459
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:45,908
There aren’t just us in this woods.

460
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:53,091
I wish you all the best of luck.

461
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:02,687
Are we going to be alright?

462
00:28:05,113 --> 00:28:05,697
Tan.

463
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:07,287
Don’t be scared.

464
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,548
Sergeant Yod just made up that story.

465
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,256
Get out of here!

466
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:14,610
Leave this place!

467
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,062
Good job.

468
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:30,994
One way to overcome your fear is to become the fear itself.

469
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:32,794
Thank you, Sergeant.

470
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,591
Don’t smile just yet.

471
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:43,100
The scariest part is the fact that you have to stay here by yourself

472
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:47,060
and spook them till the very last one.

473
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:48,014
Then you pass the test.

474
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:51,014
Huh?

475
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:53,448
Good luck.

476
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:54,908
I’m out of here.

477
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,107
Sergeant.

478
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:02,788
Hold on.

479
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:05,830
Wait.

480
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:06,365
No.

481
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:07,760
Atom, focus.

482
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,491
I’m so scared.

483
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:10,704
Gosh, I’m scared to death.

484
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:15,584
What’s that?

485
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:19,053
Damn it.

486
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,704
What are you playing?

487
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:24,967
What are you, a baby ghost?

488
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,480
Do you want red soda as an offering?

489
00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:27,408
I’ll get it for you.

490
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:30,744
I took so much time to dress up. Am I not scary at all?

491
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:33,984
- Not scary at all? - Nonsense.

492
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:35,000
Are you scared?

493
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,834
No.

494
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:41,297
Namkaeng, do you hear something?

495
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:03,547
Argh!

496
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:19,947
Good job.

497
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:24,231
You looked so scary there.

498
00:30:24,414 --> 00:30:25,404
No kidding.

499
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:28,690
I got startled too to see myself in a mirror.

500
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,094
Yes, you scared me too at first.

501
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:37,599
I’ve been waiting for so long.

502
00:30:38,316 --> 00:30:39,017
Where is everybody?

503
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:43,934
Hey!

504
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,802
Not this again.

505
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:47,257
I can’t.

506
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:51,594
Maybe everyone is gone.

507
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:52,991
What if they’re not?

508
00:30:56,836 --> 00:30:57,408
I’m scared.

509
00:30:57,557 --> 00:30:59,639
So scared.

510
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:00,527
Hey.

511
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:05,894
This is so scary.

512
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:10,680
Hey!

513
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,347
Easy. It’s me.

514
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:21,947
You.

515
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:24,057
You scared me.

516
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:27,970
Next time, use your voice, okay?

517
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:31,120
The sergeant asked me to come get you.

518
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,885
Everyone is gone.

519
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,362
We should change.

520
00:31:58,367 --> 00:31:58,982
Here.

521
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,308
Your reward.

522
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,304
For what?

523
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:05,600
For being brave and completing the task all by yourself.

524
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,102
Thanks.

525
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,459
Actually, I was scared.

526
00:32:28,377 --> 00:32:31,008
When I saw something moving, I swung my blade.

527
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,187
I saw that.

528
00:32:38,177 --> 00:32:43,097
It’s a shame I wasn’t tested for bravery like other people.

529
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:54,187
When we return to school, I'll be the odd one out.

530
00:32:56,748 --> 00:32:57,539
It’s okay.

531
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:01,487
The sergeant didn’t say we couldn’t do it.

532
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:05,490
Here.

533
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:09,794
Someone dropped these joss sticks in the woods.

534
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:16,091
You wanna do it?

535
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,300
Let’s go.

536
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:37,408
 But once again by chance

537
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,111
 We meet every day

538
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:41,927
 Sitting next to me

539
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:42,714
Oh, shit!
 Sitting next to me

540
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:44,360
 Sitting next to me

541
00:33:44,937 --> 00:33:45,882
Wait, wait.

542
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:48,494
 I must not give myself away

543
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:52,242
 You’re just so cute, I get so shy

544
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:56,337
 You’ve broken the walls in my heart, no lie

545
00:33:56,557 --> 00:33:58,645
 Can I say out loud?

546
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:02,079
 Help me now

547
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:03,891
 I don’t know what to say

548
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:06,008
 I’m fluttered

549
00:34:06,193 --> 00:34:08,084
 What do I do now?

550
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:09,722
 Someone, please help me out

551
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,331
 My heart is so frail

552
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:13,277
 Seeing you walk by

553
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,242
 One look into your eyes

554
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:18,502
 I can’t resist somehow

555
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:20,764
 I’m fluttered

556
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:22,960
 My heart’s trembling now

557
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:24,545
 Ever wondered

558
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,670
 My system’s going down

559
00:34:27,722 --> 00:34:31,634
 Baby, won’t you please

560
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:36,085
 Take my heart and help me out

561
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:43,596
Thanks for spoiling me today.

562
00:34:46,704 --> 00:34:47,408
You’re welcome.

563
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,234
Hey.

564
00:34:55,434 --> 00:35:00,996
So will you tell me now what it is?

565
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:03,888
What?

566
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:11,296
You said you’d tell me something after we completed every course.

567
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:13,768
Ah…

568
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:18,499
I…

569
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:21,400
I wanted to say…

570
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:26,120
the moon is beautiful tonight.

571
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:28,728
Huh?

572
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,490
There’s no moon.

573
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:44,456
I can’t see the moon tonight.

574
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,220
The sky is overcast.

575
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:03,500
Kongthap.

576
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:13,587
Remember when you said you felt relieved that it was all a misunderstanding?

577
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,591
Did I say that?

578
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,364
Hey!

579
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:24,270
Don’t you remember?

580
00:36:24,902 --> 00:36:25,910
On the rooftop.

581
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:30,102
Let’s forget it.

582
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:32,693
Good to know that it was a misunderstanding.

583
00:36:35,165 --> 00:36:36,045
What a relief.

584
00:36:43,939 --> 00:36:44,794
Ah.

585
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:50,496
I meant to say I was glad things were cleared out.

586
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:53,725
So you didn’t have to worry about it anymore.

587
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,791
That’s it?

588
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:04,942
Yes, that’s it.

589
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:06,887
I was worried.

590
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:08,589
Afraid you’d feel troubled.

591
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:19,533
Come on.

592
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:26,112
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

593
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:27,237
Hm?

594
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:31,090
You know?

595
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:36,964
When you said you were relieved, I was so down.

596
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:41,948
Why would you be down?

597
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:49,791
Well…

598
00:37:52,443 --> 00:37:54,447
That eraser thing was a misunderstanding, wasn’t it?

599
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:02,487
It was, at first.

600
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:08,806
But then…

601
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:13,289
Remember, this is our chance to confess.

602
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:17,544
I've heard many of our seniors formed relationships during this camp.

603
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:28,570
I just wanted to turn into the new Atom.

604
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,501
What?

605
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:44,776
What?

606
00:38:50,015 --> 00:38:50,619
Hm?

607
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:02,489
(Why?)

608
00:39:02,904 --> 00:39:04,188
(What’s wrong with the old Atom?)

609
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:16,692
Gosh.

610
00:39:16,997 --> 00:39:18,101
Why are you staring?

611
00:39:19,932 --> 00:39:22,544
You, stay here.

612
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:25,007
Don’t follow me.

613
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:34,601
The old Atom liked to keep his feelings to himself.

614
00:39:37,632 --> 00:39:38,361
I…

615
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:42,493
I started…

616
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:45,594
I started to…

617
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,704
What are you saying? I can’t hear you.

618
00:39:49,124 --> 00:39:50,659
I started to like you for real.

619
00:40:03,102 --> 00:40:03,718
Hey!

620
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:13,210
Ouch.

621
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:15,098
Ouch.

622
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:20,501
Kongthap.

623
00:40:21,053 --> 00:40:21,684
Kongthap.

624
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,582
Kongthap, are you okay?

625
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:25,296
Calm down.

626
00:40:25,878 --> 00:40:26,715
It’s not that high.

627
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:27,898
That’s good.

628
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:29,329
Ouch!

629
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:32,369
Hey.

630
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:35,049
You said you were okay.

631
00:40:35,326 --> 00:40:36,989
Something just bit me.

632
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:40,665
Whoa. This is a snake bite.

633
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:42,475
You got bitten by a snake?

634
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:44,366
Let’s get back to camp.

635
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:46,089
No. Wait.

636
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:47,440
Don’t go.

637
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:48,791
Stay still.

638
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:53,591
I heard that if you move, the poison will spread.

639
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,683
You sit here.

640
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:57,692
Hang in there, okay?

641
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,696
I promise I’ll be back soon.

642
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,364
If I go through this tower, I will get to the camp right away.

643
00:41:36,198 --> 00:41:38,435
But if I use the bridge, I will need to walk further.

644
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:44,360
Half’s got something urgent.

645
00:41:44,745 --> 00:41:46,093
He asked me to practice with you.

646
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,053
May I have them? I like vegetables.

647
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,069
Your racket is too heavy.

648
00:41:50,095 --> 00:41:50,895
Use this.

649
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:52,557
Can you stop being nice?

650
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,795
Imagine the person in front of you is someone

651
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:58,647
you’ve been looking for for so long.

652
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:05,093
At least we know that love isn’t always bad

653
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:07,299
if we find the right one.

654
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:10,978
The river in front of you is your fear.

655
00:42:11,784 --> 00:42:13,708
All you need to do is cross it.

656
00:42:13,994 --> 00:42:15,098
Then you will become a new person.

657
00:42:46,114 --> 00:42:47,121
Take a shower and wait for me.

658
00:42:47,616 --> 00:42:48,954
I miss you too, baby.

659
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:53,939
Sergeant Yod!

660
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,095
Hey.

661
00:42:55,425 --> 00:42:56,089
What’s going on?

662
00:42:57,518 --> 00:42:58,791
How did you…

663
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:02,296
What happened?

664
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:04,101
Sergeant, help!

665
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:05,295
My friend got bitten by a snake.

666
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:05,995
Where?

667
00:43:06,761 --> 00:43:08,050
Over there.

668
00:43:08,504 --> 00:43:09,204
Help, Sergeant!

669
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:10,178
Help my friend.

670
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:10,942
Help!

671
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:11,578
Of course, I’ll help.

672
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,318
- But calm down.
- Help, please.

673
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:14,597
Help him.

674
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:16,655
Alright. I’ll help.

675
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:19,858
We’re done.

676
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:22,401
Thank you so much.

677
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:24,098
- Thank you. - Thank you.

678
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:33,855
Don’t worry.

679
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,975
Based on the bite, it was not a poisonous snake.

680
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:39,204
Only the tetanus vaccine is needed.

681
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:41,964
Sorry for making you guys worry.

682
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:43,389
You’re fine.

683
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:48,591
Achira.

684
00:43:50,132 --> 00:43:50,701
Yes, sir.

685
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:53,192
I’m sorry for being the cause of the injury.

686
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:55,701
You were clever

687
00:43:57,275 --> 00:44:01,641
not to use your mouth to remove the poison or tie a rope around the wound.

688
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:04,287
If you had done it, his condition would have worsened.

689
00:44:06,164 --> 00:44:09,092
More importantly, very well done.

690
00:44:10,363 --> 00:44:14,600
You’ve overcome your fear and helped your friend.

691
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,258
I have something to reward you.

692
00:44:25,022 --> 00:44:25,858
It’s just perfect.

693
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:36,847
For the bravest in this camp.

694
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:38,495
There’s a light too.

695
00:44:45,585 --> 00:44:46,290
Thank you.

696
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:55,909
If you guys want one, you can purchase at the shop.

697
00:44:57,624 --> 00:44:58,589
Ready for you to take home.

698
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:00,589
- Yes. - Sure.

699
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:01,914
Get well soon.

700
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:04,786
I’m out of here.

701
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:08,786
Awesome.

702
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:10,369
Atom, the bravest.

703
00:45:11,173 --> 00:45:12,526
Bravest, my ass.

704
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:15,142
I did it all for Kongthap.

705
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:27,995
Ah…

706
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:29,732
I mean, yes, I’m that bold.

707
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:33,631
Call me Atom the bravest from now on.

708
00:45:38,508 --> 00:45:42,138
I’m so starving. I’ll go get something to eat.

709
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,495
Me too.

710
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,228
Atom, will you take care of Kongthap here?

711
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:46,607
(The Eraser Alliance, fight!)

712
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:02,148
I've never seen him this bold in all my years knowing him.

713
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:08,806
Don’t you know that when Atom has to do things for others, he suddenly becomes bold?

714
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,395
Like when we had to do the stage play.

715
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:14,795
You’re right.

716
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:18,792
Isn't it amazing how powerful love is?

717
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:25,093
Now that I think about it, I also want to have someone.

718
00:46:26,644 --> 00:46:28,360
Wondering if there is someone who would do that for me.

719
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:31,133
There is.

720
00:46:35,268 --> 00:46:35,901
Hm?

721
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:40,893
I’m just babbling.

722
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:42,992
You don’t have to reassure me.

723
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:51,626
Half.

724
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:06,360
Mudmee, this camp might be our chance to confess our feelings.

725
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,555
Remember, this is our chance to confess.

726
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:19,661
I’ve got something to tell you.

727
00:47:28,404 --> 00:47:29,597
I…

728
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:46,487
I can walk. It’s fine now.

729
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:51,588
I’m sorry.

730
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,130
I told you I’m okay.

731
00:48:02,487 --> 00:48:07,932
I mean I’m sorry for troubling you.

732
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:12,896
From the eraser thing to what happened in camp today.

733
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:20,629
But you’ve never yelled at me once.

734
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:36,169
Actually, the one who should get this prize

735
00:48:43,826 --> 00:48:44,529
is you.

736
00:49:07,095 --> 00:49:10,363
I told you that the eraser thing was my fault.

737
00:49:10,957 --> 00:49:12,363
I was too serious about it.

738
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:24,746
That’s exactly how I know how nice you are to me.

739
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:35,855
I can’t help but feel shaken inside.

740
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:41,895
Before I know it,

741
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:48,812
I like you already.

742
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:13,204
I know that it might be too late to say it now.

743
00:50:19,218 --> 00:50:23,749
If I were you, I wouldn’t believe me again.

744
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:30,361
But at least I got to say it.

745
00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:38,041
I heard you.

746
00:50:40,152 --> 00:50:42,988
Thanks a lot for being honest.

747
00:51:01,584 --> 00:51:02,904
Would you go out with me?

748
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,289
What?

749
00:51:11,295 --> 00:51:11,886
Hold on.

750
00:51:14,453 --> 00:51:18,689
Go out as more than friends, but less than boyfriends.

751
00:51:22,794 --> 00:51:23,426
Wait.

752
00:51:26,581 --> 00:51:27,184
Hey.

753
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:31,351
Did you hit your head falling down the hill?

754
00:51:33,976 --> 00:51:34,709
I didn’t.

755
00:51:38,844 --> 00:51:45,693
Do you remember when I said I’d think about it and give you the answer?

756
00:51:48,723 --> 00:51:49,923
I did think about it.

757
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:58,661
I found out that thinking alone wouldn’t give me the answer.

758
00:52:04,003 --> 00:52:08,188
So you suggested we talk first.

759
00:52:10,074 --> 00:52:11,058
So that you know?

760
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:15,824
Mhm.

761
00:52:18,452 --> 00:52:22,480
Is that enough reason for us to be in a talking stage?

762
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:35,089
As more than friends, but less than boyfriends?

763
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:42,884
We can try.

764
00:53:36,231 --> 00:53:36,887
Hey.

765
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:50,898
Fireflies.

766
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:02,579
There is a tale about the romantic firefly night.

767
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:06,363
Whoever spotted fireflies here together would fall in love.

768
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:30,034
(Dear nature deities, if we’re truly soulmates, please make us fall in love.)

769
00:54:51,072 --> 00:54:53,853
(Thank you, nature deities.)

770
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:01,692
It isn’t your fault, Half.

771
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:04,364
It’s my fault for being too plain.

772
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:05,195
That’s not true.

773
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:07,035
You’re a very lovely person, Mudmee.

774
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:12,154
Sir, what do people in a talking stage usually do?

775
00:55:12,538 --> 00:55:14,595
Do we need to do that?

776
00:55:16,511 --> 00:55:17,040
What are you sending?

777
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:18,213
A message asking you on a date.

778
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,401
The situation will tell you what your next move is.

779
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:23,432
I’ve lost the passion.

780
00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:25,206
What should I do?

781
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,629
Is this what they call heartbroken?
