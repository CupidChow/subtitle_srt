1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
(I promise to do anything to get him to like you back, Mudmee.)

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,000
(May the sweet moments spent preparing the play spark their love.)

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,440
I’m helping Mudmee.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,920
Would you be interested in dancing with me to a song?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,920
I’m sorry.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,239
The one you like,

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,600
I like him too.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,959
You like Half?

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,479
Mudmee, isn’t Kongthap the one you like?

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,240
(Pholkongthap.)

11
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:25,439
(Pholkongthap.)
I wrote Half’s first name on the eraser.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,200
So the one you like is Kongthap?

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,960
For this class, you’re going to work in pairs.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,480
Sketch your partner and turn it in next week.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,280
Let’s get to it.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,960
Kongthap,

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,520
can I pair with you?

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,640
Yeah?

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,760
What about Half?

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,680
Why won’t you pair with me?

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
Your face is hard to sketch.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,920
Let me pair with you.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,280
Well.

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,040
Alright.

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,120
Okay.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
It’s a relief that we like different people.

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,680
That I can help you with.

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,640
But don’t you think it’s weird?

29
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,720
Hm?

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
That I like Kongthap.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,360
It’s not weird to like someone, Atom.

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,160
Don’t let that idea get in your head again.

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,320
Well, then.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,680
Kindly advise me, coach.

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,120
Of course.

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,560
The first step in winning someone’s heart:

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,800
write Kongthap's name on your eraser.

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,320
Yes, coach.

39
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,400
The right way to do it is to look at his face throughout the whole process.

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,920
(Kongthap.)

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,400
Crap!

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,800
Let me get it.

43
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,960
What’s next, coach?

44
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,880
Then you must try to use your eraser more often.

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,080
They say the more you use it,

46
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,120
the closer you'll get to the one you like.

47
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,480
Do it.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,920
Keep going.

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,680
Hey.

50
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
That’s Kongthap.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,920
Keep erasing. It might get him to come and talk to you.

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,000
(He looks serious.)

53
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,200
(Probably not the right time to say hi.)

54
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,880
What?

55
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,600
Where did Kongthap go?

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,720
Mudmee, it doesn’t work.

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,160
Maybe you don’t have enough faith.

58
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,480
This thing works on faith.

59
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,040
Let me try it this time.

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,120
Mudmee.

61
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,000
That’s Half.

62
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,800
This is awesome.

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,720
Keep going.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,600
Atom.

65
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,000
Mudmee.

66
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,400
What’s up?

67
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,800
You dropped a pen.

68
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,720
Damn it.

69
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,680
What a waste of time.

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,320
- No more of this nonsense. - Hey.

71
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Let’s sit back down.

72
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Easy there, Mudmee.

73
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,320
At least Half walked in and talked to us.

74
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,920
If we believe in the eraser, good things will come our way.

75
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,800
You’re right.

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,040
- Sadhu. - Sadhu.

77
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Achira, you’ve got 7 out of 30.

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,240
That’s very low.

79
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,440
I hope you do better next time.

80
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,960
Students, work harder and spend more time studying.

81
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,200
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
Atom, how come you got such a low score?

83
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,520
It’s the lowest since I’ve known you.

84
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,360
Exactly.

85
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,800
There have been many things on my mind lately.

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,320
What things?

87
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,880
Why don’t you ask Kongthap how he did?

88
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I did pretty poorly as well.

89
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,800
28 out of 30.

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
What are you, the overpowered?

91
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,480
Haven’t you felt troubled at all?

92
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,600
The midterm exams are in two weeks.

93
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,960
I hope I don’t have to repeat this year.

94
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,920
Half.

95
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
Help me.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,080
I want to, man.

97
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,200
But look at me.

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,880
Why don’t you ask the overpowered for help?

99
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
I can’t even help myself.

100
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,880
Kongthap.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,520
Don’t you have basketball practice?

102
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,600
The coach gave us a break.

103
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
It’s the exam period.

104
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,280
Does that mean you can help us study?

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,960
I can.

106
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,240
But I’m comfortable with calculation-involved subjects.

107
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,360
As for English, you might want to ask somebody else.

108
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,680
Good morning, teacher.

109
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,920
I’m fine. Thank you. And you?

110
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,360
If I’m not mistaken,

111
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,399
Mudmee got the highest mark on the latest English exam.

112
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Serious?

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,000
Mudmee, can you help us study?

114
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,520
Of course.

115
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,320
No problem.

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,400
Mudmee.

117
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,240
- The power of the eraser. - The power of the eraser.

118
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,600
The school library is fully booked around this time.

119
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,600
Should we study at someone’s house not far from school?

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,960
Good idea, but…

121
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
Whose house is nearby?

122
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,520
Half.

123
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,640
We’re here.

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,200
Kongthap came home early to prepare his room.

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,800
He should be done by now.

126
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Let’s just ring the bell.

127
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,520
Atom.

128
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
Is my hair okay? Is it messy?

129
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,160
It is okay.

130
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,880
What’s the matter?

131
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,320
I’m nervous about studying alongside my crush.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
But not as much as you, I bet.

133
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,640
How so?

134
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,640
Because you’re about to walk into Kongthap’s house.

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,600
He’s here.

136
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,880
Atom, let’s try to keep it cool here.

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,200
The Eraser Alliance.

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,800
Let’s go.

139
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,280
This is my room.

140
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,480
A bit untidy.

141
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,400
Thank you so much, Kongthap.

142
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,200
Your room is so nice.

143
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Hey.

144
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,480
Hey, Kongthap.

145
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,320
You’ve got a cat.

146
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,160
Wow, Kongthap.

147
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Cute kitty cat.

148
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,880
Does he have a name?

149
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,880
Mommam.

150
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,960
Mommam, huh?

151
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,200
Hold on.

152
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
Someone left a cat here.

153
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
Let me post its photo in a cat adoption group.

154
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,240
That’s the cat left on the street the other day.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah.

156
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,400
He seems hungry.

157
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,600
Give me a sec.

158
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,480
I couldn’t find him an adopter so I adopted him.

159
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
You don’t have to worry now.

160
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
How nice.

161
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,000
You finally have a house to live in.

162
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,000
Are you happy?

163
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,520
Like the food?

164
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,240
Make yourselves at home.

165
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,880
Hey.

166
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,480
Look.

167
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,680
You also have this?

168
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,960
Mine is a cabbage.

169
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,280
Yours is a carrot?

170
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,000
We’re here to study.

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,200
Stop messing around.

172
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Oh, come on.

173
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
Just a little observation.

174
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,360
Hey.

175
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,080
You’ve got a guitar.

176
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
Do you play?

177
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,000
Can you play for me?

178
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,120
Sorry.

179
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,880
I haven’t played in a long time.

180
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,400
Really?

181
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Will you play for me though?

182
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,640
Just a little.

183
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,720
Yes.

184
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,440
No.

185
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Come on.

186
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,840
No.

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,760
Just the intro is fine.

188
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,680
You two, stop flirting.

189
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,200
Time to study.

190
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,840
What flirting?

191
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,520
We’re not flirting.

192
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
Teacher, which tense should we use in this sentence?

193
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,800
Ah.

194
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,600
You must consider the time word right here.

195
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,760
(Look at these two.)

196
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,240
(They sure have good chemistry.)

197
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,840
(If they start going out one day, it shouldn’t be weird.)

198
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,200
(Unlike…)

199
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,280
(Our chemistry, physics, and biology, are absolute zero.)

200
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,040
(Oh, gosh.)

201
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,400
The drink is out.

202
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,720
Let me go get a refill.

203
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,560
Mudmee.

204
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,280
Hm?

205
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,280
I’ve been wanting to ask you something.

206
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,680
What is it?

207
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,000
Is it about the tense you just asked?

208
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,680
No.

209
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,720
I’d like to know this.

210
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,000
Mhm.

211
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,400
Do you like…

212
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,560
Do you like Kongthap?

213
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,760
What?

214
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,280
You’ve been acting weird ever since you stepped into this house.

215
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,600
You keep fidgeting.

216
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,880
It’s because you are near him, isn’t it?

217
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,400
Hey. It’s none of your business.

218
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,560
Leave her alone.

219
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,320
Just sit there and be quiet.

220
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,880
Why?

221
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:46,159
I asked because I wanted to root for them.

222
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,120
Look at them. They seem like a good match.

223
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,719
- Stop it.
- Let me go.

224
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,159
- Look at them.
- Stop talking.

225
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,080
Actually…

226
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,280
I do like someone.

227
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,480
But he’s not Kongthap.

228
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,480
Is he in our class?

229
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,000
The one I like is…

230
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
is…

231
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,000
is…

232
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,880
The drink is here.

233
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,480
Excuse me. I need to call my mom.

234
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,280
Hold on, Mudmee.

235
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,680
- Mudmee.
- What are you guys doing?

236
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Come on, dude.

237
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,080
Did you have to come back so soon?

238
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,560
I was about to find out.

239
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,360
Find out what?

240
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,280
So Half has never had eyes for me just a bit.

241
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,200
Mudmee, I’m sorry for having such an idiot friend.

242
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,320
I’m quite surprised you like someone like that.

243
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,600
Don’t blame him.

244
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,360
He asked because he meant well.

245
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,800
I know.

246
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,600
I’m here right now because of his kindness.

247
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,558
(High School Admission Exam)

248
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,919
Why today?
(High School Admission Exam)

249
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,279
Why did I have to forget my exam card?
(High School Admission Exam)

250
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,640
(High School Admission Exam)

251
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,920
You’re so heedless, Mudmee.

252
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,360
Gosh, I spent so much time preparing just to forget my card.

253
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,360
Hey.

254
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,280
Yeah?

255
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,560
You okay?

256
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,400
You’re bumping your head against the board.

257
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,800
I’m fine.

258
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,200
I’m just pissed at myself for forgetting the exam card.

259
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,680
No biggie.

260
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,840
I forgot mine too.

261
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,080
Let me talk to the teachers for you.

262
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,200
But I don’t think they will allow us in.

263
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,880
I must go home to get it.

264
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,079
You won’t make it back in time.

265
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,520
What am I supposed to do then?

266
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,400
Rock Paper Scissors!

267
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,640
See?

268
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,400
I won.

269
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,480
I’m a lucky person, you know?

270
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,880
If I talk to them, they’ll surely allow us to take the exam.

271
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,960
Hold on.

272
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,600
What kind of logic is that?

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,680
What does Rock Paper Scissors have to do with anything?

274
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,680
At least it makes you smile.

275
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,480
Huh?

276
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,600
You’re smiling.

277
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,680
Right?

278
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,480
Half kept pleading with the teachers until they let me take the exam.

279
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,240
That’s how I got into this school.

280
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,560
Got it!

281
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,640
Cool, kind, and doesn’t give up easily.

282
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,320
Just like you said.

283
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,200
But he was just being nice.

284
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,680
He didn’t think anything beyond that.

285
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,480
But I'll never forget that moment.

286
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,600
Then we must never give up.

287
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,480
Sure.

288
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,960
I won’t give up.

289
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,040
We should use today’s study group to make progress.

290
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,080
Let’s go back and fight.

291
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,080
Are you ready, Atom?

292
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,720
I am.

293
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,200
Your brain is being destroyed in three, two, one.

294
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,640
Hey.

295
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,160
Are you alright?

296
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,480
Atom.

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,320
Don’t mind him.

298
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,560
This is him when he encounters Math.

299
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
I think I covered all I needed.

300
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,440
I’m gonna take my stuff.

301
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,440
I’m leaving.

302
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:46,760
What?

303
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,560
Leaving already?

304
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,000
Mhm.

305
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,160
Mudmee.

306
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,760
Are you done too?

307
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:51,119
Yes, you are.

308
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,559
You can leave with him.

309
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,480
I’ll stay on and study with Kongthap.

310
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
Uh…

311
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,640
If you say so.

312
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,720
Let me gather my things.

313
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,680
Sure. Take your time.

314
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,760
Yes, you two leave.

315
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,760
Bye.

316
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,800
Mudmee, hurry up.

317
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,760
Get home safe.

318
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,080
I’m done.

319
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,400
I’ll be leaving now.

320
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,000
See you.

321
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,040
I’m taking off now.

322
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,640
See you.

323
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,560
- Bye. - Bye, dude.

324
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,960
Come on.

325
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
What else should we cover?

326
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,840
(Oh shit.)

327
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,800
(I was too busy arranging for Mudmee.)

328
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,280
(I forgot that it’d result in him and me ending up alone.)

329
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,680
Should we get started?

330
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,080
Come on.

331
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,400
Thank you.

332
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,400
I’m sorry about what I asked.

333
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,480
Come to think of it, it was totally inappropriate.

334
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,440
It’s fine.

335
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,960
You just wanted to help.

336
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,200
I understand.

337
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,240
So how will you get home?

338
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,440
You want a ride?

339
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,120
It’s all good.

340
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,280
The main street isn’t that far.

341
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,240
Well, then.

342
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
I’m gonna take off.

343
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,120
Sure.

344
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,160
Ride safe.

345
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,480
Goodbye then.

346
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,800
Hold on, Half.

347
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,040
I’ve changed my mind.

348
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,680
Can you give me a ride to the main street?

349
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,480
Sure. Of course.

350
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,880
Hang tight.

351
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,560
We’re going fast and furious.

352
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,480
Let’s see.

353
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,680
What are you working on?

354
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,480
For this one, you must apply sin(a + b).

355
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,960
Not the one you used.

356
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,680
Atom.

357
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,160
Atom.

358
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,160
Atom!

359
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,400
- Yes? - Were you listening to me?

360
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,680
Who would be able to focus when you were so close?

361
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,280
So what if I was close?

362
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,040
Do you need to ask?

363
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,200
I’m in the room alone with someone I just confessed to.

364
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,600
I’m allowed to get nervous, alright?

365
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,120
Have you forgotten about the eraser thing already?

366
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,120
So it’s just me who’s thinking too much about it.

367
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,200
Not true.

368
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,080
You are all I've been thinking about.

369
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,160
So you’re thinking about me too?

370
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,480
It’s not that.

371
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,680
In my head…

372
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,640
Yeah, it is that.

373
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,960
I don’t know what happened to me.

374
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,600
You've taken up space in my head.

375
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,440
I’m not good at expressing my feelings.

376
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,360
And I don’t know how I should feel.

377
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,840
I’m sorry if I made you feel bad.

378
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,880
It’s fine.

379
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,640
Knowing that you think of me sometimes makes us even.

380
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,320
Even?

381
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,200
Does it mean you think of me all day too?

382
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,000
What?

383
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,080
Well…

384
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,000
I…

385
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,600
I don’t know.

386
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,040
You’re thinking what I’m thinking.

387
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,480
Hey.

388
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Thanks a lot for today.

389
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,360
Sure.

390
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
You can drop by again.

391
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,680
It’s fun.

392
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,400
I will come if I want to.

393
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,040
Hey, Thap.

394
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
You have a friend over?

395
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,480
Yes, Mom.

396
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,840
We had a study group today.

397
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,200
This is Atom.

398
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,880
Hello, ma’am.

399
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,520
Hello.

400
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,000
Wait a minute.

401
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,160
Were you in the play Destirella?

402
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,000
Ah.

403
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,240
Look.

404
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,160
Yes, ma’am.

405
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:36,600
But how did you get that photo?

406
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Thap sent it to me so I saved it.

407
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,120
You’re so much cuter in person.

408
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,000
I am flattered, ma’am.

409
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,880
Thap, why didn’t you tell me you were close?

410
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,440
I could’ve invited him over for food.

411
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
We’re not that close.

412
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,960
We’re just classmates.

413
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,600
Well, get home safe.

414
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,799
Next time I’ll make you something delicious.

415
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,480
Okay?

416
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,880
Yes, ma’am.

417
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,040
Excuse me.

418
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,080
Wait.

419
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,200
What’s the matter?

420
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,440
Why do you care?

421
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,280
We’re just classmates, aren’t we?

422
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,960
Do you think we’re friends already?

423
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,840
What do you think then?

424
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,680
Why do you care?

425
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,400
We’re just classmates, aren’t we?

426
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,680
(I have no problem being friends with Atom.)

427
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,720
(But boyfriend…)

428
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,120
(You are… Sodium Radium Potassium.)

429
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,960
Cute?

430
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,880
(It’s weird.)

431
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,960
(Us together?)

432
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,840
(I just can’t picture it.)

433
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,000
(But now that I think about it, sometimes Atom is…)

434
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,400
Hey.

435
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,960
How long are you gonna keep staring?

436
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,760
I can’t sketch without staring at you.

437
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,960
Just sketch.

438
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,000
Whoa.

439
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,920
You can’t be good at everything.

440
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,160
What?

441
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,960
Anyone can do it if they have a model.

442
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,240
Let me see yours.

443
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,800
Hey.

444
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,520
Is that me?

445
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,520
So that carrot root is my chin?

446
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,760
Come on.

447
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,360
There’s no carrot in it.

448
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,800
I worked so hard for it.

449
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,680
What are you doing?

450
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,000
Can we switch partners?

451
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,680
What’s your problem now?

452
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,160
I’m about to finish.

453
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,960
Look.

454
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,000
Screw it!

455
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,680
What’s wrong with Atom lately?

456
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,200
He used to be a lot cuter.

457
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,480
Ah!

458
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,600
I got it.

459
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,280
‘Cute’ is the word.

460
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
Do you think Atom is cute too?

461
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,400
Oh.

462
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,960
What I meant was he has never been whiny like this.

463
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
I don’t mean cute in a romantic way.

464
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,680
Yeah?

465
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,600
Don’t tell me you think he’s cute, as in romantically.

466
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,320
There.

467
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,840
You asked me once about whom he liked.

468
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,040
You like him, don’t you?

469
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,159
You’re avoiding eye contact.

470
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,000
You like Atom, huh?

471
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
Atom, you’ve got a problem.

472
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Hold on!

473
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,880
Come here.

474
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,640
What?

475
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,200
Keep calm and listen to me.

476
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,280
Kongthap likes you.

477
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,000
What?

478
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,000
So the eraser you borrowed had Kongthap’s name on it.

479
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,960
Then he misunderstood and thought you liked him.

480
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,200
That’s right.

481
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,160
And he’s a good person.

482
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,480
He takes this stuff seriously.

483
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,800
That’s why he asked you that weird question.

484
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,880
I think you should tell him the truth.

485
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,600
What truth?

486
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,200
That everything is just a misunderstanding.

487
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,360
You don’t have feelings for him, right?

488
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,280
Uh...

489
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,800
- Actually... - Okay.

490
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,920
If you’re afraid, I’ll go with you.

491
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,560
Then you can stop stressing out about it.

492
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,800
Alright?

493
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,960
Thanks, man.

494
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,480
But it’s my problem.

495
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
I should be the one to fix it.

496
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,360
Bye for now.

497
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,000
Okay.

498
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,680
Gosh, what should I do?

499
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,640
I can’t stop thinking about him.

500
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,880
Count sheep.

501
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,800
One sheep.

502
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,000
Two sheep.

503
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
Three Kongthaps.

504
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,200
Four Kongthaps.

505
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,280
Damn.

506
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,800
A fever?

507
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,280
(Yeah.)

508
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,400
(I stayed up late last night.)

509
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,440
(Will you save me the worksheets?)

510
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,160
Yeah, no problem.

511
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,080
Are you sure you're not feeling sick from overthinking about Kongthap?

512
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,280
No.

513
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,240
I just stayed up late playing video games.

514
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,480
I’m hanging up.

515
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Gosh!

516
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,920
(Sorry, son.)

517
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,679
(I’m working overtime tonight.)

518
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,520
(I won't be home in time to make your dinner.)

519
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,640
It’s okay, Mom.

520
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,280
I rested quite well.

521
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,080
I’m feeling much better now.

522
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,480
(I ordered rice porridge for you though.)

523
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,760
(Should be on its way.)

524
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,400
Okay, Mom.

525
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,840
I think it’s here now.

526
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,600
I’ll talk to you later.

527
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,200
Gosh!

528
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,760
I just met the delivery man.

529
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,960
He left the rice porridge with me.

530
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,120
What brings you here?

531
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,280
Half shared with me your house location.

532
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,680
We have to turn in the sketch tomorrow.

533
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,720
I came to be your model.

534
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,080
Oh.

535
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,159
Sorry. My room is a bit messy.

536
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,680
You didn’t say you were coming.

537
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,000
Sorry about that.

538
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,240
How’s your fever?

539
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,600
Oh, please.

540
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,000
You’re already here.

541
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,400
Do you still need to ask?

542
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,200
I’m much better now.

543
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,040
Actually, you could’ve just taken a photo and sent it to me.

544
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,080
Your face, I mean.

545
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,880
You didn’t have to come all the way here.

546
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,600
Yes, you’re right.

547
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,080
I’ll take a photo and leave then.

548
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,960
Wait.

549
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,480
You can stay.

550
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,880
I mean let’s sketch here.

551
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,640
Since you’re here already, we should get it over with.

552
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,800
You’ve already come.

553
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Have a seat.

554
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,200
Let’s do it.

555
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,200
I’m done.

556
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,080
Oh, come on.

557
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,560
Are you trying to pick a fight?

558
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,280
What?

559
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,720
You gave me a carrot head before.

560
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,400
I’ll show you the real one.

561
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,240
No, don’t.

562
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,720
I don’t wanna feel discouraged.

563
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,160
Why?

564
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,480
Are you struggling?

565
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,480
Can I see?

566
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,400
Nope.

567
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,400
Can you just sit still?

568
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,760
You can see it after I finish it.

569
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Can you say something?

570
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,600
Why?

571
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,320
It’s too quiet I can’t draw.

572
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,200
Okay.

573
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,600
Just one second.

574
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,520
 It might be because we locked eyes on that day 

575
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,600
 My heart began to sway 

576
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,200
 Is it you or something else, I can't say 

577
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,040
 Was it mere coincidence or a plan from the skies above? 

578
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,560
 Just having you so close 

579
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,880
 Do you know my heart's never felt this way before? 

580
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,160
 It's like a spell's been cast over me 

581
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,799
 Every second has a new meaning suddenly 

582
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,480
 When you stepped in and changed my life eternally 

583
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,199
 I don't know if it's a little thing called love 

584
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,040
 This feeling that's building up inside our hearts 

585
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,680
 The little thing we shared that day 

586
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,440
 Started from nothing and grew in every way 

587
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,559
 As long as I have you by my side 

588
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,320
 No matter where this world takes us on a ride 

589
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,280
 My arms will hold you tight 

590
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,280
 You’ve been on my mind 

591
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,360
(Kongthap)

592
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,400
I’m done.

593
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,680
Take a look if you want to.

594
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,400
Let’s see.

595
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Just so you know, this is the best I can do.

596
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,680
It’s a lot better.

597
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,600
At least I don’t have a carrot head anymore.

598
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
I’m just holding a carrot instead.

599
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,600
That’s not a carrot.

600
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,880
It’s a guitar.

601
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,400
Right.

602
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,480
I see.

603
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,080
Since we’re done here, it’s time for me to go home.

604
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,080
Whoa. It’s 11.

605
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,680
I’m sorry. I worked too slow.

606
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,840
It’s all fine.

607
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,760
I biked here. I can bike home.

608
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,200
Kongthap.

609
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,280
Riding a bicycle late at night isn’t safe.

610
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,480
What should we do?

611
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,600
Mom isn’t here to take you home.

612
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,000
How about…

613
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,000
you spend the night here?

614
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,120
You can go home tomorrow.

615
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,000
Hey.

616
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,560
Is the tee too tight for you?

617
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,920
It’s all right.

618
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Will you be able to sleep?

619
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,520
Of course. No problem.

620
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,760
Good night then.

621
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,200
It’s so quiet at night.

622
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,640
Should I play guitar for you?

623
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,400
No.

624
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:14,600
I was just saying.

625
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,400
Never knew you played guitar too.

626
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,920
No, I don’t.

627
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,280
You got a badminton racket from your dad as a birthday present.

628
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,920
Mine was a guitar.

629
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,600
He told me he’d teach me when he had time.

630
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,800
Is he busy with work?

631
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,600
I don’t know.

632
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,960
One morning, my dad gathered his things and left the house.

633
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,840
He left Mom crying all alone.

634
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,280
I’ve never seen him again since.

635
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,200
You know, it took so long for my mom to smile again.

636
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,160
Mom has never spoken about Dad again.

637
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,040
My dad is a funny guy though.

638
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,880
He’s the only one who can make my mom laugh all day.

639
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,400
He’s also the only one who can make her cry.

640
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,280
Sometimes I feel like love is so scary.

641
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,280
Yeah.

642
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,200
That’s true.

643
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,000
My dad mostly works in Japan.

644
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,880
He comes home only a few times a year.

645
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,600
Sometimes at night,

646
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,400
my mother goes through their wedding photo album

647
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,240
and cries because she misses him.

648
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,800
That’s different.

649
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,960
Your mom cries because she misses your dad.

650
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Are you boasting?

651
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,040
No, I’m not.

652
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,200
I’m sorry if I made you feel bad.

653
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,680
It’s alright.

654
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:53,400
At least we know that love isn’t always bad

655
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,880
if we find the right one.

656
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,080
The right one.

657
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,200
Atom.

658
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,080
Hey.

659
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,920
Mom.

660
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,320
Hi, ma’am.

661
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,160
You’re still up.

662
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,080
Your friend?

663
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,040
I’m Kongthap.

664
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,200
I’m…

665
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,000
Atom’s friend.

666
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,400
We worked on the assignment until late.

667
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,440
So Atom asked me to stay over.

668
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,600
I see.

669
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,800
Atom.

670
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,000
How’s your fever?

671
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,160
Your face is still red.

672
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,480
You haven’t fully recovered, right?

673
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,400
I’m feeling better now, Mom.

674
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,400
Get some rest and get well soon then.

675
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,600
Kongthap.

676
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,560
Stay for breakfast before you leave.

677
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,400
Yes, ma’am.

678
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,760
I am off to bed then.

679
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,600
Good night, ma’am.

680
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,480
Good night.

681
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,400
Hey.

682
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,000
You said we are friends.

683
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,240
I’m spending the night at your place.

684
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,880
Of course, we’re friends.

685
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,040
Well.

686
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,400
I went to your house to study, but you didn’t say we’re friends.

687
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,520
I didn’t know how you felt then.

688
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,240
That’s why I told my mom so.

689
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,920
Actually, I have thought of you as a friend for so long.

690
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,760
Yeah?

691
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,480
Oh.

692
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,160
No?

693
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,400
I guess you think of me as more than a friend, right?

694
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,280
Oh.

695
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,480
Stop it.

696
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:58,960
I’m sleepy.

697
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,840
I’m going to sleep.

698
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,280
No?

699
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,480
Did I say something wrong?

700
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,600
Did I say something wrong?

701
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,280
Stop talking.

702
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,080
Atom.

703
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,800
Be quiet.

704
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:37,840
(I can’t believe the person who made me think too much and feel sick was also the one who gave me a nice dream.)

705
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,480
(Is this what they call love?)

706
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,800
Of course, it is love, Atom.

707
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,800
Nothing can be more obvious than this.

708
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,200
I believe this is the power of the eraser.

709
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,600
Thanks, Mudmee.

710
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,880
You’re so welcome, Atom.

711
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,800
Wait.

712
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,960
Given how well it’s working for you,

713
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,960
mine will probably be just as successful.

714
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,880
Gosh, I’m so excited.

715
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,480
There you are.

716
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,800
- Speaking of the devil. - Been looking for you.

717
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,759
I’ve talked to him for you. Follow me.

718
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,400
- What? - Come!

719
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,280
Where are you taking me?

720
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,440
He talked to who?

721
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,840
I don’t want my friend to get sick again.

722
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,800
Let me help you.

723
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,840
Half said you wanted to clear things out.

724
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,640
Tell him it’s all a misunderstanding.

725
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Is there anything you want to say?

726
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,200
Well…

727
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,440
I…

728
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,560
I…

729
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,359
Someone just confessed to me.

730
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,519
Don’t tell me…

731
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,999
You like them already.

732
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,920
It’s my old jersey.

733
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
Wear it while cheering.

734
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,639
You will look like the team manager.

735
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,400
Kongthap.

736
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:33,839
We finally meet again.

737
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,079
“If I win, you must go out with me”

738
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,399
That’s the only way to win over Kongthap.

739
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,479
You’re my close friend no matter what.

740
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,879
From now on, I will help you win Kongthap’s heart.

741
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,519
(Please, Eraser.)

742
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,919
(If we are truly soulmates,

743
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,800
give me the power to make it there in time.)
