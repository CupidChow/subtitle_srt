1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,000
I’m nervous about studying alongside my crush.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,620
But not as much as you, I bet.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,760
You’re about to walk into Kongthap’s house.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,150
You didn’t tell me you were close.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,700
I could’ve invited him over for food.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,900
We’re just classmates.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,860
What’s wrong with Atom lately?

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,200
He used to be a lot cuter.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,210
Do you think Atom is cute too?

10
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,700
Atom, you’ve got a problem.

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,200
Kongthap likes you.

12
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,450
Let me help you.

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,010
Tell him it’s all a misunderstanding.

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,010
Half said you wanted to clear things out.

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,460
Well…

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,070
I…

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,300
I…

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,930
Gosh.

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,170
If you can’t, I’ll speak for you.

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,070
That eraser thing was all a misunderstanding.

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,310
It wasn’t Atom’s.

22
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,230
He didn’t know how to tell you.

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,900
There.

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,500
I started it.

25
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,300
You carry on with the rest.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,300
Hey.

27
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,150
I’m sorry for not telling you this from the beginning.

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,460
No need to apologize.

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,330
I was wrong too for jumping to conclusions too quickly.

30
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,460
Is it because I’m too serious?

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,650
Is that why you didn’t tell me anything?

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,860
Hey.

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,050
It’s not like that.

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,270
Let’s forget it.

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,300
Good to know that it was a misunderstanding.

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,550
What a relief.

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,120
I’m off to basketball practice.

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,110
See you.

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,800
(What a sucker I am.)

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:23,160
(If I’m too afraid to tell him, I might as well end things here.)

41
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,200
What?

42
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,820
Kongthap knows the truth?

43
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,480
Yeah.

44
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,060
It’s my fault for not telling the truth from the start.

45
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,610
Serves me right.

46
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,030
Atom.

47
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,600
A loser like me deserves to be left behind.

48
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,550
Mudmee.

49
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,520
Hm?

50
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,560
Any more garbage?

51
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,730
No.

52
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,830
If there is, throw it at me.

53
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,730
I’m just a trash can.

54
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,400
Hey, do not think of yourself that way.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,660
You’re not a loser, Atom.

56
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,610
You were just trying to keep the promise about the name on my eraser.

57
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,510
From now on, I’ll try to get over him.

58
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,600
I will try to be his friend.

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,830
Let’s…

60
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,170
end The Eraser Alliance here.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,910
Hey.

62
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,260
It's all down to you now, Mudmee.

63
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,030
Atom, hold on.

64
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,970
Don’t put pressure on me like that.

65
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,320
Atom.

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,160
Atom.

67
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,520
Where are you?

68
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,880
Don’t give up just yet.

69
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,900
Oops. Sorry.

70
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,810
Sorry. Are you okay?

71
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,980
I am.

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,210
Have you seen Atom?

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,620
I don’t know where he went.

74
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,310
What’s going on?

75
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,910
Long story.

76
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,060
Is he still overthinking about Kongthap?

77
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,310
He is.

78
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,140
You see.

79
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,060
If he’d listened to me and told him the truth from the start,

80
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,670
it would’ve been over long ago.

81
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,710
Half.

82
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,470
Not everything is easy to say.

83
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,650
It depends on the situation and the listener’s disposition.

84
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,660
I’m not saying it’s easy.

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,600
But there shouldn’t be excuses not to tell.

86
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,860
Well, he sucks.

87
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,700
He’s facing the consequences.

88
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,850
Serves him right.

89
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,850
Don’t feel sorry for him.

90
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,000
That unworthy deserves to be left alone.

91
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,600
Mudmee, why did you slap me?

92
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,610
It’s not like everyone is as brave as you.

93
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,740
I thought you were more considerate of other people’s feelings.

94
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,500
Now I know I thought wrong.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,160
It’s you!

96
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,700
The reason Mudmee slapped me.

97
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,050
What?

98
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,310
I was complaining about your overthought on Kongthap.

99
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,880
The next thing I knew,

100
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,510
my face was numb.

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,900
Well-deserved.

102
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,910
But that’s how I realized the truth.

103
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,870
I now know why Mudmee was so mad.

104
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,800
You know it?

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,360
Yes, I do.

106
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,490
Mudmee likes you, doesn’t she?

107
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,970
That’s why she was furious.

108
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,706
Don’t say that to her, okay?

109
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:18,608
Idiot.

110
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,060
What is it then?

111
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,900
Is it because Mudmee likes Kongthap?

112
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:27,400
- Must be that. - Half.

113
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,310
I’m not talking to you, dumbass.

114
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,650
Why is she mad then?

115
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,210
Come back and tell me.

116
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,510
Atom!

117
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,700
Atom.

118
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,760
The mid-term exam results are out.

119
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,260
You can see them in the group chat.

120
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,910
Please let me pass.

121
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,150
Sadhu.

122
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,000
Hey!

123
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,860
Did you fail?

124
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,090
I did.

125
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,990
What?

126
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,970
I mean I did it!

127
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,740
I got 16 out of 20 in Math.

128
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,200
Really?

129
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,520
Congrats.

130
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,820
You did much better this time.

131
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,810
Kongthap.

132
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,820
I passed the exams.

133
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,810
Congratulations.

134
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,110
Thanks a lot for tutoring me.

135
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,700
(Keep it together.)

136
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,420
(You said you would get over him.)

137
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,900
(But he’s sitting too close.)

138
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,320
(How can I forget about him?)

139
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,810
Guys, the teacher reseated us depending on the exam scores.

140
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,130
Come and take a look where you’ll be sitting.

141
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,240
Whoa. We are on different sides of the room.

142
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,400
That’s good.

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,100
That way, you will not be bothered by me.

144
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,150
Anyway, thank you so much for all the help.

145
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,480
Good luck.

146
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,210
Yo!

147
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,260
Next to each other again.

148
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,370
Aren’t we soulmates?

149
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,400
Are you even seeing me?

150
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,690
Am I in your sight?

151
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,150
Good job everyone.

152
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,900
Let’s take a short break.

153
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,120
Ready?

154
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,860
For what? I just sat down.

155
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,900
No, I meant are you ready to tell me what’s bothering you?

156
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,860
I, as the captain, know that my player is feeling troubled.

157
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,370
Uh…

158
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,800
Are you worried about the upcoming match?

159
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,730
No.

160
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,460
Someone just confessed to me.

161
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,210
Oh?

162
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,110
Didn’t see that coming.

163
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,160
I was trying to get the answer for them.

164
00:10:51,200 --> 00:11:01,410
But while I was looking for it, the person told me it was just a misunderstanding.

165
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,610
Sounds like an ending to me.

166
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,750
Why are you still thinking about it?

167
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,460
Exactly the question.

168
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,700
Why?

169
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,210
Don’t tell me…

170
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,610
you like them already.

171
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,350
I don’t know.

172
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,060
I’ve never liked anyone before.

173
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,310
And I don’t know how people feel when they like someone.

174
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,800
Do you know?

175
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,340
I…

176
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,900
have no idea either.

177
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,140
But…

178
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,650
my little sister loves watching romantic series.

179
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,910
I’ll get the info from her for you.

180
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,350
Don’t think too much.

181
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,970
Sir, I wasn’t cheating.

182
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,040
Mr. Pongsate is suspecting.

183
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,300
Since the last time you failed.

184
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,240
But this time, you nearly got the full score.

185
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,980
I wasn’t copying anyone's answers.

186
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,410
But I had some help with studying.

187
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,300
Can you bring the one that helped you to see me then?

188
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,260
I tutored him, sir.

189
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,610
Besides, Atom isn’t the type that cheats.

190
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,970
I can guarantee that.

191
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,910
Here is the parental approval paperwork for us to compete off-campus.

192
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,610
Thanks a lot.

193
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,160
As for Atom, I’ll explain it to your teacher.

194
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,780
Sorry if I startled you.

195
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,400
Will you please excuse me, sir?

196
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,400
Hold on.

197
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,560
You guys studied together.

198
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,300
You must be quite tight, right?

199
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,500
Ah…

200
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,260
That’s right, sir.

201
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,110
Why do you ask?

202
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,960
Very good.

203
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,670
Our basketball team needs your help, Atom.

204
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,320
I've been quite overwhelmed by the teacher evaluation.

205
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,070
And next week, we’re playing a friendly match against Burapha Piroon.

206
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,800
So I brought our interim team manager to present you all.

207
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,050
Come.

208
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,970
Introduce yourself.

209
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,610
Hi.

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,700
I’m Atom.

211
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,850
It’s very nice to meet you all.

212
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:41,979
You can do it.

213
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,460
Guys, your water is here.

214
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,660
Thanks a lot.

215
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,980
But next time, can we get sports drinks and refreshing towels too?

216
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,250
Oh.

217
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,280
Of course.

218
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,470
Boo!

219
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,100
Hey!

220
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,100
I knew you wouldn’t give up so easily.

221
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,700
You became team manager because you haven’t gotten over Kongthap, right?

222
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:32,810
Mudmee.

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,160
You’re wrong.

224
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
Mr. Suea put me in this position.

225
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,670
I don’t even want to look at Kongthap’s face.

226
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,410
But Kongthap is performing fantastically at the moment.

227
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,980
Don’t fool me, Mudmee.

228
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,030
No kidding. Turn and take a look.

229
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,220
Yes!

230
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,740
He’s so good.

231
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,070
Atom.

232
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,410
Listen to me.

233
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,810
Stop lying to yourself.

234
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,700
It’s fine if you want to get over him.

235
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,540
But if you can’t, I got you some help.

236
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,260
Here you go.

237
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,930
What is it?

238
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,500
I checked the horoscope.

239
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,990
It said that the auspicious color for love today was yellow.

240
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,200
So I gathered a lot of yellow items here for you.

241
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,140
Here.

242
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,210
Atom.

243
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,810
We still need one more bottle of water.

244
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,210
Can you get it for Kongthap?

245
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,910
What?

246
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,280
Come on.

247
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,020
Mudmee.

248
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,160
You said it was auspicious.

249
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,770
It is, Atom.

250
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,420
It’s your chance to make progress.

251
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,330
Take this with you all the time.

252
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,810
It will turn bad luck into good luck.

253
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,070
Keep fighting, Atom.

254
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,260
I’m going back to my club.

255
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,010
You should go get a drink for Kongthap.

256
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,160
I think all drink stores are closing soon.

257
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,210
Here.

258
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,210
Thank you in advance.

259
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,470
Sure.

260
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,680
I’ll be right back.

261
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,570
Miss, can I please get one of those?

262
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,550
We’re closed.

263
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,200
What?

264
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,290
Can’t I get just one more?

265
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,290
My friend has just finished his basketball practice.

266
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,520
It will freshen him up.

267
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,600
Fine. Make it quick.

268
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,220
What are you looking for? The money?

269
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,970
Have you found it?

270
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,080
I need to go.

271
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,270
Can I scan the code instead?

272
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,660
You better hurry.

273
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,470
No phone?

274
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,300
I guess I left it at the court.

275
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,200
I have to go. I’m picking up my kid at school.

276
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,303
You’re making me late.

277
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:07,980
Time is of the essence, boy.

278
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,320
Atom.

279
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,970
Why?

280
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,670
Why can’t you perform this easy task?

281
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,620
Hm?

282
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,980
What’s happened?

283
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,310
You’ve been gone for so long.

284
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,700
You.

285
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,230
I’m sorry.

286
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,480
I lost your coins.

287
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,410
Hey.

288
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,500
Is this for me?

289
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,600
Thanks.

290
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,700
I checked the horoscope.

291
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,110
It said that the auspicious color for love today was yellow.

292
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,400
So I gathered a lot of yellow items here for you.

293
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,000
Hey.

294
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,110
Don’t thank me.

295
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I should be the one thanking you.

296
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,770
For confirming I didn’t cheat.

297
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,210
Your life is pretty chaotic.

298
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,610
Was that a compliment or criticism?

299
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,670
Next time, don’t help.

300
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,840
Disagree.

301
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,970
We’ve been in the same boat.

302
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,810
I can’t just stand by.

303
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,160
Oops.

304
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,780
Let me get it.

305
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,530
It’s fine.

306
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,210
Sorry.

307
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,300
Hey, it’s the coin.

308
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,850
I’ve been looking for it.

309
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,380
Yellow really is auspicious.

310
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,700
She was right.

311
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,620
You guys can go.

312
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,760
I’ll leave after it’s all baked.

313
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,800
Alright.

314
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,900
We should get going then.

315
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,100
- Get home safe. - See you.

316
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,970
- Let’s see. - Bye.

317
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,810
Seven minutes.

318
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,810
Good timing.

319
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,410
Jeez!

320
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,500
What are you doing here, Half?

321
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,500
Why did you slap me?

322
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,640
I won’t apologize no matter what.

323
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,980
Does Atom really like Kongthap?

324
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,210
I knew it.

325
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,900
It’s obvious now.

326
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,510
So unbecoming.

327
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,700
Unbecoming?

328
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,560
How could you say such a mean thing about Atom?

329
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,320
Tell me honestly.

330
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,700
Do you really like Kongthap?

331
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,100
Your expression gave it away. I’m right, aren’t I?

332
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,710
You know, Mudmee almost slapped me again because of you.

333
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,950
Unbecoming?

334
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,070
How could you say such a mean thing about Atom?

335
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,310
I didn’t mean it the way you think.

336
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,010
I meant it was unbecoming of me to say those things to him.

337
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,910
I even urged him to get over Kongthap.

338
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,810
Gosh.

339
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,910
What a horrible friend I am.

340
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,100
No wonder why he doesn’t tell me things.

341
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,630
Half.

342
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,710
I don’t think that’s the case.

343
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,610
To Atom, you’re such an important friend.

344
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,700
That’s why he didn’t tell you straight up.

345
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,250
He’s afraid he’d lose you.

346
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,270
Yes, I like Kongthap.

347
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,300
Now that you know,

348
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,100
will you be okay with me?

349
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,030
Atom.

350
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,520
You are normal.

351
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,060
People who think this stuff is abnormal are abnormal.

352
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,250
You’re my close friend no matter what.

353
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,310
Damn, I feel so bad.

354
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,610
Will you just punch me?

355
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,520
Hit me.

356
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,190
Right here.

357
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,100
Are you nuts?

358
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,700
I’m not mad at you.

359
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:17,780
Seriously?

360
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,400
Seriously.

361
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,590
Normally, you're pretty laid-back.

362
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,600
This is the first time I've seen you become serious.

363
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,310
Sorry about that.

364
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,020
From now on, I will help you win Kongthap’s heart.

365
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,510
Okay?

366
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,100
Let’s start with this.

367
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,150
Mudmee asked me to give you this eraser.

368
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,760
There’s a message too.

369
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,440
She said,

370
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,470
“The Eraser Alliance, keep going.”

371
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,310
What does it even mean?

372
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,130
I don’t know.

373
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,810
No idea.

374
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,090
No clue.

375
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,900
Not a clue.

376
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,640
It probably means “Don’t give up.”

377
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,970
I think.

378
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,740
See you.

379
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,210
Okay.

380
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:52,170
BURAPHA PIROON SCHOOL

381
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,761
Okay.

382
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,540
Guys.

383
00:23:59,010 --> 00:23:59,830
Get off the bus.

384
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,060
Come. Come.

385
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,220
I did my homework to find out where the locker room was.

386
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,220
Follow me.

387
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,400
That way.

388
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,400
Wait a second.

389
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,700
I want you to lead, but this is Kongthap and Khao-pan’s old school.

390
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,970
What?

391
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,980
Why didn’t you tell me, sir?

392
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,440
I wanted to see you do that.

393
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,220
Follow me.

394
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,620
I’ll take you to the place with the best food.

395
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,080
No.

396
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,350
This way.

397
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,610
What?

398
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,510
Are you adding insult to injury?

399
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,210
I’m not.

400
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,660
I’m giving you a jersey.

401
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,310
It’s my old jersey.

402
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,250
Wear it while cheering.

403
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,010
You will look like the team manager.

404
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,700
Thanks.

405
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,640
Kongthap.

406
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,160
Hi, Clair.

407
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,160
We finally meet again.

408
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,900
The three of us played basketball together

409
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,700
until Kongthap and I transferred to a new school in Grade 10.

410
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,970
So it's only Clair who's still playing here.

411
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,270
I’m the team captain now.

412
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,910
Not surprised. You’ve been very skilled.

413
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:38,720
Yes?

414
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,600
Are you the manager?

415
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,280
I am.

416
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,620
Just temporarily though.

417
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,970
Must be tiring being with these two, yeah?

418
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,550
They are real geeks.

419
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,800
They used to be Slam Dunk geeks.

420
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,980
We aren’t.

421
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,700
- Watch your words. - It’s true.

422
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,120
You guys liked to quote the main character’s phrase.

423
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,530
The left hand, something.

424
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,410
“The left hand is just for holding the ball.”

425
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,040
There it is.

426
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,700
See?

427
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,580
What a geek.

428
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,850
The hand celebration.

429
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,980
- So cool. - So cool.

430
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,870
Stop it.

431
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,110
By the way, Kongthap.

432
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,110
Don’t forget.

433
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,500
We need to talk after the match.

434
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,530
Are you never gonna quit that?

435
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,660
Khao-pan.

436
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,910
What’s up with those two?

437
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,400
I don’t know.

438
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,760
Clair consistently challenges Kongthap to a one-on-one basketball game whenever they meet.

439
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,700
Thap said that they had a bet.

440
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,700
What bet?

441
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,580
What else can it be?

442
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,560
Here’s what I think.

443
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,970
“If I win, you must go out with me, Kongthap.”

444
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,120
Gosh.

445
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,860
That’s the only way for someone combative like Clair to win over Kongthap.

446
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,010
My treat.

447
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,540
Why treating me?

448
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,900
Because you helped bring me back to my senses.

449
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,250
Ah.

450
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,630
I already talked things out with Atom.

451
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,110
Really?

452
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,160
That’s great.

453
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,200
If you hadn't hit me that day, I wouldn't have realized it.

454
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,620
Maybe I should let you slap me more often.

455
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,500
Hey.

456
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,980
I’m sorry. I was joking.

457
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,700
Did it hurt?

458
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,110
I’m sorry.

459
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,800
It’s fine.

460
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,220
I deserved that slap.

461
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,140
Drink.

462
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,460
While it’s still cold.

463
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,820
I should get going.

464
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,970
Yeah.

465
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,860
I won’t bother you now.

466
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,050
Bye.

467
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,310
Let’s warm up.

468
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,510
Then line up and practice layups.

469
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,060
Let’s go.

470
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,120
Keep it up, boys.

471
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,850
Sorry.

472
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,060
That’s mine.

473
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,510
Yeah?

474
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,860
Hey, Kongthap.

475
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,800
I…

476
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,500
Kongthap.

477
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:57,005
Yeah?

478
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,010
Still using the towel I bought you?

479
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:02,780
Yes.

480
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:03,800
Why?

481
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,090
So old.

482
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,410
Want a new one yet?

483
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,500
No.

484
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,470
It’s still useable.

485
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,700
Fine then.

486
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,560
Atom, you were saying?

487
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:13,970
Ah.

488
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,120
They’re lining up.

489
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,440
You should get going.

490
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,510
Alright.

491
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,380
See you.

492
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,400
Go kill, buddy.

493
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,710
Atom, are you and Kongthap close?

494
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,100
Why would you think so?

495
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,460
You’re wearing Kongthap’s jersey.

496
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,430
Am I wrong?

497
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,100
Ah.

498
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,710
Kongthap let me borrow it.

499
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,260
You’re the one really close to him.

500
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,920
We are.

501
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,020
The three of us had gone to elementary school together.

502
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,900
I know every thought in Kongthap’s head.

503
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,160
Can you tell what he’s going to do with that play?

504
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,250
He’ll pretend to pass

505
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,600
but actually shoots the ball himself.

506
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,220
See?

507
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,140
That’s a lucky guess.

508
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,600
We can try again if you want.

509
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,200
He is being tailed.

510
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,510
He will pass the ball for sure.

511
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,220
Not yet.

512
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,566
That’s not gonna stop him.

513
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,340
He passes the ball now instead.

514
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,000
Good job.

515
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,810
People believe he is calm and collected.

516
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,510
But I know,

517
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,140
when he touches a basketball, he transforms into a different person.

518
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,430
Guys.

519
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,070
Well done today.

520
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,260
You made the host go quiet.

521
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,100
Let’s go.

522
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,040
Get home and rest.

523
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,260
Awesome, guys.

524
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,080
Get on the bus.

525
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,900
You did great.

526
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,800
Hey.

527
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,810
Are you not coming?

528
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,610
I have some business with Clair.

529
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,800
You guys go ahead.

530
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,010
I’ll find the way home myself.

531
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,200
Hey.

532
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,340
This is it.

533
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,510
Those two are going to confess for sure.

534
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,300
Seriously?

535
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,060
Do you have to do this much for love?

536
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,000
I do.

537
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,450
Different schools are not gonna change my mind.

538
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,500
Keep your word.

539
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,060
If I win, you must do as promised.

540
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,720
Sure.

541
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,310
You go first.

542
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,180
They have been competing countless times.

543
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,620
One of these days, Kongthap is going to lose.

544
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,970
It’s probably today.

545
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:10,730
No losing.

546
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,330
What?

547
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:16,200
I just realized I left my phone there.

548
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,110
Excuse me.

549
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,120
Please stop the bus.

550
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,360
I need to go back to get my stuff.

551
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,170
(Please, Eraser.)

552
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,170
(If we are truly soulmates,

553
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,760
give me the power to make it there in time.)

554
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,950
Hey.

555
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,970
What are you doing?

556
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,300
I’m sorry.

557
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,020
I really can’t let you win.

558
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,470
Why?

559
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,190
Are you saying…

560
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:58,810
Yes.

561
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,310
You like Khao-pan too?

562
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,560
Wait.

563
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,950
No!

564
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,820
Didn’t you play in order to be with Kongthap?

565
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,080
No.

566
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,700
My bet was that if I won, Kongthap would help me pursue Khao-pan.

567
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,170
What?

568
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,310
Here’s the thing.

569
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,370
Khao-pan and I have been close friends for so long.

570
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,300
I can’t just hit on him. That would be weird.

571
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,980
So I asked Kongthap for help but he kept dodging me.

572
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,500
Because I’m not good at this stuff.

573
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,320
Why don’t you do it yourself if you’re so good?

574
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,060
I wouldn’t have asked for your help if it was that easy, would I?

575
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,760
Even when I wanted to buy him a towel, I had to buy one for you too just to cover up.

576
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,460
Sorry.

577
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,390
That’s mine.

578
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,800
So…

579
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,100
I got it all wrong?

580
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,430
Wait a minute.

581
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,200
If you don’t like Khao-pan, then why did you block my shoot?

582
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:07,210
Well...

583
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:10,610
I was just passing by and wanting to play with you.

584
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,520
Nothing more.

585
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,800
Nothing.

586
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,910
Nothing at all.

587
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,810
Atom.

588
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,610
You left your phone on the bus.

589
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,390
The coach told the driver to turn around.

590
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:23,979
Oh, really?

591
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,910
Will you excuse me?

592
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,210
Sorry for interrupting.

593
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,160
Let’s go.

594
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,850
Bye-bye, Clair.

595
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,100
What now?

596
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,200
Want to continue?

597
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,570
No. The vibe got killed.

598
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,300
You should go with your friends.

599
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,650
You sure?

600
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,410
Yeah.

601
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,730
On second thought,

602
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:52,900
it’s my business.

603
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,310
I should deal with it myself.

604
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,510
I won’t bother you anymore.

605
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,300
Hey.

606
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,260
I’m wondering something.

607
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,000
When you like Khao-pan, how do you feel?

608
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,000
It’s hot.

609
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,400
So who won the game?

610
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,670
I don’t know.

611
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,160
We didn’t finish it.

612
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,900
And I don’t think I will compete with her again.

613
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,660
Don’t feel like it.

614
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,310
Yeah?

615
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,280
That's a relief.

616
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:59,110
I mean it’s a relief you don’t have to put up with Clair anymore.

617
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,850
You two are just the same.

618
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,410
What?

619
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,570
No. I don’t like Clair.

620
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,800
We’re not alike.

621
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,760
I haven’t said anything.

622
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,660
So why did you come back to see me?

623
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,940
Um…

624
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,980
I…

625
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,670
I have something for you.

626
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,100
I saw it and thought it looked like Mommam.

627
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,430
Here.

628
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,400
So I bought you one.

629
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,300
But you don’t have to use it.

630
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,100
You can continue using Clair’s.

631
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,160
I’ll let Khao-pan use that one.

632
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,240
So you don’t misunderstand me again.

633
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,560
As for this one, I’ll use it.

634
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,160
Thanks.

635
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,420
Oh.

636
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,540
I’m so sleepy.

637
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,810
I’m gonna take a nap.

638
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,670
When you like Khao-pan, how do you feel?

639
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,730
Why do you ask?

640
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,320
Just wondering.

641
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,210
I've been told that

642
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,640
when we like someone, it triggers serotonin,

643
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,600
giving us butterflies in the stomach.

644
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,700
Wait.

645
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,680
It doesn’t have to be like that.

646
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,740
It’s much easier to tell.

647
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,700
Let’s say when you like someone, your heart will tell you.

648
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,410
Atom.

649
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:55,840
Atom.

650
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,520
(When you like someone, your heart will tell you.)

651
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:00,657
Get down!

652
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,857
I said get down!

653
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:07,071
Kids from fancy schools like yours only know a life of luxury.

654
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,120
I can’t do this.

655
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,645
Maybe this camp will allow us to confess our feelings.

656
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:17,979
You said you’d tell me something after we completed every obstacle course.

657
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:18,808
Half.

658
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:21,982
I’ve got something to tell you.

659
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:23,804
What are you saying? I can’t hear you.

660
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:25,211
I…

661
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:26,911
I’ve started to…

662
00:42:27,573 --> 00:42:28,367
I…
