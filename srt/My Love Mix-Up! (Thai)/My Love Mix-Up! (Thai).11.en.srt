1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
My daughter’s boyfriend should be someone who can protect her.

2
00:00:03,964 --> 00:00:07,226
But I’m sure I can protect Mudmee, sir.

3
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:09,368
Do you think they’re real?

4
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:11,137
Long-distance relationships.

5
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:12,426
I’ve made up my mind.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,355
I will study in Bangkok with you.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,151
I’m afraid of not trying my best.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,448
It’s better than letting you go without trying to do anything.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,053
What do you think I should do, sir?

10
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,890
Tell her as soon as possible.

11
00:00:40,293 --> 00:00:42,290
I believe she will understand eventually.

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,026
Please excuse me.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,053
Worry about yourself first.

14
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,484
Your pre-test result is out.

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,460
It calculates the likelihood that you will be accepted into your preferred faculty.

16
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,520
I got 23%.

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,320
It’s better than last time.

18
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:30,942
You got only 18% before.

19
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:34,897
But I have only a few months left.

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,324
The exam is approaching.

21
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:38,995
Don’t stress.

22
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,260
You still have time.

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,355
You just need to work harder.

24
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:43,706
Don’t lose hope yet.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,271
Our stage play has come back around, guys.

26
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:56,071
This year we will perform Beauty and the Beast.

27
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,013
Atom.

28
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,977
Should we work on the props together again?

29
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,462
Good idea.

30
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,911
I remember it was quite fun last year.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,506
And the one voted to be the scary and hideous beast is…

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,622
Half.

33
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:25,653
What?

34
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:29,004
Me?

35
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,368
Wait.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,333
Who voted for me?

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,364
Did you, Atom?

38
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:35,573
Cut that.

39
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:44,142
And we have two candidates for our Beauty: Fahsai and Ipad.

40
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,911
We’re gonna have an audition to see who has better chemistry with our Beast.

41
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,466
Listen.

42
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:51,964
Yes?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,031
I heard the climax of this play is the real-kiss scene.

44
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:57,795
What?

45
00:02:57,955 --> 00:03:03,324
Watch out, girl. You might lose your Beast to one of the Beauties.

46
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:04,737
Kiss. Kiss.

47
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,533
Director.

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,248
Can I also audition for the female lead?

49
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:11,290
What?

50
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,435
Why?

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,946
What are you guys waiting for? Give her a big clap.

52
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
This is the script for the audition.

53
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:33,591
It’s a romantic scene where the Beast shows Belle his library.

54
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:34,426
Ah.

55
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:36,897
And then Genie comes out of the oil lamp.

56
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,400
That’s Aladdin.

57
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:40,328
Is it the one with the seven dwarfs?

58
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:42,026
That’s Snow White.

59
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:42,984
Are you okay, girl?

60
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:43,813
Gosh.

61
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,235
What am I gonna do?

62
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:47,315
I am too nervous to do anything right.

63
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,693
It’s alright.

64
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:50,906
Let’s see how they do first.

65
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,177
Wow, this is beautiful.

66
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,751
You have tons of books here.

67
00:04:57,786 --> 00:04:59,591
These books are all yours.

68
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:01,448
I’m so delighted.

69
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,742
Look. I like to read that book so much.

70
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:05,537
Do you want that one? I’ll grab it for you.

71
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,422
It’s my favorite book.

72
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,124
I really like this chapter.

73
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,040
Thank you so much.

74
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,013
You’ve got a problem. Look at your competition.

75
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,951
They’re acting like they want an award.

76
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,986
Mudmee, it’s your turn now.

77
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,631
So? Do you want to sit this one out?

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,630
No!

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,897
Mudmee, stand by right here.

80
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:35,857
Wait, wait.

81
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,311
You, a heartless man.

82
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,280
You judge people by their appearances.

83
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:41,280
You deserve to be cursed.

84
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,057
Which chapter are those lines from?

85
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:47,466
You acted like you didn’t want the role at first.

86
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:48,968
Look how happy you are now.

87
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,306
I’m just doing what the script says.

88
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:53,831
Yeah?

89
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,893
Does the script tell you to give them heart eyes too?

90
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:57,182
Does it say you must hold their hands?

91
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,862
Mudmee.

92
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,182
A round of applause, guys.

93
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,022
This is the Beauty that we’re looking for.

94
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,431
But she just went off-script.

95
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:12,871
It’s all from her inner feelings.

96
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:13,786
That’s true.

97
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:17,884
But the Beauty and the Beast are supposed to fight just like this.

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,115
Mudmee, I chose you to play Beauty.

99
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,977
Give her a big hand, guys.

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,102
These are the test examples from the last five years for each subject.

101
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,017
Five years?

102
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,502
I don’t think it’s enough.

103
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:49,500
I want 10 years.

104
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:50,693
20 years.

105
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:51,875
30 years.

106
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,524
100 years is fine too.

107
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,031
Calm down, okay?

108
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,320
Why are you so hyped up?

109
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,351
Well…

110
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,382
It’s my only chance to study with Kongthap.

111
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,520
I want to do my best.

112
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,893
So I won’t regret it later.

113
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,890
Nice to hear that.

114
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,151
But I’m telling you this.

115
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:22,740
You get to spend a high school life only once too.

116
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,040
I don’t want you to regret it later.

117
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,360
Keep going.

118
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,511
Kongthap.

119
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,524
Wanna join me?

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,031
Are you done studying?

121
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,573
No.

122
00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:01,857
I just wanna keep someone company

123
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,644
so he doesn’t have to eat alone.

124
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,577
Thanks.

125
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,968
What are you drawing?

126
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,537
A rose.

127
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,137
Similar to last year.

128
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:20,435
Can I try?

129
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,800
Are you sure you can do it?

130
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,315
Come on.

131
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:30,684
My skills must have improved over the past year.

132
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,164
If you don’t believe me, watch.

133
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,906
You’re supposed to draw a rose, not an earthworm.

134
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,533
Seriously?

135
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,377
Earthworm?

136
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:52,595
I’m sorry.

137
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:54,586
That’s my maximum improvement.

138
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,804
But I can eat vegetables now.

139
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:02,613
If you don’t believe me, watch.

140
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:15,653
I’m fine.

141
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,768
Is yours too spicy though?

142
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,528
I can cook a new flavor for you.

143
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:24,240
It’s alright.

144
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:27,070
My skills have improved over the past year too.

145
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,222
You’re good.

146
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,084
Kongthap.

147
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,724
I need to go back to studying.

148
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,253
Atom.

149
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,644
Since we’re not performing in the stage play this year,

150
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:02,017
should we go check out the school festival?

151
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,591
But I haven’t finished my study yet.

152
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,026
It’s fine. It’s just one day.

153
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,013
It’s our last year of high school.

154
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,728
Come with me.

155
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:17,324
Fine.

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,586
I will.

157
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,546
Okay.

158
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,586
We are going to rehearse this scene.

159
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,737
You guys run lines one last time.

160
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,462
Are you okay?

161
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,782
If not, it’s not too late to withdraw now.

162
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,204
I’m fine.

163
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,195
I’m nervous.

164
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,324
But with you here, I feel a lot more relieved.

165
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:10,151
Alright, guys.

166
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,137
Ready?

167
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,417
You can start now.

168
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,737
The stars are beautiful tonight.

169
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:20,730
Right.

170
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,911
I just realized now how beautiful my castle is.

171
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,982
That’s called the Leo constellation.

172
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:48,986
Belle…

173
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,786
I…

174
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,693
I…

175
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:07,100
You should tell her as soon as possible.

176
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,510
I believe she will understand eventually.

177
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,431
Half.

178
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,808
Half.

179
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:19,386
What’s the matter?

180
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:21,013
I’m sorry, I forgot my line.

181
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,906
Come on, Half.

182
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,586
The feeling was just right.

183
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,986
May I have some time to read the lines once again?

184
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,488
(...ongthap)

185
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,422
Your friend, Atom?

186
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,702
Good evening, ma’am.

187
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,497
I’m Kongthap.

188
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,360
I’m Atom’s friend.

189
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:14,053
Atom.

190
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,426
Don’t you have school today?

191
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,866
Ah.

192
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,591
I do, Mom.

193
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:22,110
But we’re having a festival today.

194
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,217
That’s why I’m looking extra handsome.

195
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,240
Do you have to do a stage play this year?

196
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,648
I don’t, this year.

197
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:33,813
Half does though.

198
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:35,810
I’ll be there just to look around.

199
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,537
By yourself?

200
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,444
No.

201
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,484
With a friend.

202
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,911
Atom.

203
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,928
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

204
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,448
Hm?

205
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,120
Uh…

206
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:11,608
Uh, I’m late.

207
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,120
I gotta go.

208
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,977
I’m meeting a friend.

209
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,880
I’m off now.

210
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,986
Atom.

211
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,404
Travel safe, son.

212
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,400
Text me when you’re at school.

213
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,622
Yes, Mom.

214
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,315
My energy has been boosted.

215
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,140
Which booth should we start?

216
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,204
Hi, guys.

217
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,284
Hey, Khao-pan.

218
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:18,000
Wanna test your dart skills?

219
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,884
Hit five balloons, you get the prize.

220
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,333
You also get to choose the one you want.

221
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,128
Wanna try it? I’m paying.

222
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,226
Oh, please.

223
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:33,617
No.

224
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,333
I’m not gonna hit anything.

225
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,613
Don’t waste your money.

226
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,822
How do you know?

227
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,404
Try it. Have you ever tried it before?

228
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:40,160
I haven’t.

229
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:44,497
But I told you it’s a waste of money.

230
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:47,620
It’s our last year here.

231
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,142
You’re allowed to do anything you want.

232
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,031
Alright.

233
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:20,275
Yes!

234
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:24,968
Here are your prizes.

235
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,488
May I please have a carrot and a cabbage?

236
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,137
Hey!

237
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,031
It’s fine. Just eat.

238
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,284
Are you guys ready?

239
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:20,720
We are!

240
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,515
Make some noise.

241
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,777
Everyone, please gather round.

242
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,770
Your friend has so many jobs.

243
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:37,866
Please welcome our special guest today,

244
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,435
Chinzhilla!

245
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:42,430
Hey.

246
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:44,488
Really?

247
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,546
I want to hear some noise.

248
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,826
If you’re ready, let’s have fun together.

249
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,528
Just by the look of you

250
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:20,826
Just when you walk past me

251
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:24,248
Just by being close to you and hearing your voice

252
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:27,724
It shakes my heart

253
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,084
But you let me down

254
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,408
When you told me

255
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:37,884
That we can’t be together

256
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:40,835
Because of what you heard about me

257
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:44,328
- Some say I’m like that - Some say I’m like that

258
00:20:44,364 --> 00:20:47,662
Some say I’m like this

259
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:50,968
Some say I’m a bad guy

260
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:55,911
But we haven’t even talked

261
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:58,444
So you think I’m a bad guy

262
00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:00,106
Though you haven’t really looked

263
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,831
I dare you to look at me

264
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:06,684
You already judge me

265
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,422
Based on other people’s words

266
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:12,017
So you think I’m a bad guy

267
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,760
Though you haven’t really looked

268
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:15,448
I dare you to look at me

269
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:20,071
You already judge me

270
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,911
Based on other people’s words

271
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:27,333
You say you don’t trust my words, I wanna cry

272
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,960
You say they’re all lies

273
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:34,168
You think I’m a liar, a deceiver,

274
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:36,915
Why don’t you listen to me

275
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:40,435
Some say I’m like that

276
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,671
Some say I’m like this

277
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:47,066
Some say I’m a bad guy

278
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:50,471
But we haven’t even talked

279
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:52,906
So you think I’m a bad guy

280
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,568
Though you haven’t really looked

281
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:56,248
I dare you to look at me

282
00:21:56,293 --> 00:22:01,093
You already judge me

283
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,115
Based on other people’s words

284
00:22:04,142 --> 00:22:06,542
So you think I’m a bad guy

285
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,320
Though you haven’t really looked

286
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:10,071
I dare you to look at me

287
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:14,444
You already judge me

288
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,146
Based on other people’s words

289
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:31,831
You two stand by.

290
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:34,071
Once the team is ready, I’ll come back for you.

291
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:34,586
Okay.

292
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:35,635
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

293
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,955
Half, you okay? Is something bothering you?

294
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,662
Ah.

295
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,484
It’s just nerves.

296
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,484
Should we rehearse one last time?

297
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,604
Of course.

298
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,853
Is there anything you want to tell me?

299
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,280
Do you want to rehearse the stargazing scene?

300
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,457
No.

301
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,635
I’m asking you, Half.

302
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,551
We’ve known each other quite long.

303
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:31,902
I can tell when something is bothering you.

304
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,915
I…

305
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,182
I…

306
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,560
(Beauty and the Beast)
Half.

307
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:54,506
Listen to me.

308
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,115
You can tell me.

309
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,471
I’m up for anything.

310
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,515
I’m…

311
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,288
not attending the same university as you.

312
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,386
Why not?

313
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,915
I looked up many institutes.

314
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:51,540
In the end,

315
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,737
a different university's program is more appealing to me.

316
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,582
That’s fine.

317
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,835
We don’t have to study at the same university.

318
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,782
Right?

319
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,493
But the university I chose is in Chiang Mai.

320
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,817
We will be quite far away from each other.

321
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,875
Mudmee, I’m sorry.

322
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,790
This is not your fault.

323
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,937
It’s good to know what you like and want to study.

324
00:25:58,426 --> 00:25:59,600
Don’t you believe me?

325
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:01,386
Really, I’m okay.

326
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,106
I’m sorry I can’t keep the promise.

327
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:11,733
We can still meet up or call each other.

328
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,000
You keep reading the lines.

329
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,102
I’m gonna go fix my makeup.

330
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:19,100
So when Tan comes back, I will be ready.

331
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,355
Been a while since I last danced.

332
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:12,097
That really made me sweat.

333
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,320
We still have time to hit a couple of booths.

334
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:17,502
Should we hurry?

335
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,595
One second.

336
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,600
Crap!

337
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,693
My mom is calling.

338
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:27,502
Answer her.

339
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,293
Hello, Mom.

340
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,733
What’s up?

341
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,884
(I have a half day off today and I don’t have any plans.)

342
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,657
(I’m thinking of dropping by your school event.)

343
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:43,200
What?

344
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,933
Don’t think that’s a good idea.

345
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:50,417
There's nothing to see here.

346
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,960
(But I’ve already arrived.)

347
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,040
What?

348
00:27:59,537 --> 00:28:00,880
Where are you?

349
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:02,480
I’ll come to you.

350
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,724
(I’m at the fountain.)

351
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,924
Okay, Mom.

352
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:06,044
I will…

353
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:10,275
Hello.

354
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:15,546
Seriously? It has to die now?

355
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:19,111
You can borrow mine.

356
00:28:21,173 --> 00:28:22,248
No.

357
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,262
You cannot get involved in this.

358
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,506
She suddenly called. There must be something going on.

359
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,564
You should go then.

360
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,760
I can go watch the play by myself.

361
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,826
I’m sorry.

362
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,844
Hi, ma’am.

363
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:35,804
Uh…

364
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,146
Atom’s phone died.

365
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:42,044
I think he’s coming back here soon.

366
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:49,940
Kongthap, you and Atom are close, aren’t you?

367
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,373
Hey!

368
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:05,022
That’s right, ma’am.

369
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,320
How long have you guys been close?

370
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:12,080
Since Grade 11.

371
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,955
So it’s you who inspired Atom to study harder.

372
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,382
No, ma’am.

373
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,200
It’s Atom himself who wants to study hard.

374
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:34,222
I heard you two are applying to the same university in Bangkok.

375
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:35,955
Is that right?

376
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:37,991
That’s right, ma’am.

377
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,897
Then you must know this.

378
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:53,946
Atom’s father left us when Atom was a child.

379
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,186
I’ve been working so hard that Atom has to be alone frequently.

380
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,511
He might act tough and independent,

381
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,328
but I know he wants someone to be with him all the time.

382
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:22,613
Deep down, he’s afraid that someone he loves will abandon him like his father did.

383
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,862
Atom being easily scared is partly my fault.

384
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,142
As for the university in Bangkok, he is working on it extremely hard.

385
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,640
I'm concerned that if he doesn't get in, he may become discouraged

386
00:31:44,915 --> 00:31:48,115
or think everyone leaves him behind.

387
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,502
Worse, he might be too afraid to open his heart to anyone again.

388
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,253
Don’t worry, ma’am.

389
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,333
Atom is a strong person.

390
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,542
He’s helped me many times.

391
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,724
I think he gets that from you.

392
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,453
Kongthap, do you think he can get into that university in Bangkok?

393
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,897
I do, ma’am.

394
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,391
I’m sure he can make it.

395
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,768
Even if he can’t, he will be fine

396
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,617
because he will still have me.

397
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,795
I’m at ease now.

398
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:21,102
Even though he can’t make it, I know now that someone is right by his side, supporting him.

399
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,915
Atom.

400
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,426
I’m so sorry.

401
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:47,111
My friend just texted me asking if I wanted to join her for a meal.

402
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:48,551
I think I’m gonna go.

403
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,142
But you just got here.

404
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,777
Oh, please. My business here is done.

405
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,770
You two enjoy the rest of the day.

406
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,773
Did you find her in the library?

407
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:34,088
She’s not there.

408
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,570
Where the heck did she go?

409
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,066
Gosh.

410
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,568
Don’t tell me she’s too nervous to get on stage again.

411
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,760
No.

412
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,648
It’s my fault actually.

413
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:54,230
I’ll go look for her.

414
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,697
Guys, I am so sorry.

415
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,484
I fell asleep in the bathroom.

416
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,733
Gosh, don’t do that to us.

417
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,711
I really am sorry.

418
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,897
All right, time to stand by.

419
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:09,413
The hall is full of audience now.

420
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,088
Okay.

421
00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:11,013
Let’s go.

422
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:11,786
Again, I’m sorry.

423
00:35:11,822 --> 00:35:13,555
The play is starting in five minutes.

424
00:35:17,928 --> 00:35:19,920
So? Did you memorize all the lines?

425
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,004
I am sorry, Mudmee.

426
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,133
Don’t be.

427
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,133
I should thank you for telling me honestly.

428
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,373
I admire your dedication to your future goals and I want to do the same.

429
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,426
For our future.

430
00:35:54,533 --> 00:36:00,684
Then, should we make the most of our time today

431
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,168
while we get to spend it together?

432
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,115
Okay?

433
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:37,502
Hey.

434
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,075
I’m nervous

435
00:36:39,475 --> 00:36:42,595
and I’m not even on the stage this year.

436
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:46,613
Are you sad that you don’t get to play this year?

437
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:49,146
No.

438
00:36:49,537 --> 00:36:56,426
I’m glad that those two will have a special moment like we did.

439
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:19,220
(Once upon a time,)

440
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:25,280
(an angel cursed and turned an unkind prince into a beast)

441
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,355
(to teach him the value of true love.)

442
00:37:32,622 --> 00:37:35,137
It’s not like everyone is as brave as you.

443
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:38,764
I thought you were more considerate of other people’s feelings.

444
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,453
Now I know I thought wrong.

445
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:54,124
(One day, the beast encountered Beauty who saw his kindness hidden inside.)

446
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:56,120
Hey, are you okay?

447
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,360
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

448
00:38:00,115 --> 00:38:02,110
I’ve liked you for so long.

449
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:03,573
You remember it wrong, don't you?

450
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,546
You don’t have to remember anything anymore

451
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:08,817
because from now on, I will forget everything about you too.

452
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,368
It’s good.

453
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:21,777
(As time went by, the two of them started to open up to each other.)

454
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,502
(Until love bloomed.)

455
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,928
Look at that shooting star.

456
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,591
I like you, Mudmee.

457
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,964
(With the miracle of love…)

458
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,288
Please stay with me.

459
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:59,004
- Please wake up.
- (The beast turned into a gorgeous prince in the end.)

460
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,484
Wake up.

461
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,213
(The two of them lived happily ever after.)

462
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,133
I’m totally a fan.

463
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,973
Half!

464
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:41,608
Mudmee!

465
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:43,591
Mudmee!

466
00:40:20,444 --> 00:40:22,440
Can I ask you one thing?

467
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,808
Of course.

468
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:33,031
Will you promise if you have some free time, you will come see me?

469
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,706
If we really can’t meet up, let’s call each other instead.

470
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,657
I promise.

471
00:40:49,315 --> 00:40:50,650
What about you?

472
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,706
Do you want me to make any promise?

473
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:15,226
Promise me that you will smile for me like this forever.

474
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,231
I promise.

475
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:29,413
Kongthap, I thought Mudmee would get stage fright again.

476
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,808
Turned out the applause was louder than when we performed last year.

477
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,986
So did you get to do everything you wanted today?

478
00:42:46,142 --> 00:42:49,991
Actually,

479
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,466
there’s still one thing left.

480
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:57,217
What is it?

481
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:14,053
My pre-test score isn't as good as I said.

482
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,297
I have a 23% chance to get in.

483
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,017
I’ll try my best anyway.

484
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,720
Don’t you worry.

485
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,422
Atom.

486
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,648
Did you fill out the wrong faculty code?

487
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,457
You’re enrolling in Food Business.

488
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,653
But this is Hotel Business.

489
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,084
Hey!

490
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,768
I did input the wrong code.

491
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,133
Do it again. You can check online.

492
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,813
Gosh.

493
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,555
Can you check for me?

494
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:44,853
I’m too afraid.

495
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,728
Hey!

496
00:44:57,857 --> 00:44:58,871
Why so quiet?

497
00:45:09,502 --> 00:45:10,213
Atom.

498
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,435
Congratulations.

499
00:45:18,755 --> 00:45:20,773
You have a 55% chance to get in.

500
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,120
Let me see.

501
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,337
Jeez!

502
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,808
You’re right.

503
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,280
Gosh.

504
00:45:45,395 --> 00:45:49,466
Now we have a chance to study together.

505
00:46:13,617 --> 00:46:14,248
Hello.

506
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:15,528
(Where are you?)

507
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:17,244
(The wrap-up fireworks are about to start.)

508
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:18,666
Okay.

509
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:19,786
We will be there.

510
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:24,380
Half told us to go down for the fireworks.

511
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,213
Oh.

512
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:27,724
Right.

513
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,288
Should we go now?

514
00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:33,564
Or we might not get the spots.

515
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:35,004
Let’s go.

516
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:52,657
Dang.

517
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,808
Is it locked?

518
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,142
Kongthap, the door is locked.

519
00:47:01,768 --> 00:47:03,760
I’m calling someone for help.

520
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,946
Kongthap.

521
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,737
No one will come help us.

522
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:12,160
People must be ready to see the fireworks now.

523
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,728
Should we see the fireworks from here then?

524
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:19,920
We can call someone after.

525
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,942
You being here with me is already enough.

526
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,386
Let go.

527
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,773
Kongthap.

528
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:00,275
Is there anything you haven’t done today?

529
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,270
There’s one thing, actually.

530
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:11,617
What is it?

531
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,800
All these times, you’ve been the one to make the first move.

532
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:49,760
This time, let me be the one to do it.

533
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:38,808
(I wish we could celebrate together like this again next year.)

534
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,817
(Sadhu.)

535
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,044
Did you guys bring your token?

536
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:02,257
We won’t get to see it again for ten years.

537
00:51:02,453 --> 00:51:04,337
I looked into some dormitories around the university.

538
00:51:04,755 --> 00:51:06,977
Once we get accepted, will you share it with me?

539
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:13,164
Atom, I’d like to know if Kongthap is dating someone.

540
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:19,724
If I can choose, I expect a competent and smart person.

541
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,586
Just like Thap.

542
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,724
I’m sorry, ma’am, that I’m not that.

543
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:27,150
But I’ll try my best.

544
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,511
Please don’t make us stop seeing each other.
