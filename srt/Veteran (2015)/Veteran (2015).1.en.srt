A FILMMAKERS R&K PRODUCTION

4
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,697
That's the one!

5
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,451
Hey!

6
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,911
Not that one!

7
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,454
That's not the one!

8
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,706
Come on!

9
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,586
I sure spoiled you good.

10
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,089
Just you wait.

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,884
I'll find a car that's
just right for you. Alright?

12
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,428
Alright.

13
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,390
- I'll take care of you for life.
- Welcome!

14
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,308
You can't find a better deal.

15
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,935
- This way.
- I'll come next time.

16
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,186
Come again.

17
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,606
Good afternoon!

18
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,150
For the gentleman or Mrs.?

19
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,901
Mrs.? What the fuck?

20
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,278
Let's go, baby.

21
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,655
Where are you going?

22
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,826
Hey, honey.

23
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,369
What about your mother?

24
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,788
I'm in a meeting. Gotta go.

25
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,542
That place is for married people
and we're for lovers.

26
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,961
See the cars we have?

27
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,963
Look at that Mercedes!

28
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,298
Mercedes indeed.

29
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,092
She'll be driving it.
So, no petty troubles.

30
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,469
Can I see the engine?

31
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,970
You know your cars, don't you?

32
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:18,971
Yang!

33
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,478
The lady who sold this car
bought it for her son-in-law

34
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,645
and didn't drive it once.

35
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,439
See the low mileage?

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,400
Son-in-law got a fancy job in the States.

37
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,068
Can't come back to Korea.

38
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,865
My cutie pie.

39
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,660
You look like a proper
lady in that car.

40
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,078
Shall we go with this one?

41
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,372
I suppose this'll do for my groceries.

42
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,666
You, groceries, sure... Come here.

43
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,835
What's the matter with you?! Nasty!

44
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,921
So you know your girls, too.

45
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,799
I'll take it out for a spin.

46
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,970
AUTO TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP APPLICATION

47
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,476
You checked the registration
and navigation?

48
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,727
Yes.

49
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,363
Thank you!

50
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,156
Enjoy your ride.

51
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,160
Let's get to work.

52
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,878
Hey, watch the signal!

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,798
Wait for the next light!
Son of a...!

54
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,469
Easy... easy!
This isn't your damn car!

55
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,807
And couldn't you act more naturally?

56
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,017
Check if we've got a tail!

57
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,020
I am checking!
Stop nagging already!

58
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,524
Focus on your driving! Are you nuts?!

59
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,942
Look ahead, damn it!

60
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,152
Why don't you take
the goddamn wheel?!

61
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,821
What does he want now?

62
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,530
CHIEF

63
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,032
Breathing down my neck again!

64
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,784
Text if you can't call!

65
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,411
I gave you specific instructions!

66
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,246
Do you have the brains of a goldfish?!

67
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,833
You've got zero patience.
I was just about to call you.

68
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,918
I'm sick of your excuses!

69
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,671
With all that smooth talking,
you should've become a lawyer!

70
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,881
We got the car!

71
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,424
Watch the lane, dumbass!

72
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,760
Chief, don't put me on an assignment
with him again! We're a bad team!

73
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,388
A bad team? You haven't seen bad.

74
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,308
Don't start with me! I've got the wheel!
I'll show you bad.

75
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,268
Stop screwing around.

76
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,772
So is this happening or
are we dragging some more?

77
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,984
Dragging on for three
months is enough!

78
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,985
We're on tonight!

79
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,132
Hey...

80
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,842
Isn't that your car?

81
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,850
We're on...

82
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,852
Shit!

83
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,729
Did you say "shit" to me?

84
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,732
I said no talking with
food in your mouth.

85
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,442
What about Do-Cheol?

86
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,860
Yeah?

87
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,612
Boys!

88
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,113
We're on. Let's go!

89
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,616
Oh, come on!

90
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,451
Come on, move.

91
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,248
Can I get a refund for
what we didn't finish?

92
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,960
But you ate the food.

93
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,170
Get outta here!

94
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,052
Take out the equipment.
Speed it up.

95
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,431
Let me get the GPS tracker
from the trunk.

96
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,269
Thank God! I thought
I was gonna die in there.

97
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,063
Where's the toilet?

98
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,943
Who the fuck are you?!

99
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,075
What the heck?!

100
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,413
I almost pissed my pants!

101
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,457
What took you so long?!

102
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,418
I know you. You're that guy...

103
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,544
from earlier.

104
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,296
Good going, guys.

105
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,131
I see you haven't met my team yet.

106
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,008
I said, what the fuck?!

107
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:08,761
Hello?

108
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,512
Where are you?

109
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,890
Who the fuck are you?!

110
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,599
What?

111
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,476
At a gas station?

112
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,895
You didn't fill up before a standby?

113
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,688
Are you kidding me?

114
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,608
Hurry up! I'm starving!

115
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,695
You know how to wear them?

116
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,490
Which gang are you from?

117
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,285
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

118
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,245
You'll get hurt.

119
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,176
Oh my...

120
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,370
Are you fucking insane?

121
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,732
- Let's go home!
- Nobody moves!

122
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,820
- Ladies!
- Why are you rolling about?

123
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,571
Is the car alright?

124
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,824
This is why they call you a blocker
who never gets promoted.

125
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,993
You should ask
if anyone's hurt first.

126
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:57,536
Shit!

127
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,412
Is this the guy?

128
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,621
Get up, you punk!

129
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,290
I want a lawyer!

130
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,006
Let's go.

131
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,050
I forgot that I had to make a call.

132
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,802
What was his number...

133
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:18,307
Stay put until I come back, okay?

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,309
Oh, and...

135
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,562
I can't cover your ass
if you cripple another man.

136
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,356
Yes, I'm talking about that time.

137
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,402
The poor bastard needs
a bib when he eats.

138
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,821
Gets so happy when he's fed.

139
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,950
You became a cop
to beat people up, didn't you?

140
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,280
Come here.

141
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,865
It's alright. Hold this.

142
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,450
With both hands. That's it.

143
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,745
You can't hit a cop.

144
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,288
Especially with a weapon.

145
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,456
What?

146
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,917
Now, put down the evidence.

147
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,422
This is called self-defense.
You fucking asshole!

148
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,925
No need to get physical!

149
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,551
We can talk this out!

150
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,886
Let go of it.

151
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,556
- Sit properly.
- Okay.

152
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,768
Where are the cars sent from here?

153
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,602
To Busan.

154
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,481
- My questions may not be orderly...
- Yes.

155
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,858
but I like long, structured answers.

156
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,776
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:53,777
So...

158
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,238
The cars are not just
from Seoul. Correct?

159
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,408
Just a nod?
What am I, your mate?

160
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,826
What after Busan?

161
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,119
They're sent to Russia.

162
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,245
Russia?

163
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,331
Russians come to the scene?

164
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,916
You got the picture.

165
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,505
Let's go eat, Chief!

166
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,218
What a mess.

167
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,846
Why isn't he in bed yet?

168
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,806
Ask him yourself.

169
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,101
What's with the attitude?
I just got home from work.

170
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,228
Here. I got some chicken.

171
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,273
Don't dump your jacket on the floor!
I have a full time job, too.

172
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,525
Alright, alright!

173
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,776
What's the matter with you?

174
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,987
Something happened
at the welfare center?

175
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,364
My work is fine.

176
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,534
If there's anything wrong,
it's your son.

177
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,036
Why? What happened?

178
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,288
He beat up a classmate.

179
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,707
You scared me for a second there.

180
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,085
That's how kids grow up.

181
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,339
Son, you can't be sleeping here.

182
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,259
Just don't go around getting beat up.

183
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,137
That is not acceptable.

184
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,558
Good for you.

185
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,227
Mom's a social worker, dad's a cop...

186
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,896
And you're gonna
have a thug for a son?

187
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,649
Can't you talk with more elegance?

188
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,152
I'm working on a solid case.

189
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,405
They'll call you "ma'am"
when I get into the central office.

190
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,907
Let's go to bed, son.

191
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,160
Find your seal before
you transfer to the central office.

192
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,203
What for?

193
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,329
The loan renewal.

194
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,163
What loan?

195
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,499
Loan for our rent deposit! What else?!

196
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,877
You don't have to shout.

197
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,255
Get more loans and
buy the damn house!

198
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,132
Wash your damn feet!

199
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,885
Urgh!

200
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:48,058
A real man doesn't give a shit
about things like loans.

201
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,102
Go big!

202
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,728
What's there to life?

203
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,612
Where did I put my seal?

204
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,659
Could've bought a house
with all the interest payments.

205
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,496
It's quite a distance.

206
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,791
I'm sorry we can't pay more
because it's official business.

207
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,546
Daily wage earners like us will
take any work, big or small.

208
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,383
Mr. Bae, why isn't he at school?

209
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,385
He went in the morning.

210
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,345
I'm doing this so
I can send him to school.

211
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,056
But I still can't afford
after-school tuitions.

212
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,018
Still slow in the trucking business?

213
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,311
For us,

214
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:37,774
what's more important is
to deal with the right contractors.

215
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,986
What's the use if you don't get paid?

216
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,405
There are still bastards
who don't pay up?

217
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,949
Just how the world is.

218
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,785
They don't bat an eye before
firing someone after 20 years.

219
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,786
Anyway...

220
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,372
nothing dangerous today?

221
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,501
Nothing of the sort.
You just need to drop off the car.

222
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,336
I'm not worried about me

223
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,380
but I am about the truck.

224
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,635
These days, people don't care
about people getting hurt.

225
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,849
Back off.

226
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,518
- Hey, Kang.
- Yes, sir.

227
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,688
How do you communicate
with the Russians?

228
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,398
They speak Korean fluently.

229
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,486
These days, you gotta
learn and develop yourself.

230
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,989
Even those scumbags expand
territories by speaking another language.

231
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,866
I'm too old to learn anything,

232
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,497
but you should study regularly instead of
cramming before the promotion exam.

233
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,624
I don't expect tuition support.

234
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,501
Just give us some free time.

235
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,294
You go clubbing
whenever you have time.

236
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,671
A lot of people learn
English at the club.

237
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,297
Right?

238
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,007
Sorry?

239
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,176
Get a job at the club then.

240
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,221
I have connections, you know.

241
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,141
They'll be long gone
by the time you get out.

242
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,810
That's the fun part of going to prison.

243
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,946
Now the real work begins for you.

244
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,614
Thank you for looking me up.

245
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,075
Have a safe trip back.

246
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:16,456
The accounts team will
wire the payment today.

247
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,584
The police wouldn't
withhold on payment.

248
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,835
- Sure.
- Take care.

249
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,337
One second, Mr. Bae!

250
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,757
If there are assholes
who refuse to pay, give me a call.

251
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,967
I mean it.

252
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,301
I'll see you.

253
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,135
Okay.

254
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,136
Hey, big guy!

255
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,932
Buy yourself a snack at the rest area.

256
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,559
- You shouldn't.
- It's alright.

257
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,689
A man's gotta be quick on his feet.

258
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,065
Say, thank you.

259
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,108
Thank you.

260
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:43,900
Alright!

261
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,151
I'll buy a drink
when you come back.

262
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,027
Sounds good!

263
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,015
Hey, what's up!

264
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,517
The rendezvous is on.

265
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,768
It's been a while.

266
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,647
You look more fit.

267
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,940
Hello.

268
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,236
We got four good ones.
It's no joke.

269
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,825
Mercedes S Class.
Check out the mileage.

270
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,078
No distractions around.

271
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,456
Just the main players checking goods.

272
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,131
Looks like it's ready to be served.

273
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,926
Okay, let's sign the papers.

274
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:07,233
Contract signed, nice and neat!

275
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,569
Let's get to work, ladies!

276
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,656
Don't let your guards down!

277
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,742
Don't rush. Backup is on the way.

278
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,577
Everyone, hold your positions.

279
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,371
Nobody gets away.

280
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,625
Great job! Beautifully done!

281
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,339
What the fuck?!

282
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,548
Run!

283
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,349
You're dead meat.

284
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,528
If you're gonna run,
run together in a group!

285
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,907
Hey, Do-Cheol!

286
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,409
Go after the Russians.

287
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,410
What?

288
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,412
Cut me some slack!

289
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,247
Sure. Now, go!

290
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,833
The others are running into the net!

291
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:05,500
BUSAN CONTROL ROOM

292
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,840
Bastard!

293
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,927
How long are you gonna
run?! I'm so tired!

294
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,429
Come with me now!

295
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,638
No!

296
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,306
Stop following me!

297
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,225
I'm tired, too!

298
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,811
Hey, stop!

299
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,857
Take me, too! Come on!

300
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,278
Come here!

301
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,029
You little punk.

302
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,535
Freeze, you bastard!

303
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,172
You piece of shit!

304
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,970
What the...?

305
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,646
Miss Bong!

306
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,107
Should've requested backup.

307
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,359
We can't cover this large area.

308
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,446
Sitting in front of the monitor,
bossing around...

309
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,947
Holy shit!

310
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,199
Hey!

311
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,831
Damn...

312
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,752
You bastard!

313
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,755
Stop!

314
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,298
Stop, you bastard!

315
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,397
Hey...

316
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,149
Go away.

317
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,527
Just go.

318
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,029
Go away... shoo!

319
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,576
Let go, you shitsky!

320
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,206
Let go. That hurts.

321
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,916
You punk.

322
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,836
Who do you think you are?

323
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,505
Stand up straight.

324
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,714
Stand straight, you bastard!

325
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,725
Pissing me off...

326
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,440
Aren't you tired? Hop on.

327
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,150
Water?

328
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,611
Thanks.

329
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,906
I've got tons of work
waiting for me.

330
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,075
Let's just go together.

331
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,956
Okay, let's do that.

332
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,332
Good thinking.

333
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,210
We'll have a fun ride back
with your friends.

334
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,796
Let's go!

335
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,940
Hey, Kim.

336
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,400
I'm here. Where are you?

337
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,695
Over here.

338
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,699
Let's finish up quickly and grab a drink.

339
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,453
Attention!

340
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,996
Write here!

341
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,582
One, name!

342
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,875
Two, first name!

343
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,585
Three... country!

344
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,629
You fuckers...

345
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,714
How do I look?

346
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,175
Pretty enough. Let's go.

347
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,593
Reporters are asking
if they can come in.

348
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,886
Tell them I'll be right down.

349
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,055
Is that all the evidence?

350
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,598
All ready to go.

351
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,141
How do I scratch my back?

352
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,353
We've got news cameras.

353
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,438
Cover your faces if you're feeling shy.

354
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,233
What do we do with
the Cro Cop and Fedor?

355
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,069
Where's the interpreter?

356
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,612
I speak Korean!

357
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,197
Call my lawyer!

358
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,616
Where did you learn
to speak like that?

359
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,618
Do you still want an interpreter?

360
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:13,081
Of course. It'll make a better picture.

361
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,167
Just get an officer that speaks English.

362
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,085
Let's go.

363
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,755
Promotion is here.

364
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,300
Carve my name on a desk
at the central office.

365
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,136
So good! It's promotion time.

366
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,347
Good times ahead.

367
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,892
Where's Jeon?!

368
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,770
Hey, miss!

369
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,314
If you cover for him,

370
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,400
it makes you just as bad a person!

371
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,568
I can't reach him either.

372
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,361
You bitch!

373
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,487
Come on!

374
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:48,658
How can you terminate the contract
just because we joined a union?!

375
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,035
If only you'd paid us on time!

376
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,371
We spent our own money
for fuel and food!

377
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,125
Stop harassing me.
I also work on a salary!

378
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,128
I'll kill you all!

379
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,266
You're still up?

380
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,979
Go to bed or your mom'll get mad.

381
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,275
I just ate. I'll be on my way.

382
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,736
Tell mom that I'll be home soon.

383
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,820
Bye now.

384
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,115
I just need a second.

385
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,158
Mr. Jeon!

386
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,746
Bae...

387
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,540
What are you doing here?

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,542
You've been avoiding my calls.

389
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,045
When did I do that?

390
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,129
You called me?

391
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,714
You never pick up.

392
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,008
The office won't connect you.

393
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,885
You dipshit...

394
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,096
Cut the small talk.
Just tell me what you want.

395
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,973
Let's not curse.

396
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,975
You're making me.

397
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,560
What do you want with me?

398
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,857
How can you terminate
by a text message?

399
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,358
Did I fire you?

400
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,111
I get orders from headquarters.
What can I do?

401
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,989
Why did you join the union?

402
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,449
Are you all communists?

403
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,828
You should at least
give us what you owe.

404
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,291
Take it then.

405
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,336
If there is anything to take, take it all.

406
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,338
Take it, you bastard!

407
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,964
Let's talk.

408
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,300
I am talking. Did I hit you?

409
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,676
Then get a medical certificate.

410
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,054
How many times did I tell you?

411
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,432
Go talk to headquarters.
I have no money!

412
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,769
I don't even have money for the motel.

413
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,938
So, I had to bring the girl
to the container.

414
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,689
Can't you see?!

415
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,942
For crying out loud...

416
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,152
Look at you...

417
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,030
Can't believe this.

418
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,949
Get in!

419
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,139
SEO DO-CHEOL, DETECTIVE
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

420
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,350
Is this the right place?

421
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,477
- Why isn't he picking up?
- Hey buddy!

422
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,479
I called you a thousand times.

423
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,230
Come on in.

424
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,731
- Can you valet here?
- Of course.

425
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,567
But they won't park my car!

426
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,026
I'll talk to the guy. Come on.

427
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,487
"The Female Detective"!

428
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,073
An after party for a TV show?

429
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,366
You sure I can join?

430
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,535
Of course. You were the consultant.

431
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,995
- Hey.
- Hello.

432
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,746
Is she an actress?

433
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,457
Don't act like a country boy.
There are more downstairs.

434
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,167
Really?

435
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,502
We've got a killer sponsor.

436
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,797
I called so you can
network with the big players.

437
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,884
You only stand to gain
from listening to me.

438
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:53,885
Hang on.

439
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,554
Take it if it's urgent.

440
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,265
I don't know this number.
A reporter maybe?

441
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,727
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message...

442
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,860
Wow... nice!

443
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,321
Hello! Hi!

444
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,740
- Someone you know?
- No.

445
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,621
Hello... hi!

446
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,748
This is beyond my dreams.

447
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,625
Thanks, man.

448
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:29,837
We didn't even get started.

449
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,097
Director Cho!

450
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,225
Come and say hi.

451
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,561
Hi, I'm Seo Do-Cheol.

452
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,147
Nice to meet...

453
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,274
Ready?

454
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,819
Did you place your bets?

455
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,529
Fight!

456
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,246
Put some weight behind it, damn it!

457
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:12,838
Oh, come on!

458
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,006
Get out!

459
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,840
No fun.

460
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,217
What the heck?

461
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,135
Just playing!

462
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,430
Gentlemen, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

463
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,807
It's alright. Come on.

464
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,891
Have a seat, everyone.

465
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,020
He helped out when Da-Hye
had a dispute with her agency

466
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,440
and acted as our consultant
for this detective drama.

467
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,109
Freeze or I'll shoot!

468
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,362
Give it up for Detective Seo Do-Cheol!

469
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,614
Nice to meet you.

470
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,867
He's a great guy, well worth knowing.

471
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,121
This guy's a plastic surgeon
with a practice in Gangnam.

472
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:49,375
A breast specialist, Doctor Kim!

473
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,212
This brother has a big resort business.

474
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,631
The nature destroyer, Mr. Lee!

475
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,549
Please.

476
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,926
And the party's guest of honor.

477
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,179
A trusty supporter of
my entertainment company,

478
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,557
soon to be president of Sin Jin Tradings,

479
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,809
The Director of Strategy

480
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,436
Cho Tae-Oh!

481
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,771
- Cho Tae-Oh!
- Is it the same Sin Jin I know?

482
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,231
Please...

483
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,608
We're just having fun here. Relax.

484
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,610
How do you know Yun?

485
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:21,532
We met him in the States
while on Da-Hye's shoot.

486
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,285
I took them out
to dinner once. That's all.

487
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,746
As you can tell, I'm
much younger than him.

488
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,585
What an honor to drink
with the super rich.

489
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,379
I thought they would party
differently somehow.

490
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,018
Don't.

491
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,025
Stop it!

492
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,742
Did you expect
something more like this?

493
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,505
I'm sorry for disappointing you!

494
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,549
This is all there is to the super rich!

495
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,051
Please forgive me!

496
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,150
Wow, can't trick this detective.

497
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,735
A real veteran.

498
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,655
So cool! So tough!

499
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,160
Did I scare you, baby?

500
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,751
My grandfather used to say,
befriend those with nerves of steel.

501
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,546
Hey, Yun...

502
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,756
This Mr. Cho is quite interesting.

503
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,886
Tae-Oh,

504
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,557
don't get yourself into trouble.

505
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,685
Let's have a toast.

506
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,026
FITNESS CENTER

507
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,572
Why drag me down here so early?

508
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,490
What's the matter with you?

509
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,117
It's not like I want to do this.

510
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,246
There's gonna be a physical test
in the promotion exam.

511
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,706
Morning!

512
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,416
During the personnel evaluation period,

513
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,751
you don't know who's
gonna be hung out to dry.

514
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,296
Are you on the management level?

515
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,967
How come you don't know shit
about the fundamentals?

516
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,635
Morning, sir!

517
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,596
- You've exercised enough.
- Yes, Chief.

518
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,599
You are fine as you are.

519
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,434
Yes, it feels great.

520
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:56,020
Come on, make yourself useful.

521
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,897
Is he crazy or what?

522
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,066
Ah, this feels great.

523
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,319
Hold it.

524
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,661
- You know...
- Seriously?!

525
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,788
Don't talk to me!

526
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,790
You're messing up my breathing!

527
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,376
Let's start with cardio.

528
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,587
Chief.

529
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,924
Do you know Cho Tae-Oh
from Sin Jin Trading?

530
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:25,966
Cho Tae-Oh?

531
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,135
Second or third kid of Sin Jin Group?

532
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,887
Heard he's a real fuck up.

533
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,807
Getting into trouble after
coming back from studying abroad.

534
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,184
Says who?

535
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,810
Reporters.

536
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,856
Notorious in the business circle.

537
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,151
I drank with him last night.

538
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,992
Don't get up right away.

539
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,869
They'll stare at you.

540
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,912
Stay down.

541
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,081
Do some stretching.

542
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,166
It hurts.

543
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,461
The pain won't last, but shame will.

544
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,587
You alright, sir?

545
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,672
What? Why?

546
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,925
You're bleeding in the back.

547
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:12,096
I don't think you should go
into the sauna with that bruise.

548
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:16,141
Soaking is good for bruises.

549
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,269
Little weaklings.

550
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,439
That Cho Tae-Oh from Sin Jin Trading

551
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,066
smells like trouble.

552
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,736
You got a chance to sniff
someone like him?

553
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,197
I wish I could have a sniff.

554
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,117
The actress from the detective drama...

555
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,786
Her manager, Yun. You know him?

556
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,291
He invited me to an after party.

557
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:45,421
I could feel that this
bastard was up to no good.

558
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,424
For the first time in my 20-year career,

559
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,342
I shook hands with
the commissioner yesterday.

560
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,385
His hands felt warm.

561
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:57,933
Let's keep it real quiet
until our case is closed.

562
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,976
Agreed?

563
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,938
He was sniffling like a coke addict.

564
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,315
Sinus problems.

565
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,151
A grown up rich boy
with sinus problems?!

566
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,694
Give me a break!

567
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,488
Did you pick up the check last night?!
What's your problem?!

568
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,326
Think you can get a warrant
for a sniffling nose?!

569
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,368
Then be my guest!

570
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,078
If not, finish your damn report!

571
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,956
Hae Woo Constructions won
a 3 billion dollar contract

572
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,417
to build a thermoelectric power station.

573
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,881
KE won a 1.6 billion dollar
nuclear plant contract...

574
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,218
I selected only the articles
that pertain to the group.

575
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,595
Do you want to continue later?

576
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,305
That's the least of my concerns.

577
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,557
What's with the emergency
executive meeting?

578
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,894
The Group's executive
meeting is in progress

579
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,979
in the main conference room.

580
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,859
Non-executives, please refrain
from using the elevators.

581
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,278
I think the Chairman wants
to finalize reorganization

582
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,531
before he is called in for
questioning by the DA.

583
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,534
Will we get the telecom business?

584
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,620
Don't let it show on your face.

585
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,331
The meeting's gonna be a long one.

586
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,250
Try not to drink water if you can.

587
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,297
I'm supposed to put this on?

588
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,676
Everyone wears it for
the executive meeting.

589
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,054
You can't leave while
the Chairman is talking.

590
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,232
CHO TAE-OH

591
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,983
CHO JI-SU
CHO TAE-JIN

592
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,778
Announcement for
the main conference room.

593
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:37,908
Due to the Chairman's appointment
with the prosecutors' office,

594
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,161
today's meeting has been canceled.

595
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:46,583
To ensure emergency preparedness

596
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,961
please maintain the state of emergency.

597
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,255
Once again.

598
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:57,344
Due to an appointment with
the prosecutors' office...

599
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:03,934
He can't be doing this
after calling everyone up.

600
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,728
HOSPITALIZED CHAIRMAN
CHO DONG-GUN APPEARS IN COURT

601
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,026
If dad gets locked up,
the telecom will go to my sister.

602
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,278
We'll see.

603
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,573
But it requires a shareholders' meeting
and other complicated procedures.

604
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,241
The investigation will take time, too.

605
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,826
Shareholders' meeting, my ass!

606
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,664
One of us will get the telecom business.

607
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,916
But we don't have any intel.

608
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,460
Why is our intel so shitty?

609
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:33,422
But aunt is distressed about...

610
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,423
Hey.

611
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,340
Yeah?

612
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,675
Isn't it business hours?

613
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,927
Of course.

614
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,765
Mrs. Cho is a bit sensitive
because of the Chairman.

615
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,725
MODEL CHICK

616
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,821
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

617
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,116
Can't I know what's going on
with the company, Mr. Choi?

618
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,369
It's not that.

619
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,207
It's a subcontractor complaining
about not getting paid.

620
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:12,002
Legally, we're in the clear.
So, we're trying to avoid

621
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,837
getting the police involved.

622
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,007
Don't make things complicated.
Send him up to my office.

623
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,217
Sorry?

624
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,928
We can't afford to ruin
our corporate image.

625
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,305
Let's take care of this quietly.

626
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,979
You have a good-looking boy.

627
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,901
Can't be using such rough
words in front of him.

628
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,694
Did you have lunch?

629
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,948
I'm sorry I didn't mean to...

630
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,699
Then what?

631
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,036
You can't terminate the contract
for joining the union.

632
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,830
We didn't.

633
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,123
You don't have a contract with us.

634
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,875
What about the back wages?

635
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,710
Don't raise your voice.

636
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,551
We make next to nothing
from delivering containers.

637
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,555
Because of the high gas price,
we drive at 80 km/h for 7 hours.

638
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,307
We even skip meals to save costs.

639
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,394
But the contractor says he didn't
get anything from the headquarters.

640
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,355
It's a difficult time for everyone.

641
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,900
Every year, they say
this flu is the worst one ever

642
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,945
and the economy is
the worst one ever.

643
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,780
Did that kill me?

644
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,367
I'm not dead.

645
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,246
Hey!

646
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,665
You want that, don't you?

647
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,671
So, how much do they owe you?

648
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,840
To start from the beginning...

649
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,466
Please sit down.

650
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,135
Just the total.

651
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,636
Here.

652
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,638
Say thank you.

653
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,764
Thank you.

654
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,355
It's quite a lot. It's 4.2.

655
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,816
4.2 million dollars?

656
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,735
No.

657
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:01,820
4 grand?

658
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,407
Oh, my...

659
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,994
Driver... Sir.

660
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,539
You know the grindstone?

661
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,168
There's a handle on the grindstone.

662
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:20,714
You try to grind something
and the handle falls out.

663
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,925
Just like that.

664
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,969
It's quite dumbfounding.

665
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,057
You can't do the work
just because of the stupid handle.

666
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,019
That's how I feel.

667
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,981
I'm at a loss.

668
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,569
He's the contractor.

669
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,280
President, Sir! I'm so sorry.

670
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,907
That's a dangerous comment.

671
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,035
Why call me President?

672
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,120
I apologize, Director Cho.

673
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,166
I told you I'll pay you this week.

674
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,167
When?

675
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,418
Mr. Jeon.

676
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,048
Did you steal from the drivers?

677
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,217
No, sir. Never!

678
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,970
Put the gloves on. Both of you.

679
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,734
Stop recording

680
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,705
Let's settle this like men.

681
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,208
It's alright.

682
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,877
Instead of trying to extort from me,

683
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,879
earn it with your sweat.

684
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,340
What do you think you're doing?

685
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,467
Come on. You're scaring your boy.

686
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,177
It's okay.

687
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,847
This is how
the grown-ups earn a living.

688
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,641
Watch how hard it is to make money.

689
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,768
You'll grow up to be
a good son, right?

690
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,229
Ready?

691
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,230
Yes, sir.

692
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,616
Fight!

693
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,039
Don't just stand around!

694
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,125
Come on! Like real men!

695
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,376
Mr. Jeon.

696
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,296
You'll get a registered complaint
if you don't do this right.

697
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,965
What do you think you're
doing in front of a kid?!

698
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,301
3 points for Mr. Jeon!

699
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,138
You won't get any money
just by getting hit.

700
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,515
You came to get paid.
Put on the gloves!

701
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,855
Look how tough it is to make a buck.

702
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,398
Let's cheer for Daddy.

703
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,025
Go, Daddy!

704
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,736
Let's send the kid outside.

705
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:48,987
Focus!

706
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:12,594
Mr. Choi.

707
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,428
Yes?

708
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,305
Mr. Bae might injure his teeth.

709
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,890
Give him some tissue to bite into.

710
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,404
Protect your teeth.

711
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,749
Why did you make
a big deal out of it, idiot?!

712
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,726
Look at yourself.
And for pocket change?

713
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,146
Dear me...

714
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,689
Mr. driver.

715
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:11,361
I put some on top of
the 4,200 you're owed.

716
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,366
Buy some cookies for your son

717
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,870
and some bandages for yourself.

718
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:28,587
This puts an end
to the matter. Agreed?

719
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,381
Cheer up.

720
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,217
Eight times seven is fifty-six.

721
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,512
Eight times eight is sixty-three.

722
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,265
Eight times nine is seventy.

723
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,268
Nine times one is nine.

724
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,187
Nine times two is eighteen.

725
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,981
Nine times three is twenty-seven.

726
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,775
Nine times four is thirty-six.

727
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,365
Nine times five is forty-three.

728
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,534
Nine times six is eighty-three.

729
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,745
Nine times seven is sixty-three.

730
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,414
Nine times eight is seventy-two.

731
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,626
Nine times nine is eighty-one.

732
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,676
PAY THE DELIVERY FEES!
TAKE BACK YOUR POLICY!

733
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,440
DA-HYE

734
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,359
Why can't we get someone
like that on the force?

735
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,237
I was the inspiration for the writer.

736
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,155
Inspiration, my ass!

737
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,324
My sister's kid is driving me nuts.

738
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:43,161
He's obsessed with the idea
of becoming an actor.

739
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,746
- Hey, Do-Cheol!
- Yeah?

740
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,165
You can introduce him
to that talent agency, right?

741
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,500
Guy or a girl?

742
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,961
A guy and he's great looking.

743
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,004
And tall... about 185 centimeters.

744
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,006
I don't like guys that are too tall.

745
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,299
Why don't you just eat?

746
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,177
Why are you talking to
Miss Bong that way?

747
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,179
Tell him to learn a trade.

748
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,556
Just about any loser wants to
be an actor these days.

749
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,557
What? Any loser?

750
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,106
Put some food on my plate.

751
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,654
This is Detective Seo from Seoul District.

752
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,075
Who?

753
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:27,163
Calm down and talk to me.

754
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,805
I came quickly, didn't I?

755
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,267
What happened?

756
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:52,605
He fell from the stairs.

757
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:57,861
I found your card in his wallet.

758
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:01,239
You did the right thing.

759
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,782
Did you eat?

760
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,034
Who are you?

761
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:08,079
I used to work with Mr. Bae.

762
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,290
I'm a cop.

763
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,126
The police are already here.

764
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:15,754
You're an officer?

765
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,130
Yes, I'm with the...

766
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,174
Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation.

767
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:22,177
He was protesting at
the headquarters for back payment

768
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,846
and jumped off the fire escape.

769
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:30,685
Luckily, he was caught over
the handrail and survived,

770
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,145
but he is in a coma.

771
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,440
Will the company take
responsibility for this?

772
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,233
Since the whole thing was
about a back payment.

773
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,819
That's the victim's side of the story,

774
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,489
but according to
the company's legal team,

775
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,326
he isn't contracted with the company.

776
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,287
He's with a subcontractor.

777
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,498
But even that contract is terminated.

778
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:56,628
What's more, the subcontractor
paid the driver today.

779
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:00,173
But since the driver is unconscious,

780
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,175
we don't know why he jumped.

781
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,845
And with a young child...

782
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,305
I don't know what to do.

783
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:13,812
A tough guy has to
eat well and get strong

784
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:17,023
and fight situations like this.

785
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,985
Doctors will fix Daddy up in no time.

786
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,571
I heard you were with him today.

787
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,115
Didn't you go to school?

788
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,784
We have the day off.
It's the school's anniversary.

789
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,620
Playing hooky. Nice.

790
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,666
But you came home separately?

791
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:40,046
He put me in a cab.

792
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,927
You can ride in a cab by yourself?
How impressive!

793
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:51,141
Dad couldn't ride in the cab
because of me.

794
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,309
But he did nothing wrong.

795
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:56,771
Of course. Who said your
father did anything wrong?

796
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,523
He did nothing wrong.

797
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,776
Then, why did he get beat up?

798
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:06,698
Beat up?

799
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,242
Your father got beat up?

800
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,368
He was assaulted?

801
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,288
Yes, the boy witnessed it at the scene.

802
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:17,750
With the family in shock, I thought
you might not have gotten the whole story.

803
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,546
I understand. I'll talk
to the boy right away.

804
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,339
Have this in the meantime.

805
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,841
Thank you.

806
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,428
The boy couldn't stop crying before.

807
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,181
You can see from the statements...

808
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:37,187
Did you check the CCTV and confirm?

809
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,566
We checked, but at that time
there was a system checkup.

810
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:42,942
A system checkup?

811
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:47,906
Unfortunately, it coincided exactly
with the time of the incident.

812
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:53,077
But there is no legal obligation
to keep CCTV in private buildings.

813
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,287
What about the check?

814
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,373
Who gave the check
and where was it issued?

815
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,126
I can't stand this anymore.

816
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,587
Don't you think you're
crossing the line?

817
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,673
If you keep this up, we'll
file a formal complaint.

818
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,176
Do you think we're idiots?

819
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,804
I'm just trying to help since
there's been a development.

820
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,474
Who's helping who?

821
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:18,186
We're busy as hell here

822
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,438
and you're bothering us
with improper solicitation.

823
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,856
What did you say?

824
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,107
Solicitation?

825
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,235
I'm cooperating in an investigation!

826
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,028
What the heck? What's your rank?

827
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,238
You're with
the Metropolitan Bureau?

828
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,155
Let's get outta here!

829
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,116
Why don't you take the damn case?!

830
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,078
Just because they couldn't
stop a man from jumping,

831
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,039
What the fuck?
you can't charge them for
aiding and abetting suicide!

832
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,873
Get your hands off!

833
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,416
What are we supposed to do?!

834
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,659
He's from the Met Bureau?

835
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,287
This isn't even within their jurisdiction!

836
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,330
He says he's friends with Director Cho.

837
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,417
Why is this loser cop
talking nonsense?

838
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,751
- Legal Team?
- Yes.

839
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,044
When are we getting
the case review?

840
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,131
We've got to be ready to file
a complaint for interference, okay?

841
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,007
Understood.

842
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:32,885
You guys must think I'm playing here.

843
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,470
I'm Choi Dea-Woong, SVP.

844
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,599
You're here to see the Director of
Strategy? For what reason?

845
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,685
You're a senior vice president!

846
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,438
Does that mean you outrank Tae-Oh?

847
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:48,776
I heard there was an unfortunate
incident at Tae-Oh's company.

848
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,238
So, I stopped by to see
if I can offer help.

849
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,156
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
SEO DO-CHEOL

850
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,658
There was an unfortunate incident.

851
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,162
But it is being taken care of
according to the law.

852
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:03,416
Don't be like that. That's not right.

853
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,169
Is Tae-Oh very busy?

854
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,255
Let's not put each other
in uncomfortable positions.

855
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,134
If you're getting any funny
ideas about this incident,

856
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,636
there is nothing of the sort.

857
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,138
What funny idea might that be?

858
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,057
Did somebody get beat up?

859
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:22,810
The Director of Strategy
is using elevator 3.

860
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,272
I've got your contact details.

861
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,857
Hey! Tae-Oh!

862
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,609
Tae-Oh! It's me, Do-Cheol!

863
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,486
Hey! Stop him!

864
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,071
Get him out!

865
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,572
Grab him!

866
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,573
Hey, Tae-Oh!

867
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,325
My leg!

868
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,702
Shit! My leg!

869
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,120
- Tae-Oh! My man!
- Shit!

870
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:45,083
Bastards! Let go of me!

871
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,215
Do your job right, or else!

872
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:56,052
Call our police network
and get this guy's details.

873
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,470
Right away, sir.

874
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,234
Loosen up.

875
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,694
Low!

876
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:27,166
Hey.

877
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,669
Are you playing with me?

878
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,755
Do you think I pay you for this?

879
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,607
Keep your body low.

880
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,817
Grapple!

881
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,866
That's too tight.

882
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:04,203
Don't squeeze.

883
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,330
Let go!

884
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,376
Too strong!

885
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,336
Tae-Gu! Release!

886
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:13,963
Release, you bastard!

887
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:15,965
Hey!

888
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,884
I said release!

889
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,387
Fuck!

890
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,098
Are you okay?

891
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,810
I'm alright.

892
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,687
This makes it fun.

893
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,964
Wait... stop!

894
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:57,965
Stop!

895
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,186
Think you got what it takes
to be my bodyguard?

896
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,773
Find something more suitable.

897
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,443
Sorry to keep you waiting.

898
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,487
I'm ready now.

899
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:25,701
WOMEN WANT PREMIUM

900
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:29,330
CITY-LIKE LIVING SPACES

901
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:40,675
I don't feel like wanting to
live in that apartment.

902
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,386
Since we're pressed for time...

903
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,055
We'll revise it for the next media cycle.

904
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,227
Attack. Attack!

905
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,022
Down.

906
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,732
I was just playing.

907
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,445
Let's change to a fresh face.

908
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,323
You know that TV show
"Wicked Beauties"?

909
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,409
I like the girl in that show.

910
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,870
She has the same agency as Da-Hye.

911
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,998
What was the fuss about?

912
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,960
Do you know a cop
called Seo Do-Cheol?

913
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,880
He said he knows you personally.

914
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:19,964
A cop?

915
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:20,715
Yeah.

916
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:21,757
Who could it be?

917
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,719
Not here for the investigation?

918
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:29,557
He said he's
personally close to you

919
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,851
and wanted to help.

920
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,186
Idiot... Who's helping who?

921
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,690
I think he's after a kickback
thinking it's a corporate case.

922
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,901
Poking around for a slice of the pie.

923
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,027
Don't worry about it.

924
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,778
I got this.

925
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:47,533
This country treats
businessmen like criminals.

926
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,244
Isn't it run by the taxes we pay?

927
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,080
What about the hospital?

928
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,417
Hey.

929
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,300
As for the injury
sustained in the office,

930
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,178
I made sure no medical
records were made.

931
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:11,265
More natural to make it
an injury from the fall.

932
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,434
And according to the doctor,

933
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,563
it's unlikely that he'll wake up.

934
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,859
We'll settle with the family and
get the legal team's full analysis.

935
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,153
It'll all be quiet by
tomorrow morning.

936
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,409
Let's work smart.

937
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,080
It won't be a problem

938
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,416
unless someone makes it
into a problem.

939
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,427
I'll be back in a little bit.

940
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,388
I already put in my
hours for the month.

941
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:55,101
What have you been up to
that I should get a call from upstairs?

942
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,894
Are you stirring up trouble
in the other district?!

943
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,729
Stop breathing down my neck!

944
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,147
I'll explain later at the office.

945
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,607
I'm busy. I gotta go.

946
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,572
Hey! What are you doing?

947
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,367
- You can't be in here.
- What's going on?

948
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,578
Detective.

949
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,747
Let's not step on each other's toes.

950
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,623
Take him out.

951
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,208
What the heck?

952
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,376
Hey!

953
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,377
You're in a hospital...

954
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,586
Please keep it down!

955
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,296
- Go outside! Now!
- Alright. Fine.

956
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,841
Did they offer money?
Did you accept?

957
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,300
Did they make you sign anything?

958
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,593
No... I just...

959
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,095
Let's talk outside.

960
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,764
Don't touch me! I'm talking!

961
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,145
Mr. Choi!

962
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,855
Let go, man!

963
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,190
Jeez...

964
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:49,905
The company is giving condolence money
for the sake of the corporate image.

965
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,450
A lawyer should determine that.

966
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,577
Why is a cop acting as a go-between?

967
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,246
What's a lawyer got to do with this?

968
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,664
It's a case of attempted suicide.

969
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,667
A man threw himself off
a big corporation building.

970
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,753
And not a single article is
published in the papers.

971
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:08,299
The company is so quick
to try to settle the case.

972
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,508
What settlement?

973
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,718
It's condolence money.

974
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:14,555
We gotta figure out why he jumped
before you settle or offer condolences!

975
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:20,186
The victim over there,
he was assaulted in Cho's office.

976
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,730
Why are you weaving tales
in someone else's district?!

977
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,523
We checked the facts, too!

978
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,528
Their legal team wanted to sue
for interference with business!

979
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,113
Cho stopped that from happening!

980
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:33,532
Did you take a bribe?

981
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,869
You're crossing the line here.

982
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,457
You little piece of shit.

983
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,753
We may have no money,
but we have integrity.

984
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,382
Don't go around smearing our name.

985
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,769
Damn stairs...

986
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,815
I'm sorry, baby.

987
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,445
Life's hard because of
hunger and injustice.

988
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:16,325
All I want is to live a dignified
life like a human being.

989
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,829
But I get treated like a lowlife
because of a few bucks.

990
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,622
I can't live like this anymore.

991
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,376
To punish the powerful,

992
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,837
this is the only way.

993
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,340
Please forgive me.

994
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:41,058
I don't think that cop is after a payoff.

995
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,478
So what?

996
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,397
So I think we should...

997
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,903
speak to our corporate advisor, Jeong,

998
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,698
who retired as a police commissioner.

999
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:02,746
I'll get him to funnel his influence down
the right channels to give the cop a push.

1000
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:11,505
Superintendent Kim is interested in
pursuing politics after his retirement.

1001
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:15,217
This soccer league is to secure
votes from the local district.

1002
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,386
Meetings like this can be awkward.

1003
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,264
But some face time
definitely has an effect.

1004
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,729
Please pick up your uniforms!

1005
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,522
Come this way!

1006
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,108
This is a nice field.

1007
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,611
What's a busy man like you doing here?

1008
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:34,612
I'm Cho Tae-Oh.

1009
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,031
I should've paid you a visit earlier.
I heard a lot about you.

1010
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,992
Thanks to you, I get to
see my old boss again

1011
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:44,371
and play in this nice field.

1012
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,415
Please use it as you please.

1013
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,459
- May I?
- Let's take a walk.

1014
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,340
You must be busy with issues
at your father's company.

1015
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,884
Must be a burden
to deal with other problems.

1016
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,844
I should have done better.

1017
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,846
I can only blame my inexperience.

1018
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:05,017
I reviewed the file, but
we've already closed the case.

1019
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,479
There's a loose cannon
at the Metropolitan Bureau.

1020
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,022
Yes, I heard.

1021
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:14,652
Luckily, I'm a schoolmate and
close friends with his superintendent.

1022
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,695
We still go climbing together.

1023
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:20,908
His daughter just graduated
from music school

1024
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,285
and wants to hold a recital.

1025
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:28,040
And my son will soon be
job hunting, too.

1026
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,876
Is he already graduating?

1027
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,169
- Yes, sir.
- What was his major?

1028
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:34,922
Seo,

1029
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:37,174
why are you going around
and pissing on everyone?

1030
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,218
You gonna keep smearing my name?

1031
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,469
SUPERINTENDENT KANG JUNG-SHIK

1032
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,263
I guess I spoiled you too much lately.

1033
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:45,474
But the victim helped us
with the car smuggling case...

1034
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,767
Now you dare to interrupt?

1035
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,855
You accused them of taking a bribe?

1036
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,109
You become a star and
now have no respect.

1037
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,612
Are you the only cop in this town?

1038
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,865
You ungrateful bastard...

1039
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:07,246
If I hear anything
about this case again...

1040
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,833
Put him on the housewives
gambling crackdown

1041
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,751
so that he doesn't run around
stirring up trouble.

1042
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:13,794
Yes, sir.

1043
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,006
Why so down?

1044
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,758
Come on. Cheer up.

1045
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,926
Look at me, huh?

1046
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,136
Joo-Yeon!

1047
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,013
Oh, sorry.

1048
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,140
There's someone here to see you.

1049
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:27,516
To see me?

1050
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:36,066
We know Mr. Seo is upset
about his driver friend.

1051
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,069
but... how should I put it?

1052
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:42,197
We think he is crossing the line

1053
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,076
and that's not helping anybody.

1054
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,956
What my husband does
is not my business.

1055
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:57,296
I understand things are
difficult with the loan and all.

1056
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:00,632
We can help with that.

1057
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,218
And as for your children,

1058
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:08,640
our education department can
provide support until they go to college.

1059
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,893
Please persuade your husband.

1060
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,314
Emotions and the law should not mix.

1061
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:20,277
If your husband continues
to investigate us,

1062
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,198
we can't provide support
for the driver's family.

1063
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:29,286
Let's consider how
we can help each other.

1064
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,500
You know what?

1065
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,169
I have the same bag at home.

1066
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,005
Mine must be a knockoff.

1067
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:44,635
Anyway, this is a hard color
to match with clothes and shoes.

1068
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,762
We can fix that.

1069
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,807
You'd think this can pack a lot.

1070
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,850
But you can't really fit a lot in.

1071
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,518
Look.

1072
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,981
You don't have to check that here.

1073
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:01,276
Then why are you giving it to me here?

1074
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,278
Do you need a receipt from me?

1075
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,450
When we begged you
to sponsor our sports events,

1076
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,494
you pretended to be deaf.

1077
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,747
This is enough to hold events
for a whole year.

1078
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:18,127
Isn't it exhausting? Buying
people with your money?

1079
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,546
You might regret this.

1080
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:23,674
Look here.

1081
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:27,177
My life's been a regret
since I married that loser.

1082
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,720
I've got nothing else to regret.

1083
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,097
So no need to worry about me.

1084
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:31,223
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
HOUSEWIVES GAMBLING CRIMINAL CASE REPORT

1085
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:31,974
Fuck.

1086
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,560
Housewives gambling gang?!

1087
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,728
I'm not doing that shit!

1088
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,230
An order is an order!

1089
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,857
You're a part of the system!

1090
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,483
Come here!

1091
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,569
Hey, Seo Do-Cheol!

1092
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:48,073
What did you say to me
when we got married?

1093
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:51,577
You couldn't guarantee a life of luxury
but you wouldn't let me live in shame.

1094
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:55,497
Then you have people come
to my work and embarrass me?

1095
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:58,584
Hey...

1096
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,503
What the hell are you
doing at my work?

1097
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:06,425
You're telling the world we need
a loan even for our rent deposit?

1098
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,135
What?

1099
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,513
People from Sin Jin Trading
paid me a visit

1100
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:16,059
and gave me a designer bag
packed with cash.

1101
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,812
Which bastards from Sin Jin?

1102
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:22,566
You're the cop! You figure that out!

1103
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,361
We agreed not to interfere
with each other's work,

1104
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,155
but let me say one thing.

1105
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,407
Let's not live in shame.

1106
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:35,787
Hey!

1107
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,837
You know what really
made me ashamed?

1108
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:48,759
When they put that bag
full of cash in front of me...

1109
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,303
I wavered.

1110
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,433
I'm a human being and a woman, too.

1111
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,352
Okay?

1112
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,695
India is a fascinating country.

1113
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,948
I was especially
impressed with the people

1114
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,324
and their philosophy.

1115
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,826
Met a few fabulous
people on the last trip.

1116
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:18,705
They even gave me some useful tips
on dealing with things in India.

1117
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,332
Really? What'd they say?

1118
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,377
If we can't do it today,
there's tomorrow.

1119
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,046
That is quite true.

1120
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,839
Do you have an appointment?

1121
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,633
Stop him!

1122
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,260
Even if you're a cop,

1123
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:34,429
this establishment is
for members only!

1124
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,556
Back off!

1125
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:36,515
Hey! Hey!

1126
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:41,103
You're making a big mistake...

1127
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,447
Oh, it's you.

1128
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,908
Cops don't abide by the law?

1129
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,160
Who are you to mention law?!

1130
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,996
I told you not to cause trouble.

1131
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,164
What heinous crime did you commit,

1132
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,168
that you're splashing cash
at a cop's wife?

1133
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:09,089
You're being rude in front of
my foreign guests.

1134
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,092
If they know that you're a cop,

1135
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,386
what impression would
they get of Korea?

1136
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,138
A fucked up one, you punk!

1137
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:21,059
Let go, you sons of bitches!

1138
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,314
Why are you doing this to me?

1139
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:27,441
Will you be able to deal with
what's to come?

1140
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:28,859
Cho Tae-Oh...

1141
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,945
The punishment for assault isn't bad.

1142
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,447
Apologize sincerely,

1143
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,949
compensate the family and end it.

1144
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,327
You little bastard...

1145
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,246
Don't touch me!

1146
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,553
Prosecutor Oh is handling this case?

1147
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,557
Don't embarrass me
in front of my juniors.

1148
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:05,771
The papers had the drafts
sent to the editor.

1149
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,148
But they stopped the story
from being published.

1150
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,485
Isn't it a simple wage protest?

1151
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,028
I'm telling you there's more.

1152
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,987
Like what?

1153
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:19,326
Give me the inside
scoop on Cho Tae-Oh.

1154
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:22,746
I'll give you an exclusive
on the Sin Jin suicide attempt.

1155
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:25,165
This is a big story.

1156
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,709
You're always trying to fish without bait.

1157
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,461
What am I supposed to bite?

1158
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,629
Son of a bitch...

1159
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,717
I think the driver was assaulted
before he jumped off.

1160
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:39,012
Cho Tae-Oh instigated it himself.

1161
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,305
I'm liking it.

1162
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,558
The victim's son was at the scene.

1163
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,518
His underage son?

1164
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:49,022
The cops on the case
are trying to close it.

1165
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:52,109
Not much I can do
since I'm not on this case.

1166
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:53,735
Hey...

1167
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,029
If you do some media manipulation,

1168
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,615
maybe there's something I can do.

1169
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,159
This is gonna be a sensation.

1170
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,913
Don't share it with anyone else!

1171
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,299
Is this it?

1172
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:20,345
I'm asking you! Can't you hear?

1173
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:25,767
Anyone here?

1174
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,436
Mr. Choi!

1175
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,397
Did you eat?

1176
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,567
We'll cover the cost.

1177
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:37,863
Why don't you leave the country
until this quiets down?

1178
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,117
You are talking nonsense again.

1179
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,746
Why should I run when I'm the victim?

1180
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,790
Can't you see that
I'm already in prison?

1181
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,333
I know.

1182
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:53,879
We're not asking you
to leave with empty pockets.

1183
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,383
I also have ears, Mr. Choi.

1184
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:01,595
I used to be a member of
the Mammoth gang.

1185
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:07,434
It's all because of
that loose cannon cop.

1186
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:12,147
There are a lot of hungry
and eager kids here.

1187
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,817
Even before making
the boat trip to this country,

1188
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,695
they had no registration, no I.D.s.

1189
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,113
Safe for operations.

1190
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:21,490
Operations?

1191
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:26,369
Tying this up benefits us both.

1192
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,998
It'll just be a matter of time
before that cop finds me.

1193
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:36,463
Let's say some foreigner
mistakes him for me

1194
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,465
and accidentally kills him.

1195
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,009
What are they gonna do about it?

1196
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:45,889
Do you have a quotation?

1197
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,308
Five big ones, non-negotiable.

1198
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,978
I can get by in the Philippines
with that kind of money.

1199
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,779
You're early. Traffic wasn't bad?

1200
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:02,656
Park the car!

1201
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,617
I had a chat with Jeon, the contractor.

1202
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,705
He made an interesting proposition.

1203
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:13,458
I thought you weren't
gonna call me again.

1204
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,627
Don't treat me like that.

1205
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,839
I also didn't want to call.

1206
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,636
I...

1207
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,057
You're pregnant?

1208
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,768
What, you wanna
marry me or something?

1209
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,566
Think before you cause trouble.

1210
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,486
Pull a trick like this again
and you're dead.

1211
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,285
Door is closing.

1212
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,786
Let them in.

1213
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,746
Please, get in.

1214
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,039
Get in.

1215
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,132
Door is closing.

1216
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,638
I got a call from Myeong Seong Daily.

1217
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:13,685
Had to run ads to stop the article.

1218
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,438
What trouble did he get himself into?

1219
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,189
What happened?

1220
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,483
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

1221
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,613
Are you just going to apologize
all the time like your father?

1222
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,449
What were you doing?

1223
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:31,453
Didn't we hire you to take care
of problems like this?

1224
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:34,998
What really happened?

1225
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,209
Would you even believe me?

1226
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,129
Get down on the floor.

1227
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:51,473
Hands clasped?

1228
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,850
What kind of an aide have you been

1229
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:59,356
to let a subcontractor get beat up
in the office and attempt suicide?

1230
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,234
You let this happen when
the company is in trouble?!

1231
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:08,365
What were you doing
while this was going on?!

1232
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:09,616
I'm sorry, sir!

1233
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:13,995
I'll make sure this doesn't
cause further damage.

1234
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,288
Any leaks from inside?

1235
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,208
Everyone at the scene is clean.

1236
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:22,003
We checked their emails
and phone records.

1237
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,297
There were no records
of contacting the press.

1238
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,548
Then what?

1239
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,802
The reporter was saying
his morning prayers

1240
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,762
and had an epiphany?!

1241
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,850
How can you run a company
in such a mental state?!

1242
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,186
You have to watch your blood pressure.

1243
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,024
Activate the media agencies

1244
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,527
and stop it from leaking to the press.

1245
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:51,116
You tell my wife

1246
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,577
to arrange a dinner with
the head prosecutor's wife.

1247
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:58,748
Heard she goes nuts for paintings.

1248
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:02,877
And you...

1249
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:07,132
Send all employees involved
on international assignments.

1250
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:10,385
You leave the country, too.

1251
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,512
This is the last time.

1252
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,639
You mess up one more time,

1253
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:19,185
you won't get a dime
from the company.

1254
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,546
You shouldn't drive.

1255
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:47,756
I'll get someone.

1256
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,007
Is that important now?

1257
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:55,555
You know the operation
that the contractor mentioned,

1258
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,141
let's proceed with that.

1259
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,267
Director Cho...

1260
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,813
Tae-Oh,

1261
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,274
that's a very risky proposition.

1262
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,902
Are you treating me like a retard?

1263
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,279
Because I'm the kid of the second wife?

1264
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:14,449
Why do you say that?
You know that's not it.

1265
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,410
There's just no need since
the Chairman is involved.

1266
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:20,205
Then why won't this
simple problem go away?!

1267
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,461
To survive in this family,
we gotta get tough.

1268
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,797
That applies to both of us.

1269
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,926
If we can't handle
a simple problem like this,

1270
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:36,596
what little we have will go
to my goddamn siblings.

1271
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:45,146
I'm sorry but my editor won't budge.
Sin Jin is putting on pressure.
You should back off before it gets dangerous.
Reporter Park,
Myeong Seong Daily.

1272
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,275
I haven't been able to
reach him for days.

1273
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:52,654
I can't even go home because of him.

1274
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,739
Can I use your phone?
My battery's dead.

1275
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:57,158
There are other phones here.

1276
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,077
Relax. I won't make
an international call.

1277
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,371
You're invading my privacy!

1278
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:02,789
Look what we have here.

1279
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:05,083
You got a call from Jeon
10 minutes ago.

1280
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,292
What?

1281
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:11,381
We're the kind of people that go for
intestine soup after seeing a dead body.

1282
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:15,051
If I want, I can send
anybody to prison.

1283
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,470
There's a family that pissed me off.

1284
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,472
Now three generations
are living in the cells.

1285
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,391
I can make one call

1286
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:25,311
and get your call records
with the message logs.

1287
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:28,815
You want me to print out
all your emails, too?

1288
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:33,069
Where did you learn
to lie to a police officer?

1289
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,781
Where's Jeon?

1290
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,451
Internal Affairs

1291
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,497
What now?

1292
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:48,126
Something urgent came up.
I can't stop by the store.

1293
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,545
What? You want a snack?

1294
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:51,713
Chicken?

1295
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:55,258
I should get my car looked at.

1296
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,343
Shut up and listen.

1297
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:02,140
I don't know what you've been up to
but Internal Affairs is here to see you.

1298
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,224
Internal Affairs?

1299
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,434
What the hell?

1300
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,769
Don't come in today.

1301
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:07,896
Chief?

1302
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,564
What do you mean don't come in?

1303
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,523
Hello?

1304
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,692
Hello? What the...?

1305
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,277
Detective Seo...

1306
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:18,239
Don't make it hard for your
colleagues. Come in ASAP.

1307
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:29,584
I was on my knees
and had my hands up

1308
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,628
but he started kicking mercilessly.

1309
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:35,006
Didn't even tell us that he was a cop.

1310
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,097
I scraped my knees.

1311
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:47,393
He's showing signs of a concussion
due to blunt force trauma.

1312
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,230
You know the metal pipe?

1313
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:53,942
He kicked it, and I got hit right here.

1314
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,778
And he started beating me up.

1315
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,616
I fell in and out of consciousness
but I still remember...

1316
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,326
What Miranda?

1317
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,203
When I came around,

1318
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,372
I found myself locked up
in the police station.

1319
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,915
I was just doing my job

1320
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,792
when my boss was attacked.

1321
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:14,087
Sorry to bother you at this hour.

1322
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:15,713
It's a bit urgent.

1323
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,968
There's a guy named
Seo Do-Cheol on my team.

1324
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,720
The one that busted up
the mob with us.

1325
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,097
That's the one!

1326
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,682
But...

1327
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:29,185
Internal Affairs is here
about an investigation.

1328
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,522
Can you find out what
the investigation is for?

1329
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:35,525
Officers get bad names
because of people like you.

1330
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,694
The Police Department's
image is tarnished.

1331
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,946
Control your emotions.

1332
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,239
Detective Seo,

1333
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:44,784
we understand that your wife
met an executive from Sin Jin.

1334
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:50,206
Someone saw Mr. Choi giving
a designer bag to your wife.

1335
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:54,836
You've been digging around
Sin Jin without authorization.

1336
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:58,172
And you threatened Cho today. Correct?

1337
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,676
Let's not get involved
with Sin Jin anymore.

1338
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:07,098
If you keep it up, even the commissioner
will start feeling the heat.

1339
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,809
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

1340
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,771
If you're one of us, don't
stab your own in the back.

1341
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,232
Should we check for
dust on your team?

1342
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:17,817
Sorry for interrupting.

1343
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,111
Who did you say approved
the investigation?!

1344
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,488
Can't you see we're talking?

1345
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:25,742
I called your team and
they didn't know you were here.

1346
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,745
Don't you know we report
directly to the commissioner?

1347
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,204
Have you talked to the commissioner?

1348
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,416
Fine! I'll put you through to my boss.

1349
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:34,917
Take him if you're confident.

1350
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:38,546
There's no need.
We got all the information.

1351
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:40,256
Let's go.

1352
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,967
Next time the whole team
will be out in the cold.

1353
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,429
For Christ's sake!

1354
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:47,555
Easy!

1355
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,308
You know how it works. Rank is king.

1356
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:51,225
Everything alright?

1357
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:52,477
Does this look okay to you?!

1358
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,479
I'm just doing my job!

1359
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,897
What is the matter?

1360
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,524
Someone called saying
she couldn't reach you.

1361
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,777
The female employee
of the logistics company.

1362
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:03,863
Don't tell him I contacted you.

1363
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:06,699
Mr. Jeon is going out of the country.

1364
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,118
He asked me to wire some money.

1365
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,746
You sure I'm not gonna
get in trouble for this?

1366
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:14,999
Of course. Don't worry.

1367
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,627
Text me Jeon's location.

1368
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,130
Hey, Seo! Get your ass over here!

1369
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,173
What? Why?

1370
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,092
Why are you interfering with my life?!

1371
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,052
You don't want me
to get a promotion, do you?!

1372
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,266
I feel bad that he had to
attempt suicide

1373
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,477
and I understand why
you're raving mad.

1374
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:39,732
But no police officer has ever
touched one of the super rich.

1375
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,026
Perhaps the prosecutors,
but us, no way.

1376
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,611
- Listen.
- Not in our lifetime!

1377
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,613
- Come on, man!
- It's out of the question!

1378
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,614
Brother!

1379
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,074
What's become of you?

1380
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:51,160
Don't be scared, you old man!
You won't die!

1381
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:54,831
You said, judges kill with decisions
and cops kill with reports!

1382
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,290
I'll make sure to kill with a report!

1383
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,835
Who's going to approve that report?!

1384
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:08,845
We both gotta work
until our kids go to college.

1385
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:12,265
You've done enough.

1386
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,435
Let's get back inside.

1387
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:19,188
You should move up
all the way to superintendent.

1388
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:21,816
But fuck it, since I'll
never make it that high.

1389
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,318
This isn't even your case!

1390
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:27,488
My friend from West District
went after a big gun.

1391
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,575
He got kicked to the curb
and got divorced,

1392
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:33,619
and is now living in a rented room
firing charcoal for barbecue.

1393
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,537
Get out!

1394
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:38,875
Go, you bastard!

1395
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:53,264
MOTEL

1396
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:13,576
Holy shit!

1397
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,791
As teammates, even our
farts should smell the same.

1398
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:24,545
Superintendent Oh!

1399
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,130
Why are you here, newbie?

1400
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,008
Chief asked me to drop him off.

1401
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:30,343
I even had a date waiting.

1402
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:32,386
Don't you live on the opposite side?

1403
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,596
Way opposite.

1404
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:53,699
Rock, paper, scissors!

1405
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,450
Shit...

1406
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:55,576
Rock, paper, scissors!

1407
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:56,536
Damn...

1408
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:00,665
Excuse me.

1409
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:03,417
Can you move your car?

1410
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:06,546
You can't park at the designated spot.

1411
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:07,296
You piece of shit!

1412
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:08,381
Grab him!

1413
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:09,340
Let go!

1414
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,383
Open the door!

1415
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,801
I'll kill you! You motherfucker!

1416
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:12,468
Open up!

1417
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,053
You said "one man"!

1418
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,263
I don't know. Fuck!

1419
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,097
Hold tight!

1420
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,057
Open up, you bastards!

1421
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:18,975
You motherfucker!

1422
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:22,937
Behind you!

1423
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:24,772
Hey!

1424
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:26,732
Grab it! Grab the knife!

1425
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,946
Newbie! Fuck...

1426
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:34,657
You alright, man?

1427
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:38,661
Bastards...

1428
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,144
Do-Cheol, grab that bastard!

1429
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:04,145
You motherfucker!

1430
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:34,133
Hey!

1431
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:35,176
Stop right there!

1432
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:36,052
Pick up.

1433
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:42,475
Pick up the damn phone.

1434
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,186
It's Jeon...

1435
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:46,646
Pick up the phone!

1436
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:49,065
- Shit...
- We're fucked!

1437
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,626
Go away! Shit...

1438
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:17,885
You motherfucker, you're fucked!

1439
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,016
You bastard...

1440
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,437
Stop following me! Shit...

1441
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:39,490
Alright.

1442
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,449
Way to go, Miss Bong!

1443
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,493
Just stop hitting me!

1444
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,662
Stay put, you piece of shit.

1445
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,664
Who are you?!

1446
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:49,625
Friend of the cop you just stabbed.

1447
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,547
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1448
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,966
I was imprisoned by those people.

1449
01:24:56,967 --> 01:25:00,010
I called Mr. Choi
to borrow some money.

1450
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:02,805
Our newbie got knifed?
Was that him?

1451
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,516
You bastards...

1452
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:07,351
- Detective Wang.
- Yes, sir.

1453
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:09,061
- There are some spider webs.
- Got it.

1454
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:17,486
You fucking asshole!

1455
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:19,864
Piece of shit!

1456
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,534
Come on! Let's talk!

1457
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:24,577
Who the fuck?!

1458
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:27,496
Who knifed the newbie?!

1459
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,543
Are you in charge here?

1460
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:36,213
Law enforcers can't behave this way!

1461
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,715
Where is the law here?!

1462
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:40,676
Did you knife my newbie?

1463
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,762
Wasn't me personally, sir.

1464
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:47,933
You moron!

1465
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:51,145
How can you let a scumbag
like this get to you?!

1466
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,104
He's got connections.

1467
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,606
Who's got his back? God?

1468
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,525
How dare they touch a cop?!

1469
01:25:58,069 --> 01:25:59,320
I'm telling you,

1470
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,197
before the newbie
wakes up from surgery,

1471
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:03,157
bring in the motherfucker
responsible for this!

1472
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:05,951
You heard the man!

1473
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,706
Now, it's conspiracy to murder a cop.

1474
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:14,460
Did we find something?

1475
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,504
We got something big.

1476
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:19,507
This bastard got paid in US dollars.

1477
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,592
Here's a passport and
tickets to the Philippines.

1478
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,595
We can track the bank
that issued the cash.

1479
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:27,515
CCTV from the bank will
lead us right to them.

1480
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:31,227
We got you, motherfuckers.

1481
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,395
While tracking the cash,

1482
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,649
go back to Sin Jin and
secure the video footage.

1483
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:37,316
Yes, sir.

1484
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,985
And Bong... You get
the emergency call records.

1485
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:20,150
I heard you got a big one.

1486
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:20,943
What?

1487
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,862
I have a visitor. Get lost.

1488
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:24,864
- Get outta here.
- Bye.

1489
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,577
Please have a seat.

1490
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:32,246
Did you eat?

1491
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,164
Yes.

1492
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:40,671
I should've paid you
a visit earlier. I'm sorry.

1493
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,173
No need to apologize.

1494
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,217
And you shouldn't have.

1495
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:46,677
Thank you.

1496
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,598
How is your husband?

1497
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,225
More time before he's
out of critical condition?

1498
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,727
Seems like it.

1499
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,397
If you stay too long in
the hospital, you'll get sick.

1500
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:02,985
You need to get some
air once in a while.

1501
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:06,113
Is your son doing well
at his grandmother's?

1502
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:08,198
Yes, thanks to you.

1503
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:10,367
He seemed like a thoughtful boy.

1504
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,996
What can I do for you?

1505
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:25,257
You know the text
message he sent me.

1506
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:28,636
I've been looking at it over and over.

1507
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:31,555
I realized something wasn't right.

1508
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:35,517
He's never written
a long message like this.

1509
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:40,564
Even if he wrote it
thinking it was his last,

1510
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:44,485
his messages are
normally full of typos.

1511
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:49,782
And he never uses periods.

1512
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:55,746
He always said he hated
men playing with phones.

1513
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:59,124
He never got used to
sending text messages.

1514
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:05,631
You still have his mobile phone?

1515
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:17,434
I'm sorry.

1516
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:21,855
We sent lawyers right away to deal
with the situation from last night.

1517
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,440
Take a seat.

1518
01:29:24,275 --> 01:29:25,734
Had no time to eat, did you?

1519
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:27,695
Let's have a meal.

1520
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:31,740
Sit down.

1521
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,327
You work without sleep.

1522
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,496
You should at least eat well.

1523
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,206
Come on.

1524
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:43,961
I like the eel from this place.

1525
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:45,004
Here.

1526
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:54,805
The cop didn't die, did he?

1527
01:29:56,224 --> 01:30:00,227
He's injured but it's not critical.

1528
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:03,272
Jeon and the other men at the scene,

1529
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:06,567
they know they'll be in danger
if they open their mouths.

1530
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,487
We're doing all we can
with the lawyers.

1531
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:12,865
We have the situation under control.

1532
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:18,454
As your uncle, I never really
sat down for a meal with you.

1533
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,706
What's the point of living, I wonder.

1534
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,376
You remind me a lot of your father.

1535
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,047
Working so diligently.

1536
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:32,718
His last wish was
to look after you like a son.

1537
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:40,017
I feel bad for you and your dad.

1538
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:45,230
I will do a better job going forward.

1539
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:51,153
Dea-Woong.

1540
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:53,405
Yes, sir.

1541
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:55,741
We're family, aren't we?

1542
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:01,497
Show me that I can count on you.

1543
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,337
The attempted suicide
and the recent cop incident...

1544
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,380
Why don't you take the fall?

1545
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,008
I'll make sure to put up

1546
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,345
the best of my lawyers to support you.

1547
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,014
I know it will be a hassle.

1548
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:22,726
But eventually, you'll
be released on parole.

1549
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:27,606
Your aunt says it'll be hard
for your wife and kids

1550
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:30,150
to see you in trouble.

1551
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:34,738
So why don't we send
them to school in the UK?

1552
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:40,452
You should take charge of
Sin Jin Motors, once it's over.

1553
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:44,915
You'll be a president.
Your dad would've been proud.

1554
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,302
Who's turning himself in?

1555
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:57,970
Detective Seo.

1556
01:31:57,971 --> 01:31:58,679
Excuse me,

1557
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,974
but my client is unstable due to
the grave guilt he's feeling.

1558
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:04,434
Mr. Choi, this isn't right.
Why are you doing this?

1559
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:06,353
My client requests...

1560
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,857
Will Cho take care of you
for life if you take the fall?

1561
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:12,401
For instigating assault and
conspiracy to murder?

1562
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:13,610
Do you know how long
you'll rot in jail?

1563
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:15,362
Are you threatening my client?

1564
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:17,406
Conspiracy to murder a police officer?

1565
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,997
Go easy.

1566
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:27,666
- Why?
- He says to go easy.

1567
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:28,417
I got it.

1568
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:32,671
I also feel terrible that a cop got hurt.

1569
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:35,299
I misunderstood Jeon.

1570
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,634
He said he would
take care of the problem.

1571
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:39,428
I had no idea he meant murder...

1572
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:40,846
How much are you
getting paid for this?!

1573
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:43,640
If you keep this up, we'll move
to the original jurisdiction!

1574
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:46,435
They closed the case!
That's why you're here!

1575
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:47,477
Who's in charge?!

1576
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:49,688
Out! Now!

1577
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:50,480
Hold on...

1578
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:52,566
I'm sorry. I apologize.

1579
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:54,526
Excuse me.

1580
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:59,364
Mr. Choi, I'm really curious.
So, let me just ask you this.

1581
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:00,657
Ask what?

1582
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:01,742
- You don't have to answer.
- No.

1583
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,493
Let him ask.

1584
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,748
Don't you think it's strange?

1585
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:10,542
When an apology could have
easily ended it...

1586
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,586
how did it get blown up like this?

1587
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:16,381
You must be used to
being criticized by society.

1588
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:20,260
Why go through so much
trouble to cover this up?

1589
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:24,181
That's why I turned myself in.
So it doesn't get bigger.

1590
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,812
You guys are real bastards.

1591
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:34,441
The order is to transfer
the case to a different team.

1592
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,902
What about the attempted
murder of our newbie?

1593
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,445
We got a confession.

1594
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:42,574
Transfer everything related to
Sin Jin Trading to Team 1.

1595
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:46,453
You'll get promoted to
the central investigative unit.

1596
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,413
Other members will get
new assignments, too.

1597
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:50,332
You're breaking up my team?

1598
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:57,756
Boss.

1599
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:03,637
You're here.

1600
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,013
Hey, man.

1601
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:08,225
They're transferring our
cases and splitting us up?

1602
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:10,852
Not exactly.

1603
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,605
It's not like we're getting fired.

1604
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:15,440
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

1605
01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:16,566
Why should we get fired?!

1606
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:17,526
Do-Cheol!

1607
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:20,487
Bong, did you look into it?

1608
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:22,781
What did you get her to do?

1609
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,283
Did you find out?

1610
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:28,954
There was an emergency call
from Sin Jin that was canceled.

1611
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:31,206
Doesn't match the time
that Bae sent the text.

1612
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:36,086
The emergency call was officially logged in
at 11:39 AM on the day of the incident.

1613
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:39,047
From another number
at the Sin Jin location.

1614
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,758
The call was terminated
while it was being processed.

1615
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,636
The emergency center
called back at 11:22 AM.

1616
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:47,347
REPORT DATE REPORT DETAILS
Emergency Call Records
Call disconnected during call
Callback attempted
Caller claims it was a missed call
But the caller did not
want to process the report.

1617
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:50,392
But the text message
from Bae to his wife

1618
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:54,146
was sent 15 minutes later at 11:37 AM.

1619
01:34:54,897 --> 01:34:56,773
If the accident happened
right before the first call...

1620
01:34:56,774 --> 01:35:00,694
That means Bae sent his
text after the accident.

1621
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:06,992
And lunch time was taken
30 minutes earlier than usual.

1622
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,911
The bastards cleared the whole floor.

1623
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:12,873
Do you see?
The accident was a setup.

1624
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:14,291
Give me just one more day.

1625
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:16,168
I'll bet my house on this.

1626
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:17,377
I thought you were renting.

1627
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:18,545
You punk!

1628
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:22,382
How can you harass me
so early in the morning?

1629
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:26,053
I don't think we should talk
without my lawyer present.

1630
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,972
I'm not here to investigate
but to say hello.

1631
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:32,017
We'll talk about
the same thing anyhow.

1632
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:35,771
If you've got time to waste,
spend it with your kids.

1633
01:35:35,772 --> 01:35:36,897
They grow up fast.

1634
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:40,650
Worry about yourself
rather than talking shit.

1635
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:42,736
Really gonna confess?

1636
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:45,697
To aiding in assault and
conspiring to murder?

1637
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:48,283
I told you I didn't know
about killing a cop.

1638
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:52,454
Is that all?

1639
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:55,415
Let's continue this in a formal manner.

1640
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:59,378
I didn't get a good night's sleep.

1641
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:00,337
Sit your ass down.

1642
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:10,680
Why did you do it?

1643
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:13,225
He didn't try to kill himself.

1644
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:14,518
We're done here.

1645
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:18,188
Shut up and sit down!
This is my district, son of a bitch!

1646
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,691
You should at least know
what crimes you're confessing to.

1647
01:36:26,697 --> 01:36:29,199
Bae got beat up by the contractor, Jeon.

1648
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,742
You paid him off.

1649
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:32,994
He sent his kid home in a cab.

1650
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,414
But Bae...

1651
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,000
felt so aggrieved and angry.

1652
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:41,962
So, he goes back to find you guys.

1653
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:45,173
Facts are confirmed up to this point.

1654
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:46,967
But...

1655
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:51,221
Then, the real accident happened.

1656
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,725
Cho Tae-Oh touched Bae.

1657
01:36:56,310 --> 01:37:00,105
One of the guards in
the room called emergency.

1658
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:04,734
But a bastard who's quick on his feet

1659
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,695
decides to fix the situation.

1660
01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:13,076
Conclusion...

1661
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:16,455
Bae didn't try to kill himself.

1662
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:20,000
You bastards staged it as a suicide.

1663
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:31,136
Just for a few bucks,
I'm living like a peasant.
I can't do this anymore.
In order to teach the rich a lesson,
this is all I can do.
Forgive me.

1664
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,237
That's a really good story.

1665
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,031
But...

1666
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:53,700
do you have evidence?

1667
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,960
Please come in.

1668
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:12,344
Athletes have a lot of fear.

1669
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:15,847
There was a call to 911
from this man's mobile.

1670
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:20,227
It's not ethical to fire a man
because of a broken leg.

1671
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:23,855
Can you put him on the witness stand?

1672
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:26,525
Of course, and there are others.

1673
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,236
Contractor Jeon in jail
also has lots of skeletons.

1674
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,820
You've also got dirt.

1675
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:35,534
I forgot to mention
that Jeon blackmailed us.

1676
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:37,744
How far do you think
your money will take you?

1677
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:40,413
How far do you think you can
take this as a lowly cop?

1678
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:41,915
3 years for assault,

1679
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,376
5 years for attempted murder
and trying to stage a suicide,

1680
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:46,753
conspiracy to murder
a police officer, at least 5!

1681
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:49,756
Can't change the facts no matter
who you have in your pocket!

1682
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:50,882
Look here.

1683
01:38:52,218 --> 01:38:53,718
A trader sells what he sees

1684
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:56,137
but a businessman invests in
what isn't apparent to the eye.

1685
01:38:56,138 --> 01:39:00,267
I'm investing my precious time here.

1686
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,936
Bad investment decision.

1687
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:06,231
Director Cho is leaving for
Singapore tomorrow morning.

1688
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:09,985
Are you confident
you can arrest him tonight?

1689
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,116
You should've invested in me.

1690
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,165
What's up?

1691
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,419
How's the ankle?

1692
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:31,256
I was just wondering
what you were up to.

1693
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:35,260
I guess you'll have some time
after Cho leaves the country.

1694
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:37,137
Alright...

1695
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:39,472
Call me when you're free.

1696
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,143
He is definitely leaving tomorrow, early.

1697
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:44,853
There's a party tonight.

1698
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:48,023
If this bastard gets to
Singapore on his private jet,

1699
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:50,400
he can get his blood cleansed.

1700
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:52,485
That would get rid of
all the evidence of drug use.

1701
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:55,488
He's worked closely
with the bodyguards.

1702
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:56,615
I know.

1703
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:58,825
I get your story.

1704
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:03,371
But who in their right mind would
throw a drug party in this situation?

1705
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:06,082
He would want to make sure
that his loyal cronies

1706
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:09,711
will cover his back while
he's out of the country.

1707
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:11,046
If you look at the VIP roster...

1708
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:15,216
What if we can't find anything?

1709
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:18,386
We wouldn't raise the stakes
without a backup plan.

1710
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:22,265
Stop bullshitting.

1711
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,809
If you really want to score
before the team splits,

1712
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,645
take care of that
housewives gambling case!

1713
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:27,979
Come on, boss!

1714
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:31,816
- Don't do this to us!
- I made myself clear.

1715
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:34,110
Did I ever let you down?!

1716
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:35,862
Who took care of
all the family events?!

1717
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:38,323
Your wedding, your kids'
birthdays and anniversaries...

1718
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:40,700
When your father passed away,
I even followed you to the graveyard!

1719
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:44,537
My team took care of
your in-laws' funerals!

1720
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:45,330
And this?!

1721
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:47,957
Because you had to attend
your daughter's graduation,

1722
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:51,086
I went to the scene
by myself and got stabbed!

1723
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:55,757
It's only because you were
reckless, you bastard!

1724
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:57,008
What about me?!

1725
01:40:57,009 --> 01:40:59,719
When you went alone to
Youngdeungpo and caused trouble,

1726
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:02,389
I got this while trying
to watch your back!

1727
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:05,266
You guys are just too much.

1728
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:09,479
When I got this leg
fucked up in Incheon,

1729
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,897
where were you guys?!

1730
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,232
At the sauna!

1731
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:16,152
I get such pain whenever
it rains that I can't sleep!

1732
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:23,201
Are we asking for much?

1733
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:25,412
Just let us do our jobs.

1734
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,247
You'll let them break us up?

1735
01:41:27,415 --> 01:41:28,957
Look.

1736
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:33,545
I heard these housewives
go everywhere.

1737
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,923
Perhaps they'll be at
Cho Tae-Oh's party tonight.

1738
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:42,303
What are you still doing here?

1739
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:48,017
I made myself clear that I want you
to take care of the gambling housewives.

1740
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:49,394
From what I hear,

1741
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:56,943
the mobs involved in
the gambling rings are the craziest.

1742
01:41:56,944 --> 01:41:59,696
That's why we're here to support.

1743
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:04,117
Shouldn't we get suited up
in protective gear?

1744
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:07,203
Cops make history with their bodies.

1745
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,706
My intestines were spilling out,

1746
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:11,791
I had to stuff them back in
on the way to the hospital.

1747
01:42:19,049 --> 01:42:20,467
Hey, baby. It's me.

1748
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,845
I just wanted to hear your voice.

1749
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:25,555
Why are you cursing?

1750
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:28,016
How's our boy?

1751
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,859
That white car

1752
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:40,779
belongs to the nephew
of the ex-prime minister.

1753
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,406
Behind him is the CEO of JD Telecoms.

1754
01:42:43,407 --> 01:42:46,409
- And that's an actress' car.
- Which one?

1755
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:47,660
Can't remember the name...

1756
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:48,787
Slow down!

1757
01:42:49,205 --> 01:42:50,163
Detective Wang.

1758
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:52,582
Check all the cars carefully.

1759
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,176
Standby.

1760
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:06,346
The cosmetic surgeon has
arrived with his bag.

1761
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:08,264
It's Cho Tae-Oh.

1762
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:09,808
Where?

1763
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:11,518
- There! The black sports car.
- Where, you bastard?!

1764
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:12,685
The one turning...
next to the middle lane.

1765
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:14,771
Wang, we've got Cho's car in sight.

1766
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:17,065
60 dollar fine for illegal U-turn.

1767
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:19,901
Since Cho Tae-Oh's here,
they'll start the party.

1768
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:21,653
Let's go pick up the trash.

1769
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,197
What's that vehicle?

1770
01:44:06,448 --> 01:44:08,449
Hey, Wang. I see a suspicious vehicle!

1771
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:09,784
Check that car!

1772
01:44:12,746 --> 01:44:14,664
It's Jeong Da-Hye.

1773
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:19,919
Back off.

1774
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,920
You can't go in.

1775
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:21,880
Step aside!

1776
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:22,714
We can't.

1777
01:44:22,715 --> 01:44:23,840
Don't you know who I am?

1778
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:25,216
Seo.

1779
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:28,469
Looks like she's here to spoil the party.

1780
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:29,554
What if she messes it up?

1781
01:44:29,555 --> 01:44:31,639
Don't say it, it's bad luck.

1782
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,516
I'll kick your ass back at the station!

1783
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:42,317
Mr. Cho wants to
see you quietly. Let's go.

1784
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:43,192
Where?

1785
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:45,737
I will kill you
if you're playing with me.

1786
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,685
Why the fuck did you show up here?

1787
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:19,270
How can you do this?

1788
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:21,105
I'm pregnant with your child!

1789
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:23,983
I can take it out right here.

1790
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,403
You call yourself a human being?

1791
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:34,035
When do they shoot up usually?

1792
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:39,916
You, son of a bitch!

1793
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,045
You ready, Miss Bong?

1794
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:50,134
There's someone dying in this building!

1795
01:45:50,135 --> 01:45:52,762
Her clothes are ripped!
She's being raped!

1796
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:54,973
What?! An assault?!

1797
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:58,476
We're on our way.

1798
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:02,730
Why? What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

1799
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:05,483
It's just from
that building over there.

1800
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:08,736
Someone is trying to
sexually assault a lady.

1801
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:10,655
It must be the housewives!

1802
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:12,281
We gotta go now!

1803
01:46:14,118 --> 01:46:15,326
Come on.

1804
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:22,583
Your household pet gets surprised
when it looks in the mirror.

1805
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:26,087
It thought it was a person
but it's just a bitch.

1806
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:30,383
Let's not fight.

1807
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,844
We were so good together.

1808
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:37,890
Can you just renew
my endorsement contract?

1809
01:46:38,183 --> 01:46:39,100
Then,

1810
01:46:39,393 --> 01:46:43,104
I'll get rid of the baby
and stay quiet, okay?

1811
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:47,817
I want to be on good terms with you.

1812
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:51,112
Why do you always try to use me?

1813
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:53,406
Just have fun tonight.

1814
01:47:09,256 --> 01:47:10,339
Sorry to disturb you at night.

1815
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:12,967
There's no trouble here.

1816
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:15,470
But there was a call.

1817
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:16,763
Do you have a search warrant?

1818
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:18,973
Search warrant, my ass!

1819
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:23,061
If we get an emergency call, we're
obligated to search without a warrant.

1820
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:24,479
You want the report number?

1821
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,521
Director Cho!

1822
01:47:25,939 --> 01:47:27,315
What?

1823
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:32,445
You're interfering with official business.

1824
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:35,156
We're protecting private property.

1825
01:47:36,033 --> 01:47:37,408
Run them over!

1826
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:38,326
Block them!

1827
01:47:42,164 --> 01:47:43,122
Hey.

1828
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:47,001
You don't want anything happening
to me or my friends here.

1829
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:49,420
Stop them.

1830
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:51,005
I don't care how you do it.

1831
01:47:52,758 --> 01:47:54,675
I'm hurt!

1832
01:47:55,844 --> 01:47:57,053
Don't come!

1833
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:57,887
Blood!

1834
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:05,061
Let go, you bastard!

1835
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:11,192
You're asking for it!

1836
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:23,746
I really didn't want to use this.

1837
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:26,290
Permission to open fire, detectives!

1838
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:29,210
You only brought your gun?

1839
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:34,757
Why don't you pick up?!

1840
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:38,094
Get the jet ready!

1841
01:48:38,095 --> 01:48:39,720
I'm leaving earlier than planned.

1842
01:48:39,721 --> 01:48:41,264
Singapore... no...

1843
01:48:41,265 --> 01:48:43,683
Hong Kong or Malaysia, anywhere!

1844
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:46,686
I'll be at the airport in one hour.

1845
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:48,187
You need a card to go up?

1846
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:50,064
Hurry up and open this.

1847
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:52,817
What's this?

1848
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:56,404
Get inside.

1849
01:48:56,989 --> 01:48:57,864
Inside.

1850
01:48:57,865 --> 01:48:58,614
Hurry.

1851
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:01,784
It's a maze. How can we find him?

1852
01:49:03,328 --> 01:49:04,620
Hey, where are you going?

1853
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:10,459
Fuck!

1854
01:49:15,257 --> 01:49:16,090
Da-Hye!

1855
01:49:16,091 --> 01:49:17,592
Da-Hye, wake up!

1856
01:49:20,262 --> 01:49:21,846
Line them up.

1857
01:49:30,189 --> 01:49:31,397
Da-Hye...

1858
01:49:37,446 --> 01:49:38,154
Hey!

1859
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:39,155
Yes?

1860
01:49:39,364 --> 01:49:40,239
What are you doing?

1861
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:42,408
It's not what it looks...

1862
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:44,285
You little fuck!

1863
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:48,164
Look at these idiots.

1864
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:49,999
Hey! Everyone!

1865
01:49:50,626 --> 01:49:53,085
We're the police!

1866
01:49:53,795 --> 01:49:55,504
Fuckheads!

1867
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:20,154
You guys should know better.

1868
01:50:21,323 --> 01:50:24,450
You're under arrest for violation
of drug enforcement laws

1869
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:27,119
and protection of minors
against sexual abuse.

1870
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:29,455
Caught in the act.

1871
01:50:30,832 --> 01:50:32,375
You guys are fucked.

1872
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:45,930
Cho Tae-Oh!

1873
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:03,424
That son of a bitch!

1874
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:09,221
Shit!

1875
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:45,443
Are you alright?

1876
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:47,570
- Are you okay?
- You alright?

1877
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:49,196
- Looks like you're hurt.
- I'm alright. I'm fine.

1878
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:57,746
Cho Tae-Oh!

1879
01:54:03,628 --> 01:54:05,796
Violation of drug
enforcement regulations.

1880
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:07,548
Violation of prostitution
enforcement regulations.

1881
01:54:07,549 --> 01:54:10,342
Violation of laws on the protection
of minors against sexual abuse.

1882
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:11,385
Drunk driving, speeding,

1883
01:54:11,636 --> 01:54:14,096
destruction of public property,
interference with official business,

1884
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:16,223
assault and attempted
murder of Bae Cheol-Ho.

1885
01:54:16,224 --> 01:54:18,726
You're under arrest
for all of these charges.

1886
01:54:19,019 --> 01:54:21,145
You have the right to remain silent

1887
01:54:21,313 --> 01:54:23,439
and the right to appoint a lawyer.

1888
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:27,276
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1889
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:30,529
I told you to stay out of
trouble, son of a bitch.

1890
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,283
You really want this?

1891
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:45,396
You should know your place.

1892
01:55:54,614 --> 01:55:55,322
Piss off.

1893
01:55:55,699 --> 01:55:56,532
Get out of the way!

1894
01:55:56,908 --> 01:55:57,950
Back off!

1895
01:55:58,535 --> 01:55:59,577
Hey.

1896
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:04,665
You have a foul mouth, young man.

1897
01:56:05,292 --> 01:56:06,959
- Just ignore him.
- Wait.

1898
01:56:07,252 --> 01:56:08,961
I'm the owner of this stationery store.

1899
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:10,921
You can't just go after making this mess.

1900
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:12,089
Piss off.

1901
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:13,966
What is he doing?

1902
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:16,802
I said piss off.

1903
01:56:17,178 --> 01:56:18,304
Hey!

1904
01:56:23,518 --> 01:56:27,855
Add assault of a police officer to the list!
They got it all, you motherfucker!

1905
01:56:33,695 --> 01:56:35,404
It's justified defense from now on.

1906
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:53,482
How long you think it'll take
for me to make this go away?

1907
01:57:54,275 --> 01:57:55,401
30 minutes?

1908
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:58,445
One hour tops, you fucking bastard.

1909
01:57:58,446 --> 01:57:59,613
You piece of shit!

1910
01:58:01,574 --> 01:58:04,535
It'll take 20 fucking years.

1911
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:09,456
Fucking hell...

1912
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:11,834
I'll be damned.

1913
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,631
Great job, Miss Bong.

1914
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:20,342
Why did you use your leg?
What if he got hurt?

1915
01:58:20,343 --> 01:58:21,343
Are you okay?

1916
01:58:21,845 --> 01:58:23,137
Hurts like hell.

1917
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:25,431
This little shit can fight.

1918
01:58:25,432 --> 01:58:26,682
So you're fine.

1919
01:58:27,183 --> 01:58:29,226
Have it looked at at the hospital.

1920
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:30,936
He looks very familiar.

1921
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:31,937
I'm sorry.

1922
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:32,730
Fuck you!

1923
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:35,816
No pictures.

1924
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:42,573
The first trial of Cho Tae-Oh,
Sin Jin Trading's executive,

1925
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:43,824
was held today.

1926
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:49,955
He was accompanied by Choi,
the company's SVP,

1927
01:58:50,248 --> 01:58:53,917
and logistics contractor Jeon, who have
been charged for related crimes.

1928
01:58:53,918 --> 01:58:54,668
CARGO COMPANY OFFICE

1929
01:58:54,669 --> 01:59:00,382
The incident started when Bae,
while protesting for back payment,

1930
01:59:00,383 --> 01:59:06,972
was summoned to Cho's office
and subsequently assaulted.

1931
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:52,800
COME ON, DAD!
