[Episode 15]

00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,000
Shortly after the Sixth Rank
Civil Official Tomb was raided,

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,680
Big Head

5
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,840
showed up

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,710
with

7
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,080
the four men from Hedong.

8
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,759
Unexpectedly, they raided an empty tomb.

9
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,410
So, how did Big Head

10
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,280
find the Lv Family Tomb?

11
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,100
The ceramics dug up

12
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,310
from the Sixth Rank Civil Official Tomb

13
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,280
has caused quite a stir
in the black market.

14
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,410
He must have heard something about it.

15
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,790
That's possible.

16
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,520
But

17
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,150
how did Big Head

18
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,710
know where the ceramics came from?

19
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,750
According to Shan,

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
he doesn't know Big Head, right?

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,520
Well,

22
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,190
Big Head

23
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,630
is full of mysteries.

24
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,240
What role did he play
in the tomb robbery case?

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,710
Was he the on-site commander

26
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,680
or the organizer?

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,480
If he was the on-site commander,

28
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,600
who was behind him?

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,570
We don't have

30
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,590

Don't be afraid of the trouble.

35
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,780
Alright, understood.

36
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,560
Now, what’s the status
of the stolen cultural relics?

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,590
Du, please give us an update.

38
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,680
Currently, the known stolen
cultural relics are

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,590
over sixty pieces of cultural relics from

40
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,870
Han and Tang dynasties and bronze wares.

41
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,520
There are also over
sixty ceramics.

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,360
We have already recovered

43
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,710
the relics from Han and Tang dynasties
and bronze wares.

44
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,510
The ceramics are still missing.

45
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:01,920
Good.

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,710
I'll contact the Cultural Heritage Bureau

47
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,310
to arrange for experts
to authenticate them as soon as possible.

48
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,310
I think

49
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,800
the ceramics

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,240
should still be
in Xing Zhaohu's possession.

51
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,680
With such high value,

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
and the situation

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,590
being so tense,

54

he won’t sell it anytime soon.

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,680
According to Shan's confession,

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,740
Xing Zhaohu had him

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
pick up the goods at a junkyard

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,460
and wait at a hotel.

59
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,680
I suggest

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
we should

61
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,890
turn the tables on him.

62
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,040
It's feasible.

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,910
Can I

64
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,280
pee again?

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,010
You just peed. You're going again?

66
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,920
I-I can't hold it anymore.

67
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,510

Sit down!

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,020
When I get nervous, I need to pee.

73
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,120
I really can't hold it anymore.

Hurry up, hurry up.

Hu, I've got the goods.

81
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,680
But there are only bronze wares,
no ceramics.

82
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Don't worry about the ceramics.

83
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,840

No, don't worry.

is diagonally across from it.

Let me give you some advice.

You'd better

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,390
take this batch of Song Dynasty ceramics

150
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,600
and leave Qinchuan first

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
and sell them when things cool down.

If I could take the goods out,

153
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,070
would I need to

154
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,330

I-I've figured it out.

157
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,040
You’re taking advantage of the situation.

158
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,570
Seeing that I'm in trouble,

159
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,770
you’re trying to make a quick profit.

160
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,810
You better not blame me.

161
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,220
The situation is so tense right now.

162
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,690
Do you know how much risk I'm taking

163
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,110
to even consider taking your goods?

164
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,110
After I take them,

165
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,830
I can only hold onto them for now.

166
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,110
Whether I can sell them
in the future is another story.

167
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,390
Am I getting a cheap deal
or helping you out when you're in trouble?

168
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,590
Think about it again.

169
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,450
You're sure I'll sell the goods
to you, aren't you?

170
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,390
Keep dreaming!

171
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,930
Then 200,000 is fine.

172
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,250
But you need to pay now.

173
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,190
Where would I
get so much cash all at once?

174
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,590
Then how much do you have?

175
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,650
A few thousand, maybe.

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,540
Are you trying to fool me here?

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,200
You’ve got such a big shop,

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,630
and you can't come up
with tens of thousands?

180
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,570
Give me 50,000 first.

181
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,430
Didn’t I already give you 50,000?

182
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,860
The deposit has to be at least 100,000.

183
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,030

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,320
Bring the remaining 100,000,

187
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,980
and we’ll do cash on delivery.

188
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,970
Alright, I’ll wait for your message.

189
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,440
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

190
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,370
Okay, thank you.

191
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,630
Two buns for No.38.

192
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,510
Here.

193
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,890
Coming.

194
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,240
I ordered one for you too.

195
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,670
Okay.

196
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,840
You eat first.

197
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,680
No need to be polite.

198
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,840
Enjoy your meal.

199
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,170
Okay.

200
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,030
No coriander for No. 41.

201
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,150
Have you heard about
that batch of Song Dynasty ceramics?

202
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,150
You mean

203
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,870
the batch that's been
causing a stir recently?

204
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,800
It's in my hands.

205
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,300
Can you take it all?

206
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,770
The Director wants you to go tomorrow.

207
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,630
He wants to check it out in person.

208
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,440
Alright.

209
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,020
Take your time.

210
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:17,390
[Sanfeng Village]

211
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:29,630
Guang.

212
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,920
I've checked.

213
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,780
I didn't see Xing Zhaohu.

214
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,890
That guy is very cunning.

215
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,200
He sent Shan over.

216
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,630
Get ready to pick up the goods.

217
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,820
Don't hang up the phone.

218
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,080
Put on your earphones.

219
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,170
Captain Qi.

220
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,920
Copy that. Go ahead.

221
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,280
There’s a situation.

222
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,840
All units, stay alert.

223
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,680
Once you confirm the identity,
take him down.

224
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,270
Guang.

225
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,600
There’s a situation.

226
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,520
Don't look around.

227
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,380
Get out of here.

228
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,960
He’s left.

229
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,000
Something doesn’t seem right.

230
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,050
Roger that.

231
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,349
Xing Zhaohu is a brat.

232
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,930
Brother,

233
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,440
let me handle Xing Zhaohu.

234
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,370
I got careless.

235
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,280
I didn’t expect him to be scheming.

236
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
He fooled us.

237
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,030
I can find a way to track him down.

238
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,850
But I need to act fast.

239
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,880
Brother,

240
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,370
if Xing Zhaohu takes this money

241
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,720
and runs out of Qinchuan,
it'll be hard to catch him.

242
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,000
If he cheats me out of 100,000 and runs,

243
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,070
he’ll be at a loss.

244
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
He can’t take that batch
of Song Dynasty ceramics out.

245
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,030
Guang.

246
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,060
What would you do
with those Song Dynasty ceramics?

247
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,550
I...

248
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,230
would sell them quickly.

249
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,360
Sell them for whatever price I can get.

250
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,870
Why didn't I think of that?

251
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,440
He's trying to have it both ways.

252
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,370
He wants to profit from both sides.

253
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,340
Captain Qi.

254
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,920
It's like a mouse growing a cat's eyes?

255
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,710
We’ve caught their attention.

256
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,460
It does feel a bit strange.

257
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,390
Here, have some garlic.

258
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,020
Quite a whole meal.

259
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,680
Eating noodles without garlic
is only half as flavor.

260
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,310
When you catch Xing Zhaohu,

261
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,920
you won't need to fight.

262
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,550
Just open your mouth,

263
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,790
and the bioweapon will take him down.

264
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,690
I don’t think it’s gonna work.

265
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,750
We’re all from Qinchuan.

266
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,280
What’s there to be afraid
of with some garlic?

267
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,920
Hu, where are you?

268
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,310
Don't ask about my business.

269
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,720
Have the cops been watching you?

270
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,200
No.

271
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,280
Don't worry.

272
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,920
You said

273
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,060
Xing Zhaohu is from Qinchuan?

274
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,790
He's from Shang County.

275
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,200
Are you hungry?

276
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,520
A little.

277
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,290
I’ll order you takeout.

278
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,510
Three-in-one noodle or roujiamo?

279
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,800
Three-in-one noodle.

280
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,970
Why aren’t you speaking Mandarin?

281
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,270
When two people from Shang County
made a call,

282
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,320
was there any need for Mandarin?

283
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,830
Master.

284
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,230
Xing Zhaohu might try to escape.

285
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,320
All the exits from Qinchuan,

286
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,520
block them if you can.

287
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,640
Who is it?

288
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:19,830
Hu.

289
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,830
Sheng.

290
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,520
Sheng.

291
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,510
Sheng.

292
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,310
Save me!

293
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,490
Weren't you sick of me?

294
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,690
Didn't you want to turn your life around?

295
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,850
Why are you coming back to me now?

296
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,580
Sheng, I was wrong, I was wrong.

297
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,360
The grave digging thing
got the cops onto me.

298
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,990
How could you be so careless?

299
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,110
You wanted
my Song Dynasty ceramics, didn’t you?

300
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,830
It’s all yours.

301
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,680
As long as you can get me out of here,

302
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,830
I won't ask for much money.

303
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,560
Just give me enough to survive.

304
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,110
You use people when you need them,
but discard them when you don't.

305
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,240
Now you remember me.

306
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:55,960
Hu.

307
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,880
We need to water a tree at its roots
and treat people with our hearts.

308
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,990
You hurt me.

309
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,350
I can't help you with this.

310
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
Feng, see him out.

311
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,190
Sheng, save me this once.

312
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,400
I can’t know the warmth of spring
without feeling the cold of winter.

313
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,030
I regret it so much.

314
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,870
For the sake of my loyalty to you
over the years

315
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,570
Help me out one more time.

316
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,020
If...

317
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,850
If...

318
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,850
I-If I get caught,

319
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,760
and they keep asking,

320
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,240
I won’t be able to hold up.

321
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,170
And then you’ll get dragged in too.

322
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,170
Are you threatening me?

323
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,900
I don't dare.

324
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,240
I don't dare to threaten you.

325
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,370
I-I'm just worried.

326
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,980
If I end up in jail,

327
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,340
the cops have plenty of ways.

328
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,930
If I say something wrong,

329
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,690
they might find something.

330
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,510
Sheng.

331
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,700
Take a look at this large bowl.

332
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,000
It’s the most valuable piece
in my batch of Song Dynasty ceramics.

333
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,790
Mu Jianhui couldn't take his eyes
off it back then.

334
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,920
He offered me five million right away.

335
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,030
Hu.

336
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,040
Even the best things stink
when they're tainted.

337
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,360
Sheng.

338
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,430
With all the trouble you've caused now,

339
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,310
who would dare to take your things?

340
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,720
Take it back, take it back.

341
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,270
Sheng.

342
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,880
Sheng.

343
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,920
I'm so soft-hearted.

344
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,570
I really can't bear to see
my own brother suffer.

345
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,590
Feng.

346
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,920
How much cash do we have at home?

347
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,440
About a hundred thousand or so.

348
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Let Hu take it all.

349
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,070
Sheng.

350
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,090
When this is all over,

351
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,820
I’ll come back and work for you.

352
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,300
No need for such polite words
between brothers.

353
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
What about the other things?

354
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,510
I’ve hidden everything

355
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,480
in a safe place.

356
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,920
I'll tell you once I'm out of Qinchuan.

357
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,030
You sneaky brat, you kept a backup plan.

358
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,830
Don't worry, they're all yours.

359
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,980
I can't leave with the things anyway.

360
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,310
I know

361
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,310
where your family is.

362
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,320
If you try to pull any tricks on me again,

363
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,320
I'll kill your entire family.

364
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,890
You were covering for Xing Zhaohu.

365
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,440
You must be thinking

366
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,760
that batch of ceramics
could fetch a good price.

367
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,310
Your eldest son is 23 now, isn't he?

368
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,300
He can’t afford to marry,

369
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,130
can’t afford a house and the bride price.

370
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,150
And you have a younger son

371
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,910

The whole family needs to be fed.

You do need money.

374
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,600
If that batch of ceramics

375
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,160
sells for a good price,

376
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,260

whether Xing Zhaohu’s batch of goods
can be sold.

do you think

00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,210
he'll give you any money?

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,230
Right now,

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,120
you only have one option.

the ceramics back as soon as possible.

You'll be considered as
having atoned for your crimes.

You can get a reduced sentence.

389

Otherwise,

if Xing Zhaohu escapes,

He does have a few girlfriends,

396

all the crimes will be on him.

401
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,550

Look at you, such a coward.

Why do you look so scared?

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,770
How's it going, Sheng?

560
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,910
Is everything okay with Big Head?

561
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,830
Get in the car.

562
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,780
Hello, 120.

563
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,340
Captain Qi.

564
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,360
Take a close look.

565
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,520
Are these the ones you stole?

566
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,280
Yes.

567
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,320
I think that's about

568
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,360
all of them.

569
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,320
Let me tell you,

570
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,170
if anything goes wrong,

571
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,739
the responsibility is all yours.

572
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,090
I-I'll take another look.

573
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,510
I'll check again.

574
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,320
It...

575
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,000
It seems like one’s missing.

576
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,200
Which one is missing?

577
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,380
It's a bowl.

578
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,470
The edge looks like petals,

579
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,300
with silver inlay.

580
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,780
Anything else?

581
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,930
That's all.

582
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,920
Mr. Mu.

583
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,690
You really came at the wrong time today.

584
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:38,890
Ms. Wen.

585
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,840
I have to see Mr. Zhao today,
no matter what.

586
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,770
Here’s the thing,

587
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,370
I think I should advise you.

588
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,700
This blank check you’ve written,

589
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,880
it’s too big.

590
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,870
Why don't you go back first?

591
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,510
Let's pretend nothing happened today.

592
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,160
Otherwise, if you take
one more step forward,

593
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,890
you’ll be stuck with no way out.

594
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,260
Just take me there.

595
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,140
Whether I can handle it
or not is my business.

596
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,360
Mr. Zhao.

597
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,590
Mr. Mu is here.

598
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,320
Mr. Zhao, sorry to interrupt.

599
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,130
Mr. Mu. Please, sit down.

600
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,110
Get an extra pair of chopsticks
for Mr. Mu.

601
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,480
Okay.

602
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,480
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

603
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,030
No, I haven't.

604
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,960
Come on, join me.

605
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,760
I won’t be polite then.

606
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,480
You're just in time.

607
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,810
Eat whatever you want.

608
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,050
Alright.

609
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,440
Thank you.

610
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,840
Don't touch that porridge. It's very hot.

611
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,070
Most people can't drink this.

612
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,070
I like to drink it.

613
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,960
It can easily burn your esophagus.

614
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,920
Here, take a guokui.

615
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,820
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

616
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,190
I also love to drink hot porridge.

617
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,550
We have the same taste.

618
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,120
Then, Mr. Mu, please enjoy your meal.

619
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,720
Alright, alright, alright.

620
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,850
Mr. Zhao, I'll be leaving now.

621
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,120
How is it?

622
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,670
Is it too hot?

623
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,020
It's not hot.

624
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,470
Mr. Mu.

625
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,150
You've really got a sharp tongue.

626
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,480
It’s like your mouth is carved from stone.

627
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,070
Eat if you can,

628
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,030
if you can't, then don't.

629
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,590
People should know their limits, right?

630
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,880
Look at you,

631
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,230
you seem like an educated person.

632
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,320
Guan Yu lost Jingzhou due to carelessness.

633
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
You've heard of that, right?

634
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,900
Guan Yu lost Jingzhou due to carelessness.

635
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
I don’t agree with

636
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,220
the “carelessness” part.

637
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Why?

638
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,370
I believe it was the will of heaven.

639
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,360
If it weren't for Liu Bei

640
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,980
breaking his promise

641
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,130
and not returning Jingzhou earlier,

642
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,150
then later,

643
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,460
Sun Quan and Cao Cao

644
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,120
wouldn’t have teamed up

645
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,320
to deal with Guan Yu.

646
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,840
Right.

647
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,310
You are right.

648
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,990
I've learned something.

649
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,810
You’ve probably heard about
the batch of Song Dynasty ceramics, right?

650
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,400
I wasn’t able to get it done,

651
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,640
I sincerely apologize to you.

652
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,760
But I'm not a person who breaks promises.

653
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,270
The Song Dynasty ceramics matter
isn’t over yet.

654
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,070
The police confiscated a batch,

655
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,650
but that's not all of them.

656
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,310
There’s one still out there,

657
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,270
an alms bowl from the Yaozhou kiln.

658
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,360
You’ve definitely seen
Ding kiln inlaid pieces,

659
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,350
but have you ever seen
one from Yaozhou kiln?

660
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,210
This alms bowl isn’t just inlaid,

661
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,990
it’s inlaid with silver.

662
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,470
An absolutely top-tier piece.

663
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,230
Mr. Mu.

664
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,920
I'm finished eating.

665
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,780
Take your time.

666
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,800
Mr. Zhao, this time,

667
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,770
I've put everything on the line,
giving it my all.

668
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,300
I've left myself no way out.

669
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,930
Brother.

670
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:47,880
I'll

671
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,040
give you some advice.

672
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,590
A person

673
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,110
should learn to

674
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,480
be content to avoid disgrace

675
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,600
and know when to stop to avoid danger.

676
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,800
Only then can one achieve great things.

677
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,840
I think

678
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,840
you can only achieve something
if you’re willing to take risks.

679
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,970
If I succeed, I'll bring the alms bowl.

680
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,800
If I don't,

681
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,880
you won’t see me again in Qinchuan.

682
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
What do you think?

683
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,760
You're being too serious.

684
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,220
You're being too serious.

685
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,570
You eat first.

686
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,280
Eat more.

687
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,890
Enjoy your meal.

688
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,920
Officer.

689
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,090
Have you caught

690
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,230
Xing Zhaohu?

691
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,310
What's wrong?

692
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,630
Is there anything else you're hiding?

693
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,880
Afraid your confession
won't match Xing Zhaohu's?

694
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,110
No, no, that's not it.

695
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,640
I was thinking

696
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,360
if he's been caught,

697
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,870
I could be considered to
have made a contribution, right?

698
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,570
Report.

699
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,220
Come in.

700
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,810
It's confirmed. He's from Hedong.

701
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,440
Do you

702
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,890
know him?

703
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,190
I-I don't know him.

704
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:13,960
Big Head.

705
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,660
You don't know him?

706
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,170
H-He...

707
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,030
He...

708
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,590
H-How did he die?

709
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,400
Treat others

710
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,840
with sincerity and
they’ll treat you the same.

711
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,320
I'm being

712
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,330
very sincere with you.

713
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,320
I still want to advise you,

714
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,030
don't force yourself down a dead-end path.

715
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,290
Guo Fengshan.

716
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,390
I'll ask you again.

717
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,360
What's the relationship

718
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
between Big Head

719
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,120
and Xing Zhaohu?

720
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,410
T-The black pottery figurine...

721
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,190
Back then,

722
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,550
he was with us

723
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,470
digging the looting pit.

724
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,210
What's Big Head's real name?

725
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,400
Do you know where he's from?

726
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,260
I-I don't know.

727
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,070
Then why did he stop working
with Xing Zhaohu?

728
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,530
H-He couldn't make money.

729
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,590
He was so poor.

730
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,230
So he left.

731
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,440
I had no choice.

732
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,190
We're from

733
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,860
the same hometown.

734
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,650
There's this connection.

735
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,280
And he's a tough guy.

736
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,710
So who’s he been working with these years?

737
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,840
I don't know. We haven't been in touch.

738
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,750
What's the name of your explosives guy?

739
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,280
T-The Gunner.

740
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,200
His real name.

741
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,700
I don't know.

742
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,630
Where's he from?

743
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,770
I don't know that either.

744
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,700
Do you remember what he looks like?

745
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,190
I-It was too dark.

746
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,930
I-I didn’t get a clear look.

747
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,380
How many of you were there?

748
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,650
J-Just the four of us.

749
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,720
If you don't believe me,
go ask Wang Taiping and Xing Zhaohu.

750
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,040
How did Big Head know you guys were going

751
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,440
to rob the Lv Family Tomb?

752
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,320
I-I don’t know.

753
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,930
You have to ask Xing Zhaohu about that.

754
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,230
Guang.

755
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,030
Do you remember this place?

756
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,670
I called you my brother right here.

757
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,870
I’ll never forget it.

758
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,910
If it weren't for your help back then,

759
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,460
I would have been dead long ago.

760
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,650
You gave me a second chance at life.

761
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,730
I should have repaid you properly,

762
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,360
but over the years,

763
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,330
I haven't done enough.

764
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,770
Brother, what are you talking about?

765
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,730
Haven't you been good enough to us?

766
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,630
I've been working all these years,

767
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,320
this was the first time I’ve come across

768
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,050
an organizer

769
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,980
who split the proceeds fifty-fifty
with the gravediggers.

770
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,710
You truly treat me as a brother.

771
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,540
And it’s because
I treat you like real brothers.

772
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,250
I’ve got a request.

773
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,670
Over these years,

774
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,640
we've dug quite a few graves

775
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,140
and made a lot of money.

776
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,610
It's enough for you
to spend for the rest of your lives.

777
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,360
You must be

778
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,480
trying to kick me out, aren't you?
