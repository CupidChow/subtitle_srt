00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,850
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,680
This thing.

4
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,650
In a couple of days,

5
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm going to have a bronze exhibition.

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,360
I plan to let it serve as a facade.

7
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,310
If you like it,

8
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,410
take it.

9
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,479
Mr. Zhao, this is like hiding a good bow
after the cunning rabbit is dead.

10
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,280
What're you talking about?

11
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,170
You can't make
a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

12
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,680
This is a fake.

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,190
After it's been displayed in the museum,

14
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,030
I plan to send it to the recycling center.

15
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,370
What? Am I wrong?

16
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,280
No, you're right.

17
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,810
Absolutely right.

18
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,310
Undeserving of its position,
it will surely bring trouble.

19
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,970
Just like your Mingde Museum,

20
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,360
such a fine property.

21
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,430
A fake item standing here

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,690
is quite an eyesore.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,050
Speaking of this property,

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,290
from every brick and tile
to every blade of grass,

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,940
it's all crafted with unique ingenuity.

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Carved beams, painted rafters,
and high-pitched eaves.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,310
Open any door,

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,090
and you'll find a century of elegance.

29
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,710
It's a pity.

30
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,800
The things remain but the people are gone,

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,030
never to return as they were.

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,630
Sir, stop at the alley ahead.

33
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,540
Alright, no problem.

34
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,470
Captain Qi, it's been so long.

35
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,670
They should have arrived by now, right?

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,560
Mr. Jiang.

37
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,610
Make another call.

38
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,720
Yes, call again.

39
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,610
Okay.

40
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,920
Sorry.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,529
The subsriber you
have dialed is powered off.

42
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,120
We've been exposed.

43
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,060
This... this can't be blamed on me.

44
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,320
I didn't say anything.

45
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,210
Let's go.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,480
Yongfu.

47
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,190
Xiao Guoqiang

48
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,260
is spooked.

49
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,680
You...

50
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,870
Xiao Guoqiang disappeared from the hotel.

51
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,800
Find out his whereabouts.

52
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,920
Let's meet up at the hotel.

53
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,230
The gains this time are quite substantial.

54
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,280
It's not bad.

55
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,920
I'm still quite satisfied.

56
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,850
Ms. Wen.

57
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,040
Mr. Meng,

58
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,630
Captain Yang, this is

59
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,510
Mr. Meng, who acquired
the gilt bronze candlestick

60
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,560
at this auction.
He's the collector from Beijing.

61
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,090
Mr. Meng.

62
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,200
This is the head of
our Qinchuan Relics Inspection Team,

63
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,460
Captain Yang Qingshi.

64
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,490
You're Mr. Meng, right?

65
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,140
Nice to meet you.

66
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,630
Nice to meet you.

67
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,480
Here's the case.

68
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,560
This gilt bronze candlestick you acquired

69
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,930
is now involved in

70
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,159
a case we're currently investigating.

71
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,040
According to relevant regulations,

72
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,390
this auction

73
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,000
needs to be treated as cancelled and void.

74
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,830
Case?

75
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,159
Yes.

76
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,000
What case?

77
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,540
Well.

78
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,920
Didn't the auction house promise

79
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,240
that we're dealing
with legally inherited relics?

80
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,430
How come suddenly...

81
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,800
It's become evidence in a case?

82
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Don't worry.

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,630
I apologize.

84
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,070
I can't disclose to you

85
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,840
the specifics of this case.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,210
But my colleague

87
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,920
will provide you with the relevant documents
from the cultural relics department.

88
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,320
Hello?

89
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,400
Mr. Zhao,

90
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,950
something's happened
to the bronze candlesticks.

91
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,120
The police are investigating.

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,320
Xiao is also missing.

93
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,460
How did Xiao disappear?

94
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,060
Where did that guy run off to?

95
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,920
Don't bother.

96
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,450
You won't find him.

97
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,720
You reported Xiao?

98
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,560
What a pity for this pair
of gilt bronze candlesticks.

99
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
Is this what you meant by dusting off

100
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,800
and starting over?

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,159
No.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,130
That would be letting you off too easy.

103
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,630
You ruined my men.

104
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,270
If we were to let
this matter slide so easily,

105
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,810
would I still be considered a man?

106
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,830
Mr. Mu,

107
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,050
you're an educated man.

108
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,190
You should know

109
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,310
the saying
"The benevolent cannot command troops,

110
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,040
and the righteous
cannot manage wealth," right?

111
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,000
You messed with
the big tomb in Yin Village behind my back.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,630
What's wrong with me
teaching your men a lesson?

113
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,760
What's the problem?

114
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,800
You can find anyone on the street now

115
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,270
and ask them,

116
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,720
who hasn't been disciplined by their boss?

117
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,190
You're going to fight me

118
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,850
over those few gravediggers?

119
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,190
Don't you worry
about jeopardizing your livelihood?

120
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,680
First,

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,510
you didn't just
mess with the gravediggers.

122
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,770
They were my brothers,

123
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,370
brothers as close as my own limbs.

124
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,120
Second,

125
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,740
you're not my boss.

126
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,390
The days of risking

127
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,950
my life doing your dirty work

128
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,480
are gone forever.

129
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,490
I'm standing here,

130
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,880
still trying to reason with you patiently.

131
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,190
You know in my heart

132
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,310
I still value you highly.

133
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,770
Don't refuse a toast
only to drink a forfeit.

134
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,560
You value me?

135
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
Just how much do you value me?

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,260
We both know the truth.

137
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,950
Since ancient times,

138
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,920
brothers turning against each other

139
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,050
has always been about money and women.

140
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,830
All this time,

141
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,620
how have I treated you?

142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,460
You should be clear in your heart.

143
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,169
Without me,

144
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,230
you'd still be scraping
by in the South Market.

145
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,200
Zhao,

146
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,120
you're really confused.

147
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,840
You still think

148
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,770
I'm turning against you
for a bigger piece of the pie?

149
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,669
You're wrong.

150
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,550
Completely wrong.

151
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,330
You've lived here for so long,

152
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,960
yet you haven't figured out
the truth about this residence?

153
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,630
This Mu residence,

154
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,200
what does it have to do with you?

155
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,490
Mr. Mu,

156
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,390
you've been hiding
quite a lot, haven't you?

157
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,390
It's not that I've been hiding a lot.

158
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,440
With your wealth and power,

159
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,130
surrounded by followers,

160
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,670
how could you notice
an idle pawn like me, a cold stove?

161
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,160
How could I catch your eye?

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,320
In your words,

163
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,110
I'm not worthy of attention.

164
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,780
You think I'm like this fake chime bell,

165
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,030
coming at your call
and leaving at your dismissal,

166
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,290
to be kicked aside when no longer needed?

167
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,350
You're wrong.

168
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,480
You are the one who is

169
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,280
a fake chime bell, beautiful
on the outside but rotten on the inside.

170
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,000
My Mu family's century of glory,

171
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,720
our literary heritage,

172
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,410
all ruined in a moment,

173
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,730
allowing an illiterate
like you to take advantage.

174
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,210
You're a cuckoo in the magpie's nest.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,330
Fine.

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,600
Since we've come this far
with our words today,

177
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,600
let's see

178
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,860
who really has the upper hand.

179
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,920
Alright then.

180
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,360
Times have changed.

181
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,280
It's time for you to move on.

182
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm kindly giving you a heads up.

183
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,790
This big show has just begun.

184
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,410
Just watch and see.

[Mingde Museum]

186
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,640
Captain Yang, Captain Qi.

187
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,150
How's it going?

188
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,750
We observed that

189
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,550
after Xiao Guoqiang left the hotel,

190
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,870
he directly took a taxi and left.

191
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,000
Where did he get off?

192
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,440
We asked the taxi driver.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,030
He was originally heading
to Jinyang Auction House,

194
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,800
but he got off at Baita Road.

195
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,350
Why did he suddenly get off?

196
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,240
We don't know.

197
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,900
Oh, right.

198
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,890
The driver said he received a call midway,

199
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,080
but couldn't hear clearly what was said.

200
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,550
We also investigated Baita Road.

201
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,480
After he got off,

202
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,390
he went straight to this urban village.

203
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,550
The final place he stopped

204
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,080
was at the entrance of Sanyuan Village.

205
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
That place

206
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,080
has a complex road situation.

207
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,720
The alleys are all crisscrossed,

208
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,000
and there are no surveillance cameras.

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,390
So we lost track of him.

210
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,990
Du and Jia, stay here.

211
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,030
Let's check his room.

212
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,230
Lifeng, you stay too.

213
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:02,930
Okay.

214
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,680
-Okay. Thank you.
-Please come in.

215
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
The suitcase is here.

216
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,120
It doesn't look like he intended to leave.

217
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,440
He must have received a phone call.

218
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,840
Right.

219
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,320
It seems the problem
arose from that phone call.

220
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,780
Have you traced the phone?

221
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,150
We can't trace it.
It was registered with a fake ID.

222
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,720
So Xiao Guoqiang lives
in hotels year-round?

223
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,440
We asked the hotel staff.

224
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,120
They said

225
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,320
this room is indeed a long-term rental.

226
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,390
He occasionally goes out for a few days,

227
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,480
but not very frequently.

228
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,010
About ten times a year or so.

229
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,360
We also checked his immigration records.

230
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
He does indeed frequently
fly to Hong Kong.

231
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,910
Long-term hotel room again,

232
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,510
frequent trips to Hong Kong.

233
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,490
I think this Xiao Guoqiang

234
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,060
really looks like an antiquities smuggler.

235
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,030
Open that suitcase.

236
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,070
Nothing much.

237
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,750
Just some spare clothes.

238
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,360
Access card.

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,960
Go with Du and Jia

240
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,510
to check Chengxi Garden

241
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,750
for any residence of Xiao Guoqiang.

242
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,870
Yes, I'll go right away.

243
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,200
Okay.

244
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,770
Reset it.

245
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
I'll do it, I'll do it.

246
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,280
Brother,

247
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,640
I've told you everything I know.

248
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
Please let me go.

249
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,680
Brother.

250
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,910
Brother.

251
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,080
Brother.

252
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,790
Say.

253
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,240
Speak!

254
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,770
Brother.

255
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm just a messenger running errands.

256
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,920
It has nothing to do with me.

257
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,370
Because of you,

258
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,440
my brother still can't get out of bed.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,700
You're still just a messenger?

260
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,390
Brother!

261
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,600
Brother.

262
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,560
It really has nothing to do with me.

263
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,390
Brother.

264
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,360
Remember what happened today.

265
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,020
Captain Qi.

266
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,000
Captain Qi, Captain Yang.

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,910
Did you carry him all the way up here?

268
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,240
Yes.

269
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,830
How are you? Feeling any better?

270
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,080
Be careful.

271
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,870
Okay, okay.

272
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,390
Here.

273
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,600
With Luo Qing as your remedy,

274
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,790
you'll be an Olympic champion in no time.

275
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,450
Captain Qi.

276
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,670
He's getting impatient.

277
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,720
Slow down.

278
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,730
Take it slow.

279
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,810
Come on, be careful.

280
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,300
Slowly.

281
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,380
Come, come.

282
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,350
This is it.

283
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,150
A pair.

284
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,240
Look at these two candlesticks.

285
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
There's a leaf missing right here.

286
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,730
It matches perfectly with

287
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,120
the gilt lotus leaf we found

288
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,330
at the theft scene.

289
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,570
These two candlesticks

290
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,700
are basically confirmed
to be the stolen artifacts from Yin Village.

291
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,360
What about the other artifacts?

292
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,080
There's no news about
the other artifacts yet.

293
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,000
These two candlesticks were already

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,320
listed in a local auction.

295
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,120
We urgently called it off.

296
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,230
The customs declaration provided
by the auction house

297
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,350
shows they came from Hong Kong.

298
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,340
In other words,

299
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,040
the stolen artifacts from Yin Village

300
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,570
have likely been smuggled
out of the country.

301
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,180
Out of the country?

302
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,630
Captain Qi once said

303
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,270
it's very difficult to retrieve
them once they're out of the country.

304
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,600
We'll retrieve them even if
they're at the ends of the earth.

305
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,000
Right.

306
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,280
Captain Qi, Captain Yang,

307
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,000
if there's anything
our archaeological team can help with,

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,030
we're at your service.

309
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,390
Yes.

310
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,510
The difficult part of artifact
cases is authentication, right?

311
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,440
Here's the case.

312
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,600
If you can do it,

313
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,040
take the lead for us,

314
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,470
and form a think tank.

315
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,160
Can we do that?

316
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,380
Then I'll contact Director Zhang.

317
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,510
Let's forget about Director Zhang.

318
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,570
It's hard for him to
give an accurate conclusion.

319
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,200
Go to Hou.

320
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,800
I've already talked to him.

321
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,680
When did you contact him?

322
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,160
Do I need to report
to you when I contact a man?

323
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,170
You must be feeling better.

324
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,790
What's wrong, Yongfu?

325
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,450
Captain Qi,

326
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,310
we've checked the Chengxi Garden.

327
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,480
Xiao Guoqiang did rent an apartment there.

328
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,609
I'll be right there.

329
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,530
Holy cow!

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
My goodness, so many bronze artifacts!

331
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,130
Captain Yang.

332
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,960
Are we in the right place?

333
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,080
What's going on here?

334
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,550
I think this is

335
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,260
where Xiao Guoqiang hid his loot.

336
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,070
So many items,

337
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,720
he could open a museum with all this.

338
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,380
Well, well.

339
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,830
If all these artifacts are genuine,

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
then this Xiao Guoqiang
must be a major Relics Dealer.

341
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,310
Officer,

342
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,890
I swear I knew nothing about this.

343
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,920
I haven't been inside

344
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,850
this house since I rented it to him.

345
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,790
If I had known he was
doing illegal things here,

346
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,850
I would never have rented it
to him, even if it killed me.

347
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,350
Don't be so quick to plead innocence.

348
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,740
I...

349
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,650
We'll get to the bottom of this.

350
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,590
Xiao Guoqiang is suspected
of trafficking smuggled artifacts.

351
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,350
We've been investigating him for a while.

352
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,510
If all these items are genuine,

353
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,690
they are involved in the case.

354
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,950
We need to seize them.

355
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,350
Come back with me
to process the seizure paperwork.

356
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,360
This place needs to be sealed off.

357
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,070
Alright, alright.

358
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,600
Let's go.

359
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,790
This bowl looks very familiar to me.

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,860
Celadon glaze,

361
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,510
silver rim,

362
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,060
petal-like rim.

363
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,160
Lv Family Tomb.

364
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,640
Isn't this exactly like
the stolen artifact

365
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,510
Shan described?

366
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,570
Isn't this the one?

367
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,200
Quick, let's find Shan to confirm.

368
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,880
It's too late.

369
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That guy got
a terminal illness two years ago.

370
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,720
He's gone.

371
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,200
Go to Hou Yuelai.

372
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,680
See if they have any way

373
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,460
to determine the origin
of these artifacts.

374
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,640
How about it, Mr. Hou?

375
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,400
Are these items from the Lv Family Tomb?

376
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,370
It's hard to say.

377
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,030
Why have you caught
Director Zhang's habit?

378
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,350
This matter can't be taken lightly.

379
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,210
I don't dare to speak carelessly.

380
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,070
However,

381
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,640
what I can be more certain about is

382
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,590
this alms bowl

383
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,350
and the ceramics
unearthed from the Lv Family Tomb

384
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,150
both belong to Yaozhou ceramic.

385
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,480
As for whether they're from the same tomb,

386
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,810
technically, there's
no way to verify that.

387
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,270
Mr. Hou,

388
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,350
just tell us if these artifacts

389
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,480
are genuine or fake.

390
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,370
Don't say anymore.

391
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,270
I know the answer.

392
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,070
Look, I'm the expert here.

393
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,410
It's hard to say.

394
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,350
Captain Qi, stop joking around.

395
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,200
Artifact authentication

396
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,310
requires rigorous examination.

397
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,160
We really need to

398
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,110
go back and verify carefully.

399
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,640
Alright, alright, carefully.

400
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
But also quickly.

401
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,440
Please, both of you,
give us an answer as soon as possible.

402
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,400
The current case

403
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,830
is at a critical point
and can't be delayed.

404
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,490
Okay, don't worry about that.

405
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,310
Fang Kun has already told us

406
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,350
to provide you with technical support.

407
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,950
Here's the case, Captain Qi.

408
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,110
Once there's any news,

409
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,750
I'll notify you immediately.

410
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,480
Is that okay?

411
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,590
Yes.

412
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,370
Let's go back, Jun.

413
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,510
Wait a minute.

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,590
Captain Qi,

415
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,720
Captain Yang,

416
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,030
This Heavenly King statue

417
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,490
looked familiar to me
as soon as I entered.

418
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,760
Are you sure?

419
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,110
I remember now.

420
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,400
Mingde Museum

421
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,350
also has one.

422
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,550
It's their star exhibit.

423
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,200
I took my kid to see it.

424
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,640
Are they identical?

425
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,640
Very similar.

426
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,000
As far as I know,

427
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,880
these Heavenly King statues
were buried in pairs.

428
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,720
Yes, yes.

429
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,720
Could it be that

430
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,350
one is in the Mingde Museum

431
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,000
and the other
is in Xiao Guoqiang's possession?

432
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,350
Dacang, let's not hesitate.

433
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,280
Let's go directly
to the Mingde Museum to take a look.

434
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,920
Mr. Hou.

435
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,360
Could you authenticate
this Heavenly King statue for us again?

436
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,640
Give us a conclusion

437
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,150
as quickly as possible, please.

438
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,540
Director Zhao.

439
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,200
You...

440
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,260
The two cultural relic experts
are here. Come, take a look.

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,240
Sorry to trouble you again.

442
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,790
Please, have a seat.

443
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,200
Alright, alright.

444
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,030
Please, sit down.

445
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,830
Pour some tea.

446
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,420
Go pour some tea.

447
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,070
No need to be so polite, really.

448
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,870
No need for tea, we're here to...

449
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,960
Asking you to

450
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,880
confirm something.

451
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,200
Look.

452
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,290
Do you recognize this?

453
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,350
Are you trying to trick me?

454
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,960
How could I not recognize
the figurine from my own museum?

455
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,160
This isn't yours.

456
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,310
How is this not mine?

457
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,400
It is indeed.

458
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,380
Yuhe.

459
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Come, take a look.

460
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,410
See if this is from our museum.

461
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,870
This is clearly identical
to the one in our museum.

462
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,670
That's right.

463
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,140
So what?

464
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,640
Someone has even
imitated my Heavenly King figurine?

465
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,640
We can't rule out that possibility.

466
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,170
Director Zhao,

467
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,060
there's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

468
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,600
That Heavenly King figurine
in your museum...

469
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,030
I'd like to borrow it.

470
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,990
To use as a reference for our case.

471
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,570
How should we handle it,
how to protect it?

472
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,550
What procedures should we
follow? We'll stick to the rules.

473
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,960
I promise to return it intact.

474
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
What do you think?

475
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,540
That's no problem.

476
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,160
Yuhe,

477
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,030
get a car and send this figurine over.

478
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,370
Alright, Mr. Zhao.

479
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,960
-Thank you, Director Zhao.
-You’re welcome.

480
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,400
You...

481
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,720
I'd like to ask...

482
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,140
This case you're working on recently...

483
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,880
Is it about counterfeiting?

484
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,340
Or some other kind of case?

485
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,240
Well...

486
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,830
At present...

487
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,060
It's not convenient to disclose.

488
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,630
I understand.

489
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,670
Look, it's like this.

490
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,750
Why don't I just
bring the figurine over myself?

491
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,550
I'll bring the figurine to you.

492
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,550
Let me see

493
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,550
what the fake looks like.

494
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,010
This is one.

495
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,670
Secondly,

496
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,860
I do know a thing
or two about cultural relics.

497
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,580
Maybe I can be of some help.

498
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,590
That would be great.

499
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,270
That works.

500
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,730
Then we'll trouble you to come along.

501
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,070
It's no trouble at all. Let's go.

502
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,790
At first glance,
they really do look identical.

503
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,790
This seized item...

504
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,020
After our rigorous authentication,

505
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,610
it has been confirmed as a Tang Dynasty
tri-colored Heavenly King figurine.

506
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,190
Then...

507
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,920
So mine is a fake?

508
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,350
Director Zhao,

509
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,610
these Heavenly King figurines
were originally buried in pairs.

510
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,740
But they couldn't be exactly the same.

511
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,710
So between these two...

512
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,310
One of them must be a replica.

513
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,980
Then... then what should we do?

514
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,080
We should examine
them more carefully, right?

515
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,210
To be rigorous...

516
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,400
We need to go through
the authentication process.

517
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,450
Is that okay?

518
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,030
Alright, no problem.

519
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,640
Yuhe.

520
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,960
Fully cooperate them.

521
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,160
Let the expert thoroughly
authenticate this for us.

522
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,510
Okay.

523
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,450
Then I'll...

524
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,590
Follow the requirements.

525
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,310
Take it wherever they need it to be.

526
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,840
Alright.

527
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,440
This...

528
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,080
How could this situation have happened?

529
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,050
If this turns out to be a fake,

530
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,490
how am I going
to explain this to the board?

531
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm quite well-known
in our circles, after all.

532
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,440
Don't worry.

533
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,950
Director Zhao, let me ask you first.

534
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,790
How did you acquire
that Heavenly King figurine?

535
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,050
I bought it, of course.

536
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,680
I specifically bought it from

537
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,010
an auction in Hong Kong.

538
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,840
Which auction house in Hong Kong?

539
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:10,970
Hong...

540
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
That Hong Kong...

541
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,290
That...

542
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,070
It's, it's a...

543
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,070
The auction house has an English name.

544
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,200
I don't remember it.

545
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,960
But it doesn't matter.

546
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,880
After all the cultural relics
were brought back,

547
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,810
they all have identity documents.

548
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,430
We have everything you might need.

549
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,390
They have a complete set.

550
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,350
If you need them,
I can provide them to you.

551
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,480
Great, great, good.

552
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,260
That works.

553
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,450
It's like this.

554
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,590
The overseas cultural relics
market is a mixed bag.

555
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,010
Even if you're very experienced,

556
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,770
you can still make mistakes.

557
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,190
I feel that this time,
Director Zhao, you've been...

558
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,790
Set up by someone.

559
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,750
The main thing is that this time I...

560
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,200
I'm really embarrassed.

561
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,660
Look at this situation...

[Qinchuan Relics Inspection Team]
[Qinchuan Cultural Heritage Bureau]

563
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,330
Thank you for your trouble, Director Zhao.

564
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,880
-Making you come all this way again.
-Don't mention it.

565
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,790
Thank you.

566
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,030
It's all my duty.

567
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,310
If you need anything,
just let me know anytime.

568
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,590
I'll be there whenever you call.

569
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:01,920
Okay.

570
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,880
You can go back now, go back.

571
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,130
Director Zhao.

572
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,070
Do you know Xiao Guoqiang?

573
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,000
Who?

574
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,790
Xiao Guoqiang.

575
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,000
Do you know Xiao Guoqiang?

576
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,920
Xiao Guoqiang.

577
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,370
We don't know him.

578
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,040
What's this about?

579
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,270
What does Xiao Guoqiang
have to do with us?

580
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,070
It's nothing.

581
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,720
Thank you for your trouble.

582
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,400
It's fine, it's fine.

583
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,240
Thank you for your
hard work, Director Zhao.

584
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,440
Thank you, thank you.

585
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,040
I'm at your service anytime.

586
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,480
Just let me know if you need anything.

587
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,270
Alright, alright, goodbye.

588
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:32,870
Take care.

589
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,640
Goodbye, goodbye.

590
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,840
Take care, take care.

591
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,460
Do me a favor, Captain Yang.

592
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,110
Don't worry,
Ding Yan is already investigating.

593
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,350
I haven't said anything yet.

594
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,950
What's being investigated?

595
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,430
I can read you like a book.

596
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,090
You want me to check the Mingde Museum’s

597
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,890
registered inventory of cultural relics

598
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
and see if any of the artifacts

599
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,170
match Xiao Guoqiang’s, right?

600
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,900
That Heavenly King figurine
isn't an isolated case.

601
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,700
I think so too.

602
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,080
What a mess this has become.

603
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,610
I guess I've invited a wolf into the fold.

604
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,030
Mr. Zhao,

605
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,310
I just

606
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,400
took a quick look
in their artifact storage room.

607
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,260
Several pieces
are identical to ones in our museum.

608
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,720
That Xiao is quite bold.

609
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,440
This guy, right under my nose,

610
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,440
dares to pull a switcheroo.

611
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,480
How about

612
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,140
I send more people to look for Xiao?

613
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,080
It's too late.

614
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,310
That guy must have fled already.

615
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,010
What should we do then?

616
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,590
I've heard news
from the media recently saying

617
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,930
that our museum
has a large number of counterfeits.

618
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,960
They also say
there's a black market chain behind us.

619
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,270
I think these rumors

620
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,420
must have been leaked by someone.

621
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,270
Could it be...

622
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,270
Could it be what?

623
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,120
What are you thinking?

624
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,360
It must be Mu Jianhui.

625
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,110
Who else could it be?

626
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,350
That guy has been plotting

627
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,480
to harm others since he was in the womb.

628
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,110
Why don't we take care of that Mu guy?

629
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,830
No.

630
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,310
Right now,

631
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,850
we need to clean up our own mess first.

632
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,070
That Mu Jianhui

633
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,140
is full of teeth in his belly.

634
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,540
That guy is out for blood.

635
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,790
You know, I have
dealt with artifacts all my life.

636
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,120
Being deceived happens from time to time.

637
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,220
But when it comes to dealing with people,

638
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,480
I've never

639
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,530
taken a fall before.

640
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,030
This time, I've really
been knocked down hard.

641
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,560
You know?

642
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,680
With all these artifacts I've handled,

643
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,720
I can't even tell which ones are real

644
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,520
and which ones are fake anymore.

645
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm telling you, this Mingde Museum,

646
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
its reputation is ruined this time.

647
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,270
Mr. Mu.

648
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,590
Zhao.

649
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,720
Has this play been quite intense?

650
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,030
Intense, indeed.

651
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,410
You're ruthless in your actions.

652
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,030
Every grievance has its source,
every debt has its debtor.

653
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,000
You can't pin this on me.

654
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,960
Others might not know,

655
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,020
but I'm well aware.

656
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,200
You had Xiao

657
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,880
buy many fakes,

658
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,010
and then pass off many fakes to others.

659
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,240
I don't need to spell it out, do I?

660
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,310
Those who raise venomous creatures
will eventually be bitten.

661
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,970
This pit, you dug it yourself.

662
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,730
You can't blame others.

663
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,880
Hou Yuelai just called me.

664
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,440
All the cultural relics
seized from Xiao Guoqiang

665
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,980
have all been authenticated as genuine.

666
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,680
Really?

667
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,080
Has Xiao Guoqiang responded yet?

668
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,790
Not yet,

669
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,660
but we've issued
a joint investigation notice.

670
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,810
That's strange.

671
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,750
Our operation
was supposed to be confidential,

672
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,550
and the auction house

673
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,680
has been under strict surveillance.

674
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,640
Who could have tipped off Xiao Guoqiang?

675
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,090
It must be related to the informant.

676
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,750
We can't rule out that possibility,

677
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,040
but we've lost all leads on the informant.

678
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,440
We have no way to investigate further.

679
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,790
Since Xiao Guoqiang

680
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,070
surfaced with
the stolen artifacts from Yin Village,

681
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,280
let's focus on Yin Village.

682
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,830
Look,

683
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,960
Liang's gang

684
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,380
was hired by

685
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,160
King Hua

686
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,400
to rob tombs in Yin Village.

687
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,840
The goods were stolen en route.

688
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,030
Who stole them?

689
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,030
I think

690
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,750
Uncle's gang

691
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,000
is highly likely to be
the ones who stole the goods.

692
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,690
It's possible that
Uncle's gang stole the goods

693
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,750
and then sold them to Xiao Guoqiang.

694
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,950
If you put it that way,

695
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,270
there's one thing I now understand.

696
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,140
Alms bowl.

697
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,590
Yes.

698
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,350
Alms bowl?

699
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,910
What about the alms bowl?

700
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,260
That alms bowl,

701
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,350
if it's from the Lv Family Tomb,

702
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,150
how did it end up
in Xiao Guoqiang's house?

703
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,920
We speculated before

704
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,310
that the alms bowl
was most likely in Liu Shusheng's house.

705
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,720
There's only one possibility.

706
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,350
You mean

707
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
Mu Jianhui sold it to Xiao Guoqiang?

708
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,550
Then the relationship
between Mu Jianhui and Xiao Guoqiang

709
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,440
is clear now.

710
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,510
So,

711
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,860
is there any connection between
Xiao Guoqiang and the Mingde Museum,

712
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,880
or rather, with

713
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,240
Zhao Youlin?

714
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,270
How else can we explain

715
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,440
that the fakes in the Mingde Museum

716
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,750
and the genuine articles
in Xiao Guoqiang's house

717
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,920
are identical?

718
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:52,750
Right.

719
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,080
Ding Yan,

720
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,830
the question you raised is crucial.

721
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,920
Let's boldly speculate

722
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,750
about the relationship
between Zhao Youlin and Xiao Guoqiang.

723
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,070
A buyer-seller relationship.

724
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,070
This is the most direct connection.

725
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,800
If Xiao Guoqiang is a smuggler,

726
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,510
could it be that

727
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,030
Zhao Youlin bought stolen goods from him

728
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,040
but ended up being deceived

729
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,150
and bought fakes?

730
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,250
This possibility is the most likely.

731
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Let's talk about this Uncle's gang.

732
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,000
For a gang

733
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,210
to control such a large area as Qinchuan,

734
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,550
it's not just

735
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,880
a simple group of rabble.

736
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,770
I heard they can control prices,

737
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,630
can negotiate prices down.

738
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,670
What does this indicate?

739
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,960
It indicates they've
already mastered the channels

740
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,670
for selling stolen goods, even smuggling.

741
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,199
Exactly.

742
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,510
We're all veterans
in the cultural relics field.

743
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,110
We know the characteristics
of this industry.

744
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,280
To put it bluntly, these tomb raiders

745
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,910
are at the bottom of the criminal chain.

746
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,310
But once they've mastered

747
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,620
the channels for selling
stolen goods and smuggling,

748
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,710
they could be
at the top of the criminal chain.

749
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,150
It's infuriating.

750
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,320
We've been going
back and forth with Mu Jianhui

751
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,670
so many times.

752
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,630
Now he's getting more and more arrogant,

753
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,280
and we can't do anything about him.

754
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,080
What can we do?

755
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,880
I know everyone's angry,

756
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,630
but

757
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,480
no matter how much anger we hold,
it won't light a single cigarette.

758
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,360
It's useless.

759
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,040
Now it's better.

760
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,920
Liang,

761
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,070
Mu Jianhui, Zhao Youlin,

762
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,800
right?

763
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,280
Gunner,

764
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,600
Liu Shusheng...

765
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,510
More and more people are surfacing.

766
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,150
This is good.

767
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,970
We'll continue

768
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,070
to track upwards

769
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,700
the reselling,

770
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,440
fencing, and smuggling.

771
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,100
Downwards,

772
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,720
we'll crack down
on tomb raiding and theft.

773
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,960
We must form a comprehensive,

774
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,390
full-coverage, sustained crackdown.

775
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,670
Continue tracking

776
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,760
King Hua and Xiao.

777
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,880
For other criminal suspects,

778
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,510
continue operations without evidence.

779
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,170
We must dig deep
and investigate thoroughly

780
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
the behind-the-scenes financier.

781
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,030
Kun, sit tight.

782
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,000
The road ahead is impassable.

783
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,200
I need to turn around.

784
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,590
Why?

785
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,710
There was heavy rain in Chenjiapo.

786
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,240
It has washed out a big hole.

787
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,520
We can't get through.

788
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,960
We can only turn back.

789
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,070
Stop for a moment.

790
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,320
What's wrong?

791
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,800
Stop.

792
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,690
What's the matter?

793
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,230
What did you just say?

794
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,550
I said...

795
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,630
The road is very difficult
to pass. We can't get through.

796
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,430
What's wrong?

797
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,360
The... the sentence before that.

798
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,030
The water washed out a big hole.

799
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,720
Water washed...

800
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,280
"Washed out a big hole" means...

801
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,440
"Eroded a big hole?"

802
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,140
That's right.

803
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,800
It's a dialect expression.

804
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,130
What?

805
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,420
What's the matter?

806
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,840
The author of that document, Luo Tianxiang

807
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,030
is from the Yuan Dynasty.

808
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,630
The Yuan Dynasty
was six or seven hundred years ago.

809
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,440
There hasn't been
a significant population migration.

810
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,000
So...

811
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,960
The language, especially the dialect...

812
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,480
...hasn't changed much.

813
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,160
Therefore...

814
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,310
"Washed out stone slabs"...

815
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,840
...means...

816
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,280
...eroded stone slabs.

817
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,170
That's correct.

818
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,100
Yes, that's exactly what it means.

819
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,360
You can just talk, you know.

820
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,620
Why are you hitting me?

821
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,120
What's the matter?

822
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,960
Today...

823
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,160
...was worth it.

824
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,770
It was worth it. Are we going or not?

825
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,370
Let's go.

826
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,240
Let's go.

827
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,120
Kun.

828
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,710
We've been all around
Phoenix Mountain these past few days.

829
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,070
Now we've come to Chenjiapo.

830
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,360
-Uncle Shoucun.
-If we still can't find it,
then it really doesn't exist.

831
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,220
Uncle Shoucun.

832
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,070
This stone slab is related to...

833
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,670
...where exactly
the Zi Mausoleum is located.

834
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,110
I heard that the second phase
of the landfill project

835
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,030
is really going to be built.

836
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,550
That's right.

837
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,550
Chief, tell us about it, please.

838
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,810
You guys, stop asking.

839
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,700
Just tell me a little bit about it.

840
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,150
I haven't heard anything.

841
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,750
Our chief's lips are sealed.

842
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,650
It seems this landfill
is even bigger than the previous one.

843
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,280
I heard the investment
is over 100 million.

844
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,800
This project is right
on the edge of our village.

845
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,280
Whoever's land it takes

846
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,320
will strike it rich, won't they?

847
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,960
Chief, you've got
to give us some inside information.

848
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,020
Alright, alright.

849
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,760
Stop making mountains out of molehills.

850
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,290
Crooked ways are not
the right path to wealth.

851
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,240
Just focus on planting
the cherry trees properly.

852
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,840
That's the real task at hand.

853
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,220
Alright, alright. Go.

854
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,150
Chen Laosi.

855
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,440
Chen Laosi.

856
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,590
Go, go.

857
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,590
Mr. Fang.

858
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,240
Shoucun.

859
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,750
What brings you here?

860
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,510
Oh, Mr. Fang,

861
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,780
how have you been feeling lately?

862
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,400
I'm much better.

863
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,760
Good.

864
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,760
That's good.

865
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,250
Your situation,

866
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,000
everyone in the surrounding
villages has heard about it.

867
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,600
Well done.

868
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,170
I can't help much with anything else,

869
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,580
but if your archaeological team
wants to eat cherries,

870
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,780
just come to my place.

871
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,810
There's plenty.

872
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,450
We don't need to go to you for cherries.

873
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,670
The cherries for the archaeological team,

874
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,000
we folks from Yin Village have it covered.

875
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,920
By the way,

876
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,440
what are you here for?

877
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,320
I'm looking for something.

878
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,650
Looking for something?

879
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,230
What are you looking for?

880
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,150
Stone slabs.

881
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,710
Have you seen any?

882
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,970
They're asking me.

883
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,280
Why are you answering?

884
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,550
Stone slabs, have you seen any?

885
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,280
Stone slabs?

886
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,280
What kind of stone slabs?

887
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,000
He, he can't explain it clearly.

888
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,800
It's written in an ancient book.

889
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,480
It says an old man
from the Yuan Dynasty wrote a book.

890
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,110
It's basically

891
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,320
like a travel magazine now.

892
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,330
It's about things in our Qinchuan area.

893
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,120
It says that one year,

894
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,280
the Zishui River flooded,

895
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,080
and washed open
the gates of the Zi Mausoleum.

896
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,630
Over 500 stone slabs were washed out.

897
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,940
Those are the stone slabs I'm looking for.

898
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,650
Am I right?

899
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,400
The stone slabs you mentioned, I think...

900
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,800
I might have seen them when I was young.

901
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,590
They were on the plateau
in my maternal grandfather's village.

902
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,920
Where exactly?

903
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,760
Northeast of the Dou Mausoleum,

904
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,000
east of the Bailu Plain.

905
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,000
The area you mentioned
is too vague, isn't it?

906
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,960
Can you be more specific?

907
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,820
Where exactly?

908
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,110
Well, I'm free anyway.

909
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,680
I'll take you there.

910
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,010
This place used to be very nice.

911
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,400
Once the villagers left,
no one took care of it.

912
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,460
Look how quickly it became desolate.

913
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,440
Take it slow.

914
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,150
This place goes up and down.

915
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,840
The slope is quite steep.

916
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,700
Take your time.

917
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,550
Slow down, slow down.

918
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,280
Don't rush.

919
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,150
Okay.

920
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:15,880
Can you manage?

921
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,760
If you can't, I'll carry you on my back.

922
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,440
I can manage.

923
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,880
Can you do it?

924
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,400
How is it?

925
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,000
It's fine.

926
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,960
Slow down.

927
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,310
Right, right, right.

928
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,440
Look.

929
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,000
Look at you,
why are you trying to show off?

930
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,800
This kid.

931
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,150
How am I going to explain it to Qing?

932
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,030
Come on.

933
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,160
Let me carry you.

934
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,190
Let me carry you on my back, let's go.

935
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,630
Is it okay to leave Heizui there alone?

936
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,320
It's fine, let it watch the tricycle.

937
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,650
Well,

938
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,610
well,

939
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,590
that tricycle isn't locked.

940
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,050
It's great that
it's watching it over there.

941
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,920
Slow down.

942
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,710
It's okay.

943
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,440
Be careful.

944
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,760
No problem.

945
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,860
Let's go, this way.

946
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,590
This path is not
easy to walk. Look at this road.

947
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,190
It's fine.

948
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,840
We're here.

949
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,710
The locals call
this place Stone Slab Valley.

950
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,810
-Hurry.
-Take it slow.

951
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,400
Here.

952
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,540
Give him a hand. That's right.

953
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,500
Be careful.

954
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,770
Let me carry it for you.

955
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,480
Is this it?

956
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
The stone slabs
you're looking for must be these ones.

957
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,110
In this place,

958
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,680
there are many stone slabs.

959
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,480
Could it be here?
