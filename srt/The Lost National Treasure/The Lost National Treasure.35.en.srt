179

went to the northeast with some bad guys

190
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,240
to work in the mines.

191
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,360
One day, for some reason,

192
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,840
a bad guy stepped on his glasses.

193
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,480
When mixing the explosives,
he made a mistake.

194
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,030
And then…

195
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,200
You know, when I first saw Mu Jianhui,

196
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,440
I thought my eyes
were playing tricks on me.

197
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,050
I thought my brother
had come back to life.

198
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,420
Your eyes were
playing tricks on you indeed.

199
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,000
Just because he looks similar,
you treat him like a real brother?

200
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,550
All these years,

201
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,790
you've been following me around,

202
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,840
freeloading off me,

203
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,550
always calling me Sheng.

204
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,130
What do you take me for?

205
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,400
You?

206
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,820
You don't deserve a thing.

207
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,380
You're just an ungrateful wretch.

208
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,920
Mu Jianhui treated me
no worse than a real brother.

209
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,160
So it doesn't matter whose child it is.

210
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,770
What did you really come here for today?

211
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,320
I...

212
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,490
I came here for two things.

213
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,870
First,

214
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,320
to stand up for my wife.

215
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,750
Second,

216
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,910
to clean up my brother's mess.

217
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,030
Shusheng!

218
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,330
The police are here!

219
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,360
So beautiful.

220
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,120
This shelf

221
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,040
will one day hold our empire.

222
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,690
Let's go.

223
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,800
Let's go back for dinner.

224
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,410
Xiuheng.

225
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,150
Uncle.

226
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,750
-What are you doing here?
-You're back.

227
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,290
Why don't you go inside?

228
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,960
I'm waiting for Lai.

229
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,680
He said he'd be back today,
but I haven't seen him.

230
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,740
Coming back today?

231
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,790
He's been working away
from home for the past few years.

232
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,520
It took a lot of convincing
to get him to come back.

233
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,880
But still no sign of him.

234
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,940
You all go in first.

235
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,280
Dinner's ready.

236
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,400
The dumplings are ready.

237
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,000
Alright.

238
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,610
Okay.

239
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,930
Go ahead.

240
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,970
Xiuheng,

241
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,140
let's go

242
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,910
back home.

243
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,000
Dad.

244
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,780
I'm back.

245
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,320
Xiuheng.

246
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,680
Dad.

247
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,110
You've grown taller.

248
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,770
I've missed you so much. What's this?

249
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,810
Take it.

250
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,800
What's this?

251
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,560
Let's go.

252
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Let's go back for dinner.

253
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,510
Your mom has prepared the dumplings.

254
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,840
Okay.

255
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,160
Mom.

256
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,360
Xiaoman.

257
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,390
-I'm back.
-You're back, son.

258
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,240
You've...

259
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,080
gotten darker,

260
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,010
and thinner too.

261
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,680
Mom,

262
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,330
this is the 30,000 yuan
I've earned over the past two years.

263
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,160
I'm handing it all over to you.

264
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,590
This...

265
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:57,920
Right.

266
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,950
I will save it for you.

267
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,330
Okay.

268
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:00,840
Okay.

269
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,380
Alright.

270
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,640
I'm back.

271
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,310
I...

272
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,480
I've made you...

273
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,320
lamb and beef dumplings.

274
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,800
Great.

275
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,400
All your favorites.

276
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,200
I'll eat a lot.

277
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,240
Now that you're back, don't leave again.

278
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,610
Okay.

279
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Have you all got wine?

280
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,680
Yes.

281
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,720
Come on.

282
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,180
Come on.

283
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
Let's...

284
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,800
Drink.

285
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,480
Okay.

286
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,810
-Come on.
-Welcome.

287
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,510
Come on.

288
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,370
You guys drink.

289
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,110
Alright.

290
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,790
Cheers.

291
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,750
Welcome back.

292
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,790
Welcome home.

293
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,200
Thank you so much.

294
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,070
Eat more.

295
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,970
Okay.

296
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,930
Eat quickly.

297
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,680
It's getting cold.
I've been preparing it for a while.

298
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,610
Here, take this.

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,530
How is it?

300
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,210
Good.

301
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,960
Here. Come on.

302
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,620
I have some.

303
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,500
Eat yours quickly.

304
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,160
Dad,

305
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,650
let's have a drink.

306
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,740
Lai wants to have a drink with you.

307
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,640
You don't know, Lai.

308
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,510
When we came back today,

309
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,550
we saw Uncle and Xiuheng

310
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,080
waiting for you at the door.

311
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,790
It felt like they could

312
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,320
see right through the wall.

313
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,480
Let's have another toast.

314
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Let's eat. No more drinking.

315
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,110
Exactly.

316
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,940
Come on.

317
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,750
Alright.

318
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,480
You just got back and she cares for you.

319
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,810
Okay, no more drinking.

320
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,310
Alright.

321
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,690
Luo Qing,

322
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,240
today Mr. Lu and I

323
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,680
searched along the north side again.

324
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,590
We did find some rammed earth walls,

325
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,590
but the problem is

326
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,400
they don't connect.

327
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,280
No worries, let's eat first.

328
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,480
Alright.

329
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
There's still time, no rush.

330
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,670
Father,

331
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,960
when you're free,

332
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,790
tell those people in
the cultural relics protection team

333
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,550
to pay attention during their patrols.

334
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,880
If they see any rammed earth walls,

335
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,270
let me know, and I'll go check.

336
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,550
Eat.

337
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,250
Alright.

338
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,370
How about I tell everyone in the village?

339
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,480
That would be great.

340
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,080
What does the wall look like?

341
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,330
I have a picture.

342
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,240
Look.

343
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,400
There are round depressions on it.

344
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,360
Just remember,

345
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,680
it looks like the stone pancakes we eat.

346
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,400
It does look similar.

347
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,060
Doesn't it?

348
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,850
Is this vegetarian?

349
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,510
Celery.

350
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,790
Why does this wall look so familiar to me?

351
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,400
I've seen this wall
at Xingwang's brick kiln.

352
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:27,720
Who?

353
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,840
Xingwang.

354
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,200
Is there someone
named Xingwang in our village?

355
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,110
Not in our village.

356
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,170
It's in Chenjiapo.

357
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,850
Chang You's cousin.

358
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,680
I once went to his house
to play mahjong with Chang You.

359
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,960
When I went to pee by the wall,

360
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,420
I saw it.

361
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,030
I thought at the time that this wall

362
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,350
was built very strangely.

363
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,680
Are... are you sure?

364
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,640
I'm sure.

365
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,880
-There's a circle here.
-Look carefully.

366
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,740
It's this wall.

367
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,550
Okay, let's eat first.

368
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,030
After we finish eating, if you're free,

369
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,490
could you take us to see it?

370
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:52,840
Sure.

371
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,530
Let's eat first. Hurry.

372
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,880
You've been talking.

373
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
Master, you eat more.

374
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,170
You won't be able to see this wall.

375
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,680
Why?

376
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,020
The electrical wires at my house,

377
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,210
and your tires,

378
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,420
Xingwang did all that.

379
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,570
Why?

380
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,640
We haven't interfered
with Chenjiapo's affairs.

381
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,900
Why would they do that?

382
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,720
The landfill issue

383
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,110
is related to him.

384
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,180
Your archaeological team

385
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,410
has blocked his source of income.

386
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:37,150
♪ Mournful cries
of the birds keep coming ♪

387
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:53,340
♪ It seems to complain about injustice ♪

388
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:12,340
♪ Who tore you apart? ♪

389
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:31,720
♪ It seems that I share
the same misfortune as you ♪

390
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,830
You idiot,

391
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,240
why didn't you call me?

392
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,960
I know what you're up to
as soon as you make a move.

393
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,920
If you act on your own like this again,

394
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,380
see how I'll deal with you.

395
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,570
So what do we do now?

396
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,360
Let's make it quick.

397
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,600
Take a look and leave.

398
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,980
This is the brick kiln.

399
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,090
Go in from there,

400
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,270
then go around to the back.

401
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,000
There's a patch of weeds there.

402
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,170
It's inside there.

403
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,070
You stay here and keep watch.

404
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,730
We'll go in.

405
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,830
Guard the place.

406
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,160
Okay.

407
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,730
Let's go.

408
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,710
Come quickly.

409
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,680
-Can't we get out?
-Who's there?

410
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,740
It must be thieves.

411
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,830
Come here.

412
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,030
Don't let him escape!

413
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,960
Lai, what are you doing here?

414
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,000
I was looking for you.

415
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,830
Looking for me? For what?

416
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,480
You brought the archaeological
team to steal from me?

417
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,010
What archaeological team?

418
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,030
-Why bring so many people to play cards?
-They must be in the brick kiln.

419
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,160
Come on, move aside!

420
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,880
You keep searching here.

421
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,940
I'll go block them.

422
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,220
Talking nonsense.

423
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm going with her.

424
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,270
I'll beat you up.

425
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,480
What's going on?

426
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
Why bring so many people?

427
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,610
Chen Xingwang!

428
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,930
Chen Xingwang!

429
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,300
You're Chen Xingwang, right?

430
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm the leader of
the Hanling archaeological team.

431
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,980
My name is Luo Qing.

432
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,640
Our team has experienced
many strange incidents recently.

433
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,070
I heard you know the inside story.

434
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,720
Since you're here...

435
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,400
Father, something's wrong.

436
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,930
I'd like to ask you about it.

437
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,590
You wicked woman,

438
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,850
now you're trying to shifting the blame?

439
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,400
Do you need to climb walls
to ask about things?

440
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,610
Let me tell you,

441
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,790
people in our village

442
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,000
saw you sneaking into my brick kiln.

443
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,960
Do you know what this is called?

444
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,560
This is called trespassing!

445
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,160
Let's go! Take your people

446
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,680
to the police station!

447
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,210
Let's go!

448
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,920
What are you doing?

449
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
Let's go!

450
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,500
Don't move!

451
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,230
I'm standing right here today.

452
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,240
Let's see who dares to step over me!

453
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,070
Fellow villagers of Chenjiapo,

454
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,350
do you know who contracted

455
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,030
this landfill project?

456
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,800
Never heard of it.

457
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,560
Who do you think contracted it?

458
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,110
It's someone who doesn't want our team

459
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,400
to ruin their project and their profits,

460
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,730
trying to drive us away.

461
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,600
Xingwang,

462
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,240
so you're trying to

463
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,740
turn our village into a landfill?

464
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,400
Well, Uncle Zhaolin,

465
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,070
I still call you Uncle.

466
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,920
How could you side with outsiders?

467
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,460
What's wrong?

468
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,720
You're turning against us, aren't you?

469
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,590
If you come to me
for anything in the future,

470
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,830
I won't help you anymore!

471
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,690
I'm calling the police right now!

472
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,880
For what?

473
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,080
Calling the police to arrest yourself?

474
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,110
Xingwang,

475
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,870
your Uncle Qi has already told me

476
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
about your misdeeds in Yin Village.

477
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,150
Don't forget,

478
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,970
your last name's Chen too.

479
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,750
If you want to go to the police station,
that's fine,

480
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,880
but let's first have a talk
at the Chen's ancestral hall.

481
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:25,830
Kun.

482
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:26,790
Kun.

483
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,000
Rammed earth.

484
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,800
Rammed earth.

485
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,270
Look.

486
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,440
Is it?

487
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,010
Mr. Fang,

488
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,300
there's some here too.

489
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,270
It's connected.

490
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,830
To the ancestors of the Chen family,

491
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,160
I, Chen Sisheng, have kowtowed
and confessed my guilt here today!

492
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,290
Chenjiapo Village

493
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,400
is about to be ruined under my leadership!

494
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,670
How can we blame you for this?

495
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,700
If there's blame,

496
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,290
it's on Chen Xingwang.

497
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,300
Chen Xingwang!

498
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,380
You're using us as your pawns.

499
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,640
You built that landfill

500
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,560
on top of our ancestors.

501
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,720
This is not only
disrespectful to our ancestors,

502
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,570
but also makes us,
who are still alive, feel suffocated.

503
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,350
You know that?

504
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,960
Exactly!

505
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,670
Disrespectful to our ancestors.

506
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,130
Chen Xingwang,

507
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,350
don't forget,

508
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,460
you're also from Chenjiapo Village.

509
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,760
Your parents

510
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,420
are still rooted here.

511
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,440
Once you make money from the project,

512
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,370
you can move away

513
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,180
and buy a house in the city,

514
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,590
but you're letting your parents

515
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,110
and all

516
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,550
our fellow villagers

517
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,320
living on a garbage dump.

518
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,680
Can you be at peace with that?

519
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,270
That's right!

520
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,030
Exactly!

521
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,440
Alright, everyone.

522
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,750
Fellow villagers

523
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,680
from Chenjiapo,

524
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,560
Sisheng,

525
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,640
our archaeological team
has also made some mistakes.

526
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,680
We shouldn't have

527
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,560
climbed over Xingwang's wall.

528
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Xingwang,

529
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,360
I'm sorry about that.

530
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,110
It's alright.

531
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,190
We've all made mistakes.

532
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,010
The landfill project

533
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,790
isn't something

534
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,520
Xingwang can decide on his own.

535
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,110
Our archaeological team

536
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,110
is now racing against this project.

537
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,790
As long as we can win this race,

538
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,110
I can guarantee to everyone

539
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,240
that this landfill

540
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,070
will definitely not be built here.

541
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,680
Captain Luo, how can we win this race?

542
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,070
If there's anything we can do to help,

543
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,200
we promise to spare no efforts.

544
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,720
Thank you, Sisheng.

545
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,560
Actually, it's no big deal.

546
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,650
We just need Xingwang

547
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,340
to lend us the brick factory
for a couple of days.

548
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,240
Say something.

549
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,960
Say it!

550
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,720
Is that okay?

551
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,450
Is that okay?

552
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,720
Okay.

553
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,970
Speak up!

554
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,440
I already said okay.

555
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,640
Okay! I said okay!

556
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,000
That's more like it.

557
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,730
Captain Luo.

558
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,410
Captain Luo.

559
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,210
Make way.

560
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,730
Captain Luo,

561
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,540
we found it.

562
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,970
This is what we found at the scene.

563
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,280
Please identify it.

564
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,810
It's my brother's.

565
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,820
How is my sister-in-law doing now?

566
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,400
Her condition isn't
very good at the moment.

567
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,930
But don't worry,

568
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,370
we've been trying to contact her family.

569
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,370
It exploded.

570
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,210
It exploded.

571
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,920
Everything's gone.

572
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,150
Everything's gone.

573
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,950
Everything's been blown up.

574
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,360
Xiaofeng.

575
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,240
Shulan,

576
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,800
you're here to pick me up.

577
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,150
It exploded.

578
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,320
Ghost!

579
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,050
Mu Jianhui is a ghost.

580
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,820
You're a ghost too.

581
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,650
You're all ghosts.

582
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:35,910
Xiaofeng,

583
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,370
don't be afraid.

584
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,550
Good acting.

585
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,830
Good acting.

586
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,770
You act even better than Mu Jianhui.

587
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,540
Let me tell you,

588
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,830
Shusheng

589
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,670
was killed in the explosion.

590
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,910
It's all Mu Jianhui's fault,

591
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,480
Liu Shulan's fault.

592
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,400
How come they're still alive?

593
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,910
You know, this Liu Shulan,

594
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,270
she should've been the one to die!

595
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:13,790
Right?

596
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,760
Mu Jianhui should have
been killed by Liu Shulan!

597
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,310
Liu Shulan,

598
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,310
he... he's your own brother.

599
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,590
I'm here.

600
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,400
Big Head is dead.

601
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,180
Xing Zhaohu is dead.

602
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,920
Li Yuanguang is also dead.

603
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,070
Anyone involved with Mu Jianhui is dead.

604
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,480
Liu Shulan,

605
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,830
it's all your fault!

606
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,670
You hypocritical, vicious woman.

607
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,080
You're the root of all evil!

608
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,140
You're the source of trouble!

609
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,660
Shusheng.

610
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,880
My poor Shusheng.

611
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,080
The application to extend

612
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,800
Mu Jianhui's detention

613
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,460
has been rejected.

614
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,990
Why was it rejected?

615
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,910
For major case suspects,

616
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,880
the detention approval can

617
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,440
be extended by up to 30 days.

618
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,550
Mu Jianhui has already had two extensions.

619
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,510
He's been in custody for over 30 days now.

620
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,440
Don't throw all these regulations at me!

621
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,570
I'm telling you, Mu Jianhui's guilty!

622
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,640
If he's guilty, why release him?

623
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,670
Guilty?

624
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,230
How do we convict him?

625
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,880
Right now, we only have Yan Xiaowu's

626
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,070
and King Hua's testimonies,
which are single-source.

627
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,960
How do we convict him with that?

628
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,230
What about He Xiaofeng's testimony?

629
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,400
He Xiaofeng is mentally unstable.

630
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,860
Her testimony is invalid.

631
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,110
Li Yuanguang and Liu Shusheng
are both dead.

632
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,700
So this case can't proceed anymore, huh?

633
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,840
I don't care!

634
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,030
Mu Jianhui is guilty!

635
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,910
He's guilty!

636
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,450
I have to convict him, no matter what!

637
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,720
I think your efforts haven't been in vain.

638
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,590
Yes.

639
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,040
The criminals have woven a net,

640
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,070
but your net is even bigger.

641
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,370
It's the dark before the dawn.

642
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,670
Don't rush.

643
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,840
Justice will come eventually.

644
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,920
I think your net will soon close in.

645
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,830
[Qinchuan City Detention Center]

646
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,210
Sir, which cake would you like?

647
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,460
I'll take this one.

648
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,000
We can write on the cake.

649
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
What would you like written?

650
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,950
Just write "Happy Birthday, Liangliang."

651
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,480
Alright.

652
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,250
This way.

653
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,670
Let's eat.

654
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,760
I can't eat.

655
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,150
I know you feel bad.

656
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,090
I feel the same way.

657
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,950
I've had fallouts with Shusheng before,

658
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,210
and we've reconciled.

659
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,080
No matter how bad things get,

660
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,890
we're still family in the end.

661
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,040
We'll take care of Xiaofeng.

662
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,510
Let Shusheng rest in peace.

663
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,710
Try to think positively.

664
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,330
He hasn't suffered
or been wronged all these years.

665
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,320
He was quite a figure after all.

666
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,720
Kind of a blessed person.

667
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,910
But we still have to
struggle in this world.

668
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,500
He's gone ahead
to enjoy blessings in paradise.

669
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,430
What did he enjoy?

670
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,920
Wearing gold every day,

671
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,330
eating great food and drinking fine wine.

672
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,760
And in the end?

673
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,810
Not even leaving a complete body.

674
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,320
Don't dwell on it anymore.

675
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,980
Let's just focus on living our own lives.

676
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Today is the baby's first birthday.

677
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,480
Let's celebrate it.

678
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,270
Can you be honest with me now?

679
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,330
Whose child is it really?

680
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,130
Is it Wen Wen and Li Yuanguang's?

681
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,020
About this matter,

682
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,480
I did keep it from you.

683
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,610
The child's father

684
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,550
is not Guang.

685
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,880
It's me.

686
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,870
When you were living in the mountains,

687
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,360
Shusheng drugged me and Wen Wen,

688
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,450
and this mistake was made.

689
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,850
The adults were wrong,

690
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,310
but the child is innocent.

691
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,980
From now on, the baby will live with us.

692
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,570
Who is it? It's so late.

693
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,610
Who's there?

694
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:09,610
It's me.

695
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,800
You go inside first.

696
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,890
Where's the baby?

697
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,560
Give me back my baby.

698
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,460
Wen Wen,

699
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,110
this baby is mine too.

700
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,150
What did you promise me back then?

701
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,740
No matter whose baby it is,

702
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,000
once it's born,

703
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,670
it's Yuanguang's and mine.
