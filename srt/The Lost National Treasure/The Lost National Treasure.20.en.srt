00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,810
[Episode 20]

3
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,700
Wen Wen.

4
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,680
Mu.

5
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,810
Where's your sister-in-law?

6
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,550
Give it to me.

7
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,960
Okay.

8
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,329
Wen Wen,

9
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,310
plug in the electric heater
I just brought.

10
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,660
I don't want it.

11
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,880
Take it away.

12
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,080
Shulan,

13
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,910
the mountain is full of negative energy.

14
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,280
It's not good for your health.

15
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,079
Let's go home.

16
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,020
No matter how heavy
the negative energy is here,

17
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,310
it's not as heavy
as the negative energy surrounding you.

18
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,470
The cold will aggravate your rheumatism.

19
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,800
You can be angry with me,

20
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,010
but don't mistreat your own body.

21
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,930
No amount of suffering
can atone for my sins.

22
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,560
It won't bring my child back.

23
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,390
The sin is mine alone.

24
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,280
If anyone should suffer, it should be me.

25
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,079
Rest assured,

26
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,880
from now on, I'll bear the burden alone.

27
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,450
I won't touch any dirty stuff ever again.

28
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,480
Shusheng won't touch it either.

29
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,160
Alright then.

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,190
So stay here,

31
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,040
and copy scriptures
with me to atone for our sins.

32
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,480
Brother, it's not worth it
for such a small matter.

33
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,880
Here's the stuff for you.

34
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,670
When the big river runs dry,
the small river dries up.

35
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,470
Uncle will be the big river
of Qinchuan from now on.

36
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,930
Where did you get so much money?

37
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,320
I saved it up.

38
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,370
Who is Luo Qing?

39
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,270
She's a cultural relic expert
from the provincial institute.

40
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll pick up.

41
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,410
Captain Qi,

42
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,720
Ms. Luo Qing,

43
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,210
what's the matter?

44
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,480
That empty tomb has been excavated.

45
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
There's another tomb underneath.

46
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,430
That's great!

47
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,800
Why are you so jumpy?

48
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,620
It's nothing. I'll be right there.

49
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,980
You're coming with me to the site.

50
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,020
What about picking up the kid?

51
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,190
Call Mom.

52
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,750
You must go.

53
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,050
Let me tell you,

54
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,500
I'll show you what I do every day.

55
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,680
Director Zhang.

56
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,830
Captain Qi.

57
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,270
Professor Xiang, you're here too.

58
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,600
-Yes, I'm here. Captain Qi.
-You're here.

59
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,660
And who is this?

60
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm his wife.

61
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,250
How is it?

62
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,810
I heard there's another tomb underneath.

63
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,280
Come, come, have a seat.
Let's talk about it.

64
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,230
Please, sit down.

65
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,160
Yes, they're still digging below.

66
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,760
Any new discoveries?

67
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,160
Nothing yet.

68
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,720
We're waiting for news.

69
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,360
There's hope.

70
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,560
Good.

71
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,600
You...

72
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,260
Captain Qi.

73
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,750
Ms. Luo Qing, how is it?

74
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,840
It's still an empty tomb.

75
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,600
-Empty?
-What?

76
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
There are no burial objects below,

77
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,390
no funerary objects,
coffins, or skeletal remains.

78
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,480
There's nothing at all.

79
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,539
It's the same as the first empty tomb.

80
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
The tomb owner must have been crazy.

81
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,080
Why dig two deep empty tombs?

82
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,390
I have a bold guess.

83
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,720
No one would go to such lengths

84
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
to design

85
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,030
two such deep empty tombs for no reason.

86
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,600
There's only one possibility.

87
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,860
It's to prevent theft.

88
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,410
So I think the real burial chamber

89
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,270
should be at an even deeper level.

90
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
A third layer?

91
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,870
Someone with such intricate planning,

92
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,210
according to the Lv family genealogy,

93
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
there can only be one person.

94
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,920
Our ancestor, Lv Dalin.

95
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,200
Director Zhang,

96
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,790
what do you think?

97
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,720
It's hard to say.

98
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,120
It's not impossible.

99
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,480
We still need facts and evidence
to speak for themselves.

100
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,870
Just keep digging.

101
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,820
You'll have evidence once you dig.

102
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,270
Always saying "it's hard to say," come on.

103
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,910
If we dig further,
we'll hit the Liaojiang stone layer.

104
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,440
What's the Liaojiang stone layer?

105
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,150
It's a type of grayish-white rock.

106
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,350
It's extremely hard.

107
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,910
Yes,

108
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,400
when local people dig wells,

109
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,850
if they encounter this kind of stone,

110
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,380
they can't dig any further.

111
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Even if it's hard, we still have to dig.

112
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,370
What's the big deal?

113
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,020
Captain Qi.

114
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,320
We're different from you.

115
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
You handle cases,

116
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,670
taking one step forward
with two legs following closely behind.

117
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,670
for us, whether we can take that step

118
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,750
depends on passing three checkpoints.

119
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,300
Don't be in a hurry.

120
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,750
We'll let you know
once we've finished our research.

121
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,870
It's not that I'm impatient,

122
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,470
it's that the case is urgent.

123
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,720
Just dig!

124
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,120
You can pass
six checkpoints for all I care.

125
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,550
Aren't you going to
dig anyway after all that research?

126
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,550
Shut up, will you?

127
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,000
You're so indecisive.

128
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,960
Fine, I'll wait, I'll wait.

129
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,560
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,320
What are you doing all day long?

131
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,150
Ms. Luo.

132
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,200
Ms. Luo.

133
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,550
There's a major discovery in pit M1.

134
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,120
Your leg

135
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,410
doesn't seem to
be getting any better here.

136
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,480
If you ask me,

137
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
we should go back down the mountain.

138
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,340
Your phone is ringing.

139
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,400
Don't worry about it.

140
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,480
Hello?

141
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,040
I understand.

142
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,010
I'll come down right away.

143
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,440
Sir,

144
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,470
how about a fortune telling?

145
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,790
You don't even know

146
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,600
where your next meal is coming from,

147
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
yet you're telling fortunes for others?

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,930
My next meal is right here with you.

149
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,890
I see that your brows are radiant,

150
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,200
your forehead is full and moist,

151
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,360
surely a sign of
great fortune in your future.

152
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,630
However, there's a slight unfavorable
aura around your eyes,

153
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,080
spreading to your forehead,

154
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,610
which might affect
your children's fortune.

155
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,790
So, do you see

156
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,040
any offspring in my future?

157
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,480
Yes,

158
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,030
within a year.

159
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,060
That's enough.

160
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,860
You're having a hard time too.

161
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,280
You got one thing right though.

162
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,480
Your next meal is indeed with me.

163
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,840
Go eat.

164
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,140
Look at this.

165
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,670
His name was Daya, courtesy name Zhengzhi,

166
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
the youngest son of the Lord.

167
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,510
This indicates that
the occupant of tomb M1

168
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,320
is Lv Daya.

169
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,870
The Lord?

170
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,470
It refers to his father, Lv Ying.

171
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,910
There's another passage here.

172
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,910
Look at this part.

173
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,440
Tong had two sons, the eldest named Ying,

174
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,450
who held the position of
Assistant Director of the Palace Library,

175
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,030
and was posthumously awarded
the title of Senior Court Gentleman.

176
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,290
So this tomb's occupant is Lv Ying's son,

177
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,440
and Lv Ying

178
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,830
is also the eldest son of Lv Tong.

179
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Lv Daya's second son

180
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,610
was adopted by one of his cousins.

181
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Can you guess who?

182
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,320
Could it be our founding father, Lv Dalin?

183
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,550
That's right, it's Lv Dalin.

184
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,630
Because Lv Dalin
had no children of his own,

185
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,870
so the child was adopted by him.

186
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,120
There's another interesting point.

187
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,320
Come and look at this.

188
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,700
Here, let me take over.

189
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,960
Take a look at this tomb epitaph cover.

190
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,690
See if you notice
anything different on the back.

191
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,640
There are words on it.

192
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,320
It says "Epitaph of Lord Zhang,
Former Prefect

193
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,790
of Dingzhou
of the Great Tang, Upper Pillar of State."

194
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,960
You're right. This tomb cover

195
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,360
was repurposed.

196
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,120
It originally belonged to

197
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,030
a Tang Dynasty governor surnamed Zhang.

198
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,600
So during the Song Dynasty,

199
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
this tomb cover was already an antique.

200
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,630
And in the Lv family,

201
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,690
wasn't Lv Dalin the one
who loved collecting antiques?

202
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,890
Think about it.

203
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,360
Lv Dalin's stepson was Lv Daya's son.

204
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,100
And Lv Dalin loved collecting antiques.

205
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,150
This tomb cover

206
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,000
was likely one of Lv Dalin's collections

207
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,660
that was eventually
used for Lv Daya's funeral.

208
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,720
M2 and M1 are so close to each other.

209
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,270
The more we talk about it,

210
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,670
the more it seems
that M2 is Lv Dalin's tomb.

211
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,890
The excavation of M1

212
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,390
has to some extent helped

213
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,390
confirm the identity of M2's occupant.

214
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,440
Now we believe

215
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,910
that M2 is very likely
to be Lv Dalin's tomb.

216
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,840
This is a newly discovered tomb cover

217
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,790
that has been repurposed.

218
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,800
It has inscriptions on both sides.

219
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,870
The front side is inscribed with "Tomb of
Mr. Lv, Retired Officer of Song Dynasty,"

220
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,800
which refers to the occupant of M1.

221
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,120
The back side reads
"Epitaph of Lord Zhang,
Former Prefect

222
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,440
of Dingzhou
of the Great Tang, Upper Pillar of State."

223
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,300
The exact identity is uncertain.

224
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,290
Chief Wang,

225
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,270
if we dig deeper,

226
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
we'll encounter the Liaojiang stone layer.

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,360
If we're too gentle,
we can't dig through it.

228
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,690
If we're too forceful, it might collapse.

229
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
From what we know now,

230
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,390
both the first and second tomb layers

231
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,990
have a lot of collapsed soil.

232
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,670
If the third layer is a real tomb

233
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,000
and hasn't been looted,

234
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,240
it could easily collapse,

235
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
which would cause

236
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,840
irreversible damage.

237
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,500
Your concerns are valid.

238
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,420
The Lv Family Tomb
is now attracting a lot of attention.

239
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,450
If it's really Lv Dalin's tomb,

240
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,440
then millions of eyes will be watching.

241
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,770
I suggest

242
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,790
we proceed with caution
in further excavating M2.

243
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,680
We should first develop
a plan before considering excavation.

244
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,390
We need to base our work on

245
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,320
legal, standardized,
and technological criteria.

246
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,960
We must ensure everything is foolproof.

247
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,480
We will come up with

248
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,330
the safest excavation
plan as soon as possible.

249
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,150
Mr. Mu,

250
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,040
you're impressive.

251
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,840
You have a keen eye.

252
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,490
You've acquired so many
good items in such a short time.

253
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,870
Your ability to take action is remarkable.

254
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,270
Mr. Zhao, you flatter me.

255
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,130
I owe it all to your support.

256
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,160
It's all thanks to your care.

257
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,530
I've just been riding on your coattails.

258
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,270
What coattails of mine are you riding on?

259
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,910
Speaking of it,

260
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,150
recently,

261
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,880
I've indeed heard some things.

262
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,060
They say in Qinchuan city,

263
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,750
there's someone called Uncle

264
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,360
who's been making quite a stir.

265
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,880
Some things have reached my ears.

266
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,240
Mr. Mu,

267
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,880
in life,

268
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,109
one should

269
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,030
keep a low profile.

270
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,300
A tall tree catches the wind.

271
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,900
Is that so?

272
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,030
Right.

273
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,359
You are right.

274
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,280
Mr. Zhao.

275
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,240
They're here.

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,400
Oh?

277
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,290
I'll head back first then.

278
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,480
Let's go together.

279
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,310
Alright.

280
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,240
Let's go.

281
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,010
Okay.

282
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,280
Here's the case.

283
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,880
Yuhe.

284
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,240
Please see Mr. Mu out.

285
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,490
Alright.

286
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,960
You go ahead with your business.

287
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,620
Okay, okay.

288
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,900
Welcome back anytime.

289
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,560
This way.

290
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,300
Qin.

291
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,070
I heard there are two decent goods.

292
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,870
That's great.

293
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,680
Let's go inside.

294
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,160
Have a seat inside.

295
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,960
What?

296
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,790
What's the rush?

297
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,650
You must be deaf. Get out of my way.

298
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,010
What?

299
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,030
Sheng.

300
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,050
It's me.

301
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,200
Shuan.

302
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,480
Shuan.

303
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,060
How long has it been since we last met?

304
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,240
You've gained weight.

305
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,640
I have.

306
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,670
Looks like life's been treating you well.

307
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:42,990
Sheng.

308
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,830
Is this your construction site?

309
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,880
You see, it's really...

310
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,350
Talk about a lucky coincidence.

311
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,480
What a coincidence.

312
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,050
How did you end up here?

313
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,790
I'm stuck in the office all day.

314
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm bored to death.

315
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,440
Shuan.

316
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,040
Let me ask you something.

317
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,110
There must be something
underneath here, right?

318
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,910
If there is...

319
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
Just dig it up openly.

320
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,750
This is my territory.

321
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,810
I'll cover for you.

322
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,610
Let's be clear about this upfront.

323
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,230
The stuff is under my land.

324
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,070
An organizer

325
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,200
should be me, right?

326
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,060
I quit that business long ago.

327
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:22,830
You quit?

328
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,490
Yes, I quit.

329
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,220
I'm just a laborer now.

330
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,830
Although it's still digging...

331
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,310
The nature of the work
is completely different.

332
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,570
Working here for a year

333
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,640
doesn't compare to a single day
of what we used to do.

334
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,440
You're not telling me the truth.

335
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,320
Sheng, this is your construction site.

336
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,830
You must know
if there's anything underneath.

337
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,720
Don't you?

338
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,770
There really isn't anything down there?

339
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:50,960
Sheng.

340
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,350
You must be making a fortune now that
you've switched to building houses.

341
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,310
And building houses is profitable.

342
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,840
The money comes in quickly.

343
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,160
Quick? This is hard-earned money.

344
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,060
What about you?
Why did you change your line of work?

345
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,930
Sheng.

346
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,070
It's not that
I didn't want to do it anymore.

347
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,530
I just couldn't continue.

348
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,750
A group of people

349
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,270
showed up out of nowhere.

350
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,790
They are very powerful.

351
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,340
Any site they set their eyes on...

352
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,750
Any goods they fancied...

353
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,150
They'd just snatch it up.

354
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,960
They don't just rob goods,

355
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,020
they also buy them.

356
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,330
The key is they're pushing
the prices ridiculously low.

357
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,370
No one in all of Qinchuan dares
to offer higher prices than them now.

358
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,820
In the end, there's no choice.

359
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,020
We can only sell to them at a cheap price.

360
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,800
I've only been out
of the game for a few days,

361
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,030
and our industry's atmosphere has
already deteriorated to this point.

362
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,480
Who is it?

363
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,960
So formidable.

364
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,690
So powerful.

365
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,570
I think it's called something like...

366
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,880
Some Uncle...

367
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,160
Li.

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,130
Li something Guang.

369
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,550
Uncle?

370
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,780
Close the door.

371
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,450
Have a seat.

372
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,530
What do you want from me?

373
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,030
What is it?

374
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,160
You're always stirring up trouble
out there with an outsider,

375
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,270
making a fortune, aren't you?

376
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,400
You've shoved me off
to that construction company.

377
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,730
What are you getting at?

378
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,400
What do you mean by that?

379
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,200
What do I mean?

380
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,580
Remember this.

381
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,480
One hand can't cover both ears.

382
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,030
Now everyone in the Qinchuan industry
knows about this.

383
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,240
And you're still keeping it from me?

384
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,270
What have I kept from you?

385
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,550
You haven't kept anything from me?

386
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,960
Then how did this
Uncle become Li Yuanguang?

387
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,750
You're hiding it from me.

388
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,010
You two are in cahoots, making big money.

389
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,400
What?

390
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,440
You want to monopolize Qinchuan
and sideline me, don't you?

391
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,870
Sheng,

392
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,480
your mind,

393
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,550
it's really something else.

394
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,030
Getting paid without doing any work,

395
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,030
and you still feel like
you're getting the short end of the stick.

396
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:05,890
How about this?

397
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,510
If you don't want to do it, step aside.

398
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,310
There are plenty of people
lining up to be a mascot.

399
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,440
I don't need to

400
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,900
keep doing these thankless favors anymore.

401
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,560
As for you,

402
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,550
go back to your old trade.

403
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,440
But since we're family,

404
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,280
let me give you a word of warning.

405
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,200
Qi Dacang has been keeping an eye on you.

406
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,680
If one day they catch you,

407
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,510
don't blame me
for not being capable enough

408
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,370
to bail you out.

409
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,080
Stop trying to scare me.

410
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,560
You're also on Qi Dacang's radar.

411
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,640
Why can you do it and I can't?

412
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,640
Some things
you can't figure out on your own,

413
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,270
and even if others explain it
to you, you still won't understand.

414
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,790
You have wine
but insist on drinking vinegar.

415
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,270
You insist on being a tomb raider

416
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,800
who can't get out of his den.

417
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,960
Then go ahead,

418
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,440
I won't stop you.

419
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,750
So you mean

420
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,960
I can only watch you two eat the meat

421
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,110
while I just drink the soup?

422
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,770
If that's how you want
to see it, I can't help you.

423
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,310
Fine.

424
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,510
Two Circles.

425
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,080
Pung!

426
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,480
Wait a moment.

427
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,670
It's a win.

428
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,240
What?

429
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,880
Look.

430
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,750
Pay up first.

431
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,320
I've been losing all day.

432
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,960
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

433
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,000
You set up this game,
and now you're just quitting?

434
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,590
You want to leave?

435
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,390
Settle your debts before you go.

436
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:04,930
Lai, pay up.

437
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,880
Bro,

438
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,250
I'm a bit short on cash lately.

439
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,590
I'll bring the money to you later.

440
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,590
Later, later, later...

441
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,070
Cut the crap.

442
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,210
Stop being so shameless here.

443
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,270
Don't be so harsh with your words.

444
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,070
We're all from the same village.

445
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
Cut the crap and pay up.

446
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,180
Bro, you

447
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,070
You seem to have forgotten
about that 200-yuan stone.

448
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,640
When have I ever left
you out when I made money?

449
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,270
Is that petty little matter
even worth mentioning?

450
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,200
You have the nerve to bring that up.

451
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,880
I've been playing dumb for so long.

452
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,420
After all that trouble,
we only sold one stone.

453
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,480
Didn't you say ten pieces?

454
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,880
That was because Fang Kun found out.

455
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,270
You've been

456
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,240
following the archaeological team.

457
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,170
What did you actually accomplish?

458
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,120
What results did you get?

459
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,310
Bless your heart.

460
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,310
You're hopeless.

461
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,030
Mr. Lv!

462
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,160
Mr. Lv!

463
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,350
What's up?

464
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,550
Come down for a moment.

465
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,810
Go, go, go, take a look.

466
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,460
What's the matter?

467
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,960
I've drilled all the holes
you laid out for me.

468
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,690
Can you lay out some more for me?

469
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,530
You've finished them all?

470
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,000
You've drilled all
the holes I laid out for you?

471
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,800
That's right.

472
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,010
You're quite impressive, young lady.

473
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
You're almost surpassing me, your master.

474
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,750
Master, you're teasing me again.

475
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,290
Why would I flatter you?

476
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,400
At your speed,

477
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,270
you're faster than those who've
been doing this for two or three years.

478
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,130
I wouldn't dare say that, Master.

479
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,700
What's wrong, Master?

480
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,350
Why is there variegated earth here?

481
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,400
Master,

482
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,020
why can't there be variegated earth?

483
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,780
Mr. Guo, Mr. Guo.

484
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Come here with Mr. Fang for a moment.

485
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,620
Mr. Guo.

486
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,040
Mr. Fang.

487
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,880
I've double-checked everything.

488
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,140
We laid out the holes exactly as you said,

489
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,110
using the location where the black pottery
figurine was unearthed as the coordinate.

490
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,970
12 holes in two rows
north to south, that's correct.

491
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,040
16 holes in two rows
east to west, also correct.

492
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,920
The distance between holes is five meters.

493
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,780
Still correct.

494
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,470
Now that we've finished drilling,

495
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,930
God knows we haven't
reached the bottom yet.

496
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,860
What do you think, Lu?

497
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,830
Mr. Guo, Mr. Fang,

498
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,410
I can guarantee

499
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,330
we'll be able to drill so fast.

500
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,180
It can only mean one thing:

501
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,760
This tomb,

502
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,920
is more impressive than we thought.

503
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,440
It seems

504
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,170
the size and structure of this tomb

505
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,400
far exceed our initial expectations.

506
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,140
Let's discuss something.

507
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,130
Can we change our drilling method?

508
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,140
You want to use the plum blossom pattern?

509
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,410
What's the plum blossom pattern?

510
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,160
Look, we're currently
using the grid pattern.

511
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,160
The grid pattern drills two rows
of holes vertically and horizontally,

512
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,830
which means

513
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,460
drilling these
exploratory holes in a cross pattern.

514
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,400
[Grid Style]

515
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,260
Its main purpose is

516
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,920
to determine the stratigraphy

517
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,400
in both vertical and horizontal directions
within the large working area.

518
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,560
The plum blossom pattern,

519
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,590
[Plum Blossom Style]

520
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,620
as the name suggests,

521
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,440
we drill the exploratory holes in a pattern
that resembles plum blossoms.

522
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,550
Like this.

523
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,590
This is mainly

524
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,000
to determine large-scale remains

525
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,860
and the extent of the burial site.

526
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,170
Here's the case.

527
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,440
Let's increase the distance

528
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,410
between these exploratory holes

529
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,690
by doubling it.

530
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,330
Let's reduce the density
of this general survey.

531
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,270
First, let's determine
the range of this tomb,

532
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,640
shall we?

533
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,730
Alright.

534
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,110
Fine.

535
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,790
I think it's good.

536
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,000
Everyone, let's work hard.

537
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,640
I'll go to town later to buy a chicken.

538
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,270
We'll treat everyone tonight.

539
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,600
Okay, okay, no problem.

540
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,830
You've got quite a collection here.

541
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,690
What are you interested in?

542
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,590
Are you just selling,

543
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,400
or do you buy things too?

544
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,550
Are you looking to sell something?

545
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:22,920
Yes.

546
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
What kind of item?

547
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,640
Qin bricks and Han tiles.

548
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,590
Extremely valuable, priceless.

549
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,950
How much do you want for them?

550
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,760
Three thousand.

551
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,130
Three thousand?

552
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,350
Listen.

553
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:40,880
What?

554
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,200
My shop is small.

555
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,940
Can't handle such high-value items.

556
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,070
Go out,

557
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,480
turn left.

558
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:48,960
That place

559
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,570
can handle your high-value items.

560
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,550
Are you messing with me?

561
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,070
There's nothing
to the left except a trash can.

562
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,790
Silly.

563
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,350
Even if you throw your garbage

564
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,790
into the trash can, no one would want it.

565
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,790
You're talking nonsense.

566
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,190
Let me tell you the truth.

567
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,550
A whole set of Qin and Han dynasty tiles

568
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,220
is only worth three to five hundred yuan.

569
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,420
Your broken pieces are worth nothing.

570
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,420
You said they're high-value items.

571
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,110
Go away.

572
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,200
Get out of here.

573
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,530
You're wasting my time.

574
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,860
Shulan.

575
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,490
Shulan.

576
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,530
It's me.

577
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,190
Wen Wen made some dumplings for you.

578
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,190
They're vegetarian and still warm.

579
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,160
Shulan.

580
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,900
Shulan.

581
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,050
Shulan.

582
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,090
Are you alright?

583
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,510
I'm fine.

584
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,430
Don't come here anymore.

585
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,330
Go back.

586
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,640
I'll leave the dumplings at your doorstep.

587
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,200
And the newly bought medicine.

588
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
Along with an electric blanket.

589
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,890
Smells delicious.

590
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,350
Mr. Lu, we're counting on you.

591
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,880
Alright.

592
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,270
I've got two bottles of good wine.

593
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,880
Let's celebrate tonight.

594
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,400
Okay.

595
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,550
Guo.

596
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,370
I don't mean to rain on your parade.

597
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,270
It's okay if you're happy about it.

598
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,200
But don't get too excited too soon.

599
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,750
We haven't even confirmed if it's a tomb

600
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,360
or a burial complex yet.

601
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,720
Why have you become so conservative now?

602
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,590
Didn't you say

603
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,400
we should make bold guesses
and seek careful verification?

604
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,350
You make bold guesses,

605
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,160
and I'll seek careful verification.

606
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,560
Right?

607
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,820
Right, right, right.

608
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,250
You verify, I'll guess.

609
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,210
Put the knife down, put it down.

610
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,240
Lu,

611
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,920
I've been thinking,

612
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,030
we should increase the depth now.

613
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,960
Let's find the tomb passage first,

614
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,870
and then we'll measure the depth

615
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,690
and dimensions of the passage.

616
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,210
Let's first

617
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,110
trace the structure of this burial.

618
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,070
What do you think?

619
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,730
No problem.

620
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,610
Is that okay?

621
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,480
It's doable.

622
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,340
Alright, good.

623
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,560
Luo Qing.

624
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,040
Luo Qing.

625
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,830
You haven't eaten anything

626
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,720
all day.

627
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,910
You should drink
some hot fermented rice soup.

628
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,000
It'll give your body some calories,

629
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,200
so you'll have
more energy to write better.

630
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,260
Thank you, senior.

631
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,920
Don't worry about me.

632
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,980
You all go and rest.

633
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,790
Actually, everyone
is quite worried about you.

634
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,350
You're pushing yourself so hard.

635
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,440
We're afraid you might wear yourself out.

636
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,370
I'm really fine.

637
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,750
You should go rest, quickly.

638
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,750
I'll drink it in a bit, just a moment.

639
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,230
Luo Qing, it's like this.

640
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,640
Actually,

641
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,750
after working with you these days,

642
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,440
I feel

643
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
the job of team leader
is indeed quite tough.

644
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
I was thinking,

645
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,880
if, I mean if,

646
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,070
you want to step back from the front line,

647
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,790
I can

648
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,370
fully support you.

649
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,930
Who steps back at such a young age?

650
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,160
If you keep talking here,

651
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,560
I'll be even less
able to continue writing.

652
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,260
Alright, I won't bother you then.

653
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,860
remember to drink something.

654
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,590
Every word spoken by an archaeologist,

655
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,790
every judgment made,

656
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,860
could potentially affect

657
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,630
the accuracy of a period
of history and civilization.

658
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,330
Therefore,

659
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,840
we must be extremely cautious,

660
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,510
never make assumptions,

661
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,040
and never jump to conclusions lightly.

662
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,120
Mr. Fang,

663
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,480
someone's going to die.

664
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,760
Mu, don't worry.

665
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,860
I'll go to the mountain tomorrow.

666
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,880
Wen Wen,

667
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,429
thank you on behalf of your sister-in-law.

668
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,449
So many dishes.

669
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,280
You should sit down and eat with us.

670
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,680
We're all family, no need for formalities.

671
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,400
Alright.

672
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,090
Wen Wen.

673
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,550
Sheng, Feng.

674
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,670
Is my brother-in-law here?

675
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,710
Yes, he's eating.

676
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,560
Jianhui.

677
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,030
Look, look, look.

678
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,560
Feng made dumplings today.

679
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,530
She said to bring some over to you.

680
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,070
You're eating dumplings too?

681
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,920
What a coincidence.

682
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,850
Perfect timing.

683
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,770
The filling seems different.

684
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,590
Let's make it a double happiness.

685
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,720
Let's eat together.

686
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,810
I'll go get a cup.

687
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Try the dumplings Feng made.

688
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,710
Sheng.

689
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,960
Feng, enjoy your meal.

690
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,670
Just call me if you need anything.

691
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,710
Come on, sit here and eat with us.

692
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,110
No need, no need.

693
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,710
We brought so much.

694
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,030
You eat.

695
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,360
Sit down and eat with us.

696
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,530
The kid is still quite shy.

697
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,210
Come on, let's eat then.

698
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,110
That day,

699
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,510
after you talked to me,

700
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,040
I went back
and thought about it over and over.

701
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,450
I finally understood.

702
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,110
I realized

703
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,670
who truly cares about me.

704
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,840
You see, I'm short-sighted.

705
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,670
I couldn't see
the grand ambitions in your heart.

706
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,320
The flock needs to follow the lead sheep.

707
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,000
That's right.

708
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,200
You are my lead sheep.

709
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,440
From now on, I'll follow right behind you.

710
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,840
Wherever you go, I'll go.

711
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,590
You really understood?

712
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,030
I did.

713
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,760
That's more like it.

714
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,390
What took you so long?

715
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,010
Let's drink.

716
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,470
Cheers.

717
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,070
Hou.

718
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,400
Hou.

719
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,510
Fang Kun?

720
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,500
I recognized you from behind.

721
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,710
Why are you here so late at night?

722
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,360
Can't I come late at night?

723
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,230
Just checking on you, paying a visit.

724
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,030
I missed you.

725
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,060
You smooth talker.

726
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,070
Miss me?

727
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,680
You actually miss me?

728
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,960
Who else would I miss?

729
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,810
What's that you're carrying?

730
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,130
It's getting colder, isn't it?

731
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,320
I bought a small heater for Luo Qing.

732
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,650
She's been staying up all night recently.

733
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,840
I'm worried she might catch a cold.

734
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Isn't there already a stove?

735
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,510
That stove isn't enough.

736
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,240
Won't this make it a bit warmer?

737
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,420
Are you sure this thing works?

738
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,630
What do you mean?

739
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,830
Why wouldn't it work?

740
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,760
Nothing.

741
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,930
Hou, is this your first time

742
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
doing fieldwork?

743
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,590
It is indeed my first time.

744
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:16,920
Okay.

745
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,420
First time is good.

746
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,880
What do you mean?

747
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,080
Isn't this written quite well?

748
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,340
You scared me to death.

749
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,670
You didn't even knock when you came in.

750
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,680
Like a ghost.

751
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:42,960
Oh my god.

752
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,310
When did you get here?

753
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Ms. Luo,

754
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,190
look at your eyes.

755
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,050
You've turned into a panda
in just a few days.

756
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,860
It's just like what Xiaobai said.

757
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Haven't you eaten or slept for days?

758
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,070
He's the one
who tipped you off again, isn't he?

759
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,600
Xiaobai is just
concerned about his teacher.

760
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,160
He's worried you might work yourself sick.

761
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,010
So why did he send you here?

762
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,810
To team up and annoy me?

763
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,020
It's not like that.

764
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,960
At most, we'd team up to knock you out

765
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,360
so you can get some proper sleep.

766
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,480
You should go do whatever you need to do.

767
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,550
Go back to where you came from.

768
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,590
I haven't even warmed my seat yet,

769
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,230
and you're already kicking me out.

770
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,830
We're colleagues after all.

771
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,610
In this freezing weather,

772
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,670
you could at least
offer me a meal or something.

773
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,770
Isn't there any?

774
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,740
Senior made it.

775
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,160
I can't eat. You go ahead.

776
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,960
What the hell did Hou make?

777
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,800
It's so watery.

778
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,130
How can this fill you up?

779
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,600
Luo Qing.

780
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,720
Luo Qing.

781
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,360
Don't you know how to knock?

782
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,420
You scared Ms. Luo.

783
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,480
I...

784
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,320
Well, Fang Kun.

785
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,070
I made this for Luo Qing.

786
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,270
Why are you eating it?

787
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,760
Luo Qing, I'll make you
another bowl in a bit.

788
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,890
No need, I can't eat.

789
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,950
You have to eat

790
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
so that your body can have calories.

791
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,100
Luo Qing, look at this.

792
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,670
Doesn't it feel warm...

793
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,380
Unplug it!

794
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,170
Well.

795
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,320
Senior,

796
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,840
this small heater
can't handle the old house's wiring.

797
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,410
It's definitely going to short circuit.

798
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:27,960
I'm sorry.

799
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,880
I didn't know it would short circuit.

800
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
I thought having a small heater

801
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,490
would make you a bit warmer.

802
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,000
How did it short circuit?

803
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:35,590
How about this?

804
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,000
I'll go find an electrician.

805
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,190
Then have them fix the wiring.

806
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,150
Where are you going to find
an electrician in the middle of the night?

807
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,590
Can you stop making things worse?

808
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,650
Alright, Luo Qing.

809
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,730
Don't blame Hou.

810
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,960
If you want to blame someone,
blame me for not reminding him, okay?

811
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,890
What do you mean?

812
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,070
You knew he was going to use the heater?

813
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,400
Yeah.

814
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,840
And you didn't warn him?

815
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
I just wanted the lights to go out.

816
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,640
So you could get some good sleep.

817
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,000
What kind of person are you?

818
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,440
Who are you to me?

819
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,190
Wait, can you guys just...

820
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,110
Stop caring for me in your own way.

821
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,070
Stop being so presumptuous.

822
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,870
I'm really busy with something.

823
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,420
Oh no, now she's really angry.

824
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,080
Jianhui.

825
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,370
Jianhui.

826
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,320
Go call Wen Wen out.

827
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,980
Go quickly.

828
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,190
Wen Wen.

829
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,280
Come on, join us.

830
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,740
Let's eat together.

831
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,070
It's been so long
since we've seen each other.

832
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,510
Mu.

833
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
Mu drank too much.

834
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,440
It's okay.

835
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,110
It's fine, let him sleep for a while.

836
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,710
Rest a bit.

837
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,230
Sit down, sit here.

838
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,510
I'll help him inside to sleep.

839
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,150
It's alright.

840
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,110
When people drink too much,
we can't move them.

841
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,190
-He might vomit.
-Long time no see.

842
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,440
I've been wanting to thank you.

843
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,640
I can't drink either.

844
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,000
It's okay.

845
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,630
You can't drink.

846
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,800
Sit here and have a chat.

847
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,000
Really, it's good 30-year-old liquor.

848
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,370
That's enough.

849
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,000
-I can't drink.
-It's fine.

850
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,840
It's alright, we're happy today.

851
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,640
That's right.

852
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,230
You've worked hard lately, Wen Wen.

853
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,000
It's my duty.

854
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,510
There's a lot of work to do at home too.

855
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,440
See how busy
my brother-in-law is.

856
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,670
Come on, let's have a drink.

857
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,550
It's all in the wine.

858
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,010
Cheers.

859
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,630
Thank you, Wen Wen.

860
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
I'll drink it all.

861
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,280
Drink it all.

862
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,820
It's fine for young folks.

863
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,660
Come on, eat, have a dumpling.

864
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,210
I made them.

865
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,480
Have a dumpling.

866
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
I don't want any.

867
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,400
You won't eat?

868
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,730
If you're not eating, then drink. Come on.

869
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,370
Luo Qing.

870
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,360
If you ask me,

871
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,230
your ability to
handle pressure is so poor.

872
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,400
You might as well
not be the team leader anymore.

873
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,330
What do you mean?

874
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,170
From what I know about you,

875
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,060
the plan you've written must be good.

876
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,550
So in my opinion,

877
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,610
you just can't handle pressure well.

878
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,860
You lack confidence in yourself.

879
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,530
The institute has given you

880
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,450
a task beyond your capabilities.

881
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,760
How many eyes are watching?

882
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,400
If anything goes wrong,

883
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,960
not only will you fail to lift the roof,

884
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,490
but you'll also
smash the ancestors' skulls.

885
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,920
So you toss and turn, hesitating,

886
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,380
unable to make a decision.

887
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,740
What are you trying to say?

888
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,460
You know,

889
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,730
we're archaeologists.

890
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,580
It's all about academic work.

891
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,400
Right?

892
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,610
But being a team leader is different.

893
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
A team leader has to make decisions.

894
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,920
If you keep hesitating,

895
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,770
your team members will be on edge too.

896
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,080
Whether it's Xiaobai

897
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,000
or Hou,

898
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,770
they're not just your support group,

899
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,520
they're your teammates too.

900
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,320
If one project drains you completely,

901
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,950
then I suggest

902
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,810
you might as well

903
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,800
just go back to
the institute and take an office job.

904
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,840
Wouldn't that be much easier?
