[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,729
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,920
This is fifty thousand.

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,450
I came here with sincerity.

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,560
Give me ten days.

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
I'll gather five million.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,920
If during these ten days,

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,009
you find someone
offering a higher price than me,

9
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,350
you can sell anytime.

10
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,740
Does that work for you?

11
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,970
What if I sell the goods?

12
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Do I need to return this money?

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,610
No need to return it.

14
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,669
You said something quite right.

15
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,220
No one turns down money.

16
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,360
So I'll

17
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,030
be magnanimous

18
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,960
and put aside those
disgusting things you did in the past

19
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
for now.

20
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,240
However,

21
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,960
whether you can
buy this batch of goods from me

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,150
depends on your luck.

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,570
Bro, it's worth so much.

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,590
Bro.

25
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,620
It's five million.

26
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,520
We can afford to cross Mu Jianhui.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,380
But we can't afford to pass up
the money, can we, bro?

28
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,440
That's right.

29
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,550
You two idiots.

30
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,050
You need to read between the lines.

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,340
What kind of person is Mu Jianhui?

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,890
He has a sharp eye.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,140
No one in the entire
Guanzhong region can match him.

34
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,140
If he dares to offer five million,

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,050
it proves

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,630
our goods are worth at least ten million.

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
Plus our batch of bronze artifacts,

38
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,910
selling for over ten million

39
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,170
is not a problem at all.

40
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,360
The emperor's daughter
doesn't worry about marriage.

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,370
With these treasures in our hands,

42
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,780
we're the bosses.

43
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,120
We can sell to whoever we want.

44
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,260
That's right.

45
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:31,960
Hu,

46
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,150
should we

47
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,120
inform Sheng first?

48
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,150
I'm in a good mood right now.

49
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,960
I took this thing to him.

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
He insisted that what I had was fake.

51
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,690
He doesn't even know
as many characters as I do.

52
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,690
He's just a monkey wearing glasses,

53
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,240
pretending to be cultured.

54
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,520
Saying I'm uneducated.

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,030
I think he's the one
who's gone stupid from reading too much.

56
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,230
Right, right, right.

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,910
But, bro,

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,830
we usually get our goods through him.

59
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,030
If we go behind his back this time

60
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,090
and sell the goods,

61
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,570
once his temper flares up,

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,740
he'll eat us alive.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,060
How can you... This is a huge sum of money.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,610
Can Liu Shusheng afford it?

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,680
It's not that we're being disloyal,

66
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,740
it's just that he's not
destined for these good things.

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,690
I just can't understand

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,430
why we have to put up
with that jerk's attitude.

69
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,430
Five million? That's too generous.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,670
Bro,

71
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,190
after being mocked for so long,

72
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,520
how can you still laugh?

73
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,480
I've finally found goods
that will catch Zhao Youlin's eye.

74
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,740
Why shouldn't I laugh?

75
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,330
Just those goods of his...

76
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,310
Did you see that celadon bowl

77
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,390
with lobed rim and silver fittings?

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,600
Song Dynasty ceramic with silver fittings.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,360
It's the first time I've seen one.

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,230
I bet

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Zhao Youlin hasn't seen one either.

82
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,380
You don't understand Xing Zhaohu.

83
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,330
That jerk

84
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,410
will definitely pocket that 50,000 yuan

85
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,430
and still won't sell us the goods.

86
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,160
If he won't sell,
I'll find a way to make him sell.

87
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,140
In Qinchuan,

88
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,050
no artifact is beyond my reach,

89
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,650
only beneath my interest.

90
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,310
Even if he sells,

91
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,390
where are we going to get 5 million from?

92
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,990
Anyone can write a bad check.

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,740
By then, it won't be this amount anymore.

94
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,210
Bro, the more you say,
the less I understand.

95
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,970
He didn't sell for 5 million,

96
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,070
how could he sell it to us for less?

97
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,700
Guang,

98
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,330
I may not understand
Xing Zhaohu as well as you do,

99
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,060
but I understand human nature.

100
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,159
Do you think

101
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,190
this batch of goods
is worth 5 million or not?

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,340
If you think it's worth 5 million,

103
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,600
it's probably worth more than that, right?

104
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
That's right.

105
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,159
Xing Zhaohu thinks the same way.

106
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,560
Xing Zhaohu doesn't know much.

107
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,120
Mr. Hong offered 50,000 and he didn't sell.

108
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,310
If we talk like this, won't we reveal everything?

109
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,150
You're right.

110
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,590
Xing Zhaohu doesn't understand anything.

111
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,270
After being

112
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,360
an on-site commander for so many years,

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,960
he probably hasn't even seen 5 million before.

114
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,630
After hearing the price I offered,

115
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,310
his heart must be soaring.

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,800
I bet right now

117
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,750
he's frantically
looking for buyers everywhere.

118
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,800
This news

119
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,690
will soon be spread
by him to the black market.

120
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,310
The inspection team is already
focusing on Song Dynasty ceramic.

121
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,370
They'll catch wind of it in a few days.

122
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,780
Once the inspection team is on to him,

123
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,630
this batch of goods will become a hot potato.

124
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,640
No one will dare to take it.

125
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,480
Other than lowering the price,

126
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,210
does he have any other options?

127
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,560
If others don't dare to take it,

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,890
I'm afraid we won't dare to take it either.

129
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,600
Others are others.

130
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,930
Zhao Youlin is Zhao Youlin.

131
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,740
Others don't dare,

132
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,930
but he, Zhao Youlin, might dare.

133
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,870
It's a brilliant move.

134
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,210
I just feel the risk is a bit high.

135
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,720
What if...

136
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,230
Both we and the goods get caught?

137
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,420
That's why we need to have a backup plan.

138
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,270
Guang,

139
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,410
contact a few of our brothers.

140
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,550
Prepare the tools.

141
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,850
Get ready to go down
the pit in a few days.

142
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,590
Which pit?

143
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,140
The pit where Xing Zhaohu

144
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,370
got the goods from.

145
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,410
He wouldn't tell me, would he?

146
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,360
That's right.

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
He won't say.

148
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,370
But someone will.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,560
Sheng.

150
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,670
Brother-in-law is here.

151
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Letting just anyone into the house.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,930
Not afraid of inviting trouble in.

153
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,870
Brother-in-law, please don't take offense.

154
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,870
He's just sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.

155
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,750
Sheng must still be upset
about the previous

156
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,880
misunderstanding.

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,420
I can make mistakes too, you know.

158
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,390
If you have something to say, say it.

159
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,590
If not, please leave.

160
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,750
I know you've lost a lot of money.

161
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,470
Your sister and I both feel bad about it.

162
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,000
So,

163
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,310
there's an opportunity
to make some money right now.

164
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,440
I want you to join in.

165
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,080
Help you recoup some losses.

166
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,290
Well, well, this is a surprise.

167
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,360
You actually thought of me
for a money-making opportunity?

168
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,430
If you don't trust me,

169
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,480
at least trust Hu.

170
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,380
Zhaohu?

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,060
What about Zhaohu?

172
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,900
Come on, let's talk inside. Come on.

173
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,360
Come on.

174
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,230
Don't touch me.

175
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,120
Let's talk in the yard.

176
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,630
I want to be out in broad daylight.

177
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,429
Let's see how you spin your tale.

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,320
Brother-in-law, please sit.

179
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,850
Alright.

180
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,420
You've been quite ambitious lately.

181
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,490
If you don't improve,
you'll be left behind.

182
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,210
Let's get to the point. It's like this.

183
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
Xing Zhaohu has just acquired a new batch of goods.

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,570
I've seen them. The quality is excellent.

185
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,270
But he's asking for five million.

186
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,750
It's too much for me to handle alone.

187
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,960
Let's do it together.

188
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,260
After we sell it, we'll definitely make several times the profit.

189
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,870
Mu Jianhui, oh Mu Jianhui.

190
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,630
You're like a weasel
paying New Year's respects to a chicken.

191
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,760
You're up to no good.

192
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,200
You're the one who fails at life,

193
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,510
but still gives advice on how others should live.

194
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,870
Full of tricks and schemes.

195
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,320
You're still trying to fool me.

196
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,720
I've already seen Zhaohu's batch of goods.

197
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,550
They're fake.

198
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,360
Fake?

199
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,990
How is that possible?

200
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,150
I inspected them myself.

201
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,030
They're absolutely genuine.

202
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,110
Absolutely genuine?

203
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,320
Then explain this to me.

204
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,360
How come there's Song Dynasty ceramic in a Song dynasty tomb?

205
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,490
You think I'm a fool?

206
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,670
I don't know what these people were thinking.

207
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,550
If you're going to fake it, at least make it more convincing.

208
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,750
Putting Western Zhou bronze

209
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,360
into a Song dynasty tomb.

210
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,550
And claiming it's some grand tomb of the Lv family.

211
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,150
It's laughable.

212
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,440
The Lv family tomb?

213
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Must be Lv Dalin's family?

214
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,550
You've slipped up, haven't you?

215
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,080
You've given yourself away.

216
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,410
You know about Lv Dalin,

217
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,000
but you don't know that in a Song dynasty tomb,

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,660
you can't find bronze and Song Dynasty ceramic?

219
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,790
You just think I haven't been fooled enough,

220
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,040
and want to kick me while I'm down

221
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,370
to crush me completely.

222
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,250
Alright.

223
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,890
Since you don't believe me,

224
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,730
there's nothing I can do.

225
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,280
This batch of goods,

226
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,870
I'll just keep it for myself.

227
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,400
Go ahead,

228
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:25,960
keep it.

229
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,670
See if it doesn't make you burst.

230
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,670
Brother-in-law,

231
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,200
take care.

232
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,650
Still trying to fool me.

233
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,790
Sheng,

234
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,030
why do you think he keeps trying to deceive us

235
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,160
over and over again?

236
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,860
Could it be that Hu's batch of goods

237
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,680
is actually genuine?

238
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,210
Impossible.

239
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,060
You think your husband has been

240
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,480
staying up late reading books for nothing?

241
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,450
You don't understand human nature at all.

242
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,980
Hating those who have and laughing at those who don't,

243
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,440
that's just human nature.

244
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,770
You know?

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,720
Mu Jianhui

246
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,240
just can't wait to see us never get ahead in life.

247
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,080
From now on, we'll just interpret everything he says as the opposite.

248
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,030
If he says it's genuine,

249
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,160
then it must be fake.

250
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,510
He's back.

251
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,630
Brother, brother.

252
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,390
Has it eaten?

253
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
I don't know, probably.

254
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,080
You don't know?

255
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,290
Xiaobai.

256
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,840
Why do I feel like you're glued

257
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,120
to Ms. Luo every single day?

258
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,290
Wherever she goes, you go.

259
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,830
Well, Ms. Luo is my teacher.

260
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,090
Of course I follow her.

261
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,320
Are you feeling lonely, Kun?

262
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,750
Want to hang out together today?

263
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,700
If you're really free,

264
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,700
go to the north
and do a field survey of that area for me.

265
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,840
Heizui.

266
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,390
Heizui.

267
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,870
So lazy today.

268
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,480
Heizui.

269
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,440
What's wrong? What's wrong?

270
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,090
Tired from playing?

271
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Hello.

272
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,750
Do you want some sausage?

273
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,610
Do you have any?

274
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,080
No, I'm just teasing it.

275
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,580
Heizui.

276
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,510
Look, what's wrong with it here?

277
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,040
Did it happen while eating?

278
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,630
No, something's wrong.

279
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,080
We need to take it to the vet station.

280
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,150
-Hurry up.
-Here. Take it.

281
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,720
OK.

282
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,000
-Come on, Heizui.
-Be careful.

283
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,950
It's alright.

284
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,250
Let's go.

285
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:49,910
Let's go, let's go.

286
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,970
Let's go, let's go.

287
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,790
What happened

288
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,630
to you?

289
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,480
Hello, doctor.

290
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,130
Is anyone there?

291
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,630
Who is it?

292
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,180
Hello, doctor.

293
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,990
Our dog doesn't look well. Hello.

294
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,920
Coming, coming.

295
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,250
Hurry, hurry up.

296
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,270
-What’s wrong?
-Thank you. Thank you.

297
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,840
What’s wrong?

298
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,970
-Hurry up.
-Come on.

299
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,910
Come.

300
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,670
It looks like it ate rat poison.

301
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,800
Is there still hope?

302
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,940
Let's give it a try. Come, follow me.

303
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,000
-Let’s go.
-Hurry.

304
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,670
Down here,

305
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,450
it's as hard as rock.

306
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
We can't dig anymore.

307
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,390
You idiot!

308
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,530
Get out, get out!

309
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,330
Come on!

310
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Come on, one, two!

311
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,800
Take this.

312
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,900
Be careful!

313
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,530
I'll do it.

314
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,370
Hammer.

315
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,510
Hammer, hammer.

316
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:11,940
Hurry!

317
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,080
Found it!

318
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,190
Quick, quick, quick!

319
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,670
You,

320
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,820
you can't dig either, can you?

321
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,830
You talk too much.

322
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
What rotten luck.

323
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,200
Choosing this lousy place.

324
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,260
So what do we do now?

325
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,880
Let's try somewhere else.
What else can we do?

326
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,740
Okay, okay, thank you.

327
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,650
Okay.

328
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,320
How is it?

329
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,630
The doctor said there's no major problem.

330
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,470
A few more days of IV drip and it should be fine.

331
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,720
Look.

332
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,390
The nose is even wetter
than it was this afternoon.

333
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,600
Fortunately, we discovered it early.

334
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,460
The stomach pumping was done in time.

335
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,390
Have you contacted Uncle Shoucun?

336
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,960
I called, but no one answered.

337
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,360
I've told Uncle Youliang.

338
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,490
I asked him to notify us immediately
if there's any news.

339
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,500
Where could he have gone so late?

340
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,790
You should go back first.

341
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,830
Isn't your train early tomorrow morning?

342
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,430
Xiaobai and I are still here.

343
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,630
You haven't packed yet, have you?

344
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,800
Hurry back and get some rest.

345
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,060
You won't get many hours of sleep anyway.

346
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,790
What?

347
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,580
Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

348
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,550
Once we part this time,

349
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,530
who knows when we'll see each other again.

350
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,960
Don't you feel
even a little reluctant to part,

351
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,750
Ms. Luo?

352
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,610
What do I have to be reluctant about?

353
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,330
Whether we meet again or not
is up to people to decide.

354
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,590
Besides, it wasn't me who took the heartless pill back then,

355
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,320
disappearing without a trace for several years.

356
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,090
But you didn't contact me either, did you?

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,130
You left without a word, why should I have contacted you?

358
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,200
Luo Qing.

359
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,640
Did you stay in Qinchuan back then

360
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,480
really because of me?

361
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,840
Yes.

362
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,840
So what if it was?

363
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,870
Is there any point in talking about the past again?

364
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,599
It was nothing but an illusion.

365
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:07,980
An illusion?

366
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,390
In a closed environment,

367
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,790
it was just an illusion caused by hormones.

368
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,420
Spending every day together,

369
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,150
seeing each other all the time.

370
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,530
If not an illusion, what else could it be?

371
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,670
When I left back then,

372
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,800
I told Guo Shilin

373
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,860
that I wanted to go to Yusai,

374
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,390
to walk the path that Mr. Zan had walked.

375
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,980
But in fact, I knew better than anyone

376
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,790
that I was just running away there.

377
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,510
I was afraid to see you all.

378
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,000
I was afraid to see this environment.

379
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,270
I was afraid to remember

380
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,330
how good Mr. Zan had been to me before.

381
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,750
All these years, I've been trying to convince myself

382
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,480
that I hope I can have the courage to face all this.

383
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,990
What exactly are you trying to say?

384
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,200
I like you.

385
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,710
I like you even more than before.

386
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,130
Can you give me a chance?

387
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,840
Don't.

388
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,600
Fang Kun,

389
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,730
we're not kids anymore.

390
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,120
We're both almost thirty.

391
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,670
Let's be realistic and practical.

392
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,190
One of us is in Yusai,

393
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,860
the other in Qinchuan.

394
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,640
If I can ask you this question,

395
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,150
it means I've thought it through very clearly.

396
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,210
You just need to answer me:

397
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,550
can you give me a chance or not?

398
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,140
I'll figure out a way to deal with the distance.

399
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,280
The distance issue requires one person to make a sacrifice.

400
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,630
I can't possibly leave Qinchuan and go to Yusai to find you.

401
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,760
I'm not selfish either.

402
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,490
I don't want you to give up Yusai for me.

403
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,230
To be honest,

404
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,090
at my age,

405
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,510
I should have been in a relationship by now.

406
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,570
Some of them should be married by now.

407
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,220
Why should I choose loneliness?

408
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,960
Isn't this our choice and life?

409
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,660
I think things are pretty good now.

410
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,760
Let's just stay friends.

411
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,600
You should go back first.

412
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,800
[For Camel Five, from Dog Four]

413
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,390
What's wrong?

414
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,150
Stop for a moment. Back up a little.

415
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,870
Back up.

416
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,580
Okay, okay, stop.

417
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,380
Uncle Shoucun.

418
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,180
Uncle Shoucun.

419
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,450
Why is this guy here?

420
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,220
Why does he reek of alcohol?

421
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,900
Uncle Shoucun.

422
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,180
Let's go. Here's the case.

423
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,140
Let's carry him back first.

424
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,740
We can't just leave him here.

425
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,860
One, two, three.

426
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,190
Come on.

427
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,800
You go in first.

428
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,840
Come on, turn around.

429
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,830
This way.

430
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,230
Slow down.

431
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,400
Chunhua.

432
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,980
I still need to patrol.

433
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,000
Uncle.

434
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,480
Move up a bit.

435
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,640
Chunhua is up there.

436
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,360
I need to go on patrol.

437
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,110
Why don't we leave first?

438
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,380
I don't want to hold you up.

439
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,540
You turn around first. I'll be right there.

440
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,520
Don't worry, this guy will be fine.

441
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,660
You go ahead first.

442
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,260
Then hurry up.

443
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:03,910
Uncle.

444
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,770
I'm leaving.

445
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,850
It looks like it ate rat poison.

446
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,710
Captain Qi, it's Fang Kun.

447
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,970
There's something I need to tell you.

448
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,830
Can you come to the site right now?

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,460
At Uncle Shoucun's place.

450
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,020
There's a situation here.

451
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,690
I think tomb raiders might be behind this.

452
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,850
Alright?

453
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,680
Ms. Luo!

454
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,320
Ms. Luo!

455
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,920
Ms. Luo.

456
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,680
Ms. Luo!

457
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,290
What's going on?

458
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,590
Kun, Ms. Luo is missing.

459
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,730
What happened?

460
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,210
Well...

461
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,870
Last night,

462
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,490
I fell asleep at the veterinary station, right?

463
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,770
She came to wake me up in the morning.

464
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,370
Then we saw a cage over there.

465
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,630
We thought we'd leave Heizui at the vet station first...

466
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,550
Why don't you start from the beginning of time?

467
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,680
Just get to the point.

468
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,190
Well.

469
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,150
Then Ms. Luo said

470
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,360
we'd investigate this area again.

471
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,280
So we came over here.

472
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,190
As I was walking...

473
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,520
I turned around and she was suddenly gone.

474
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,000
It's all flat ground here.

475
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,150
You turn around and she's gone?

476
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,320
What, did she vanish into thin air?

477
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,880
Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

478
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,320
With all these ancient tombs around here,

479
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,190
You don't think there could be... some kind of evil spirits or something?

480
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,650
Watch what you're saying.

481
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,430
Where exactly did she disappear?

482
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,470
Over there, right over there.

483
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,420
I just walked over and she was gone.

484
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,040
Did you call her?

485
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,770
I tried, but there's no signal here.

486
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,730
You didn't bring the walkie-talkie either?

487
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,060
I didn't bring it today.

488
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,800
Come on.

489
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,500
Go over there, there's signal.

490
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,590
Go there and call for help.

491
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,430
-Okay.
-I’ll go over there.

492
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,960
Alright.

493
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,430
Luo Qing!

494
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,460
Luo Qing!

495
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,170
Luo Qing.

496
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,580
-Luo Qing!
-Fang Kun.

497
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,800
Fang Kun.

498
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,320
Why are you here?

499
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,620
Haven't you left yet?

500
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,430
If it weren't for you...

501
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,710
I've already arrived in Huang Plain.

502
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,040
What are you doing here?

503
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,320
Xiaobai said you vanished into thin air.

504
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,600
Why didn't you take the walkie-talkie when you went out?

505
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,400
You've got a mouth just for criticizing others, huh?

506
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,230
What if something happens?

507
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,120
That could've been really dangerous!

508
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,320
Who asked you to care?

509
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,090
Hurry up and catch your train.

510
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,870
I...

511
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,130
This looks like a new looting pit.

512
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,260
Move aside, please.

513
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,590
What are you coming down for?

514
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,670
Let me see.

515
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,020
Hand me the shovel.

516
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,600
I suspect

517
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,030
it was these people

518
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,480
who drugged Heizui

519
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,740
and dug this looting pit here.

520
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,780
Look at the walls of this pit.

521
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,850
Don't they look like rammed earth?

522
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,170
It is rammed earth.

523
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,150
Absolutely rammed earth.

524
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,870
Really?

525
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:54,950
Well,

526
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,650
the highest cut surface of this rammed earth

527
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,250
is so close to the ground level.

528
00:27:59,250 --> 00:27:59,840
In other words,

529
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,470
when rammed earth structures have appeared at the surface layer,

530
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,390
they're most likely...

531
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,520
-Mausoleum ruins.
-Mausoleum ruins.

532
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,930
Ms. Luo, you're amazing!

533
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,190
This...

534
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,000
Kun.

535
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,630
Kun.

536
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,280
Hey, what are you guys doing?

537
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,670
Kun, you should've let me know when you find her.

538
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,030
Really.

539
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,390
I...

540
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,550
Give me a hand, will you?

541
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,400
Hurry up, hurry up!

542
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,200
Come on, pull!

543
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,840
Quick!

544
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,340
Ms. Luo, be careful.

545
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,320
Okay, okay, okay.

546
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,430
Be careful, Kun.

547
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,840
Bro, why did you suddenly

548
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,000
buy so many walnuts

549
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,200
for ourselves to eat?

550
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,040
Do we need to nourish our brains?

551
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,170
Nourish our brains?

552
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,120
What are we going to do tomorrow?

553
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,150
We're going to Lvjia Village to collect walnuts.

554
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,280
We should at least look like people who collect walnuts, right?

555
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,540
Look like collectors?

556
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,560
You want to use these to blacken your hands?

557
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,510
Also dirty our clothes?

558
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,840
That's right.

[Selling Walnuts]

560
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,560
Is anyone home?

561
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,520
What are you here for?

562
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Fellow villager.

563
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
I'm from Qinbei to collect walnuts.

564
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,650
How many do you have at home?

565
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,380
About 90 kilos.

566
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,610
There are more in the field.

567
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,680
How much do you pay per kilo for walnuts?

568
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,390
5.6 yuan per kilo for less than 50 kilos.

569
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,450
6 yuan per kilo for more than 50 kilos.

570
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,250
That's too cheap. Not selling.

571
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,840
If the mountain walnuts grow in a good location, they'll be more profitable.

572
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
I can add another yuan.

573
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,300
My walnuts are absolutely premium quality.

574
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,870
No one for miles around grows

575

better walnuts than we do in Lvjia Village.

576
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,340
Then let's go to the field and take a look.

577
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,430
It's everyone's responsibility to combat tomb raiding.

578
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,660
Are there still people in our village raiding tombs?

579
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,460
Who would dare to do such a thing?

580
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,040
We have ancient tombs here.

581
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,430
It's for protecting them.

582
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,600
If there are ancient tombs, it must be a feng shui treasure spot.

583
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,190
The crop yields must be good.

584
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,460
Good? What's good about it?

585
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,320
Even the wheat doesn't grow tall.

586
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,920
We can only grow walnuts.

587
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,600
Isn't that missing the trees for the forest?

588
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,270
That's why your village has become the hometown of walnuts.

589
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,670
You've got a point there.

590
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,280
Heizui!

591

Heizui!

592
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,980
I'm sorry to you.

593
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm so sorry to you.

594
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,560
Uncle Shoucun.

595
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,430
What's wrong with you?

596
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,930
You've been living here for years,

597
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,040
never missed a day, rain or shine,

598
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,790
why such bad luck this time?

599
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,120
When the tomb raiders came,

600
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,380
you were out drinking.

601
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,240
Uncle Shoucun,

602
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,540
I need to ask you something.

603
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,340
Who were you drinking with that day?

604
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,050
I won't say.

605
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,030
What's the matter?

606
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,760
I don't want to talk about it.

607
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,970
There must be a reason you won't tell me.

608
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,880
You guys can beat me to death,

609
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,410
I still won't say anything.

610
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,730
Uncle Shoucun.

611
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,660
Stop asking.

612
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,100
Master Liu.

613
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,760
I was wrong.

614
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,240
What did you do wrong?

615
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,630
Take off your clothes.

616
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,060
Hair wash or shave?

617
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,170
I thought you were going to pay me.

618
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,630
How old are you? Why are you still eating candy?

619
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,470
Why is this candy so warm?

620
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,150
It's sticky.

621
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,410
It's very sweet.

622
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,080
You silly man.

623
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,670
Have some food before you go.

624
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,920
I can't stay for a meal.

625
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,670
I need to patrol the site soon.

626
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,700
Suit yourself.

627
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,920
I'm just telling you straight.

628
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,370
Once this opportunity passes,

629
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,800
there won't be another chance.

630
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,140
This door of mine

631
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,270
won't open for you anymore.

632
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,410
Think it through.

633
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,230
Go to

634
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,950

635
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,790

[Chunhua Barbershop]

637
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,570
Right away.

638
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,150
Is it comfortable?

639
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,210
It's comfortable.

640
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,790
-Come here more often.
-Sir, line up.

641
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,450
Have a seat.

Liu Chunhua.

643
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,460
Do you want to wash your hair or shave?

644
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,190
You two.

645
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,050
What...

What are you doing?

647
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,380
Just gathering some information.

648
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,290
You're Liu Chunhua, right?

649
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,030
On the 28th,

650
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,250

Yan Shoucun

652

from Yin Village.

653
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,430
Why did you let him stay overnight after dinner and drinks?

654
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,760
What's wrong with that?

655
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,750
I wanted to.

656
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:10,960
I liked it.

657
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,790
I loved it.

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,060
Is that illegal?

660

Seriously?

661
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,679

00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,290
How much money can Yan Shoucun give you anyway?

663
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,120
I had dinner and slept with someone I like.

664
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,270
Why would I expect him to pay?

665
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,469
What kind of person do you think I am?

666
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,600

What happened? Speak up.

672
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,159
I really can't drink anymore.

673
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,760
I still have to go back to the site for patrol later.

674
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,620
Don't say that.

675
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,810
As a man,

676
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,520
you can't say you can't drink.

677
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,510
If you're a real man,

678
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,440
then drink.

who gave me 200 yuan.

713
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,160
He asked me to sleep with Yan Shoucun.

Who was it?

715
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,460
I don't know him.

716
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,540
Be honest.

I really don't know him.

718
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,710
It was a...

719
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,490
A man in his thirties.

720
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,840
He said...

721
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,320
He said he was Yan Shoucun's

722
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,830
nephew.

723
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,740
He said he felt sorry for his uncle being single all his life.

724
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,400
He wanted to give his uncle a taste of happiness.

725
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,350
That man...

726
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,030
What did he look like?

727
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,290
I'm not a cop, I didn't look that closely.

728
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,790
I remember now.

729
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,160

730
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,430

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,480
Many people have seen the goods.

740
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,120
They say it's one hundred percent real.

741
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
I went to the junkyard to ask around.

742
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,350
That Xing Zhaohu has even collected a deposit.

743
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,310
He's been treating Shan Wa to the finest food and drinks every day.

744
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,570
Living it up, they are.

745
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,970
Whose deposit did he take?

746
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,890
Your brother-in-law's, of course.

747
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,690
Mu Jianhui's.

748
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,110
How much did he take?

749
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,310
Fifty thousand yuan.

750
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,670
Why isn't he answering his phone?

751
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,080
See?

752
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,960
He's already sold the goods. Why would he answer your call?

753
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,390
Reading books all day, and who knows what you've learned.

754
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,190
What do you know? Get out of here.

755
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,760
Where's Zhaohu?

756
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,310
He hasn't been here for days.

757
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,960
Where did he go?

758
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,920
I'm just a gravedigger.

759
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,320
Why would the boss tell me where he's going?

760
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,050
Go, go, go. Get lost.

761
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,780
[Incoming call from Sheng]

762
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,440
Ungrateful bastard.

763
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,490
Forgot who's been feeding you all these years?

764
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,080
Bro.

765
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,710
Why don't you use my phone to call him?

766
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,330
He won't answer mine, but he'll answer yours?

767
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,260
Well, he's afraid of you, isn't he?

768
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,110
That's right.

769
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,790
Send him a text message.

770
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,480
Just say,

771
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,790
I know where his house is.

772
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,840
Does he still want his wife and kid?

773
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,790
If this brat doesn't call me back in five minutes,

774
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,590
I'll go to his house and kill him.

775
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,560
This brat...

776
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,400
Bro, what's the character like?

777
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,880
I don't know, either.

778
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,950
Write in pinyin.

779
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,400
Brat.

780
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:34,750
Sheng,

781
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,650
it's me.

782
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,560
I guess you're my big brother, huh?

783
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,660
You're so cocky, huh?

784
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,560
Not even answering your phone anymore.

785
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,630
Sheng, please don't make fun of me anymore.

786
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,880
I just didn't see it for a moment.

787
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,520
I, I wouldn't dare not answer your call.

788
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,180
Don't give me that runaround.

789
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,230
Bring me that batch of ceramic.

790
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,270
Now, immediately.

791
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,040
Well, Sheng, let me tell you.

792
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,710
I can bring it to you,

793
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,790
but let's be clear upfront.

794
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,920
This batch of goods,

795
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,220
Mu Jianhui has seen it.

796
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,790
He's offering 8 million.

797
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,120
We're brothers,

798
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,830
if you can come up with 8 million in cash,

799
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,180
I'll bring it to you right away.

800
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,880
Do I look like I have 8 million?

801
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,630
Bring the stuff over.

802
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,830
We're still brothers.

803
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,890
If you don't bring it,

804
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,750
get ready to collect your wife and kid's bodies.

805
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,790
Stop threatening me with my wife and kid.

806
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,520
My wife and kid haven't lived in the village for a long time.

807
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,600
Let me tell you, I've had enough of you.

808
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,190
All these years I've followed you,

809
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,440
not only have I not gotten rich,

810
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,370
I've gotten poorer with each raid.

811
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,150
Now even the heavens can't stand it anymore.

812
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,470
Finally, it opened its eyes.

813
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,670
I'm finally going to turn my luck around.

814
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,830
Do you want to make it or not?

815
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,700
You're right.

816
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,740
After this job,

817
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,580
whoever goes down into the pit again is a grandson.

818
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:49,790
Bro.

819
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,360
What are you doing?

820
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,140
If you have energy, go use it outside.

821
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,230
What kind of man vents his anger at home?

822
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,830
Shut up!

823
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,960
Bro.

824
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,080
Your wife is actually right.

825
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,790
Why are you sulking here?

826
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,140
If Xing Zhaohu can dig, we can dig too.

827
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,150
Where is the tomb that Xing Zhaohu said he dug last time

828
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,710
he dug last time?

829
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,750
I don't know.

830
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,170
The Lv family's grand tomb.

831
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,480
In Mi County.

832
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,440
The Lv family tomb?

833
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,300
Must be Lv Dalin's family?

834
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,180
Mu Jianhui has outsmarted us again.

835
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,440
Big Head.

836
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,960
Get a few people right away.

837
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,820
Go to Mi County.

838
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,510
Find Mu Jianhui.

839
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,270
Is he in Mi County now?

840
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,430
This guy came to see me last time.

841
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,310
He's got his eye on that batch of ceramic.

842
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,510
But he doesn't know where the pit is.

843
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,440
He came to pump me for information.

844
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,640
He is quite sneaky, isn't he?

845
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,830
So, are we going to dig up this pit or not?

846
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,430
Of course we're going to dig.

847
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,750
And we're going to dig it up big time.
