[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,810
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,600
Hey, buddy.

4
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,340
You're back.

5
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,560
You brought some food?

6
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,330
You're back, Ms. Luo.

7
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,520
What's all this you've got here?

8
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,660
So you haven't been writing your self-criticism properly here.

9
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,820
You've been out on the site doing this stuff again.

10
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,740
Aren't you afraid Mr. Zan will scold you?

11
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,660
It's really you, Ms. Luo.

12
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,750
You start criticizing me as soon as you're back.

13
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,250
Are you holding a struggle session for me?

14
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,510
She criticizes me even when I do nothing.

15
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,980
What's this?

16
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,320
Look, take a good look.

17
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,180
I think the scenery looks nice.

18
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,550
Look, take a good look.

19
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,150
See if you can spot anything.

20
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,500
When was this old photo taken?

21
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,450
Next to the black pottery figurine looting pit,

22
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,980
why is there an extra slope?

23
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,500
Here.

24
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,450
Watch carefully.

25
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,940
I've talked to many elders from Yin Village.

26
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,940
And I've also found many old photos.

27
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,300
What can be proven now is

28
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,570
the area around the black pottery figurine looting pit

29
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,420
used to have a large mound.

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,850
What are you trying to prove?

31
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,070
Come on, look.

32
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,530
Here.

33
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,940
I measured it.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,310
The distance between the black pottery figurine looting pit and Dou Mausoleum

35
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,500
is a full 800 meters.

36
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,500
I also looked into

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,430
the previous exploration records

38
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,410
of South Mausoleum and Dou Mausoleum.

39
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,100
It shows that this black pottery figurine looting pit

40
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,660
doesn't match the characteristics of Dou Mausoleum's outer burial pit.

41
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,340
This means that this looting pit

42
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,450
definitely isn't an outer burial pit of Dou Mausoleum.

43
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,850
If it's not an outer burial pit, what else could it be?

44
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,620
Could it be a tomb?

45
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,880
It might just be a tomb.

46
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,829
I've never seen

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,350
a subordinate tomb‌ that deep before.

48
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,100
Then maybe it's not a subordinate tomb‌.

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,829
Then tell me,

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,870
whose tomb could be in front of Dou Mausoleum?

51
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,060
How would I know whose tomb it is?

52
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,680
There could be many possibilities.

53
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,410
It might even be an emperor's tomb.

54
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,740
Stop talking nonsense.

55
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,920
Which emperor could be buried in front of Dou Mausoleum?

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,870
What do you mean?

57
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,030
Look at these photos now...

58
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,220
-And these things...
-Enough.

59
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,480
Don't make a fuss here.

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,270
Hasn't this matter already been settled?

61
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,980
Aren't you two curious

62
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,220
about this black pottery figurine looting pit at all?

63
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,180
Of course.

64
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,100
On our way back,

65
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,790
we were just talking about it.

66
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,950
How come Mr. Zan had no reaction

67
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,180
when he saw that confession?

68
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,910
Confession?

69
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,450
What confession?

70
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,010
In the materials we went to translate this time,

71
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,500
among the submitted documents,

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,830
there was a confession from a tomb raider.

73
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,860
It said

74
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,300
they smelled a fragrance in the tomb.

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,600
Fragrance?

76
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,420
What kind of fragrance?

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,220
They said it was slightly milder than sandalwood.

78
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,050
Milder than sandalwood,

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,870
and it's a fragrance from inside the tomb.

80
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,510
It might be the scent of cypress wood.

81
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,060
Right, cypress wood fragrance.

82
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,060
When we saw the materials,

83
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,520
we thought the same thing.

84
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,740
The Huangchang Ticou (imperial tomb chamber)

85
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,550
is stacked with peeled heartwood cypress.

86
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,570
In other words,

87
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,820
if there's a cypress scent,

88
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,880
it's likely to be a Huangchang Ticou.

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,650
But that's just a casual remark from a tomb raider,

90
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,910
without any evidence.

91
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,470
We can't make wild guesses.

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
The problem is

93
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,400
Huangchang Ticou

94
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,650
is a tomb chamber used for emperors.

95
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,540
The subordinate tomb‌ near Dou Mausoleum

96
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,420
using Huangchang Ticou as a tomb chamber,

97
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,330
who would have that level of status?

98
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,130
And it's 20 to 30 meters deep.

99
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,470
Who on earth is buried here

100
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,040
to have such high specifications?

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,020
If it weren't for the clear historical records

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,130
stating that Emperor Taizong of Han's Zi Mausoleum is on Phoenix Mountain,

103
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,500
I'd be tempted to guess this is the Zi Mausoleum.

104
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,300
Nonsense.

105
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,570
The Records of the Grand Historian states that the Zi Mausoleum's landscape should be preserved in its original state.

106
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,590
Where's the landscape?

107
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,060
In that old photo,

108
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,740
isn't there a slope next to the hole?

109
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,340
That slope is the landscape.

110
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,520
We need to go down the looting pit.

111
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:48,980
What?

112
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,050
Are you crazy?

113
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,570
I may not have the qualification,

114
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,090
but I can talk to Mr. Zan about it.

115
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,250
Buddy, can you convince Mr. Zan?

116
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,330
I wasn't able to do it before,

117
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,330
but now with these materials,

118
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,980
I should be able to persuade him.

119
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,640
Then you've lost your chance.

120
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:02,890
What do you mean?

121
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,010
I heard that the Municipal Cultural Heritage Bureau

122
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,420
has already notified the district government.

123
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,950
They're about to fill in the looting pit soon.

124
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,690
Don't fill it yet, don't fill it yet.

125
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,390
This pit can't be filled right now.

126
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,330
Don't fill it, don't fill it.

127
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:19,740
Wait.

128
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,420
Stop filling it.

129
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,090
Where did you come from, young man? What are you doing?

130
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,650
I'm from Qinbei University,

131
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,180
a graduate student in the Archaeology Department.

132
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,510
I'm currently interning at Yang Mausoleum.

133
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,690
There are new discoveries in this pit now,

134
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,760
so it can't be filled yet.

135
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,620
You're working at Yang Mausoleum,

136
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,880
why are you meddling with our Zi Mausoleum?

137
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,420
Do you have the proper documents?

138
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:31,750
I...

139
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,350
I don't have the documents yet.

140
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,790
Then why are you shouting here without documents?

141
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,210
So, for filling this looting pit,

142
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,070
do you have the proper documents?

143
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,650
I am from the government.

144
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,070
The Cultural Heritage Bureau ordered this pit to be filled.

145
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,940
Even if you have the documents,

146
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,130
could you pause for a moment?

147
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,420
We have new discoveries.

148
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,020
Well...

149
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,180
After we apply,

150
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,230
I'll talk to you again, okay?

151
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,820
We'll apply right away.

152
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,770
Listen, you student,

153
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,180
what are you? A nobody like you

154
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,180
talking that big?

155
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,409
Are you my boss?

156
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,980
Why should I listen to you?

157
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,700
If this looting pit isn't filled,

158
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,740
and it gets robbed again, will you take responsibility?

159
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,820
Alright, get out of the way quickly.

160
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,420
There are many people and tools here. Be careful not to get hurt.

161
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:04,780
Okay.

162
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,740
Let's get to it.

163
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,150
I said you can't fill it.

164
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,840
It just can't be filled.

165
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,080
-Fang Kun, don't do anything stupid.
-Don't move!

166
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,210
-Don't do anything rash.
-Don't move.

167
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,300
Call Mr. Zan.

168
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,130
I'll do it, I'll do it.

169
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,890
Alright, alright.

170
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,540
Here's the case.

171
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,380
Can I call our teacher first?

172
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,620
Let's apply first.

173
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,210
Can we wait until the teacher approves it?

174
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,600
It's my own land. What right do you have to stop me from filling it?

175
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,010
If I don't fill it, how am I supposed to farm?

176
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,480
Fill it.

177
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,580
Don't use force.

178
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,880
Why are you using force?

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,620
Never mind, fill it.

180
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,110
No, no, no.

181
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,290
You can't fill it.

182
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,830
Don't fill it. Stop moving.

183
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,520
Give it to me, give it to me.

184
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,740
-Don't move, don't move, don't move.
-Fill it.

185
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,870
-Don't use forece.
-Fill it, quickly.

186
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,970
Fill it, quickly.

187
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,640
Don't interfere with our work.

188
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,570
Get out of the way.

189
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,820
Didn't I tell you not to fill it?

190
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,420
Just wait a moment, will you?

191
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,010
Give me a hand.

192
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,220
Hurry up, hurry up! Come help quickly!

193
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,280
Hurry up, hurry up!

194
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,240
Mr. Zan.

195
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,230
Captain Qi.

196
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,300
Hey, Liu.

197
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,350
This is Professor Zan from Qinbei University.

198
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,180
He's an expert in cultural relics.

199
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,220
These are all his students.

200
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,800
Professor, I've taken some measurements.

201
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,980
The looting pit for the black pottery figurines is 800 meters away from Dou Mausoleum.

202
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,540
And I've found some old photos.

203
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,560
They can prove that

204
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,620
the area around the looting pit for black pottery figurines

205
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,080
was elevated 40 years ago.

206
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,300
It was nearly two meters higher than the surrounding area.

207
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,860
Moreover,

208
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,620
inside that tomb,

209
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,300
there's a scent of cypress wood that might be from the Huangchang Ticou.

210
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,820
Combined with the depth of the looting pit,

211
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,080
it can fully prove that

212
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,620
it's not an outer burial pit.

213
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,550
It must be a tomb,

214
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,790
and it's 100% an imperial tomb.

215
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,799
We can, at this tomb site...

216
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,280
Shut up!

217
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,520
I was wondering

218
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,299
why we couldn't find you.

219
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,480
Turns out

220
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,970
you've come to the site to play gangsters.

221
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,659
You think you're so capable, huh?

222
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,920
Did something happen?

223
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,140
One of them has already confessed.

224
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,020
It's considered a public disturbance.

225
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,880
Who confessed?

226
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,940
How are you handling it?

227
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,950
This time, it almost cost someone's life.

228
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,150
No matter what, they'll have to be detained for a few days.

229
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,240
Mr. Zan.

230
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,770
Alright, Captain Qi.

231
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,510
Professor,

232
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,080
it's not a big deal.

233
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,890
If you vouch for them,

234
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,210
you can take them back.

235
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,350
Well, I'll only vouch for these two students.

236
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,340
The others are not my concern.

237
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,450
Let's go.

238
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,600
No, Professor.

239
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,870
-He knows he was wrong.
-Mr. Zan.

240
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,110
If Fang Kun hadn't

241
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,300
reacted so quickly,

242
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,430
you'd be dead by now.

243
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,230
You would've lost your life.

244
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,490
You think it's joking?

245
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,770
You're more in the right here.

246
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,660
So let's be a bit more understanding, okay?

247
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,210
Okay.

248
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,970
Since you've spoken up, Captain Qi,

249
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,880
and we're all just doing our jobs,

250
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,940
I'll try to be understanding.

251
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,820
Alright, you can go first.

252
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,470
I'll teach him a lesson.

253
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,550
Should I see you out?

254
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:24,910
No need.

255
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,910
I'm close by.

256
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,520
It's just a short walk.

257
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,550
Give him a good talking-to.

258
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,440
Have a seat.

259
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,820
You're quite loyal, aren't you?

260
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,380
Taking all the blame on yourself.

261
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,860
So what?

262
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,660
Just consider it a life experience.

263
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,820
Do you know what a pity it is today?

264
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,040
That looting pit has already been filled in...

265
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,970
You really think I'm praising you?

266
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,550
I finally understand why the professor doesn't like you.

267
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,460
I don't care if he likes me or not.

268
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,710
He'd at least ask about it when he got here.

269
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,910
Why was there a slope?

270
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,780
Who exactly is buried down there?

271
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,970
He didn't even ask about it.

272
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,690
You're a dummy.

273
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,080
Why don't you tell me?

274
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,870
Which emperor do you think is buried in this imperial tomb?

275
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,600
Who else could be buried next to Empress Dowager Bo and Empress Dou?

276
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,490
It might be Emperor Taizong of Han.

277
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,540
Nonsense.

278
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,890
Emperor Taizong of Han's tomb is on Phoenix Mountain.

279
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,230
What is it?

280
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,610
Master Guanshan,

281
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,260
thank you for your trouble.

282
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,850
Look,

283
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,150
one hundred thousand per pit.

284
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,720
This is what I paid two hundred thousand for.

285
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,180
This is for two pits.

286
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,100
Digging up tomb pits

287
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,780
is all a gamble, plain and simple.

288
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,300
Winning or losing depends on luck.

289
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,160
I explained everything clearly to you beforehand.

290
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,820
You didn't listen to my advice.

291
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,210
You insisted on testing your luck.

292
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,370
Losing once might be bad luck,

293
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,400
but losing three times

294
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,210
means you're not skilled enough.

295
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,740
Some people lose ten times.

296
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,060
If you gamble, you must accept the losses.

297
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
Besides, you've only lost twice...

298
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,150
Why are you pulling this stunt?

299
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,190
Let me tell you,

300
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,210
those who live on a slope don't fear steepness.

301
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,300
The knife held to my neck last time

302
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,830
was longer and sharper than yours.

303
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,960
It was quite frightening.

304
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,660
Guang,

305
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,830
I'm putting real money on the pits.

306
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,010
You've deceived the wrong person.

307
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,820
No one is deceiving you.

308
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,450
You've paid your respects to the Earth God

309
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,940
and handed over the offering silver.

310
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,780
Whether you'll make a fortune or not

311
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,580
depends on the Earth God's will.

312
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,300
Moreover,

313
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,160
don't you still have one pit left?

314
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,520
There's still one pit?

315
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,600
Where is it?

316
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,000
What?

317
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,370
Haven't found it?

318
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,660
If I had found it,

319
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,590
why would I invite you here?

320
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,450
It's a pity I wasted these pits on you amateurs.

321
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,040
Let me tell you,

322
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,370
if there's nothing in the third pit either,

323
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,900
even the Jade Emperor won't be able to save you.

324
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,330
Dragon comes ten miles,

325
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,060
its aura rises one zhang.

326
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,090
Dragon comes hundred miles,

327
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,730
its aura rises ten zhang.

328
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,970
Wherever there's a true dragon or a true chamber,

329
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,300
there must be a gathering of tidal waters.

330
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,140
Mountains follow the winding water,

331
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,300
clearly there's a cavity here.

332
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,420
The mountain is surrounded by water.

333
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,820
vegetation flourishes,

334
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,270
wind is concealed, energy gathers,

335
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,440
yin and yang merge.

336
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,620
It does seem like a place with a cavity.

337
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,570
You seem to know your stuff.

338
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,540
You should know that I haven't cheated you.

339
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:20,850
How come...

340
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,780
We wouldn't dare to show off in front of an expert.

341
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,300
Master,

342
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,570
I've heard that when you examine cavities,

343
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,790
it's similar to traditional Chinese medicine.

344
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,850
You practice observation, auscultation, inquiry, and palpation.

345
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,090
How exactly do you apply these methods?

346
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,500
The observation

347
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,700
is about examining feng shui and observing vegetation.

348
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,830
In a feng shui treasure spot like this,

349
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,630
no doubt,

350
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,590
there must be a grand tomb.

351
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,470
What about observing vegetation?

352
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,680
The soil under ancient tombs is all rammed earth.

353
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,360
Crops usually don't grow well there.

354
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,310
You can tell by the color of the grass.

355
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,440
That's really true.

356
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,390
As for sniffing,

357
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,120
that's a much more profound subject.

358
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,330
The tombs of the Qin and Han dynasties

359
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,990
all favored using green clay for preservation.

360
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,210
The Tang and Song dynasties preferred mercury and cinnabar.

361
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,860
These substances all have distinct odors.

362
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,120
Experienced old hands

363
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,530
can sniff the soil

364
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,140
and basically tell

365
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
which dynasty's tomb lies beneath.

366
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,800
This method has another meaning too.

367
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,930
That is, listening.

368
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,100
During thunderstorms, large tombs

369
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,060
can be identified by their echoes.

370
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,890
What about asking?

371
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,170
It's right here.

372
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,680
Guang,

373
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,360
bring them over.

374
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,610
You have a good appetite.

375
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,330
Seems like the disciplinary action didn't affect you much.

376
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,940
It's just probation, isn't it?

377
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,450
It's not like I've been expelled.

378
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,910
What impact could it have?

379
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,390
So this time you'll finally write a proper self-criticism, right?

380
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
Write it for whom?

381
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,200
For whom?

382
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,260
Who do you think you should write it for?

383
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,820
He already said he doesn't consider me his student anymore.

384
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,960
What kind of self-criticism could I possibly write for him?

385
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,540
With that time,

386
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,840
I might as well write a love letter

387
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,590
to some pretty classmate or something.

388
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,190
Oh, right.

389
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,190
I've been busy looking for a new supervisor lately.

390
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,170
You must be really busy then.

391
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,190
I won't bother you anymore.

392
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,440
I was going to invite you to go to the site with us.

393
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,100
But seeing how busy you are,

394
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,660
I can only wish you from the site

395
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,390
to find a good supervisor soon.

396
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,430
Luo Qing, Luo Qing, Luo Qing!

397
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,069
Luo Qing, what are you going to do on the site?

398
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,329
None of your business.

399
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,950
There's a Du Mausoleum Village next to Yin Village.

400
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,800
Mr. Zan wants us to figure out

401
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,540
what the relationship is

402
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,480
between this Du Mausoleum Village and Du Mausoleum.

403
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,760
Neighboring village?

404
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,690
Du Mausoleum Village.

405
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,700
It's more than 20 kilometers from Du Mausoleum, right?

406
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,710
What's the point of investigating this?

407
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,780
Otherwise, why would it be called Du Mausoleum Village?

408
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,150
That's a good question. Why is it called Du Mausoleum Village?

409
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,670
So you're checking local chronicles because of this?

410
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,390
Obviously.

411
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,300
So that's also why you came to the site?

412
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,630
Weren't you the one always

413
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,510
wanting to figure out what's going on in the site?

414
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,380
Mr. Zan said

415
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,060
that during this holiday,

416
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,870
he wants to take us on a field survey of this area.

417
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,710
That sounds great!

418
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,270
-Right.
-It's a whole holiday.

419
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,020
If you're doing a survey,

420
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,760
you should be investigating near the looting pit, right?

421
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,560
What's the use of investigating

422
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,370
the relationship between Du Mausoleum and Du Mausoleum Village?

423
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,500
How is it not useful?

424
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
Then tell me, what's the use?

425
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,900
You tell me.

426
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,260
Look,

427
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,800
neither of you can explain its usefulness.

428
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,370
I think he's just got nothing better to do.

429
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,170
-What are you talking about?
-That looting pit...

430
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,670
Such a small matter

431
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,520
and you can't even figure it out.

432
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,280
How can you talk about field surveys?

433
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,140
Strange thing.

434
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,080
You really are a blabbermouth.

435
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,140
Can't you just listen for once?

436
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,650
Archaeology is part of historical science.

437
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,120
We need to collect local information first

438
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,130
before we can plan the specific route.

439
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,060
You've forgotten even the basics.

440
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,140
How did all your studying go to waste?

441
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,360
It's about investigating

442
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,420
the relationship between Du Mausoleum and Du Mausoleum Village, right?

443
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,080
Within a day.

444
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,210
I'll figure it out for you.

445
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,210
Don't make a fuss.

446
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,560
Within one day?

447
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,000
Why are you stunned?

448
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,730
You think you're so capable?

449
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,730
You sure can brag.

450
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,410
How's it going?

451
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,920
Nothing.

452
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,140
Nothing.

453
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,650
The tomb is big.

454
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,210
Of course it takes longer to dig.

455
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,560
Keep digging.

456
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,340
What are you doing?

457
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,320
What are you doing?

458
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,240
What am I doing?

459
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,360
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

460
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,340
I'll tell you right now.

461
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,690
What are you doing?

462
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,890
You want to use force?

463
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,080
What are you doing?

464
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,140
What are you doing?

465
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,900
Why are you being so forceful?

466
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,770
Aren't you afraid of disturbing the Earth God?

467
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,290
I'll give you ten more minutes.

468
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,540
If there's still nothing down there,

469
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,510
I'll blow you to bits as an offering to the Earth God.

470
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,000
The tomb that I identified,

471
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,130
will be fine.

472
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,500
How is it? Found anything?

473
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:12,800
Nothing.

474
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,040
What?

475
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,720
Nothing.

476
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,720
Keep digging!

477
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,690
Dig on.

478
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,770
You keep saying "keep digging,"

479
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,330
how could nothing be found?

480
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
It's only been a while.

481
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,140
Why did you really light it?

482
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,920
What?

483
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,320
Are you sure?

484
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,480
It's impossible there's nothing.

485
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,880
There must be something.

486
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,530
You...

487
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,420
It's the joint tomb of the Countess of Le'an and her husband.

488
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,240
Absolutely no one has touched it.

489
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,420
Absolutely no one has touched it.

490
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,720
What did you just say?

491
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,890
What Countess of Le'an?

492
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,210
You use this fake crap

493
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,770
to scare women?

494
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,350
I wasn't raised to be scared easily.

495
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,380
Guang, switch to the real ones.

496
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,620
Come back, come back.

497
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,120
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

498
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,090
The tomb owner

499
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,400
is the granddaughter of Emperor Gaozu of Tang.

500
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,710
She married a military officer.

501
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,520
Her title was Countess of Le'an.

502
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,650
She was almost like a princess.

503
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,840
By observation, auscultation, interrogation, and palpation,

504
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,750
you can even figure out whose tomb this is?

505
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,610
Those're nonsense.

506
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,930
If I don't talk it up a bit,

507
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,000
who would pay me for pits at such a high price?

508
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,620
In the end, it's all about reading more,

509
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,370
asking around, and observing carefully.

510
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,090
Take this pit as an example.

511
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,260
I first learned about this person from books,

512
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,700
and figured they were buried somewhere around here.

513
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,070
Afraid of not being accurate,

514
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,800
I even disguised myself as a fortune-telling blind man

515
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,200
and wandered around here for a month or two.

516
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,800
Finally, I found out

517
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,260
that crops haven't grown well here for many years,

518
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,920
and they can only plant trees.

519
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,300
Some old men said

520
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,530
that when they played here as children,

521
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,160
they found pottery figurines.

522
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,170
So it's almost certain.

523
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I understand now.

524
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,430
It is indeed observation, auscultation, interrogation, and palpation.

525
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,090
Read books, observe the land,

526
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,330
and ask the locals.

527
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,810
Palpation is also a skill.

528
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,140
Even if you've located the ancient tomb,

529
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,080
how do you know

530
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,410
what the layout is?

531
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,320
How do you dig the hole

532
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,200
to reach the burial chamber as quickly as possible?

533
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,910
Simply put, it's about understanding the structure of tombs from different dynasties,

534
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,440
figuring out what kind of tomb belongs to what kind of person,

535
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,980
so you can dig straight into the burial chamber.

536
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,970
That's right.

537
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,280
You're really smart.

538
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,520
You catch on quickly.

539
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,870
Ultimately,

540
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,180
it's just like those archaeologists.

541
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,270
Study a lot of historical documents...

542
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,750
-Guang.
-Do field investigation.

543
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,380
Ask them

544
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,680
how many wall niches they've passed.

545
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,280
How many wall niches?

546
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,890
We've passed the third niche,

547
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,960
but still nothing?

548
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,200
Three wall niches.

549
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,300
Keep digging.

550
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,310
Keep digging.

551
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,240
I found something.

552
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,170
There's a poem.

553
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,070
"The Ballad of Buying Flowers."

554
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,730
The author is this Liu Yanshi.

555
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,860
Have you heard of him?

556
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,210
No.

557
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,890
Let me read it to you.

558
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:21,940
Well.

559
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,000
"The people of Du Mausoleum Village do not farm.

560
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,720
They enter valleys, cross streams, and climb walls.

561
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,380
Every time they reach South Mountain in spring,

562
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,840
they go to the marquis's house for gold and jade.

563
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,350
Delicate and beautiful, the spring scene dawns,

564
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,520
where will the woodsmen move them to?"

565
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,450
Finally found one

566
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,130
poem that mentions Du Mausoleum Village.

567
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,410
This must be about Du Mausoleum Village.

568
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,390
We should refer to the map of Du Mausoleum Village.

569
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,320
Open it and take a look.

570
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,150
Check the south of Du Mausoleum Village.

571
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,670
Is there a mountain?

572
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,410
Any rivers?

573
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,180
Cliffs or steep slopes, anything like that?

574
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,540
Could it be referring to Liyu Gully?

575
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,670
Liyu Gully?

576
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,720
Let's see.

577
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Liyu Gully, to the south.

578
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,090
Is there?

579
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,180
It's right there in the south.

580
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,150
You know a lot.

581
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,350
Let's check Liu Yanshi next.

582
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,350
Has he been to Du Mausoleum Village?

583
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,070
I only borrowed local chronicles.

584
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,000
I didn't borrow Liu Yanshi's book.

585
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,370
And it's getting late.

586
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,330
Where can we find the books?

587
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,080
Don't pull me.

588
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,350
Bro.

589
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,030
Bro.

590
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,320
I'll give you back the 300,000.

591
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,830
Spare my life.

592
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,730
That's the money I paid for the pit. No need to return it.

593
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,370
I'll just consider it as buying a retirement insurance.

594
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,050
I said, you don't need to return it.

595
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,510
Alright.

596
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,910
Thank you.

597
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,910
Then I'll push my luck.

598
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,640
Can I ask you for one more favor?

599
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,880
What is it? Get up and tell me.

600
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,350
I still need to make a living in this business for the rest of my life.

601
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,820
Can you ask your men

602
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,970
to keep today's events to themselves?

603
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,400
Leave me a way out, will you?

604
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,430
What happened today?

605
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,840
Do you remember?

606
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,940
I don't know, I don't know.

607
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,550
Master, please get up.

608
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,700
Once we're out of this forest,

609
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,890
we've never met.

610
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,820
I absolutely won't do anything to cut off someone's livelihood,

611
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,420
especially not a scholar's.

612
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,480
You're a decent person.

613
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,020
You're straightforward.

614
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,360
And smart.

615
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,240
If you don't mind,

616
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,240
you can become my disciple.

617
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,280
I'll teach you how to read burial sites.

618
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,410
I've already learned what I needed to.

619
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,140
If you really want to teach me, just give me a few books.

620
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,290
No problem.

621
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,060
I can give you all my books.

622
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,120
A few days ago,

623
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,490
you just turned the village committee upside down.

624
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,930
Why are you here again?

625
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:25,800
[Du Mausoleum Village Committee]

626
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,260
Lingzhi mushrooms don't grow in dung heaps.

627
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
The village committee isn't a library either.

628
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,310
Why do you need these?

629
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,480
We're working on a very important research project.

630
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,150
It's related to Du Mausoleum Village.

631
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,080
In this village,

632
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,620
with one shout,

633
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,210
you can be heard from one end to the other.

634
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,590
It's a small village.

635
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,100
What's there to study?

636
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:44,750
Uncle,

637
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,040
there's something you don't know.

638
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,950
Although this village is small,

639
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,760
its origins are not insignificant.

640
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,430
Isn't its name Du Mausoleum Village?

641
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,430
This Du Mausoleum

642
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,350
is the tomb of Emperor Xuan of Han.

643
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,610
But looking at the map,

644
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,520
our village is next to the wife of Emperor Taizong of Han,

645
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,910
Empress Dou's tomb.

646
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,590
It's more than 20 kilometers away from Du Mausoleum.

647
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,910
If we can figure out the connection between them,

648
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,480
we might be able to rewrite history.

649
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,740
So our research project is to understand

650
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,110
what relationship this Du Mausoleum

651
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,280
has with Du Mausoleum Village.

652
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,720
Du Mausoleum Village and Du Mausoleum.

653
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,110
What relationship could they have?

654
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,590
They have no relationship at all.

655
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,350
You kids got one thing right though.

656
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,720
Our village is next to Empress Dou's tomb.

657
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,800
Actually, it used to be called Dou Mausoleum Village.

658
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,600
Our pronunciation isn't clear,

659
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,150
We can't distinguish between "Dou" and "Du".

660
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,880
Listen to me.

661
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,970
Du Fu, Li Bai,

662
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,840
some people even think it's "Tofu Li Bai".

663
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,700
As time went on,

664
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,050
somehow it became Du Mausoleum Village.

665
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,110
Du.

666
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,280
Dou.

667
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,070
Where did you all go so early in the morning?

668
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,680
Uncle Youliang.

669
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,080
Uncle.

670
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,040
Go eat.

671
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,570
Auntie.

672
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,730
You're back.

673
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,330
Come on, hurry up, let's eat.

674
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,220
Mr. Zan, you're really enjoying your meal.

675
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,320
Sit there, quickly.

676
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,870
Xiaoman.

677
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,000
Grab the bowls, quick.

678
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,590
Coming.

679
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,000
I've been sleeping well these days,

680
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
so naturally, the food tastes good.

681
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,560
We don't have much appetite.

682
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,760
We can't sleep at all.

683
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,520
I didn't ask you to come.

684
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,060
So, did you find the answer?

685
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,770
Yes, we did.

686
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,320
This Du Mausoleum Village has nothing to do with Du Mausoleum.

687
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,670
It's actually next to Dou Mausoleum.

688
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,150
It used to be called Dou Mausoleum Village.

689
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,870
The locals don't distinguish between "Du" and "Dou".

690
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,480
That's why it became known as Du Mausoleum Village.

691
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,940
Not bad.

692
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,580
If it had taken any longer, some people would have challenged me for nothing.

693
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,910
So you knew the answer all along, didn't you?

694
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,950
Is there a problem with the person who sets the question knowing the answer?

695
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,670
Mr. Zan,

696
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,430
just because of a homophone,

697
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,510
we looked through so many useless books.

698
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,710
We spent so much time.

699
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,280
Wouldn't it have been better to spend that time surveying a few more miles?

700
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,190
I just asked you to find the answer.

701
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,190
Did I tell you to look through books?

702
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,700
Strange thing.

703
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,530
It's the first time I've heard

704
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,390
that looking through books is a waste of time.

705
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,240
Sir,

706
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,610
what are we doing here?

707
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,850
It's so far from the black pottery figurine looting pit.

708
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,040
Is this the place

709
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,290
where you excavated 30 years ago?

710
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,080
That's right.

711
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,800
I heard that back then,

712
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,600
to the west of Empress Dowager Bo's mausoleum,

713
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,330
you discovered 20 burial pits.

714
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,280
Among the unearthed burial objects, there were many animal bones,

715
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,810
including rhinoceros and giant panda bones.

716
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,520
It's not surprising to have pandas in our Qinchuan area,

717
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,950
but how could there be rhinoceroses?

718
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,760
I remember

719
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,390
The book "The 11 Western Han Mausoleums"

720
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,590
by Mr. Liu Qingzhu and Ms. Li Yufang mentions

721
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,620
that the rhinoceros buried in South Mausoleum belonged to

722
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,660
what's called a Javan rhinoceros.

723
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,670
It was probably a tribute from

724
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,300
the rulers of Vietnam to the Han Emperor.

725
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,750
Yes, yes, yes.

726
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,180
I heard it was the first time

727
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,940
that rhinoceroses and pandas were found as burial objects.

728
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,800
That's right.

729
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,610
But you probably don't know

730
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,460
that back then, because of me,

731
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,690
this piece of history was almost rewritten.

732
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,350
It almost led to a big mistake.

733
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,050
I was in my twenties that year,

734
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,910
about the same age as you are now.

735
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,440
It was also my first time participating

736
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
in such a major excavation project.

737
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,560
Just like you,

738
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,350
I was full of enthusiasm

739
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,840
and unquestioning confidence.

740
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,670
Mr. He, any new discoveries?

741
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,300
Not yet.

742
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,760
Zan.

743
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,120
Come here.

744
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,650
What do you think this looks like?

745
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
Could this be a cow bone?

746
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,170
Hurry back to town.

747
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,450
Call the school

748
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,590
and reach Mr. Yang, a paleontologist

749
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,250
from the geology department.

750
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,460
Who is this?

751
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,690
This isn't Mr. Yang.

752
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,840
Mr. Yang took some students

753
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,080
to Guyue for a survey.

754
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,330
I couldn't find him.

755
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,320
So I went to the town's middle school

756
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,920
and found a biology teacher.

757
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,730
I thought, it's just a cow bone,

758
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,320
surely a biology teacher can identify it.

759
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:23,800
Zan.

760
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,710
Come here.

761
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,050
This skeleton isn't fully preserved,

762
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,710
but judging from the structure,

763
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,660
it should be a big wild cow.

764
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,460
After I recorded what Mr. Wu said,

765
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,840
I wrote it in the archaeological report.

766
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,440
When Mr. Yang heard about it,

767
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,180
he became very interested

768
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,770
and rushed back from Guyue specifically to examine it.

769
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,380
That's when we discovered it was a rhinoceros bone.

770
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,040
Although none of the teachers in the archaeological team

771
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,190
criticized me,

772
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,600
I felt terrible inside.

773
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,720
I ran to the site and cried my heart out.

774
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,720
At that moment, I wished

775
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,449
I could just bash my head in and die.

776
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,520
It was because of my presumption

777
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,199
that I almost ruined a piece of history

778
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
and destroyed the rhinoceros bone.

779
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,239
I almost

780
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,639
became a sinner against history.

781
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,949
But

782
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,980
the rhinoceros horn is so big.

783
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,159
How could it be wrong with the bones of the cow?

784
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,219
Part of the skeleton was missing at the time,

785
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,389
so I just assumed it was a cow.

786
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,210
After we confirmed it was a rhinoceros bone,

787
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,610
we searched the pit again

788
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,770
and finally found the rhinoceros horn.

789
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,449
I'm telling you about this embarrassing incident today

790
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,750
to let you know that

791
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,790
once you've made a subjective judgment,

792
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,850
no matter how much evidence there is,

793
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,679
you'll be blind to it.

794
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,390
Now I finally understand

795
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,000
why you asked us to look into

796
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,950
the relationship between Du Mausoleum and Du Mausoleum Village.

797
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,430
Because when we first started,

798
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,960
as soon as we got this topic,

799
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,490
we just assumed

800
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,550
there must be a historical connection between them.

801
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,430
We started looking for local chronicles and historical texts without thinking.

802
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,490
It's because we had preconceptions.

803
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,600
If it weren't for these preconceptions,

804
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,800
it wouldn't have been hard to discover it was due to dialect.

805
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
Even if we had asked Xiaoman

806
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,450
or asked the locals,

807
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,160
we could have found the answer.

808
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,320
Being too preconceived,

809
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,240
too presumptuous,

810
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,990
can make you miss the forest for the trees

811
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,050
and overlook the truth of the matter.

812
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,160
Many people now think

813
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,050
archaeology is useless.

814
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,490
But I believe

815
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,280
archaeology

816
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,580
can make a nation's history

817
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,470
clearer and more transparent.

818
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,820
Archaeological discoveries

819
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,660
can fill in some of the gaps

820
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,540
in historical records and texts.

821
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,280
It pieces together and restores

822
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,880
every footprint of history,

823
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,640
presenting the full picture of Chinese civilization's development

824
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
to everyone

825
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,400
and to the world.

826
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,510
The so-called "knocking on the earth to supplement history"

827
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,910
is the meaning of our archaeological work.

828
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,320
Every word spoken by an archaeologist,

829
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,550
every judgment made,

830
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,450
could potentially affect

831
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,240
the accuracy of a period of history and civilization.

832
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,920
Therefore,

833
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,430
we must be extremely cautious,

834
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,830
never make assumptions,

835
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,920
and never jump to conclusions lightly.

836
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,690
Fang Kun,

837
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,940
now try to guess again,

838
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,750
whose tomb this might be.

839
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,630
Without concrete evidence,

840
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,910
I dare not make wild guesses either.

841
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,750
Alright, our trip to this site hasn't been in vain.

842
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,850
Have you heard?

843
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,430
Mu Jianhui dug a big one.

844
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,200
Why is he so lucky?

845
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,390
It's truly fate.

846
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,570
There's no use in overthinking it.

847
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,130
It's infuriating.

848
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,030
That Mu fellow is making a monkey out of us.

849
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,490
We're being sold out and even counting the money for him,

850
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,280
not even getting a taste of the sweet,

851
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,200
and still getting beaten on top of it.

852
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,990
This Mu Jianhui,

853
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,190
he could crawl out even if buried alive.

854
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,170
If I had known he could crawl out back then,

855
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,630
I would have beaten the life out of him first.

856
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
I don't know what Sheng is thinking,

857
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,440
now he's in bed with that guy again.

858
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,230
After all, they're family.

859
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,990
Blood is thicker than water.

860
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,070
Now we're

861
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,230
getting soaked from the top

862
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,830
and dragged from the bottom,

863
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,280
can't catch a break either way.

864
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,140
So what do we do?

865
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,200
Even the Gunner has been lured away.

866
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,680
We can't catch fish on the mountain,

867
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,200
nor can we chop wood in the water.

868
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,860
Might as well starve to death.

869
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,730
Why did you stop?

870
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,200
Bro,

871
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,730
that feng shui tomb,

872
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,280
isn't it near where we dug the looting pit?

873
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,640
If we want to turn things around,

874
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,350
we still need to rely on a big pit.

875
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:48,870
Bro,

876
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,970
wherever you point your flag,

877
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,500
that's where we'll charge.

878
00:38:53,580 --> 00:39:03,820
[Self-criticism]

879
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,440
What's up?

880
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,560
Writing a self-criticism?

881
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,290
What self-criticism?

882
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,490
Look at that guy snoring.

883
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,370
How can I sleep?

884
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,150
I'm just reading a book here.

885
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,110
Pretending.

886
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,940
Keep pretending.

887
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
Mr. Zan is doing all this for you.

888
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,410
You always think he doesn't like you.

889
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,460
We can all see

890
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,740
he values you the most.

891
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,650
Because he has high hopes for you,

892
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,550
that's why he's strictest with you.

893
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,200
If he hadn't pleaded for you,

894
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,390
you would have been expelled already.

895
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,990
Would you even be able to read books here?

896
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,810
Think about it carefully.

897
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,990
Why, not asleep yet?

898
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,580
Can't sleep.

899
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,310
Just exercising here for a bit.

900
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,160
Do you need something from me?

901
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,560
No, no, nothing.

902
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,510
You're up so late because...

903
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,370
Can't sleep.

904
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,780
Going for a walk.

905
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,600
Then can we go together?

906
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,000
Let's go.

907
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,890
You know, for us field archaeologists,

908
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,970
what's the most important thing?

909
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,400
The knowledge in our heads.

910
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,320
No matter how much knowledge you have,

911
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,920
if you don't have a good body,

912
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,880
you won't even make it to the excavation site.

913
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,950
So from a young age,

914
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,550
I started exercising.

915
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,410
I told myself,

916
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,330
if I can't surpass others in academic achievements,

917
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,930
I'll compete with them on who lives longer.

918
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,870
Use time to overcome talent.

919
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,780
Sir, after that mistake you made,

920
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,200
later...

921
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:58,910
You...

922
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,760
After returning from the site that time,

923
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,190
I couldn't hold my head up.

924
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,770
It felt like there was a millstone weighing on my heart.

925
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,530
I couldn't breathe for years.

926
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,230
As it happened, I had a classmate

927
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,810
who had a project in Yusai.

928
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,830
He advised me to put Qin and Han archaeology aside for a while

929
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,940
and go there to clear my mind.

930
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,830
So I went.

931
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,010
To Yusai?

932
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,140
Yes.

933
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,460
When I got there,

934
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,700
it was full of ravines and gullies.

935
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,720
Bare mountains

936
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,710
and dry riverbeds everywhere,

937
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,460
and endless Gobi desert.

938
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,750
It was very harsh.

939
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,590
But when I got there,

940
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,790
for the first time, I felt relieved.

941
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:50,870
W-why?

942
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,530
Because that place is remote.

943
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,310
No one knew me there,

944
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,150
and no one knew what mistakes I had made.

945
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,650
So as soon as I arrived,

946
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,020
I stayed.
