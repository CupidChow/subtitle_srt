prove that the empty tomb

has significant historical,

considered as an ancient tomb.

Everyone hopes you can uphold justice.

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,000
The law is justice.

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,040
The criminal law clearly states that

99
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,830
if a person looted ancient cultural sites

100
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,920

historical, artistic

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,070
and scientific value,

102
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,630
he should be punished accordingly.

103
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,030
Since it's an empty tomb,

104
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,920
which law do you want me to apply?

105
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,390
We can't just stick rigidly
to the description of law.

106
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,830
If you only stick rigidly to
the description of law,

107
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,800
those tomb raiders will be at large.

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
If we can't convict the tomb raiders,

109
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,220
it only shows your incompetence.

110
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,330
Your investigation isn't thorough.

111
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,360
You haven't figured out
all the facts of the crime.

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,490
What else can you say about this?

113
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:48,950
Well...

114
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Prosecutor Song,

115
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,330
if you say it like that,

116
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,190
you aren't quite familiar
with the Lv Family Tomb,

117
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,870
are you?

118
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,160
During the Northern Song Dynasty,

119
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,620
the Lv family's ancestor
was called Lv Tong.

120
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,600
He was going to be
an official in Chang'an.

121
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,130
When he passed by Mi County,

122
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,600
he took a look and found that

123
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,380
it was so beautiful there.

124
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,090
Then he settled there
with his whole family.

125
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,390
Lv Tong

126
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,430

named Lv Fen.

128
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,910
Lv Fen had six sons.

129
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,000
His second son was called Lv Dafang,

130
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,390
who became the prime minister
under Emperor Zhezong.

131
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,360
His fourth son

132
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,080
was called Lv Dalin.

133
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,000
He was a favorite student of
Zhang Zai, the founder

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,120
of our Guanzhong School of Thought.

135
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,290
He was an expert in epigraphy.

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,600

137
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
he's the forefather of our

you were taking over this case,

155
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,120
they were all happy,

156
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,590
and they all cheered.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,190
"The wife of our head is
helping us with the case."

158
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,050
"It'll surely be steady,
accurate and efficient."

159

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,340
we won't have to suffer anymore."

161
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,370
Stop talking nonsense.

162

Now that I've rejected the case file,
would they accept my decision?

163

I wonder what they have
said about me behind my back.

164
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,560
It was not like that.

165

166
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,510

167
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,390
Absolutely not.

168
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,560

169
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,480

170

now that you've rejected the case file,

182
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,870

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,310
Fine.

186
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,750
Then take off your clothes.

187
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,920
Ask everyone in your team
to take off their clothes.

188
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,190
I'll take them to court by that time.

189
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,480
If the chief judge asks me

190
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,600
how to prove it's an empty tomb,

191
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll tell him to smell the clothes.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,430
How's that?

193
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,120
Don't play dumb.

194
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,830
Why are you so stubborn?

195
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,800
The law is the law,

196
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,090
and personal favors are personal favors.

197
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,100
Don't mix them up.

198
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,530
You're just like the impartial Judge Bao.

199
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,820
We need to protect ancient tombs,
but we also need to build the subway.

200
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,670
Under the ground of Qinchuan,
there are tombs everywhere.

201
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,670
Even ten Archaeology Institutes
wouldn't be enough.

202
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,680
Don't blame me.

203
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
If you blame me...

204
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,200
If you want to blame someone,
blame those ancient emperors.

205
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,910
Tell them

206
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,390
not to be buried here.

207
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,480
It would make things easier for all of us,

208
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,210
wouldn't it?

209
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes. I know.

210
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,340
I'll reassign people.

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,600
One month.

212
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,390
At least one month.

213
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,520
Okay. Alright.

214
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,360
I got it.

215
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,910
That's it.

216
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,510
Goodbye.

217
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,410
Building this subway is
making me so exhausted.

218
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,310
You know what?

219
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,520
There's an ancient tomb complex
under the starting point of Line 2.

220
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,120
Don't you know what kind
of place Qinchuan is?

221
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,580
Why have they insisted on
building a subway?

222
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
We need economic development, too.

223
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
This subway has been planned for 13 years.

224
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,240
It's not easy for our Qinchuan.

225
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,390
It's not only about the subway

226
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,630
but also all kinds of infrastructure.

227
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,890
They call me every day.

228
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,840
To be honest,

229
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,550
some have really been on
the waiting list for three years.

230
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,360
And that place, too.

231
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,760
You...

232
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,200
The key is that it's useless
to ask for my help,

233
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,730
isn't it?

234
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,080
Let's not talk about this anymore.

235
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,740
Captain Qi,

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,400
why are you here to see me?

237
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,820
It's about the tomb-raiding
case in Lvjia Village.

238
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,390
Didn't we finish the on-site
investigation of a looting pit there?

239
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,720
The raiders can't be convicted
as it's an empty tomb.

240
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,180
It's a rescue excavation.

241
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
I'm here to ask about the situation.

242
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,150
If you want to discuss this with me,

243
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,950
you're really

244
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,200
talking to the wrong person.

245
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,780
Although we are involved,

246
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,790
the main participants are
from the provincial level.

247
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,750
Luo Qing is there.

248
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,240
She's more familiar with
many of the situations.

249
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm not asking for details.

250
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,400
I just want to know the progress.

251
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,050
It's hard to say.

252
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,910
Look. Well...

253
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,840
Get back to work.

254
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,480
Let me tell you.

255
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,000
I know it's hard to say.

256
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,960
Is anyone there?

257
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,080
Dacang?

258
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,960
Ms. Luo Qing.

259
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,350
What brings you here?

260
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,450
Are you alone here?

261
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,680
They've all gone out.

262
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,150
I...

263
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm here to visit you.

264
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,730
Please come in.

265
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,030
Is it appropriate for me
to enter your private room?

266
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,670
It's fine.

267
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,640
Don't stand on ceremony.

268
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,030
Let me get you some water.

269
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,150
Don't bother. I won't drink.

270
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,680
I just want to ask something.

271
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,810
When will our excavation work begin?

272
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,760
Director Zhang just called me.

273
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,970
You want to ask about that empty tomb?

274
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,480
He even complained first, huh?

275
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Let me tell you about this Director Zhang.

276
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
Every time I ask him something,

277
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,790
he always hesitates and mumbles.

278
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,270
Do you know what his
contact name is in my phone?

279
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,870
What is it?

280
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,010
It's Hard To Say.

281
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,520
That's his catchphrase.

282
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,440
Your team is in place now, right?

283
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,390
The excavation approval
has also come through.

284
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,630
The banquet tables are all set up.

285
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,890
Why haven't you stir-fried the food yet?

286
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,750
Archaeological work

287
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,550
is not as simple as you might think.

288
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,080
We indeed need to follow
the procedures step by step.

289
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,200
Before the formal excavation,

290
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,870
we need to complete all the paperwork.

291
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,600
Yes, yes, yes.

292
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,150
Your work is so troublesome.

293
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,210
I understand that.

294
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,870
But I think your researches into

295
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,360
books and documents

296
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,360
have been done thoroughly.

297
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,550
It's enough. Just start the excavation.

298
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,910
If it were just about understanding
the information in books,

299
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,970
that would be easy.

300
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,120
A lot of information
related to the Lv family

301
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,670
needs to be gathered through
interviews and investigations.

302
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,150
It's just like how you guys

303
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,630
investigate the social relationships

304
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,360
of suspects.

305
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,840
We need to ask the villagers

306
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,480
and visit the households one by one.

307
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,280
That's right.

308
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,030
Have you asked Lv Fugui?

309
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,750
Speaking of Lv Fugui,

310
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,550
we've visited him three times,
but we failed each time.

311
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,150
No matter what we asked him,
he only said these three words.

312
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,790
"I don't know."

313
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,190
He was talking nonsense.

314
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,510
His family has been
tomb keepers for generations.

315
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,080
He's well aware of everything
about the Lv family.

316
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,270
How could he not know?

317
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,600
Why don't you go with me?

318
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,000
You can act as a middleman

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,060
to see if we can make him talk about it.

320
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,440
Fugui, we've been looking for you.

321
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Well, Fugui.

322
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,270
There's something we'd like to...

323
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,270
Calm down.

324
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,960
What are you doing?

325
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,500
What are you doing?

326
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,320
Why are you trying to run away?

327
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,850
Alright. Just take me away.

328
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,910
I failed to protect the ancestors'
tombs, so I'm guilty.

329
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,390
I can't stay in the village anymore.

330
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,390
Just put me in jail.

331
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,240
Come on! Handcuff me!

332
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Why do you want me to catch you again?

333
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,740
Didn't I tell you that

334
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,030
Wang Taiping's tomb raiding
had nothing to do with you?

335
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,240
Why don't you understand?

336
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,120
Fugui isn't referring to Wang Taiping.

337
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,780
He means us.

338
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,550
He thinks that our archaeological team

339
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,550
has ruined their ancestors' tombs.

340
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,900
Is that really what you think?

341
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,480
If that's really what you think,
you're wrong.

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,150
Fugui.

343
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,480
You're a cultural relic conservator
and a role model.

344
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Do I really need to teach you about this?

345
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,410
W-What? You can't say it like that.

346
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,650
If the government wants to dig up graves,

347
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,670
I can't stop that.

348
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,240
But I can't be your vanguard.

349
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,150
Leading you guys to open
my ancestors' coffins

350
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,720
is not something I can do.

351
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,630
A house can't be unsteady,
and a person can't forget his roots.

352
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,360
My family

353
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,000
has been guarding tombs for generations.

354
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can't let people point at

355
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,730
the back of my back and curse me.

356
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,720
Fugui, our archaeology work isn't
about digging up your graves.

357
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
It's not tomb raiding, either.

358
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,870
The Lv Family Tomb has been damaged.

359
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,750
We need to take measures to protect it.

360
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,200
That is called rescue excavation.

361
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,750
Look. It's been robbed twice.

362
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,240
This news has been spread widely.

363
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
What if someone else wants to rob it?

364
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,910
Relying on just a few cultural relic
protection volunteers like you

365
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,550
won't be enough to control it.

366
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,750
Just hear how clearly she explained it.

367
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,800
Moreover,

368
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,870
right now,

369
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,390
we can't convict the tomb raiders.

370
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,080
How can we convict them
without excavation?

371
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,730
Alright.

372
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,750
No matter how much you say,

373
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,210
I have nothing to tell you.

374
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,490
For over a thousand years,

375
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,450
the Lv family has branched out.

376
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,030
The descendants are spread
all over the world.

377
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,910
Every year, there are people who come back

378
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,120
to seek their roots and pay
respects to their ancestors.

379
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,320
If the tombs are dug up,

380
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,750
won't their roots be removed?

381
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,410
Who will they pay respects to?

382
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,630
To put it bluntly,

383
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,270
when I die,

384
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,860
my ancestors won't even let me be buried.

385
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,140
Step aside!

386
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,900
Please.

387
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,670
What?

388
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,450
Where did you come from?

389
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,290
Ms. Luo, how come you look unhappy?

390
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm very worried.

391
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,950
What's wrong?

392
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,280
I went to see Fugui during the daytime.

393
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,530
I was turned away again.

394
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,260
I wanted him to provide us with some help.

395
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,460
It looks like there's no hope now.

396
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,550
I can understand.

397
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,550
To think from their perspectives,

398
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,410
if I were a member of their family,

399
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,840
I probably wouldn't want to help
the archaeological team, either.

400
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,300
What you said makes sense.

401
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,080
Even if this matter

402
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,010
had happened to one of us
in the archaeological team,

403
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,150
it would probably be quite
difficult to come up with

404
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,350
a very good solution.

405
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,480
I don't know if you've
heard of this story before.

406
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,870
A few years ago in Xiangzhou,

407
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,330
there was a tomb-raiding case.

408
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,410
A Qing Dynasty tomb was destroyed.

409
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
Halfway through the excavation,

410
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,170
they found the tomb owner's
epitaph on the tomb door.

411
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,120
The epitaph recorded that the tomb owner

412
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,380
was an official from the Kangxi period
of the Qing Dynasty.

413
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,030
When the archaeological team captain
saw the name of the tomb owner,

414
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,490
he was stunned on the spot.

415
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,910
Was the tomb owner his own ancestor?

416
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,510
At first,

417
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,150
the archaeological team captain
wasn't quite sure.

418
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,600
Later,

419
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,200
he discovered another

420
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,730
epitaph recording the life
of the tomb owner.

421
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,840
After seeing the name of the tomb owner,

422
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,000
he finally confirmed that

423
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,390
this archaeological team captain

424
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,790
was the twelfth-generation
descendant of the tomb owner.

425
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,030
He was excavating his ancestor's tomb.

426
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,680
At that time, he was very troubled.

427
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,310
Why?

428
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,030
To excavate a Qing Dynasty tomb,

429
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,829
they needed to respect
the wishes of the descendants.

430
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,109
The Archaeology Institute said
whether to continue the excavation

431
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,170
depended on the captain's attitude.

432
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,160
So, was the excavation suspended later?

433
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,960
No, it wasn't.

434
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,680
The Archaeology Institute and the captain

435
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,640
came up with a very good

436
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,200
solution to reach a compromise.

437
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
What solution was it?

438
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,050
What are you two chatting about up there?

439
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,930
Luo Qing.

440
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,590
You haven't been sleeping well these days.

441
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,520
Just rest early.

442
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,550
Don't you still have something to do
early tomorrow morning?

443
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,640
If you haven't slept well, rest early.

444
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
You have things to do
early tomorrow morning.

445
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,890
I'm leaving.

446
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,000
You haven't finished telling the story.

447
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,070
What solution did they figure out later?

448
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,510
If you want to know what happened next,
stay tuned for the next episode.

449
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,920
I'm leaving.

450
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,320
You...

451
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,970
Fang Kun.

452
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,200
It's rare for us to have a consensus.

453
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,110
You're not the only good man in this world

454
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,370
who cares about women.

455
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,130
Right, Luo Qing?

456
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,530
You need to rest early.

457
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,400
Ancestors above,

458
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,240
I, your unfilial descendant Lv Fugui,

459
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,790
am here to beg for your forgiveness.

460
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,590
My lineage

461
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,310
has guarded tombs for generations.

462
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,440
During the Northern Song Dynasty,

463
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,210
amidst the raging fires of war,

464
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,120
our clan members went south and scattered.

465
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,100
My ancestors refused to leave,
even at the cost of their lives.

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,510
At the end of the Ming Dynasty,

467
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,310
when Li Zicheng, the rebel king,

468
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,460
invaded Qinchuan,

469
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,030
the bandits looted households.

470
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,070
My ancestors

471
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,040
even risked their lives.

472
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,590
In the end,

473
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,720
they prevented them from damaging
even a blade of grass.

474
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,720
Who is this?

475
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,950
When the Republic era came...

476
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,720
That's Fugui.

477
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,450
The Japanese launched
an air attack on Qinchuan.

478
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,690
My grandfather

479
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,120
took my father

480
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,330
to sleep in the cemetery day and night.

481
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,600
They guarded it for totally 100 days.

482
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,820
The tombs were safe in the end,

483
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,790
but my grandfather didn't survive.

484
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,010
Then in my generation,

485
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,240
Taiping robbed tombs

486
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,480
due to my failure in
supervision and discipline.

487
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm too ashamed to live.

488
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,660
If it weren't for the fact that

489
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,150
the Lv family tomb still exists,

490
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,250
and the burden on my
shoulders is still there,

491
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,920
I would rather kill myself with a rope.

492
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,290
Later, the archaeological team came.

493
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,740
The government

494
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,520
wanted to excavate the tomb.

495
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,720
But this tomb

496
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,650
was destroyed while I was the keeper.

497
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,030
I'm afraid the roots of the Lv family

498
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,920
will be removed by others.

499
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,920
The Lv family is completely scattered.

500
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,900
Fugui, don't worry.

501
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,330
The roots of the Lv family
won't be broken.

502
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,240
The Lv family won't be scattered, either.

503
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,440
After we finish the excavation,

504
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,300
we'll rebuild your family temple

505
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,720
as compensation.

506
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,030
After that, the descendants
of your Lv family

507
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,550
can gather to strengthen
your hometown ties

508
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,680
and unite the clan members together.

509
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
Do you think that's okay?

510
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,830
Can you make the decisions?

511
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm not the one who makes the decisions.

512
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,550
But this is our project leader,

513
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,000
Luo Qing, whom you know.

514
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,590
Yes, I am the project leader.

515
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,300
So you're the one who decides?

516
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,000
-I...
-Sure.

517
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,880
She can surely make the decisions.

518
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
She's the project leader after all.

519
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,600
Alright.

520
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,950
But I don't know how to

521
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,110
repay you for your great kindness.

522
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,770
Fugui, that's not necessary.

523
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,720
Actually, we didn't consider
things thoroughly before

524
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,550
and didn't take your feelings
into account.

525
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,440
It's our fault.

526
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,910
Alright. Let's not dwell on the past.

527
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,770
Since you can help us
rebuild the family temple,

528
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,120
you are the friends of our Lvjia Village

529
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,180
and the honored guests of the Lv Clan.

530
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,290
Come on.

531
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,330
Come in and look around.

532
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,180
Come on.

533
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,880
These photos

534
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,560
were taken by my father and me.

535
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,700
Looking at this photo,

536
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,130
I can't forget it even to this day.

537
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,170
In the 1980s, we could
barely fill our stomachs.

538
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,550
My father asked someone in Shanghai

539
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,680
to buy this Seagull camera.

540
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,340
Back then, he knew that

541
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,270
the family temple probably
couldn't be preserved.

542
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,800
So he took photos every day.

543
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,470
This may sound silly,

544
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,390
but my father spent our family's

545
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,650
one-year income buying this camera.

546
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,040
Because of it, my mother didn't
speak to him for half a year.

547
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,740
I'm impressed.

548
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,720
Your father's awareness of
preserving cultural relics

549
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
was even stronger than people nowadays.

550
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,640
It wasn't about preserving
cultural relics.

551
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,770
He just wanted to leave some
mementoes for the Lv family.

552
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,550
Back then, my father was a teacher
at the village primary school.

553
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,440
He noticed that

554
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,480
there were many old books at the school.

555
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,750
They were either tattered or worn.

556
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,410
Nobody was reading them.

557
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,550
[Lv Family's Genealogy]

558
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,240
Later, he brought them all

559
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,720
back home.

560
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,510
As long as the content was
related to the Lv family,

561
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,880
my father

562
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,820
would transcribe it word by word.

563
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,970
This family genealogy is also
a concern of mine.

564
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,190
When my father was alive,

565
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,750
he always wanted to figure out
the Lv family's lineage

566
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,350
from the Northern Song
Dynasty to the present.

567
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,930
Unfortunately,

568
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,300
he was just a teacher in the countryside

569
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,960
and didn't have that ability.

570
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,720
I'm also not capable of that.

571
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,880
I'm not well-educated.

572
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm just a farmer who can
only do farm work.

573
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,750
Fugui,

574
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,480
these materials are so valuable to us.

575
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,070
We have a saying in archaeology.

576
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,600
"There's a history behind
every tombstone."

577
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,480
The history of the Lv Family Tomb

578
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,540
belongs not only to you but also to us.

579
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,750
Don't worry. We'll complete
the excavation properly

580
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,150
with the utmost respect.

581
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Thank you so much.

582
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,520
Thank you.

583
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,120
So you can't pedal anymore?

584
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,440
Guo! Xiaobai! Come out and help!

585
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,640
Hurry!

586
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,480
Coming!

587
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,640
What?

588
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,480
What's wrong?

589
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:27,920
Come on.

590
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,000
So you've brought back an entire archive?

591
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,530
You've convinced Lv Fugui?

592
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,590
Since I tried to do this personally,
I surely succeeded in persuading him.

593
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,720
-You're amazing.
-Carry them inside.

594
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,240
Good, Fang Kun.

595
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,980
What kind of sweet talk
did you use on Lv Fugui?

596
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,540
Mrs. Zan.

597
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,480
Let me tell you.

598
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,680
He didn't use any sweet talk,

599
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,830
but he set a big trap for me

600
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,790
and pushed me into it.

601
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,750
Do you know what he promised Lv Fugui?

602
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,080
He said we'd rebuild their family temple.

603
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,210
Then he said, "This is the
team leader, and she's in charge."

604
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,400
“She's fully in charge of it.”

605
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,030
He didn't even discuss it with me.

606
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,160
He put me on the spot.

607
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,200
What was I supposed to do?

608
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,440
Captain Luo, Captain Luo.

609
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,030
I noticed that you were very excited

610
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,550
while carrying the materials
at Lv Fugui's house.

611
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,440
How come as soon as you've seen Mrs. Zan,

612
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,350
you're trying to deny that I helped a lot?

613
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,880
He gave us so many materials,

614
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,830
including the genealogy and other books.

615
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,310
Of course I was excited just now.

616
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,310
On the way back, I realized that

617
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,510
you had set a big trap for me.

618
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,640
Let's not talk about whether
it's a trap or not.

619
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,170
Mrs. Zan.

620
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,480
The Dry Ditch and the Spirit Way
have been figured out.

621
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,590
-You still think you're amazing?
-Really?

622
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,440
And you're impressive, huh?

623
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,510
Isn't that impressive?

624
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,720
Mrs. Zan, please be the judge here.

625
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,450
This is actually a good tactic.

626
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,030
At least,

627
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,200
we've made a significant discovery.

628
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,660
Well...

629
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,160
Um,

630
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,200
as for rebuilding the family temple...

631
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,730
Fang Kun.

632
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,640
You can't just walk away
after stirring up trouble.

633
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,590
Since you've caused this trouble,

634
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,000
you can't let Luo Qing bear it alone.

635
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Yes, yes, yes.

636
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,350
Kun, Mrs. Zan is right.

637
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,590
We should handle this matter properly

638
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,590
right here at the Lu family's tomb.

639
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,830
Let's solve this problem properly.

640
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,290
You can handle it. I can't.

641
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,050
What?

642
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,770
I have to go.

643
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,640
Where are you going?

644
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,590
I need to go back.

645
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,550
Xiaoman just texted me,
saying that Uncle Youliang was back.

646
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,680
I need to go back and discuss the matter

647
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,960
of crop compensation with him.

648
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,680
You're leaving so soon?

649
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,940
I'll set off in a while.

650
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,460
Well...

651
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,920
If Ma Chaoyue couldn't solve this issue,

652
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,530
what solutions can you
and Uncle Youliang have?

653
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,830
We have to give it a try.
Don't you think so?

654
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,230
You...

655
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,240
How are you going to fix the mess
you've created for Luo Qing?

656
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,000
Isn't this a perfect chance

657
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,750
to test Captain Luo's leadership skills?

658
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,150
Right?

659
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,880
You...

660
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,360
Luo Qing, don't be angry.

661
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,680
This guy is just a...

662
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,700
He's just a troublemaker.

663
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,690
Fang Kun.

664
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,500
Go comfort her.

665
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:18,920
I...

666
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,920
She has such a bad habit.

667
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,720
What bad habit?

668
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Go. Hurry up. Just go.

669
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,320
Go at once.

670
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,350
Gosh.

671
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,440
What's wrong?

672
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,830
So you can't bear to see me leave?

673
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,830
You're such a conceited guy.

674
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,510
You really think you're
that special and popular?

675
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,720
How I wish you could leave immediately.

676
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,240
Why do you have such a deep
misunderstanding about me?

677
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,920
Am I really that unreliable in your mind?

678
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,830
Aren't you?

679
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,030
You mentioned rebuilding
their family temple.

680
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,380
Do you know how much hope
you've given to Fugui?

681
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,440
Do you know how much

682
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,260
the family temple means to them?

683
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,480
If we can't rebuild it,

684
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,720
how will our archaeological team
and I face him?

685
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,550
How will he bear this disappointment?

686
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,030
You really just know how to
make empty promises.

687
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,400
When you gave him such a big hope,

688
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,270
you never considered

689
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,350
the consequences and harm
you might bring to others.

690
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,810
How do you know I was
just saying it casually?

691
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,550
How do you know

692
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,350
I was intentionally
giving him a false hope?

693
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,960
Because I know you too well.

694
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,160
I don't think you understand me at all.

695
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,550
Yesterday, I told you a story

696
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,480
about that archaeological team captain.

697
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,610
What was the ending?

698
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,790
The ending was that the captain
applied to the department

699
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,070
to see if they could build

700
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,510
a memorial hall for their ancestors.

701
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,840
Then the leader agreed.

702
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,440
Not every leader would agree.

703
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,640
At least, you should have

704
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,310
discussed it with me, shouldn't you?

705
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,030
I did want to discuss it with you.

706
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,020
But... But the atmosphere
at that time suddenly

707
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,830
got heated up.

708
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,030
You're always right.

709
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,790
From now on, you'll be called Fang Right.

710
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,440
Fang Right, go back to Yin Village now.

711
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:48,830
Well...

712
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,290
Get out!

713
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,550
You're really leaving?

714
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,150
Of course.

715
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,030
Luo Qing is right.

716
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,340
You came back from Yusai
purely for Yin Village.

717
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,010
You didn't tell me about that.

718
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,440
If things don't work out,
come back quickly.

719
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,500
Don't be stubborn.

720
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,120
Let the kid do it himself.

721
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,590
That's right. Don't worry about him, Mom.

722
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,990
Let him drink by himself.

723
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,320
Uncle.

724
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,600
Auntie.

725
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,030
Fang.

726
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,550
Kun.

727
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,080
You're here.

728
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,600
Xiuheng.

729
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,480
Why did you...

730
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,510
Do you like it?

731
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,960
It's a new toy I bought for you.

732
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,100
Say thank you to your uncle.

733
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,200
Eat first. Play with it after you finish.

734
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,400
So, you've returned home with victory?

735
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,240
Isn't it up to my uncle
whether I can return or not?

736
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,070
When you come next time,
don't bring gifts.

737
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,830
-That's right.
-Okay.

738
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,920
Uncle, I bought you two bottles of wine.

739
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,450
Let's get some beef and
have a drink together.

740
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,170
Alright.

741
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,270
Come on. Sit down.

742
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,060
I'll go make a few more dishes.

743
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,640
Here.

744
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,750
Sit down.

745
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,080
No need to make more dishes.

746
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,850
I won't drink the wine.

747
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,810
It'll cause heartburn.

748
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,030
What's wrong, Uncle?

749
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,000
Kun.

750
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,640
You're not an outsider.

751
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,140
I'll be straightforward.

752
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,720
Now that I know you're back,

753
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,580
I'm so annoyed.

754
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,610
Why are you back?

755
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,440
You want me to be your broom

756
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,510
to clear away all those stumbling blocks

757
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,570
for your fieldwork

758
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,960
so that you can continue your
archaeological work in the fields.

759
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,360
Right?

760
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,400
Uncle, this subsidy is
just a matter of time.

761
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,800
You know that, don't you?

762
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,640
We do want to start the fieldwork sooner

763
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,830
in order not to delay the progress.

764
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,510
Do you really think
the people in our village

765
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,040
are all concerned
about your meagre subsidy?

766
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,410
All of us work on the yellow earth.

767
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,440
That land

768
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,460
is vital to our villagers.

769
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,790
If the land is ruined, what can we do?

770
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,510
Every household relies on
this small piece of land

771
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,550
to make a living.

772
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,160
What if you ruin that land?

773
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,280
Uncle.

774
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,240
I...

775
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,730
understand.

776
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,510
The villagers indeed have
their own difficulties.

777
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,160
I didn't think about that

778
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,480
thoroughly before.

779
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,570
These five members

780
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,240
of our family

781
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,030
are the same, too.

782
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,310
You want Lai to work as
a technician for you.

783
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,370
I'm not against it.

784
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,000
But Lai...

785
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,160
He's not someone who wants to settle down.

786
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,680
What will he do after you leave?

787
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,720
-Dad.
-Won't he...

788
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,680
While you were talking about our village,

789
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,880
why did you mention Lai again?

790
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,540
Don't talk.

791
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,660
I'm explaining the situation to Kun here.

792
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,210
Xiaoman.

793
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,570
Growing the cherries well

794
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,350
is the most important thing for me now.

795
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,680
Chenjiapo has harvested good crops now.

796
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,000
I need to hurry up, don't I?

797
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,460
Well...

798
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,130
We'll miss the opportunity
if we don't act quickly.

799
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,680
I went to see Section Chief Ma
a couple of days ago.

800
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,610
He told me he would send
an agricultural expert here.

801
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,370
But the expert hasn't come yet.

802
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,140
Where is he?

803
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,680
What am I now?

804
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,590
Now I'm like a man waiting for
his lover under an old locust tree.

805
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,720
I'm so anxious.

806
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,030
I'm at my wit's end.

807
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,040
Come in, please.

808
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,930
Mr. Fang.

809
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,570
Why are you here again?

810
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,110
You're quite stubborn, too.

811
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,110
About the subsidy,

812
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,510
I really can't handle it.

813
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,640
I didn't say I came to see you
about the subsidy.

814
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,310
Then why are you here?

815
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,370
Can't I come see you without a reason?

816
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,920
Of course you can. Tell me what it is.

817
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,050
Go on with your work.

818
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,090
Go ahead. I'll just look around here.

819
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,720
Why are you taking your bag?
Are you going to a meeting again?

820
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,520
What meeting?

821
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,450
It's none of your business.

822
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,920
Did you promise Uncle Youliang that

823
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,200
you'd find an agricultural expert for him?

824
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,270
I didn't promise him that.

825
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,440
I just said I'd ask around.

826
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,750
So what's the result of your inquiry?

827
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,750
He's waiting for an answer.

828
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,030
No result. No reply. Satisfied?

829
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,530
I have official business to attend to.

830
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,270
Section Chief Ma, can't you
think of a solution?

831
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,310
Bro, the leaders each has
their own responsibilities.

832
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,480
I'm just in charge of culture and tourism.

833
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,070
If I could handle this,
I would have done it already.

834
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,200
There are real difficulties, aren't there?

835
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,310
You even called me bro.

836
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,840
Let's stop this empty talk.

837
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,960
This trivial matter surely

838
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,360
isn't difficult for you.

839
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,200
Get up.

840
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,480
Before I lose my patience, just get up!

841
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,400
Ma.

842
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,120
Ma, please help me.

843
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,100
Let me tell you.

844
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,960
If you keep pestering me like this,

845
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,590
and it really affects my work,

846
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,790
can you take responsibility for that?

847
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,070
How am I pestering you?

848
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,110
I'm mainly here to keep you company

849
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,680
and improve our relationship.

850
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,960
I told you about it already, didn't I?

851
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,550
Even if you accompany me
to the ends of the earth,

852
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,310
I still can't solve this problem.

853
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,040
Then I'll be your driver. Okay?

854
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,200
This is an electric scooter.
I don't need you.

855
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,480
Your scooter doesn't have
rearview mirrors.

856
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,530
I'll be your rearview mirror. Okay?

857
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,680
You think you're so capable?

858
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,740
Where are we going?

859
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,240
Where are we going? Just tell me.

860
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,350
Chenjiapo.

861
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,240
The cherry trees in your
Chenjiapo Village...

862
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Section Chief Ma!

863
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,880
In terms of the scale...

864
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,440
Section Chief Ma!

865
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,400
It's already taking the lead.

866
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,060
Chief Chen.

867
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Park the scooter.

868
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,810
I'm sorry that I'm late.

869
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,160
You're not late at all.

870
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,350
Section Chief Ma.

871
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,880
Our Rural Cultural Tourism
Development Forum

872
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,440
will have to be postponed for a while.

873
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,970
Someone is giving a lecture
in the courtyard.

874
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,420
What kind of lecture?

875
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,640
The district government sent an old expert

876
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,640
to teach everyone how to
scientifically grow cherries.

877
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,840
With modern agricultural facilities,

878
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,790
we can extend the shelf life of cherries

879
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,590
so that the Chenjiapo villagers

880
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,920
can start capturing the cherry market
from early February,

881
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,270
make money

882
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,000
and live a better life.

883
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,750
Bravo!

884
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,270
Do you have any more questions?

885
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,960
I'll tell you everything I know

886
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,220
and hold nothing back.

887
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,250
Is there anything else?

888
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,510
Sir!

889
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,070
If the soil isn't good, how can we
grow good cherries?

890
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,640
What's wrong with the soil?

891
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,070
Is it due to improper irrigation

892
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,890
or unbalanced fertilization?

893
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,590
Or is there a lack of beneficial bacteria?

894
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,030
All these issues exist.

895
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,360
There are so many problems.

896
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,820
[Magnificent Mountains and Rivers]

897
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,550
Bro.

898
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,480
Where is this?

899
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,060
This is a residential community.

900
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,850
What are we doing here?

901
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,410
You'll know when we get there.

902
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,450
Hey, come in.

903
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,270
Guang.

904
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,130
How do you like this apartment?

905
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,520
Bro, are you moving to a new place?

906
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,690
No, I'm not.

907
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,520
I bought this apartment for you.

908
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,790
For me?

909
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,070
Bro, don't joke around.

910
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,030
It's fine for me to live there.
I'm not moving here.

911
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,400
You'll keep living in a junkyard?

912
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,139
You want your future wife to live
in a junkyard with you, too?

913
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,270
What are you talking about? What wife?

914
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,880
Wen Wen is a good girl.

915
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,760
If you have something
to rely on in the future,

916
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,690
you should let her rely on you, too.

917
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,920
When you meet the right person,
start a family first.

918
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,780
Only a home is a man's foundation.

919
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,480
Except for your wife,
children and warm home,

920
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,210
everything else is just empty.

921
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,230
What do you think?

922
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,320
I think this community
has a nice environment.

923
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,710
The previous owner only
lived here for a year.

924
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,400
The decoration work is all done.

925
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,550
It can save us a lot of trouble.

926
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,679
I took the liberty of buying it for you.

927
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,230
Bro, I don't even know what to say.

928
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,550
Come on. Sit down.

929
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,480
Guang.

930
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,969
After you get married,

931
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,150
Wen Wen will be your closest person.

932
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,159
She's an honest girl.

933
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,800
She might not be able to
accept certain things.

934
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,710
You can just decide what she should know

935
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,840
and shouldn't know.

936
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,760
Don't worry.

937
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,320
I understand all of this.

938
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,230
Congratulations on your new home.

939
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,510
What's this? Is it for me?

940
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,770
Open it and take a look.

941
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,630
Bro, what are you doing?

942
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,360
I don't need so much money. You...

943
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,480
It's not only for you

944
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,800
but also for our buddies.

945
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,960
You can decide how to divide it.

946
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,020
Don't forget this.

947
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,960
There's also a share for
Xiaowu's wife and child.

948
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,000
Mom, I'm back.

949
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,710
Mom.

950
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,670
Mom, I'm going to my room to do homework.

951
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,360
Okay.

952
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,890
This is for you.

953
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,490
What does this mean?

954
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,440
It's for you to start a company.

955
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,800
What kind of company?

956
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,200
A construction company.

957
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,030
I don't know anything about construction.

958
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,800
How can I run a construction company?

959
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,530
You can learn if you don't know.

960
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,970
So I have to spend the money on tuition?

961
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,010
I won't do anything that wastes money.

962
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,630
If you don't want to learn,

963
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,760
just take your 500,000 yuan and leave.

964
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,930
It's not that I don't want to learn.

965
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,510
The key is...

966
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,750
we're doing well
in the cultural relics field.

967
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,000
Why do we have to start
a construction company?

968
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,190
Don't worry about that.

969
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,000
Just focus on running your company well.

970
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,660
This is money, not just paper.

971
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,880
What if we suffer losses?

972
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,540
I'll cover the losses for you.

973
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,800
Then it's okay.

974
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,330
But there's one thing.

975
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,550
You can't do anything illegal anymore.

976
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,840
Cut ties with all those unreliable old

977
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,400
friends of yours completely.

978
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,600
I want you to be clean,

979
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,460
inside and out,

980
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,430
so that others can't find
anything wrong with you.

981
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,280
The more I hear, the more confused I am.

982
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,590
Why do you want to
whitewash my reputation?

983
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,990
Don't keep asking me why.

984
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,280
The police started keeping
an eye on you long ago.

985
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,670
If you don't do legitimate business,

986
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,960
then you'd keep up your old ways

987
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,290
and give the police
a reason to arrest you?

988
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,320
Why hasn't Lai shown up yet?

989
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,250
He's not coming.

990
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,230
Why?

991
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,280
This morning, he told me
his wrist was aching.

992
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,960
He wants to rest for a couple of days.

993
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,510
I think

994
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,240
he's just like that.

995
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,090
Mr. Guo.

996
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,480
I've found that your judgment of people

997
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,710
is always wrong.

998
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,240
How could that idler
handle this hard work?

999
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,480
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

1000
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,030
Right?

1001
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,400
We've been teaching him carefully.

1002
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,030
Whether he learns or not is his business.

1003
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,560
Besides,

1004
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,810
in this way, Uncle Youliang
can't find fault with us.

1005
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,310
That's right.

1006
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,190
It's time to work.

1007
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,720
Why haven't you gone to work yet?

1008
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,260
My wrist is about to break.

1009
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,190
This job isn't suitable for
my long-term career.

1010
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,590
It's really exhausting.

1011
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,440
Lai,

1012
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,570
didn't you agree to this
willingly at first?

1013
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,320
At first, they even said I could
make money with it.

1014
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,000
I've been working for so long
and haven't seen a penny.

1015
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,660
Aren't you an apprentice now?

1016
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,760
Once you finish learning,
won't you get paid?

1017
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,320
Besides,

1018
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,810
with our relationship with Fang and Guo,

1019
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,920
how would they treat you unfairly?

1020
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,650
Then I'll have to wait forever.

1021
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,830
I am a big shot after all.

1022
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,720
Working as a gravedigger

1023
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,520
is quite embarrassing.

1024
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,620
You think being a gravedigger
is embarrassing?

1025
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,960
So being unable to support
your wife and child isn't embarrassing?

1026
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,230
You always have no income to buy food

1027
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,800
and haven't paid my parents for meals
for three consecutive months.

1028
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,330
Even the toilet paper is
bought by my parents.

1029
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,440
How can you have the nerve to lie in bed?

1030
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,920
I'm at your home to be
your parents' live-in son-in-law,

1031
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,400
instead of a permanent worker.

1032
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,130
Why do you always look so upset?

1033
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,450
Let me tell you.

1034
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,630
If I hadn't married you back then,

1035
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,030
who else would marry you?

1036
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,810
You should be grateful.

1037
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,840
What?

1038
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,110
Yes.

1039
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
You're right.

1040
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,970
Though my face doesn't look good,

1041
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,070
at least, I have some self-respect.

1042
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,630
Move back. Go on. Move back.

1043
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,070
Let go.

1044
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,150
Gentlemen.

1045
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,690
It's time to eat.

1046
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,760
Coming!

1047
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,880
Coming.

1048
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,140
Xiaoman, you're here.

1049
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,840
It's time to eat.

1050
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,300
Come on.

1051
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,660
What will we eat today?
Let me take a look.

1052
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,930
What will we eat today?

1053
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,190
There's even meat.

1054
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,520
Come over here quickly!

1055
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,630
Let me take a look.

1056
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,910
There's so much food.

1057
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,490
Xiaoman.

1058
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,030
Come on.

1059
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,420
What's the occasion today?

1060
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,840
We could just have some buns.

1061
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,640
Why did you prepare so much food?

1062
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,800
Come on.

1063
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,710
Mr. Lu.

1064
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,820
I want to apologize to you.

1065
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,400
I'm sorry.

1066
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,000
Lai...

1067
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,710
is so disappointing.

1068
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,360
He wasted your efforts.

1069
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,930
I don't really mind.

1070
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,260
It's just that this boy
lacks perseverance.

1071
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,610
If he finds another job,

1072
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,590
he probably won't stick with it, either.

1073
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,320
I think

1074
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,240
you're a responsible girl.

1075
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,920
Put more effort into guiding him.

1076
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,440
Maybe he'll settle down

1077
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,220
and live a stable life.

1078
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,400
If he had listened to me,

1079
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,280
I wouldn't be so worried.

1080
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,200
Xiaoman.

1081
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,400
Don't worry.

1082
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,840
These buddies always

1083
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,480
helps him keep an eye out for work.

1084
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,450
That's right.

1085
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,190
It's okay.

1086
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,320
Fang.

1087
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,840
I want to try.

1088
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,230
You want to be a technician?

1089
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,890
Yes, I want to be a technician.

1090
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,810
Xiaoman.

1091
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,440
I'm not trying to discourage you.

1092
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,630
But this shovel is really heavy.

1093
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,550
Even Lai can't handle it.

1094
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:47,960
That's right.

1095
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,920
Let alone your small figure.

1096
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Lai can't handle it because he's lazy.

1097
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,840
Although I'm thin,

1098
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,770
I have strength.

1099
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,960
Don't underestimate me
just because I'm a woman.

1100
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
If I don't do well,

1101
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,160
I can keep practicing

1102
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,550
until I meet the standard.

1103
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,510
Being a technician

1104
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,550
isn't just about digging with a shovel.

1105
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,760
There's a lot to learn.

1106
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,110
You need to learn how to
distinguish the soil

1107
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,030
and take notes.

1108
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,000
That's right.

1109
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,320
If you want to turn it into
a long-term job,

1110
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,780
you even need to understand
basic archaeological knowledge.

1111
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,320
Mr. Lu, look.

1112
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,880
The feet should form a T-shape

1113
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,230
with the left foot in the front

1114
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,280
and the right foot at the back.

1115
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,840
The body should lean forward

1116
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,360
with the right hand holding
the rod's upper part

1117
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,030
and the left hand below
controlling directions.

1118
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,280
It's necessary to grip the rod tightly

1119
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,760
and dig with the shovel decisively.

1120
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,280
The shovel should be vertically downward

1121
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,140
so that the hole

1122
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,170
appears to be a perfect circle.

1123
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,230
Sir.

1124
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,880
Xiaoman's shoveling technique
is very professional.

1125
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,010
I think she can do it.

1126
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,470
Our industry happens to be
short of some female technicians.

1127
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,800
Why don't we let Xiaoman fill the vacancy?

1128
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,760
If you think it's okay,

1129
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,690
I won't stop her.

1130
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,490
Jiang He.

1131
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,230
You'll be Xiaoman's mentor from now on.

1132
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:55,890
No problem.

1133
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,960
Then you'll work with me from now on.

1134
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,760
Hello, Mentor.

1135
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,070
Good.

1136
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,590
Welcome, welcome.

1137
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,210
Welcome, welcome.
