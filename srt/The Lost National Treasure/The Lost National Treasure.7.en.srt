[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
When you stayed in Yusai,

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,039
what were you doing there?

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,729
Our province is an important place
for the Great Wall's resources.

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,509
And the Great Wall accounts for a major

7
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,370
portion within Yusai's borders.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,710
Regarding the length, direction, structure

9
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,810
and layout of the Great Wall,

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,789
as well as its historical
and geographical context,

11
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,790
there are still many gaps
in the archaeological data.

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,520
So I decided to stay in Yusai

13
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,150
to conduct a field survey
of the Great Wall's resources.

14
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,610
But this is a cross-disciplinary practice.

15
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Who says we can't have a
cross-disciplinary practice

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,450
So, during those years in Yusai,

17
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,290
how was your life?

18
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,960
Back then, Yusai was short of
food and drinks.

19
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,240
There were so many sandstorms that

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
you would be parched.

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,310
But every time you
finished surveying a relic

22
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,840
and made some discoveries,

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,140
you would forget all the
hardships you had endured.

24
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,590
It's a pity that

25
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,000
the time I spent in Yusai was too short.

26
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,610
I was writing a survey report about
the Great Wall's resources,

27
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,890
but it wasn't finished by the time I left.

28
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,560
I really don't know if I will

29
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,880
have a chance to go there again.

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,130
Hearing what you've said,
I also want to go there.

31
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,810
You're still young.

32
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,750
There will be plenty of opportunities.

33
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,280
Let's go.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,040
Well, I have to build up my health first.

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,280
By driving a horse for three years,
it's easy to understand its nature.

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,680
Don't I know your nature?

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,840
What's on your mind? Tell me.

38
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:20,880
Sir.

39
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,210
This is...

40
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,840
my self-criticism report.

41
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,690
Stop right there, you thieves!

42
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,490
Stop!

43
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,170
Stop! Don't run!

44
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,430
Did you bring your mobile phone?

45
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,870
No.

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,030
Fang Kun!

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,010
Stop!

48
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,750
How about this? Go back and ask for help.

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,550
I'll go stop Shoucun.

50
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,190
Let me go, sir.

51
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,740
No.

52
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,350
Asking for help is more urgent. Hurry!

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,130
Shoucun!

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,710
Stop!

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,760
Stop, you thieves!

56
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,860
Stop!

57
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,040
Stop!

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,100
Shoucun!

59
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,510
Don't act recklessly!

60
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,420
Stop!

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,200
Don't run!

62
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,740
Stop!

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
They're running so fast!

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
-Stop running!
-They're running so fast!

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,769
Shoucun!

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,510
You have to listen to me!

67
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,310
Shilin!

68
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,510
Shilin!

69
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,240
Shilin!

70
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,560
What's wrong? Why are you yelling?

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,620
There are tomb raiders in the fields.

72
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,120
Call Dacang at once!

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Just call him.

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,140
Be careful.

75
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,000
What's going on?

76
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,920
Get dressed.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,430
Let's go.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,890
What's wrong?

79
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,240
There are tomb raiders in the fields.

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,770
Let's go!

81
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,560
Stop!

82
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,600
Stop!

83
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,630
Stop running!

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,310
Shoucun!

85
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,100
Stop!

86
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,870
S-S-Stop!

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,640
Let's go search for them.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,430
Hurry up!

89
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,020
Where are they?

90
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,120
Slow down!

91
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,720
-Hurry up!
-Be quick!

92
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,160
Let's go!

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,480
Let's go!

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,010
Hurry up!

95
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,310
Let's go!

96
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,000
What about over there?

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,660
Be careful!

98
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,380
Shoucun!

99
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,030
Let go!

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,320
Get your hands off me!

101
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,670
Leave at once!

102
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,430
Run!

103
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,360
Stop! Stop!

104
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,190
Stop chasing them.

105
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,830
I'm about to catch up with them.

106
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,870
Let go of me!

107
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,040
Stop chasing them!

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,560
Don't let the thieves get away again!

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,240
They won't be able to escape!

110
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,020
Let go of me!

111
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,390
Oh, my God!

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,750
The thieves got away!

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
At that moment, I was so close.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,159
I was just so close that

115
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,680
-I could almost catch them.
-You're back.

116
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,040
How was it?

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,170
This old professor kept following me.

118
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,510
Why did he keep following me?

119
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,750
The van was right there.

120
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,000
I was about to catch them.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,720
Look at you, old man.
Your strength was so big that

122
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,920
you held me tightly.

123
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,070
-I watched that van go away.
-Please take a good rest.

124
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,480
Those thieves just got away!

125
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,210
Yan Shoucun.

126
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
If it weren't for Professor Zan,

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,560
you would've been hit by
the tomb raiders' van and got killed.

128
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,920
You've attended the city's training class
for cultural relic conservators.

129
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,430
I've told you countless times that

130
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,950
when you encounter tomb raiders,
you can't confront them directly.

131
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,480
Your personal safety comes first.

132
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,870
Why can't you take my advice?

133
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,190
What are those tomb raiders anyway?

134
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,510
They're all cowards.

135
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,630
If they dare to come again,

136
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,890
just see... just see what I'll do to them.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,130
I'll knock out every
single one of them teeth.

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,790
Don't do that. Let me tell you.

139
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:18,830
Sir,

140
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,510
where were those tomb raiders digging?

141
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,310
It's the same place as last time.

142
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,290
Let's go take a look.

143
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,970
Lead the way.

144
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,370
-We'll go now?
-Let's go.

145
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:26,980
Let's go.

146
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,040
Why are you leaving?

147
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,000
Are you all going?

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,950
Aren't you going to sleep?

149
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,750
Xiaoman, don't go. Don't go with us.

150
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,720
We'll go. It's fine.

151
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,650
Then be careful.

152
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,210
Heizui!

153
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,170
They didn't dig it for long.

154
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,330
It's all thanks to you,
Uncle Shoucun and Heizui.

155
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,790
Otherwise, they would've succeeded again.

156
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,730
Captain Qi.

157
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,760
I've checked the surrounding area.

158
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,870
I only found a few cigarette butts

159
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,270
and some van tire tracks.

160
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,250
Uncle Shoucun.

161
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,570
How many people did you see?

162
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,180
I chased two of them.

163
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,860
There was another one
by the van when I got there.

164
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,520
There were three men in total.

165
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,630
What did they look like?

166
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,510
I-It was too dark at that time.

167
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,370
I couldn't see anything clearly.

168
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,790
It's okay.

169
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,620
That's fine.

170
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,750
You've done well enough.

171
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,750
You've done well.

172
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,110
Captain Yang,

173
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,750
now that we've finished
the on-site investigation,

174
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,409
please ask someone
to fill this hole again.

175
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,929
Okay.

176
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:34,970
Alright.

177
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,270
We've been working on it all night,
and it's already dawn.

178
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,000
Go back and rest. You've all worked hard.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,799
Indeed. You've all worked hard.

180
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,550
Auntie.

181
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,650
-You're back.
-You're all back.

182
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,180
Brother.

183
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,970
You're back.

184
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,960
Dacang, you're back, too.

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,270
-Wash your hands and eat.
-You're just in time.

186
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,000
Wash your hands and eat. Hurry.

187
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,000
-Hurry up,

00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,460
Mr. Hong.

372
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,730
If you can't put all your items here,
you can put them in my place.

373
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,290
I can't put them in your place anymore.

374
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:01,730
Sir.

375
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,660
Congratulations.

376
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,330
Thanks for your congratulations.

377
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,460
Wish you a prosperous opening.

378
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,250
Thank you.

379
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:05,940
Please come in.

380
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,570
Alright.

381
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,970
-Wish you a prosperous opening.
-Alright.

382
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,080
[Beijing]

383
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,330
Qing, won't you have an interview
at the Social Sciences Academy tomorrow?

384
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,160
I bought you some clothes.
Come and try them on.

385
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,720
It's not okay. T-T-This doesn't look good.

386
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,280
Come on. Try this one on.

387
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,800
Alright. It's settled then.

388
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,030
Qing.

389
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,570
Why have you been so distracted

390
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,210
since you came back from Qinchuan?

391
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,480
What's wrong?

392
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,430
Is it still because of
Professor Zan's death?

393
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,090
There's something

394
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,710
I want to tell you and my dad.

395
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,520
Stop reading. Hurry up.

396
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,790
I've made up my mind.

397
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,550
I don't want to go to
the Social Sciences Academy.

398
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,150
I want to go back to Qinchuan.

399
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,400
Sweetie,

400
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,210
why is that?

401
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,480
For those of us who major in archaeology,

402
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,160
Qinchuan is truly a piece of fertile land.

403
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,260
If I can never go to
Qinchuan for the rest of my life,

404
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,990
I'll definitely have regrets.

405
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,260
Moreover,

406
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,230
there's still someone there

407
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,010
whom I can't stop worrying about.

408
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,630
Cheers.

409
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,340
Ma'am.

410
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,300
Give me some tendons.

411
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,390
-Tendons.
-And some kidneys, too.

412
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,160
-Right.
-Here.

413
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,180
Here's some more lean and fat meat for you.

414
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,510
Okay.

415
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,870
Give us a portion of grilled fish, too.

416
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,400
Alright.

417
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,310
What a big meal today.

418
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,790
Have you decided yet?

419
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,450
About what?

420
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
Where will you go?

421
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,340
I've sent my resume to

422
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,940
the provincial institute,
the municipal bureau and the museum.

423
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,550
Only the municipal bureau replied to me.

424
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,030
I'll officially join them next week.

425
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,560
Alright.

426
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,870
The municipal bureau is good, too.

427
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,150
What's so good about it?

428
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,870
It's all about infrastructure
projects every day.

429
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,000
That's exhausting.

430
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,510
I used to always say that

431
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,830
I ranked last in our class.

432
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,630
I ranked last.

433
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,600
In the end, I really did rank last.

434
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,690
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

435
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,480
Since you're an excellent

436
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,870
candidate who is always scrambled for

437
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,150
by several institutions,

438
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,410
you can't understand.

439
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,300
What do you think, buddy?

440
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,700
I noticed that you weren't
talking to anyone previously.

441
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,660
That was why I didn't ask you about it.

442
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,520
Have you decided where you'll go?

443
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,210
Yes, I have.

444
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,150
Let me guess.

445
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,520
It must be the provincial institute.

446
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,150
Yusai.

447
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,740
Yusai?

448
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,150
What will you do there?

449
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,350
I'll do research on
the Great Wall's resources.

450
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,610
What will you research at the Great Wall?

451
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,890
Anyway, you know what?

452
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,030
I just don't want to stay
in Qinchuan anymore.

453
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,050
I want to walk the path
that Mr. Zan once walked.

454
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,930
When will you go?

455
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,230
Tomorrow.

456
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,420
You look silly.

457
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,700
Just eat it yourself.

458
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,450
The grilled fish is here.

459
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,200
You're always bragging.

460
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,020
You don't even how you'll end up.

461
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,660

466
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
Ms. Luo, you're here.

467

How's it going?

Ms. Luo.

471
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,790
Could you take a look at it for me

472
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,850
to see what period this basin is from?

473
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,390
It's quite good. It's from
the late Spring and Autumn Period.

474
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,420
Thank you, Ms. Luo.

475
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,030
Ms. Luo.

476
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,830
Look.

477
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,710
What type of vessel is this?

478
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,790
This is a basin.

479
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,150
The pattern on it is quite rare.

480
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,940
But as for what specific animal it is,

481
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,470
it can't be determined yet.

482
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,070
Later, let's consult with the teachers

483
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,260
from the provincial institute.

484
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,500
If you're still uncertain about
the types of any vessels,

485
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,150
let me take a look.

486
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,310
Look at this one, Ms. Luo.

487
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,910
It's a pig.

488
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,590
It's very beautiful.

489
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,630
Isn't this a dog?

490
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,620
How could it be a dog?

491
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,480
Come on. This is definitely a pig.

492
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,980
Yours is clearly a dog.

493
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,560
I just gave this one a name.

494
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,890
It's called Dog Four.

495
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,090
That sounds awful.

496
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,550
Pig Three and Dog Four.

497
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,660
What a perfect match!

498
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,790
Why don't we just let them get married?

499
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,390
You may want that, but my Dog Four
wouldn't be happy about it.

500
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,190
That's right.

501
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,700
It's definitely a pig, isn't it?

502
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,460
It's definitely a dog.

503
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,740
-It has a round nose.
-Alright.

504
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,940
Whether it's a dog or a pig,

505
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,310
treat it as a specimen first.

506
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,330
Take photos, draw pictures

507
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,700
and then fill out the artifact card.

508
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,030
Okay.

509
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,340
Everyone, don't forget that

510
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,360
all specimens should be classified again

511
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,420
according to their different units.

512
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,560
Ms. Luo,

513
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,770
you've asked us to
organize everything twice.

514
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,240
That's right.

515
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,920
Yeah.

516
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,200
Then let me ask you all.

517
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,500
What do you think this pottery pig was

518
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,420
used for after it was made?

519
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,880
I think it was used as a toy.

520
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,810
I think it was used for praying.

521
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,260
It was to pray for more
and more livestock at home.

522
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,830
I think it was used for
sacrificial purposes.

523
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,490
It was probably used as a gift.

524
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,460
You might all be right.

525
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,020
We have to admit that

526
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,390
this pottery pig was already beyond

527
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,900
the needs of production and daily life,

528
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,350
and instead, it satisfied
the spiritual needs of our ancestors.

529
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,070
After you sorted out the documents twice,

530
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,220
you've learned how to
sequence the artifacts.

531
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,900
You've also learned how to study

532
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,160
social structures and their patterns of

533
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,630
development and evolution through these

534
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,590
archaeological materials in your hands.

535
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,390
But this time,

536
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,740
I hope that you all can
broaden your perspectives

537
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,940
to study issues in the spiritual realm.

538
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,740
Archaeology is not only
about seeing objects

539
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,700
but also about seeing people.

540
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,180
It's to learn about people from objects.

541
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,070
You all need to learn how to use these

542
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,150
scattered static pottery shards

543
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,110
in your hands

544
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,630
to reconstruct an entire spiritual world

545
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,590
of our ancient ancestors.

549
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:11,940
Here's the thing.

00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,830
Our provincial colleagues responsible
for the Great Wall archaeological project

551
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,940
are coming for a visit and inspection.

552

The Great Wall archaeology?

553
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,630
The institute wants you to be
in charge of receiving them.

Where are they from?

556
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,290
They're surely from Yusai.

I'm Luo Qing from the Provincial

Sorry for the trouble.

581

It's alright.

582
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,580
Everyone, let's move on.

583
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,850
This is our courtyard.

584
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,070
You've set it up quite nicely.

585
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,870
Yes, yes, yes.

586
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,850
We usually do our
archaeological work inside.

587
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,830
Right. This area is...

588
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,830
Professor, beware of the doorstep.

589
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,630
Okay.

590
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,220
This is one of our areas

591
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,420

592
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,990
This... This looks...
There are so many items here.

593
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,390
The noodles are here. Be careful.

594
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,460
Give me another bowl.

595
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,790
Be careful. Step aside.

596
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,880
Step aside.

597
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,420
Thank you.

598
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,130

599

Thank you.

601
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,960
You're welcome.

602
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,350
How come this kid has such a...
such a strange accent?

603
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,400
He's from the Taiwan Region.

604
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,460
The Taiwan Region?

605
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,590
When we do archaeological
work in the desert,

606
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,190
let alone having a good meal,

607
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:30,950
it's even

608
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,110
impossible to have

609
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,620
a full meal on time.

610
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,940
Is Mr. Fang doing quite well?

611
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,350
You mean Fang Kun?

612
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,830
You know each other?

613
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,660
We once interacted during our internship.

614
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,920
We're kind of friends.

615
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,230
He was always competitive
when we were students.

616
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,390
He could always do some unexpected things.

617
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,050
I wonder if he has changed now.

618
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,310
Not at all. He hasn't changed at all.

619
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,920
In your Qinchuan dialect,

620
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,140
he's just a silly boy.

621
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,420
It's a pity he didn't come this time.

622
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,880
Otherwise, we could
talk about the old days.

623
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,740
It's quite a coincidence this time.

624
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,870
Just before we left,

625
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,660
his Xiaoxue

626
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,560
suddenly gave birth to a baby.

627
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,810
He was worried,

628
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,250
so he canceled the trip
at the last minute.

629
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,940
Ms. Luo Qing, I'll fetch another bun.

630
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,440
Guys, wait here.

631
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,060
I'll go ask someone for help.

632
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,500
With this terrible weather

633
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,110
and this sandstorm, do you want to die?

634
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,430
What if an accident occurs?

635
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,080
Fang Kun!

636
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,990
Fang Kun is back!

637
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,400
Hello, Xiaoman.

638
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,150
Hello.

639
00:33:59,350 --> 00:33:59,790
Sister.

640
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,870
How's your recovery going?

641
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,030
I feel troubled.

642
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,830
The baby keeps whimpering
at night without falling asleep.

643
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,290
Sister,

644
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,110
after becoming a mother
have I realized that

645
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,429
I was so free before.

646
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,510
It's okay.

647
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,270
Your kid will grow up soon.

648
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,110
It's been almost 100 days, huh?

649
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,860
Yes, almost.

650
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,780
Sister,

651
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,540
I was just about to tell you about this.

652
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,230
The baby's hundred-day celebration
will be held in a few days.

653
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,159
You have to come.

654
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,260
I'll definitely attend it.

655
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,980
Alright.

656
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,590
Bring your boyfriend, too.

657
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,670
If I can get a boyfriend
in the next couple of days,

658
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,469
I'll definitely take him there.

659
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,360
Guang.

660
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,150
Bro!

661
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:28,780
Guang.

662
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,310
Where have you been?

663
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,340
You didn't tell me before you came.

664
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,540
You really scared me.

665
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,570
I was hungry, so I went out
to buy some food.

666
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,430
Do you want some roujiamo?

667
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,560
I've already eaten.

668
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,110
Guang.

669
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,860
The goods this time are nice.

670
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,990
It's enough for you to
take a break for some time.

671
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,120
I won't take a break.

672
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,530
All my subordinates are
waiting to make a living.

673
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,330
Wait a moment.

674
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,370
I've applied for a bank card in your name.

675
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,690
There's 50,000 yuan in it.

676
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,580
Help those buddies settle down.

677
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,170
Tell them not to come to Qinchuan
during this period of time.

678
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,870
Why?

679
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,710
In this season, there's a bunch of
starving ghosts fighting for food.

680
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,820
The cultural relics protection
team won't do nothing.

681
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,420
They'll surely take action.

682
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,110
Let those starving ghosts
be the cannon fodder.

683
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,850
When they all suffer
great losses in the fight

684
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,770
and get exhausted,

685
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,900
we'll make our move.

686
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,440
Okay.

687
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,630
Is anyone there?

688
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,160
What's going on?

689
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,690
The gate isn't closed.

690
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,650
Who are you looking for?

691
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,990
Yuanguang.

692
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,590
Who are you?

693
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,030
I'm Wen Wen.

694
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,380
I'm Wen Wen.

695
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,430
Wen Wen?

696
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,040
Why have you become like this?

697
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,230
Is your hair real or fake?

698
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,890
How did you find this place?

699
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,870
Your uncle told me about it.

700
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,770
When did you arrive?

701
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,870
My family asked me
to come out and find a job.

702
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,120
It's my first time coming to Qinchuan.

703
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,100
I don't know what jod I can look for.

704
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,360
I really have no choice

705
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,060
but to come to see you.

706
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,880
Yuanguang.

707
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,300
Do you have any work that I can do here?

708
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,840
What color did you apply to your eyelids?

709
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,080
It's too late today.

710
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,420
Now I'll help you find
a nearby place to stay.

711
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,880
We'll talk about
everything else tomorrow.

712
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,590
Wen Wen.

713
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,310
I'm coming in.

714
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,700
The room is a bit small,

715
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,460
but it's quite clean.

716
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,810
It's close to my place and is safe.

717
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,600
By the way, I've paid
a deposit at the reception.

718
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,660
If you need anything, just tell them.

719
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,120
Alright.

720
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,920
Just stay here and make
yourself comfortable.

721
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,530
Remember.

722
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,860
Don't wander around.

723
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,650
Wipe off that blue eyeshadow.

724
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,380
It looks awful.

725
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,580
Go to sleep now.

726
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,510
Bro.

727
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,880
What's going on?

728
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,430
A woman from my hometown village

729
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,880
came to Qinchuan for work,
but she couldn't find a job.

730
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,940
So she came to me for help.

731
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,300
How could you tell others
this address so casually?

732
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,990
I didn't.

733
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,180
I only told my... my uncle about it.

734
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,010
I don't care what method you use.

735
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,910
Just get rid of her quickly.

736
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,580
Okay.

737
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,590
I got it.

738
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,720
Alright. That's it.

739
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,080
I'm going back home.

740
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,420
Remember.

741
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,860
Don't bring anyone here.

742
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,300
I'll go to Beijing in a few days.

743
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,590
Call me if there are any urgent matters.

744
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,790
You'll go to Beijing?

745
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,550
To get a high price for the goods,

746
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,600
we can't rely on just one buyer.

747
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,530
Put it away.

748
00:40:59,530 --> 00:40:59,990
Okay.

749
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
What's wrong, Heizui?

750
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,970
What did you see?

751
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,610
Hey, come on. Let's go.

752
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,030
Hello?

753
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,800
Hello? Hello? This is Yan Shoucun.

754
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,600
What's wrong?

755
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,740
Something came up!

756
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,270
Bring some people here now!

757
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,700
Don't act recklessly.

758
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,630
Keep an eye on them first.

759
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,110
I'll be right there.

760
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,300
Okay! Hurry up!

761
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,430
Come on. Let's go take a look.

762
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,480
Where are the tomb raiders?

763
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,030
Did they drive a car?

764
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,400
How many people?

765
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,740
You frantically asked us
to come over here.

766
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,740
And now you know nothing?

767
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,810
Are you trying to fool us?

768
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,140
Heizui barked just now.

769
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,940
-There must be something wrong!
-Yan Shoucun!

770
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,980
No wonder they say you're silly.

771
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,380
It's a dog. Of course it barks.

772
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,640
Heizui's bark just now was very strange,

773
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,680
so there must be something wrong.

774
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,660
-I want to take revenge for its father!
-Yan Shoucun!

775
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,260
If you keep talking nonsense again,

776
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,740
you can no longer be a
cultural relic conservator.

777
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,790
Let's go. Get on the motorcycle.

778
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,920
You're really something, aren't you?

779
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,630
So you... you just ignore this?

780
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,710
Captain Yang.

781
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,530
The people from the Cultural Relics
Management Office just came.

782
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,480
But then they left.

783
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,950
There's something wrong here.
