00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:42,140
The municipal institute's research
on Emperor Taizong of Han's Zi Mausoleum

4
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,289
started earlier
and is more thoroughly prepared.

5
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,820
For the work plan this time,

6
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,200
let's have Mr. Guo explain it to everyone.

7
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,590
Emperor Taizong of Han's Zi Mausoleum,

8
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,070
according to historical records,

9
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,789
is a cliff cave tomb built on a mountain.

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,320
This is currently the prevailing view.

11
00:01:59,430 --> 00:01:59,970
Of course,

12
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,340
if we refer to the layout
of other emperor mausoleums,

13
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,730
it might have these types of
foundation sites of ritual architecture:

14
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,259
a mausoleum temple, main hall,
and side hall.

15
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,199
So, our exploration this time

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,500
focuses on two aspects:

17
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,030
first,
to find the entrance to the cliff cave,

18
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,710
and second, to search for remains
of the mausoleum architecture.

19
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,510
That's right.

20
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,600
Emperor Taizong of Han was a good emperor

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,860
and a model for ancient feudal emperors.

22
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,520
So many later emperors

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,870
would send high officials
during important solar terms

24
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,050
to represent them
in worshipping Emperor Taizong of Han.

25
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,010
These are

26
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,829
various sacrificial steles
erected for worship.

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,240
We conduct this archaeological exploration

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,560
not to remove these stone steles

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
or overturn previous research,

30
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,840
but to rigorously and scientifically
investigate and supplement history.

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
We want to ensure that every step

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,770
can withstand external scrutiny.

33
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,400
Therefore,

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,710
for this archaeological exploration
of Phoenix Mountain,

35
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,680
we've decided to start exploring
from here.

36
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,470
Because according to the general pattern
of cliff cave tombs,

37
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,150
they are usually horizontally excavated
halfway up the mountain,

38
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,710
forming the tomb passage and chamber.

39
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,770
So our destination

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,910
is tentatively halfway up the mountain.

It takes time.

67
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,040
Your problem

68
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,720
is not with your legs.

69
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,680
It's not something that can be recovered
just through rehabilitation.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,330
Whether you can recover

73
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,280
depends on when the blood clot dissolves.

74
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,600
How long?

75
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,240
It's hard to say.

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,690
You're still young.

will be beneficial
for your early recovery.

Someone left a baby

90
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,310
at our doorstep.

91
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,159
What?

92
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,730
A little baby.

93
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,750
A newborn, so little.

94
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,510
Where did the baby come from?

95
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,800
I don't know.

96
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,510
I don't know what to do.

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
Then quickly bring the baby inside.

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,720
I've already done so.

99
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,430
So what should I do now?

100
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,110
Should I...

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,450
Should I call the police first?

102
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,170
Or should I take the baby
to a welfare institute?

103
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,290
Shulan, don't panic, don't panic.

104
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,120
I'll be there right away.

106
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,430

111
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,000
Look.

112
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,870
The baby looks so pitiful.

113
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,520
Look at this little baby.

114
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,190
The baby was right in here,

115
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,630
left at our courtyard gate.

116
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,560
There's a bottle and a formula too.

117
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,870
All packed up.

118
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,930
I don't know where the baby came from.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What should we do?

120
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,940
Should we call the police?

121
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,880
Call the police?

122
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,480
If the police
can't find the baby's parents,

123
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,920
they'll surely send the baby
to a welfare institute.

124
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,070
It'll work that way.

125
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,030
But I'm just worried.

126
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,810
The welfare institute
is already overburdened.

127
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,100
This baby is too little

128
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,120
to be left alone for even a minute.

129
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,600
With the limited staff
at the welfare institute,

130
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,059
they simply can't manage.

131
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
You're right.

132
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,200
They can't take proper care of him.

133
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,750
Too little.

134
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,510
How about

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,260
we keep him for a while?

136
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,990
When he's a bit older,

137
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,130
we can still send him
to the welfare institute then.

138
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,820
I suppose that could work.

139
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't have much going on right now,

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,260
so I can look after him.

141
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,440
But I'm still a bit worried.

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,790
What are you worried about?

143
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm afraid that
if we keep him for too long,

144
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,640
I'll get attached to him.

145
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
And if his family comes looking for him,

146
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,850
I won't be able to let him go.

147
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,390
We can discuss becoming godparents later,

148
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,210
and we can still see him when we want to.

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,670
Well,

150
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,670
let's keep him for now?

151
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,470
Just keep him.

152
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,600
Look at this baby.

153
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,120
Isn't he lovely?

We've pretty much figured out
Liang Jianbin's situation.

158
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,840
He's barely stayed in Gufeng County
these past two years.

His wife is farming at home

161
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,480
Are there any ex-convicts
in contact with him?

162
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,150
We've identified a few,

have unpredictable whereabouts.

164
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,840
It takes time to investigate them.

However, we've uncovered another lead.

166
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,960
Before Liang Jianbin went to prison,

167
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,910

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,030
Sure.

187
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,690
Thank you.

188
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
Do you think we should

189
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,720
summon Lin Yuyu for questioning?

190
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,050
Don't rush, don't rush.

191
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,410
Let's be steady.

192
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,510
The relationship between these two

193
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,510
can't be confirmed.

194
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,150
If it's not solid,

195
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,040
it'll be hard to get a statement.

196
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
Liang Jianbin is very skilled
at anti-investigation.

197
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,550
After we caught Hei,
he doesn't even go home.

198
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,240
He's not easy to deal with.

199
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,440
Let's not alert him.

200
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,270
If he really

201
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,750
spends so much money

202
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,200
on Lin Yuyu,

203
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,240
he'll contact her for sure.

204
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,170
Let's just wait.

205
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,130
Alright.

206
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,490
We'll monitor Lin Yuyu's communications
in real-time.

207
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Can you get us a car
with a local license plate

208
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,270
to stake out Lin Yuyu?

209
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,930
No problem.

210
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,280
Check the garage
to see if Lin Yuyu's car is there.

211
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,100
Captain Qi,

212
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,150
this residential area is quite upscale.

213
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,280
One even needs to swipe a card to enter.

214
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,510
You're such a blockhead.

215
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,150
Let's just sneak in with a resident.

216
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,140
Captain Qi.

217
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,390
I'll keep an eye on the car with Du.

218
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,790
You two watch the target.

219
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,590
Get in the car.

220
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,630
Thank you for your hard work.

221
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,290
Look, look.

222
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,790
We've explored this much.

223
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,250
Still no sign of anything.

224
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:22,800
Xiaoman.

225
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,300
Master.

226
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,610
Analyze this soil sample.

227
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,200
Let me see

228
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,790
if your skills are up to par.

229
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,850
Why are you giving me a pop quiz?

230
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:33,920
Alright.

231
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,290
I'll analyze it for you.

232
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,750
This soil should be divided
into three layers.

233
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,270
The first layer is the surface layer.

234
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,130
It's about 20 centimeters thick.

235
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,390
You can see it contains
abundant plant root systems.

236
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,550
The second layer is the alluvial layer.

237
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,670
It's grayish-brown.

238
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,320
It contains a large amount
of Liaojiang stones.

239
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,200
It's basically close
to the undisturbed soil.

240
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,440
Below is the yellowish-brown raw earth.

241
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,240
Xiaoman is learning so quickly.

242
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,670
I'm flattered.

243
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,770
Captain Luo, I have something to ask you.

244
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,600
We've almost finished exploring.

245
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,320
But we haven't seen any variegated earth.

246
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,910
Does this mean we haven't found any
traces of artificial tomb construction?

247
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,030
Based on the soil layers
we've seen so far,

248
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,960
you're correct.

249
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
So, does this mean

250
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,370
that we haven't found

251
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,670
any remains of tombs or mausoleums?

252
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,600
It's hard to say.

253
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,800
At this stage,
it's hard to say anything for certain.

254
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,790
Why have you been infected
by Director Zhang's way of speaking?

255
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,750
Ms. Luo.

256
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,390
Mr. Guo.

257
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,960
From what I heard,

258
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,800
there's no mausoleum on this mountain?

259
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,280
What's all this about?

260
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,630
I've been here since my twenties,

261
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,390
coming and going through wind and rain.

262
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,320
I've been guarding this place
for most of my life.

263
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,480
Everyone knows I've been guarding
Emperor Taizong of Han's tomb.

264
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,790
But in the end,

265
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,630
there's nothing here.

266
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,270
This is...

267
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,630
Really...

268
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,870
It's a waste of effort.

269
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,120
It's making us a laughingstock.

270
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,720
Chen, Chen, don't get upset.

271
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,000
It's possible that we

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,360
might have overlooked something
during our exploration.

273
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,240
We'll go back and have a meeting
to discuss it further.

274
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,840
Chen,

275
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,840
even if there's no mausoleum found
on Phoenix Mountain in the end,

276
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,300
your years of hard work
haven't been in vain.

277
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,120
Those stone tablets
at the foot of the mountain

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
all have significant historical value.

279
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,910
You see,
in case of a major event in our country,

280
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,960
the post office always issues
a set of commemorative stamps.

281
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,390
They're called commemorative covers.

282
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,320
These stone tablets

283
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,870
are equivalent to

284
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,240
the commemorative covers
of our Zi Mausoleum cultural heritage.

285
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,970
You've protected them so well.

286
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,050
Your contribution is immense.

287
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,750
You cultured people
do have a better grasp of the big picture.

288
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,760
These few words

289
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,750
have made me feel much better.

290
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,320
Is...

291
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,650
Is she your girlfriend?

292
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,720
Let him bring it.

293
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,630
Hello?

294
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Kun.

295
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,720
How's your recovery going?

296
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,240
Luo Qing and I have been too busy lately.

297
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,040
We haven't had time to visit you.

298
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,870
Very well.

299
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,550
Impressive. You can already say two words.

300
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,480
Guo and I have been really busy lately.

301
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,720
We've got time to update you
on the work progress.

302
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,120
Right.

303
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,390
The exploration work
on Phoenix Mountain is finished.

304
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,050
There's nothing underneath.

305
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,670
What?

306
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,630
Nothing at all.

307
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,030
Right.

308
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,670
Not only is there no tomb,

309
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,910
but there's not a single trace
of human activity.

310
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,390
So we're wondering
if there really is no tomb

311
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,790
or we've overlooked something in our work.

312
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,000
Two possibilities.

313
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,270
One,

314
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,270
it's...

315
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,600
First, according to historical records,

316
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,670
the Zi Mausoleum
among the Western Han Imperial Mausoleums

317
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,030
has a rather unique burial system.

318
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,430
Could it be an exception?

319
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,100
It might not

320
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,400
have structures like

321
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,069
main halls, side halls,
or mausoleum temples.

322
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,109
Second, the Phoenix Mountain area

323
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,349
is uneven in elevation.

324
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,440
And it has changed significantly
over the centuries.

325
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,240
The soil sampling
might be affected or disturbed.

326
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,920
Do we

327
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,680
share a brain?

328
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,740
Right, right, right.

329
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,200
He's still teasing me
even though he can't speak clearly.

330
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,160
Share a brain?

331
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,480
It's a tacit understanding.

332
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,590
Both of you are right.

333
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,750
I agree with your points.

334
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,160
But I think besides that,

335
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,550
according to the practice
of building mausoleums on mountains,

336
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,830
normally, the entrance to the tomb passage

337
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,440
should be around halfway up the mountain.

338
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,030
Take the King of Liang's Tomb
in Henan as an example.

339
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,590
Its tomb entrance
is halfway up the mountain.

340
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,000
So,

341
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,590
could it be that

342
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,550
our exploration position is too low

343
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,150
or the spacing between drill holes
is too wide?

344
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,200
Emperor Taizong was frugal.

345
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,340
The entrance...

346
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,240
The entrance might be quite small.

347
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,900
We didn't drill carefully enough
and missed it?

348
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Right.

349
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,070
I have an idea.

350
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,840
Second exploration.

351
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,880
You do understand me.

352
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,790
I think our work

353
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,250
needs to be more cautious.

354
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,070
This time, I want to

355
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,420
move the exploration position higher up

356
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,000
and make the drill hole spacing narrower.

357
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,750
I agree.

358
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,610
Archaeology...

359
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,000
Archaeology is a science.

360
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,200
We need to approach it
with a scientific attitude.

361
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,640
As long as our exploration
is rigorous enough,

362
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,150
the conclusions can be convincing.

363
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
Is that right?

364
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Right.

365
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,000
Alright, let's do it this way.

366
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,750
I'll report to the institute right away.

367
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,240
You should return to the team
as soon as possible.

368
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,160
Focus on your recovery.

369
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,240
Stop teasing us here.

370
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,960
Yes, yes, yes. Hurry and recover.

371
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,000
Let's work together.

372
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,750
We're waiting for you.

373
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,310
Tyrant

374
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,400
Luo

375
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,590
Qing.

376
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,400
You useless person.

377
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,050
You can't speak clearly, yet you still
don't forget to criticize me.

378
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,620
Gosh.

379
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,870
Yes, yes, yes.

380
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,400
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

381
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,350
Quick, drink some water, drink some water.

382
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,720
You've said so much all at once.

383
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,000
You must be exhausted.

384
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,190
Everyone,

385
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,880
today, we'll start the second round
of exploration.

386
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,030
From the foot of the mountain
to the middle,

387
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,030
we must explore it carefully again.

388
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,880
This time, we'll increase
the density of test holes.

389
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,350
The spacing between test holes should be
reduced from three meters to two meters.

390
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,640
Let's strive to make some discoveries
this time.

391
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,270
Alright, we can do this.

392
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,880
Okay.

393
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,750
Let's get started.

394
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,770
-Okay.
-Okay.

395
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,380
Captain Qi.

396
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,090
There's been some movement
on Lin Yuyu's side.

397
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,820
Just at noon,

398
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,910
Lin Yuyu made a phone call to Liang.

399
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,790
Do you have a recording?

400
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,530
Yes.

401
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,030
Where are you?

402
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,660
None of your business!

403
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,480
You're so quick to anger.

404
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,540
Have I offended you again?

405
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,790
Every time you call, it's never good news.

406
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,990
It's always about money, money, money.

407
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
How much do you want?

408
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,830
Ten.

409
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,580
I just gave you 10,
and now you want another 10?

410
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,840
Do you think I'm an ATM?

411
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,330
Aren't you capable of earning money?

412
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,550
Sir, where to?

413
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,890
Hongxing Hotel.

414
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,330
Will you give me or not?

415
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,480
Wait.

416
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,580
I have a business deal
that hasn't gone through yet.

417
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,090
I'll give you the money when it's done.

418
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,900
Captain Qi,

419
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,530
you're really amazing.

420
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,240
Lin Yuyu did ask Liang for money.

421
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,480
That's why we call Captain Qi
the relic detective.

422
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Where did the call

423
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,270
come from?

424
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,970
Right here in Qinchuan.

425
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,240
Alright.

426
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
To Qinchuan then.

427
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,510
It's getting dark soon. Why don't you
rest for the night before leaving?

428
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,880
Relics Dealers are like rats.

429
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,610
Their paws never stop.

430
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,550
Wait a minute,
and some relics will be gone.

431
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,710
Oh, right.

432
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,790
Well,

433
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,030
did he just say Hongxin or Hongxing?

434
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,750
It's hard to say.

435
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,030
We Hedong people don't distinguish between
front and back nasal sounds when speaking.

436
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,070
It could be either.

437
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,070
You can't even tell the difference?

438
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,820
Listen, listen again.

439
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,380
Come on.

440
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,550
Let's think about it.

441
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,960
Is there anything we've missed?

442
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,700
We haven't written down the "Hong"
meaning rainbow yet.

443
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,580
How is that possible?

444
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,030
Which hotel would use that word?

445
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,160
Why not?

446
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,690
The hotel next to my house uses it.

447
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,140
I'll write it down too.

448
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,000
Alright.

449
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,960
Stop writing.

450
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,200
The related hotels

451
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,240
are over 80.

452
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,830
My plan is, we'll split into four groups.

453
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
We'll check one by one.

454
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Check one by one?

455
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,150
What's wrong?

456
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,720
Let me tell you,

457
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,790
until there's a smarter way than mine,

458
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,200
this is the smartest approach.

459
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,020
Unless you have a better idea. Do you?

460
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,070
Do you?

461
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,030
Anyone?

462
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,860
Listen to my arrangement.

463
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,130
Four groups.

464
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,280
Yongfu...

465
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,210
I'll be in a group with Yongfu.

466
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,210
Alright.

467
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,510
Ding Yan and Yongfu.

468
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,200
Captain Yang and Du.

469
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
You find someone else on your own.

470
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,590
I'll team with Jia.

471
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,070
Okay?

472
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,320
Alright.

473
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,790
Jia.

474
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:21,880
Jia.

475
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,550
He's too tired.

476
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,050
He's fallen asleep.

477
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,800
Let him sleep for a while.

478
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,490
Okay.

479
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,880
Then we'll call it a day.

480
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,450
Let's get some sleep
and talk about it tomorrow.

481
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:15,270
[Qingyuan County]

482
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,070
A blind bet or not?

483
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,070
A blind bet. Here.

484
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,780
I'll check my card.

485
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,770
Coming.

486
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,750
Jianbin.

487
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,950
Have you found your wife?

488
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,030
She didn't go back to her hometown.

489
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,880
She didn't?

490
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,840
Why haven't we heard anything from her?

491
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,100
Her family called
and said she went to Jiaocheng.

492
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,780
Jiaocheng?

493
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,140
Jianbin, I'll go with you now.

494
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,970
Let's get this done first.

495
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,860
Where did you find the driver?

496
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,220
Don't worry, Jianbin.

497
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,480
We brought him from Qinchuan.

498
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,810
He's not from the local.

499
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,970
Where's Qiang?

500
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,070
He went out to buy some stuff.

501
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,720
Buy stuff?

502
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,830
Haven't we got all the tools we need?

503
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,480
We have.

504
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,750
Then what stuff does he need to buy?

505
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,550
He said we're still missing something.

506
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,490
Jianbin.

507
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,510
Qiang, we're about to start working.

508
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,270
You never miss a chance
to eat something, do you?

509
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,200
What do you know?

510
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,070
It's for good luck and safety.

511
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,720
Be sharp and smart.

512
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,750
Don't worry, Jianbin.

513
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,950
It's not the first time we've done this.

514
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,920
Where did you put the tools?

515
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,240
In the field up ahead,
with the mark I made.

516
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,590
What?

517
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,550
In the field up ahead, with the mark...

518
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,790
He made a mark.

519
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,300
Right.

520
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,480
Speak Mandarin.

521
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,590
Brothers,

522
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,920
kill him for me!

523
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,460
Hello?

524
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,280
A gang fight?

525
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,190
Where?

526
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
Okay, I'm coming now.

527
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,700
Let's go. Come with me.

528
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,320
Alright.

529
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,530
You've done well with this.

530
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,680
This will teach Mu Jianhui a lesson.

531
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,280
By crippling one of his arms,

532
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,970
he'll know how tough we are.

533
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,360
You go to Hong Kong first.

534
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,480
I'll call you if anything comes up.

535
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,070
Director.

536
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,840
Director.

537
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,590
Can he be saved?

538
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,030
Your brother's injuries are too severe.

539
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm afraid we can't treat him here.

540
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,070
I suggest

541
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,030
you transfer him to the main hospital
in Qinchuan.

542
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,630
Director,

543
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,740
I have plenty of money.

544
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,720
No matter what method you use,

545
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,160
you must cure him.

546
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,370
We can only do our best,

547
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,000
but you must bear the risks yourself.

548
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,810
I passed by here last night
on some business.

549
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,200
I noticed some commotion around here.

550
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,720
When I checked, oh boy,

551
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,590
there were at least a dozen people
fighting here.

552
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,650
They were all carrying iron weapons.

553
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,300
It was terrifying.

554
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,650
I came to check out the situation.

555
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,080
It scared me so much that my legs
went weak.

556
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,540
Anything else?

557
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,010
Chief Wu, we've found something here!

558
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,860
This could be a case of
tomb raiding and pit robbery.

559
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,310
Cao,

560
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,830
get some more of our men over here.

561
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,920
Search the surrounding area

562
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,270
to see if there are any looting pits.

563
00:29:59,270 --> 00:29:59,800
Alright.

564
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,600
Liu Gang,

565
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,160
take two men and search the area

566
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,960
for any suspicious tire tracks.

567
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,370
These people must have come by car.

568
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,100
If you find any,

569
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,350
confirm the time with the villagers.

570
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,070
Then check
with the traffic police department

571
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,810
about the vehicles at each intersection
during that period.

572
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,540
Understood.

573
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,650
Duan, let's go.

574
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,480
If we don't find any looting pits,

575
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,080
they probably started fighting
before they even began digging.

576
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,840
How should we look for it?

577
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,010
Yongfu.

578
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,840
There's also a Hongxing Hotel.

579
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,730
Take a look.

580
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,780
Hedong accent.

581
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,100
I don't usually stay here.

582
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,310
Wait a moment.

583
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,680
Honey!

584
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,240
Come here for a second!

585
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,170
Coming, coming!

586
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,240
Gosh.

587
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,610
What's the matter?

588
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,070
The police are here to investigate.

589
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,000
What do you want?

590
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,170
Ma'am, from your accent, I can tell

591
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,450
you're from Feng Village, right?

592
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,270
That's right, I am from Feng Village.

593
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,130
What's up? Do you need something?

594
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,280
It's nothing.

595
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,550
We're fellow villagers.

596
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,750
I'm also from Feng Village.

597
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,000
Y-You're also from Feng Village?

598
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,310
God.

599
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,510
It's fate to meet a fellow villager here.

600
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:19,970
Indeed.

601
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,480
What is it?
If you have something to say, go ahead.

602
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,110
It's nothing big.

603
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,370
It's like this, ma'am.

604
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,790
I'm here to look for someone.

605
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,250
Can you help me take a look?

606
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,450
Do you recognize this person?

607
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,550
This person

608
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,750
looks like the guest in Room 212.

609
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,050
Take a look.

610
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,030
It seems so.

611
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,440
Is he?

612
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,620
This...

613
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,120
Ma'am.

614
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,790
Are you sure?

615
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm sure about this.

616
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,030
This person is in his forties.

617
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,830
He wears a hat.

618
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,000
There's also a white-bearded old man
enshrined in the room.

619
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,030
He's very mysterious all day.

620
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,720
I don't know what he does all day.

621
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,400
Are you sure this person
is staying in your hotel?

622
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,730
Yes, he's staying here.

623
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,200
Is he in the room now?

624
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,160
He left yesterday.

625
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,490
He hasn't come back yet.

626
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,360
Come in.

627
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,600
Ding Yan.

628
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,390
Earth God.

629
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,350
No problem, it's him.

630
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,030
Fellow villager,

631
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,680
what did he do?

632
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,170
Nothing, ma'am.

633
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,480
Well, just pretend nothing happened.

634
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,960
Can you keep it a secret?

635
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,750
Yes, I can.

636
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,050
Well, you guys go on.

637
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,140
I'll leave then.

638
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
Call me if you need anything.

639
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,930
Okay, thank you.

640
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,730
Captain Qi.

641
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,960
We've got a lead.

642
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,660
Hongxing Hotel in Xingfu Third Village.

643
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,080
Don't move, don't move!

644
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,450
How is it?

645
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,270
He's lucky to be alive.

646
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,800
The surgery is successful.

647
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,760
That's great.

648
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,200
His life is saved.

649
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,400
But several of his organs
are severely damaged.

650
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,890
Especially the intestines,
with multiple areas of traumatic necrosis.

651
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,400
We had to perform a colostomy.

652
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,360
What does that mean?

653
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,690
For the rest of his life,

654
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,570
he may have to rely on a colostomy bag
for excretion.

655
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,400
Li Chunlai has identified someone.

656
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,800
Liang is the tomb raider.

657
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,620
Captain Qi.

658
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,710
Are you the organizer

659
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,630
in the Yin Village tomb robbery case?

660
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,290
No, I'm not.

661
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Then who contacted you?

662
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,710
I only know his nickname is King Hua.

663
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,480
What?

664
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,830
King Hua.

665
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,000
Have you met him?

666
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,710
Just once.

667
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,590
Where is he now?

668
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,480
I don't know.

669
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
Take a look. Is he King Hua you met?

670
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,320
It was a bit dark when I saw him.

671
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,650
I couldn't see clearly.

672
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,400
If King Hua is the organizer,
what's your role?

673
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,130
I'm just an on-site commander.

674
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,890
You recruited others?

675
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,940
How many? What did they do?

676
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,240
I brought two from my hometown.

677
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,150
One is Wu, Wu Shengyuan.

678
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,280
Another one's nickname is Scar.

679
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,490
His real name is Hu Jianshe.

680
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,160
We found Hei to be the gravedigger.

681
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,840
He's from the Northeast.

682
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,240
Where are your goods now?

683
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,550
They were snatched away.

684
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,530
Snatched away?

685
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,490
What happened?

686
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,710
When we just brought the goods
to the abandoned power plant,

687
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,760
a group of people showed up
before we could contact King Hua.

688
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,360
They all had their faces covered.
I couldn't see what they looked like.

689
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,190
But I feel

690
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,190
that their leader

691
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,790
should be the guy
who sold the explosives to me.

692
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,110
Now that I think about it,

693
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,840
we were tricked by that guy.

694
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,440
We were used as pawns.

695
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,120
Did that person's explosives
work very well?

696
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,060
They're incredibly precise.

697
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,890
What are you doing in Qinchuan this time?

698
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,690
Here to raid another tomb?

699
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,590
No.

700
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,920
Since Hei got caught,
things are tense, you know?

701
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,150
I didn't dare to stay long
in my hometown either.

702
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,630
So I found a crowded urban village.

703
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,190
I've stayed in the village hotel all day.

704
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That's not right.

705
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,480
When we were looking for you today,

706
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,070
the hotel owner told me

707
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
that last night,

708
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,030
you didn't come back all night.

709
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,640
Where did you go?

710
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,970
Well, you know, as a man...

711
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,440
It's no fun being alone all day.

712
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,960
I had to find a place

713
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,480
to relax a bit.

714
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,510
Relax?

715
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Where did you go?

716
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,190
I just found a girl
on the street in the village.

717
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,990
On the street?

718
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,190
Where did you sleep?

719
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,440
In a random hotel.

720
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,270
What hotel? What's its name?

721
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,020
I drank quite a bit last night.

722
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,990
I can't really remember.

723
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,550
What about the injury on your face?

724
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,840
I drank too much and fell.

725
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,300
Who are you trying to fool?

726
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,320
I really didn't do anything else.

727
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,590
You told Lin Yuyu

728
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,670
that you had a deal

729
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,480
that didn't work out.

730
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,410
Which deal is it?

731
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,940
He's not saying anything.

732
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,850
Alright.

733
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,590
Who contacted you?

734
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
How would I know?

735
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,710
They always contacted me
through public phones.

736
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,880
They'll contact me if they need anything.

737
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,320
I never contacted them.

738
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,940
Alright, alright.

739
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,320
You're so stubborn.

740
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,440
Well, how about

741
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,710
we hire an artist?

742
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,360
Let's draw together.

743
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,030
We'll draw

744
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,720
every artifact you stole

745
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,710
in Yin Village, one by one.

746
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,030
If Fang Kun finds out
the tomb raiders have been caught,

747
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,880
he might be so happy that he could jump.

748
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,030
I can hear it in your voice.

749
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,000
You're urging me
to solve the case quickly.

750
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,600
Captain Qi, I wouldn't dare.

751
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,710
Everyone knows that tomb-raiding cases

752
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,320
are notoriously difficult to solve.

753
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,760
At least the main culprit has been caught.

754
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,710
It would be helpful
for our archaeological research.

755
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,070
Captain Qi has always been
an expert in cultural relics.

756
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,230
He immediately showed our team
any information he had.

757
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,000
He gave us first-hand information.

758
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,150
Whether you mean it or not,

759
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,680
I love hearing you say that.

760
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,630
Fang Kun.

761
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,400
Hello.

762
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,480
Where did the patient in bed No. 31 go?

763
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,110
Fang Kun?

764
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,190
He was discharged an hour ago. Just left.

765
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,920
Discharged?

766
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,110
Who picked him up?

767
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,770
His family.

768
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,280
His legs aren't working well.

769
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,000
Why did he suddenly get discharged?

770
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,630
With his condition,

771
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,280
there's not much point
in him staying in the hospital anymore.

772
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,030
What do you mean?

773
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,920
Whether he can walk

774
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,670
doesn't depend on

775
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,480
a few days of rehabilitation
in the hospital.

776
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,030
It mainly depends on
whether the blood clot in his brain

777
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,710
can dissolve

778
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,510
and stop pressing on his nerves.

779
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,150
You mean,

780
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,230
as long as that blood clot in his brain
doesn't dissolve,

781
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,080
he might never be able to walk again
in his life?

782
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,400
It's possible.

783
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,480
The patient has undergone rehabilitation
for so long,

784
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,290
but there hasn't been much improvement.

785
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,150
He might have become a bit pessimistic

786
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,680
and decided to leave early.

787
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,070
Thank you.

788
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,940
No problem.

789
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:13,680
Let's go.

790
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,230
Let's go to his house to find him.

791
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,830
He probably won't be at home.

792
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,510
