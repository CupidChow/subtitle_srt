186
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,370
There was a man who gave her
flowers a couple of days ago.

187
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,730
He's from the Provincial
Identification Center.

188
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,210
And he graduated from Peking University.

189
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,400
Why are you such a gossiper?

190
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,610
So what if he's from
the Provincial Identification Center?

191
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,400
So what if he graduated
from Peking University?

192
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,560
Luo Qing is sitting in our yard right now.

193
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,330
Have you heard of the saying
"First come, first served?"

194
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,610
I'm going to interfere right away.

195
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,250
Are you going to act recklessly?

196
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,130
What are you going to do?

197
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,090
Y-You'd better run away. Let me tell you.

198
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,330
Can't you understand what I mean?

199
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,250
What I mean is...

200
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,250
Luo Qing is right next to us, isn't she?

201
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,640
-I'll beat you up.
-Professor Zan!

202
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,500
Professor Zan!

203
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:03,970
Young man,

204
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,090
could you tell me
if Professor Zan is here?

205
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:06,970
Mr. Zan

206
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,580
went to Beijing for a seminar.

207
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,400
He just left this afternoon.

208
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,460
He went to Beijing?

209
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,210
But you need to provide evidence as to

210
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,010
why these six items are claimed

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,730
to be from China.

212
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,160
Sir.

213
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,770
Your auction house

214
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,610
clearly stated in the item
description that

215
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,010
those six black pottery
figurines are from China.

216
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,310
From Qinchuan.

217
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,400
What more do I need to say?

218
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,760
We did mention the word China.

219
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,240
But that doesn't mean that
they automatically belong to you.

220
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,490
By your logic, does it mean that
you can claim ownership

221
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,210
of any items in our auction
related to China?

222
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,340
Blue and White Ruyi Vase,

223
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,430
which is dated back to
Qianlong Period of Qing Dynasty.

224
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,040
The shape, the decorative patterns,
and the inscriptions

225
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
showcase

226
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,370
the exquisite craftsmanship

227
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,450
and its cultural heritage of porcelain
production in Qing Dynasty.

228
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,730
Hello.

229
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,370
Could you please tell me

230
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,500
if that's the Jinyue Hotel in Beijing?

231
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,640
I'd like to ask whether

232
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,170
Professor Zan Maochang from
Qinbei University has checked in.

233
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,440
Okay. Thank you.

234
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,330
No?

235
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,130
Mr. Zan took a flight tonight.

236
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,920
Could it be that his flight was delayed
and hasn't landed yet?

237
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,580
At your archaeological site,

238
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,130
are there any other experts or professors?

239
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,040
Here's the thing.

240
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,760
Recently in Beijing, hasn't there

241
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,280
been an archaeological seminar
about Qin and Han Dynasties?

242
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,880
Almost all the experts who could
go from our side have gone there.

243
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,420
Chief Wang.

244
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
I'll call the municipal bureau
about this matter.

245
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,920
Let's see if we can still
find someone else.

246
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,580
Actually, we can answer
these three questions.

247
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:50,850
Do you guys

248
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,640
know how important this matter is?

249
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,560
Is this the time to pretend that
you're capable?

250
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,880
We can't meddle in this matter.

251
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,610
Yes, we know.

252
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,330
If our answers are even slightly wrong,

253
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,390
those six black pottery figurines
can't be retrieved.

254
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,130
It's probably difficult to find
our teacher at this hour.

255
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,950
Anyway,

256
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,640
there are still 20 minutes left.

257
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,780
It's up to you guys.

258
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,640
Hello?

259
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,340
Hello?

260
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,490
Mr. Zan.

261
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:23,990
Sir.

262
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,450
I believe it's necessary to remind you

263
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,130
that there's only half an hour left

264
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,880
before the auction of
those six black pottery figurines.

265
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,740
Chief Wang, Mr. You.

266
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,110
Those three students are all excellent.

267
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,570
Don't worry. Leave this matter to them.

268
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,170
Time waits for no one.

269
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,970
Start working at once.

270
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,500
Fang Kun,

271
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,850
I'll be waiting by the phone for you.

272
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,100
Don't let this matter go wrong.

273
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,130
-Turn on the computer and take notes.
-Okay.

274
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,660
Luo Qing.

275
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,640
Come on. Search for some brief reports
about the excavation of

276
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,370
the outer burial pits in Yangling
and their subordinate tomb‌s.

277
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,160
Yangling has the largest number
of unearthed nude figurines.

278
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,040
There are also photos that were
taken when they were unearthed

279
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,880
and some other details.

280
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,160
Well, Chief Wang, Mr. You,

281
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,610
please take some photos to record this.

282
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,250
-Okay.
-The camera is over there.

283
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,040
I'll do it.

284
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,280
Are you ready?

285
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,520
If you're ready, let's begin.

286
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,330
I'll dictate it, and you'll write it.

287
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,370
Ladies and gentlemen,

288
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,630
now we're going to auction Lot Number 32.

289
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,850
This is a collection of black nude pottery
figurines from Qinchuan City, China.

290
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,790
Please take a closer look.

291
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,450
As you can see, the female

292
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,380
and male forms are very exquisite,

293
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,090
as well as the facial expressions,

294
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,680
they are really realistic.

295
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,680
This is a high-class artistic object

296
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,520
and is considered to be
a burial object as well.

297
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,620
These cultural relics are burial objects
from imperial tombs.

298
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,610
These nude figurines were
originally supposed to be

299
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,450
clothed pottery figurines.

300
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,130
During production,
the head, body, and feet

301
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,400
need to be glued together.

302
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,060
After getting dry, they are then colored.

303
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,690
Next,

304
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,090
hands and arms made of wood

305
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,750
are assembled.

306
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,620
Finally,

307
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,850
they are put together to
form a complete human figurine.

308
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,810
The price for Lot Number 32

309
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,120
is starting at 800 dollars.

310
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,610
Please raise your paddles for bidding.

311
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,520
820 dollars.

312
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,520
850 dollars here.

313
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,760
900 dollars.

314
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,610
They were first excavated in the Yangling
Mausoleum Area of Emperor Jing of Han.

315
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,880
There was the largest quantity

316
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,010
with the most complete category.

317
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,250
Both male and female figurines were found.

318
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,180
Different roles were discovered.

319
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,850
Secondly, in the 1980s,

320
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,560
excavations were carried out at Duling
Mausoleum of Emperor Xuan of Western Han.

321
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,610
The quantity was not as
large as that of Yangling.

322
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,040
The third batch was excavated
in the early and late 1980s

323
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,490
from Maoling Mausoleum
of Emperor Wu of Han.

324
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,250
The fourth batch was
excavated in the 1990s

325
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,760
from the southwest part of Changling
Mausoleum of Emperor Gaozu of Han.

326
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,820
The sizes were generally consistent,

327
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,770
but only male figurines were found.

328
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,680
The fifth batch was found in Bacunbao,
the northwest area of

329
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,880
Han Dynasty's Chang'an City.

330
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,520
Fragments of nude pottery figurines
were discovered during the survey.

331
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,370
Later, in Bacunbao,
archaeologists also found

332
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,770
workshops for making nude figurines

333
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,850
and some unfired nude figurines.

334
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,850
How many times now?

335
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,880
T-T-T-The fifth time. The fifth time.

336
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,740
The fifth time.

337
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,870
Why do I remember that
there are six times?

338
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,000
Where did they do it for the sixth time?

339
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,420
For the sixth time, it was at...

340
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,490
Ladies and gentlemen,

341
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,170
are there any higher
bids for Lot Number 32?

342
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,450
1,500 dollars!

343
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,079
The King of Liang...
The Mausoleum of the King of Liang.

344
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,359
The information about the King of Liang.

345
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,520
This one.

346
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,760
-It's in...
-It's in Mangshan, Henan.

347
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,359
The Mausoleum of the King
of Liang in Mangshan.

348
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,360
Okay.

349
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:34,870
I got it.

350
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,490
Mr. Manager,

351
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,330
may I use your computer
for a little while?

352
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,330
Just for a moment.

353
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:45,840
Sir.

354
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,470
Please take a look.

355
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,650
If you have any questions,

356
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,930
I'd be glad to explain them to you.

357
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,330
1,600 dollars!

358
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,910
Any there any higher bids?

359
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,280
1,600 dollars, going once.

360
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,840
-1,600 dollars, twice.
-Wait!

361
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

362
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,630
I'm very sorry to inform you that

363
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,240
the acution for Lot 32 is

It's a replica.

391
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,620
It's a later replica
from the Qing Dynasty.

The craftsmanship is not bad.

546
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,080
I can only buy

547
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,040
100 pieces.

548
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,040
100 pieces?

549
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,080
Yes.

550
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,550
If you don't agree, it's fine.

551
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,160
You can find someone else.

552
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,690
No problem.

553
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,450
The quality of the goods
isn't for me to decide.

554
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,940
Just see how the market
responds to the 100 pieces.

555
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,940
If it works out, there will be
more opportunities.

556
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,200
If it doesn't work out,

557
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,980
I'll owe you a favor.

558
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,020
I'll wait for your news about the rest.

559
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,360
Even if others want them, I won't sell.

560
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,080
Okay.

561
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,990

giving us a hard time.

[Yangling Archeology Base]

563
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,360
Drawing artefact illustrations
and tidying up rooms

564
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
are just tasks for undergraduates.

565
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,290
Why did he ask graduate students
to waste time on these things?

566
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,880
This is not a waste of time.

567
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,360
Undergraduate education is meant to be

568
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,650
cultivating basic interests.

569
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,520
These professional skills

570
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,780
are all acquired through further study.

571
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,250
I'm going to do fieldwork in the future.

572
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,240
There are technicians to
draw these things.

573
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,370
If you can accept that
your drawing skills are not

574
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,050
as good as the technicians' in the field,

575
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,850
just go ahead.

576
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,360
That's right.

577
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,930
Let me learn about

578
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,800
what level a top talent from
Peking University is really at.

579
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,330
Alright.

580
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,800
Since you have insights,
let's discuss. Come on.

581
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,390
Bring it on.

582
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,860
I wouldn't dare.

583
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,570
Alright.

584
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,490
It looks quite similar.

585
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,410
But in terms of archaeology, is it enough
to just capture the likeness?

586
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,870
I've noticed that you've
been here for just a short time.

587
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,360
Let me briefly summarize

588
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,760
the basics that Mr. Zan
usually teaches us.

589
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,550
Listen carefully.

590
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,970
Put on your glasses.

591
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,170
Look at

592
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,170
Mr. Zhang's drawing of Jiang Tribe.

593
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,750
That's a very standard archaeological illustration.

594
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,210
It's primitive,

595
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,340
full of vitality

596
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
and interesting.

597
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,350
Look. What features does
your drawing have?

598
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
It looks as cold as winter.

599
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,880
Mr. Zhang, whom you've mentioned,

600
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,040
is the pioneer of archaeological
illustrations in China.

601
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,500
How can I compare with him?

602
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,220
Why did you stand up?

603
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,560
We're in class.

604
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,220
Why did you stand up? Sit down!

605
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,370
If you can't draw well, just learn.

606
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,600
If you can't draw well in a month,

607
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,760
can't you draw for two months?

608
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,600
If you can't draw well
in two months, draw for a year.

609
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,260
Keep drawing until it's good.

610
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,560

611
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,220
I have something to say.

613
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,210

Come with me on a mission.

615
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,010
Mr. Zan, what mission is it?

616
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,450
A robbed Tang-Dynasty tomb that's not far
from Yangling has been discovered.

to conduct emergency excavations
as soon as possible.

620

Alright. Let's pack up
and set off quickly.

621

not only lakcs artistry

624
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,490
but also doesn't meet the most
basic scientific standards.

Alright. Stay here and keep drawing.

Luo Qing has only
been here for half a month.

Why can she go and I can't?

631
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,630
Because she draws better than you.

632

But I've been drawing carefully, too.

633
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,490
Look at these calluses on my hands.

634
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,140
They can prove my hard work.

635
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,930
Effort without diligence is wasted effort.

After eight months, this is what
you've accomplished?

640

What have you been
thinking about all this time?

641
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,180

I...

650
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,450
So you're talking about

651
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,080
You're an expert in Qin and Han Dynasties.

652

654
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,230
How can you say this Tang Dynasty tomb
has nothing to do with me?

655
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,820
Think about its location.

656
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,920
It's very close to our Yangling.

657
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,570

I know your little scheme.

664
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,120
Your Yangling research is short of funds,

665
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,930
so you've taken on
the emergency excavations

666
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,970

667
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,630

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,080
Right?

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,260
Xinzhi, here's the thing.

671
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,850
Just do me a favor this time.

initiated by your provincial institute.

674
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,540
You'll be the team leader.
It's such a great opportunity.

675

Just let my students and me

676

be your assistants.

677
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,600
You'll make decisions on vital matters.

678
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,800
I'll help you with the trivial matters.

679
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,770

No hurry.

687
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,020
The herbs are ready.

688
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,850
I'll decoct them for you first.

690
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,180
Next year...

691
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,130
Next year, we'll move to a bigger house.

692
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,940
We'll find one with a balcony.

693
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,610
You can sunbathe every day.

694
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,070
How can we afford to move?

695
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,250
Don't say that.

696
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,210
If others can get rich, so can we.

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,800
Where did you go today?

698
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,790
Where else could I go?

699
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,770
I was selling goods at my stall.

at noon, but you weren't there.

At noon?

00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,600
At noon,

704
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,350
I went away to buy this for you.

705
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,120
Look.

706
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,010
If you need anything in the future,

707
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,340
just call me directly.

708
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,850
Where did you get the money?

709
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,690
I had savings.

710
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,890
Can you do me a favor?

711
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,040
There's something under the bed.

712
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,380
Can you take it out for me?

713
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,580
What is it?

714
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,850
How do you explain the pottery
figurines in the suitcase?

715
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:05,120
You must have robbed the grave
with Sheng and the others.

716
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,980
I bought those pottery figurines

717
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,770
from the countryside.

718
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,239
You're still lying to me.

719
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,409
I'm not lying to you.

720
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,600
Because of my damned illness,

721
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,489
all our family incomes have
been used on my medicine.

722
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,489
Where could you get money to buy goods?

723
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,770
Where could you get money
to buy me a mobile phone

724
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,900
and all those herbs?

725
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,520
We can't do bad things like that.

726
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,469
It will come back to haunt us sooner or later.

727
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,770
I can't control Sheng anymore.

728
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,600
Just let him be.

729
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,489
But I can't watch you

730
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,219
stray from the righteous path.

731
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,120
Shulan.

732
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,520
Look.

733
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,449
Why did you start crying
while we were talking?

734
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,710
Think about it.

735
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,050
What kind of person is Sheng?

736
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,120
He's mindful of every penny.

737
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,820
Would he let me participate

738
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,679
in the profitable business?

739
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:54,889
Besides,

740
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,810
I can't do laborious work.

741
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:57,720
I can be neither a grave digger

742
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,180
nor an on-site commander.

743
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,370
I've just had a bit of luck recently.

744
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,490
My friend from the countryside
was willing to give me goods on credit

745
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,290
so that I could earn some profit.

746
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,550
You're not lying to me?

747
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,840
How would I lie to you?

748
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,490
You're annoying. I was so scared.

749
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,160
Don't be scared.

750
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,890
Look at the mobile phone.
Come on. Open the box.

751
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,770
Look.

752
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,610
It's a new model.

753
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,420
Not much.

754
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,500
10,000 yuan.

755
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,680
It's up to you how much you'll give

756
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,940
to your grave diggers.

757
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,850
Bro, I've made up my mind.

758
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
I won't do anything else from now on.

759
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,630
I'll just work for you.

760
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,120
I'll do whatever you say.

761
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,010
No rush. Take it slow.

762
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,240
Our good days are yet to come.

763
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,970
When we were at the watch factory,

764
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,640
I knew you would accomplish great things

765
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,740
and would be someone important.

766
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,420
In your opinion,

767
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,870
what kind of person is important?

768
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,850
Well, people like

769
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,600
the emperors of Qin, Han, Tang and Song Dynasties.

770
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,130
Alright.

771
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,370
From now on, as for the treasures
used by emperors and ministers,

772
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,970
we'll take whatever we want.

773
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,720
Okay.

Thanks for your hard work, Captain Qi.

778
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,390
Your trip to Suizhou in the south
was quite fruitful.

779
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,790
[Qi Dacang, Captain of Relics Inspection
Team of Municipal Public Security Bureau]

780
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,010
I'm ashamed. We only retrieved
34 black pottery figurines.

781
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,410
The other ones were all lost.

782
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,140
You've already done your best.

783
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,650
I know everyone is concerned about

784
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,240
the current state of the six withdrawn

785
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,500
black pottery figurines from
the Winthrop Auction House.

786
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,640
We've just received news from the embassy.

787
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,770
The foreign customs have
detained these cultural relics.

788
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,770
The reason is that

789
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,490
the evidence we provided is too simple.

790
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,160
They've raised more questions.

791
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,410
For example,

792
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,850
can we specify

793
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,520
how many

794
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,370
pottery figurines there were in the tomb?

795
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,330
In addition,

796
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,010
what else

797
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,810
was in the tomb?

798
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,010
Right now, we don't

799
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,940
even know where the looting pit is.

800
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,720
How could we know
what it's like inside the tomb?

801
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,520
Ultimately,

802
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,370
we need to find the looting pit where
the black pottery figurines were unearthed

803
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,310
and prove that

804
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,070
the black pottery figurines are indeed from that looting pit.

807

Whether we can retrieve these six black pottery figurines

808
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,400
depends on whether our police officers

809
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,120
can solve this case.

810
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,850
What's the time limit?

811
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,450
One month.

Here!

815

When you dealth with this batch of
pottery figurines this time,

816
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,730
what clues did the Suizhou police provide?

817
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,720
Sir!

818
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,970
Based on the information
we currently have,

819
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,010
we only know that
those six black pottery figurines

820
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,820
and these 34 black pottery figurines

821
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,750
were purchased from Qinchuan
and sold to Suizhou by

822
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,600
someone nicknamed
King Hua eight months ago.

823
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,450
Six pieces were smuggled abroad through Hong Kong.

824
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,490
Within just eight months, they were
sold to a foreign auction house.

825
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,370
It's obvious that

826
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,200
this underground cultural
relic trading chain

827
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,560
is already very mature.

828
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,770
So, if we can find King Hua,

829
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,560
we'll find this Grave Robbery Gang

830
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,170

But he's very cunning.

In terms of its form,

850

we can only determine that

851

there are 11 emperor mausoleums
from the Western Han Dynasty.

isn't for nothing.

909
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,470
No matter what news it is,

910
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,780
as long as it passes by his ears,

911
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,340
some secrets will have to be left behind.

912
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,470
I'd better not tell him
anything in the future.

913
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,730
Hey, Mr. Know-it-all.

914
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,140
Do you have any acquaintances
from the Public Security Bureau?

915
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,340
I'd like to take a look at those
black pottery figurines.

916
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,260
That's the Public Security Bureau.

917
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,430
It's not like I own that place.

918
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,870
Not anyone can go in there.

919
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,930
Why don't you ask me

920
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,030
if I have any acquaintances
from the Identification Center

921
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,030
who can take you inside for a look?

922
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,630
The Identification Center?

923
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,610
After those relics are retrieved,

924
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,300
don't they have to be checked
at the Identification Center first?

925
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,160
Do you have acquaintances there?

926
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,320
No, I don't.

927
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,780
There was a man who gave her
flowers a couple of days ago.

928
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,700
He's from the Provincial
Identification Center.

929
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,030
And he graduated from Peking University.

930
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,310
Miss Luo.

931
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,340
You must be tired of
eating leeks all this time.

932
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,390
How about this?

933
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,780
I'll take you to the downtown tomorrow.

934
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,180
Why don't we eat some better food?

935
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,510
Are you serious?

936
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,310
It's my treat.

937
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,430
[Hou Yuelai, Provincial Cultural Relics
Identification Center]

938
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,140
I heard that

939
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,340
the police retrieved a batch
of black pottery figurines.

940
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,780
Are some of them

941
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,580
at your Identification Center?

942
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,340
The current situation is like this.

943
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,080
The higher-ups are also asking
us to produce a report.

944
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,660
They want to know if we can
provide some useful clues

945
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,390
for retrieving those six
pieces from our country.

946
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,300
We're racking our brains over it, too.

947
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,230
What do you mean?

948
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,070
Didn't you guys answer

949
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,550
their questions last time?

950
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,150
This time,

951
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,910
they raised a few more tricky questions.
