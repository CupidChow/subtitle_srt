[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,810
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,850
Fifty thousand.

4
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,710
This antique-style thing is just a copy.

5
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,520
I can pay for it,

6
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,040
but I need to be fully convinced.

7
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,710
Dude,

8
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,040
I heard from my nephew

9
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,810
that you're also an expert.

10
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,190
I'd like to test you.

11
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,840
There's both

12
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,970
real and fake stuff

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
in this place.

14
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,430
Can you tell?

15
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,020
Be careful.

16
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,200
Don't worry.

17
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,190
This Lang kilin red vase—

18
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,220
You could say it's real

19
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,590
or fake.

20
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,120
Tell me about it.

21
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,170
During the Qing's Kangxi era,
many Xuande porcelains were imitated,

22
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,380
but

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,850
they failed to replicate
the Xuande red porcelain.

24
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,980
Later, Lang Tingji from the Kangxi era

25
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,400
successfully imitated the Lang kiln red,

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
which is as red as chicken blood,

27
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,079
with ox-hair patterns in the glaze,

28
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,310
an unglazed base,

29
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,520
and white straw-wick edging.

30
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,470
Call it real—

31
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,760
it's real by today's standards.

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,090
Call it fake—

33
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,960
it's a copy

34
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,750
in the Qing dynasty.

35
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,030
You've got sharp eyes.

36
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,720
However,

37
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,280
even I was almost

38
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,560
fooled

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,190
by your vase.

40
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,680
So you mean

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
this

42
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,520
is still a fake?

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,750
Craft-wise,

44
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,610
I can say it's flawless.

45
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,400
Look at the base—

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,800
the glaze stops cleanly,

47
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,800
which takes real skill.

48
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,230
The firing was spot-on.

49
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,120
I dare say

50
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,490
even a craftsman from Kangxi's time

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,960
would be impressed.

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,150
You're an expert indeed.

53
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,750
So why

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,520
do you

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,800
say it's fake?

56
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,000
Visually,

57
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,920
it fooled me too.

58
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,690
But once I held it,

59
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,430
I knew it was fake.

60
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,830
A real Lang kilin red is

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,190
evenly weighted.

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,180
But this one's top-light and bottom-heavy.

63
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,360
All the weight sits at the base.

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,800
Dude,

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
at least ten experts

66
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,560
have seen this vase.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,830
Not one

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,680
dared say it was fake.

69
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,430
Experts won't say it,

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,310
but what if we test it with machines?

71
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,170
What machines?

72
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,890
Aren't they man-made too?

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,920
To tell you the truth,

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,240
in our town,

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,600
whether it's glaze from

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,330
the Ming's Chenghua era or Qing's Kangxi,

77
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,240
you can buy it,

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,390
and take soil from ancient kiln sites

79
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,880
to fire porcelain.

80
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,260
Its composition will be
exactly like the originals.

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,190
You're being so honest.

82
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,430
Aren't you afraid I'll steal it?

83
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,430
What I just told you

84
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,600
took our ancestors
over 100 years to develop.

85
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,870
You think you can steal that?

86
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,600
Still fake in the end, isn't it?

87
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,190
My brother was right.

88
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,040
Your brother was right indeed,

89
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,990
but he doesn't get the final say.

90
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,750
No offense,

91
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,610
but who are you?

92
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,830
Can you override ten experts?

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,390
Sir,

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,390
seems I misjudged this time.

95
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,010
I said I wanted to be
convinced before buying.

96
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,480
And now I've seen

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
your craftsmanship.

98
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,870
I'll take the vase.

99
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,840
You can't afford it.

100
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,800
Not even close.

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
You can sell it to a private museum.

102
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,730
Why not me?

103
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,680
Dude,

104
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,880
you're quite the stickler, aren't you?

105
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,310
If we're really getting into it,

106
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,220
how could you tolerate fakes?

107
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,030
Those who come to buy from me,

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,430
some have poor judgment,

109
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,630
some just turn a blind eye,

110
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,560
but no one stares at
every flaw like you do.

111
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,650
I've been in this trade for over 40 years.

112
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,560
Faking pieces is the easy part.

113
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,460
Reading people

114
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,180
is one of my skills too.

115
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,000
You're a master.

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,290
I can't see through you.

117
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,040
But this guy beside you?

118
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,560
One look and I know

119
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:47,650
he's a tomb raider.

120
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,040
Sir,

121
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,700
you've got sharp eyes.

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,340
We only deal in real antiques,

123
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,890
and you only deal in fakes.

124
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,550
Normally, we don't
interfere with each other.

125
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,020
But your business is getting too big—

126
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,360
even my clients are buying your stuff.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,480
I don't mean anything else.

128
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm just curious

129
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,630
who on earth could fool them.

130
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,220
Wrong.

131
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,180
Not fooled.

132
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,720
They bought it willingly.

133
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,560
So what if it's fake?

134
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,120
Even emperors Yongzheng
and Qianlong liked copies.

135
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,200
There are so many antique dealers,

136
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,480
but not enough real stuff to go around.

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,190
Fakes fill the gaps.

138
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,320
Private museums, auction houses—

139
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,990
how would they survive without

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,040
my fakes?

141
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,330
Nine out of ten collectors buy fakes.

142
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,560
Nine out of ten experts are dumb.

143
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,280
The poor want to get rich overnight.

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,370
The rich want to keep
or grow their wealth.

145
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,750
As long as someone's buying,

146
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,560
I could

147
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,890
call it

148
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,190
real or fake

149
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,830
as I like.

150
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,800
Sir, this trip wasn't in vain.

151
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,250
I've learned a lot.

152
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,120
The money isn't taken for nothing.

153
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,000
Apart from this Lang kiln red vase,

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
pick anything else you like.

155
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,020
I'll give you one more advice:

156
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,010
Water too clear has no fish;

157
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,840
People too discerning have no followers.

158
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,750
In this circle,

159
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,049
how many truly deal in genuine artifacts?

160
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,840
Guang,

161
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,030
"Water too clear has no fish;

162
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,410
People too discerning have no followers."

163
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,740
You get what that means?

164
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,200
Means clear water can't support fish.

165
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,200
But

166
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,000
what's that second part about?

167
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,320
The second part means

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,520
if a person sees too clearly,
they'll have no companions.

169
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,470
I still don't understand

170
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,730
what we went there for.

171
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,150
We paid tens of thousands

172
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,410
and came back with this fake plate.

173
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,030
Why?

174
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,390
The truth.

175
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,750
The truth?

176
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,320
You know how that fake plate

177
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,030
ended up in the Mingde Museum?

178
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,910
Xiao bought it,

179
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,610
to fool Zhao Youlin.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,720
You really think

181
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,550
Zhao Youlin didn't know it was fake?

182
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,480
Even if he knew it was fake,

183
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
his friends didn't know what it was.

184
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,960
Do you think his friends

185
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,220
didn't know it's fake?

186
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,720
You think they really care about antiques?

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Then what do they care about?

188
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,440
To them, authenticity doesn't matter.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,870
Connections do.

190
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,480
They don't play antiques.
They play people.

191
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,200
In times without heroes,

192
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,150
even scoundrels can become famous.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,330
Those in high positions

194
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,790
are full of opportunists.

195
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,760
What does that mean?

196
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,860
Not to know is not to know. That's wisdom.

197
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,720
You're wiser than Zhao Youlin and his men.

198
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,400
Let's go.

199
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,450
From now on,

200
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,370
we have a lot to do.

201
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,750
Okay.

202
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,720
Jianhui, you didn't take the plate.

203
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,360
Just leave it there for use.

204
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,440
You can keep it.

205
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,930
Alright, thanks.

206
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,120
Wen Wen.

207
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,610
Wen Wen.

208
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm back.

209
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,690
You're back.

210
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,020
Wait, let me wash my hands. They're dirty.

211
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,300
I forgot to change my shoes again.

212
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,840
I must say, you're quite carefree.

213
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,120
She's already 11 weeks pregnant.

214
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,380
Why are you coming now?

215
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,870
11 weeks?

216
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,750
I'm sorry, doctor. I'm so sorry.

217
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,360
I... I really was too careless.

218
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,800
Why are you apologizing to me?

219
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,730
You should apologize to your wife.

220
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,220
Stop it.

222
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,600
She's just pregnant.

223
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,570
It's still a delicate time.

224
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,770
You mustn't hold her.

225
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,120
Hello.

226
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,650
Looking for something?

227
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,080
I'm from a publishing house.

228
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Is Mr. Mu here?

229
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,650
Publishing house?

230
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,850
Come in. He's inside.

231
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,320
Mr. Peng,

232
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,370
although I dabble in many fields,

233
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,550
I really don't know

234
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,750
what to write about.

235
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,320
What direction do you think I should take?

236
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,200
Song porcelain is quite popular lately.

237
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,960
We could

238
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,080
write something about that

239
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,380
to test the waters.

240
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,840
After all, we're self-publishing.

241
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,600
We should consider the sales potential.

242
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,790
Forget about it.

243
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,320
Too many people are working on that.

244
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I've said it before,

245
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm not doing this for money.

246
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,150
It's purely for sharing knowledge.

247
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,480
What do you think

248
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,110
about black pottery figurines?

249
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,390
Black pottery figurines?

250
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,320
That could work.

251
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,550
I have a friend whose cousin

252
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,830
works in archaeology.

253
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,870
The black pottery figurines
passed through his hands back then.

254
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,360
It caused quite a stir
when they were brought back to China.

255
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,820
No one here had seen
anything like it before.

256
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,240
Where did he do his archaeological work?

257
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,100
In Yin Village.

258
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,870
I heard

259
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
they discovered a large tomb there.

260
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,320
I have some knowledge
about black pottery figurines.

261
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,720
I'll write about it then.

262
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,200
Director Zhang,

263
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,320
isn't the scenery here
in Yin Village beautiful?

264
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,150
Of course.

265
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,520
If it weren't,

266
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,350
why would nobles be buried here?

267
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,090
The ancients said,

268
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
"Serve the dead as you
would serve the living."

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,270
Even in death, they wanted a scenic view.

270
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Director Zhang,

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,030
so who do you think

272
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,790
could be buried down there?

273
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,500
Well, that depends on what you dig up.

274
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,560
Isn't that why you called me here?

275
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,050
I've been waiting for you two to speak up.

276
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,080
This tomb must be big.

277
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,420
Come on.

278
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,320
Here.

279
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,000
Look.

280
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,910
Based on recent surveys,

281
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,750
we've concluded that

282
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,320
this tomb faces east

283
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,130
with four burial passages:

284
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
North passage: 36.5 meters long,

285
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,910
7.8–31.3 meters wide;

286
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,840
South passage: 32.7 meters long,

287
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,080
9.7–40.2 meters wide;

288
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,840
West passage: 46.7 meters long,

289
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
6–30.8 meters wide;

290
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,240
East passage: 134.5 meters long,

291
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,080
9.7–40.2 meters wide.

292
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,880
I asked you to come here
to investigate the cultural relics,

293
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,060
and you've discovered

294
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,610
a large tomb in the shape
of the character "亚".

295
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,790
This is a big deal.

296
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,240
I need to report this to my superiors.

297
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
Director Zhang,

298
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,240
you haven't said yet.

299
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,370
Who do you think could be buried there?

300
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,670
It's hard to say.

301
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,230
When the black pottery figurines
were first discovered,

302
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,530
the academic community discussed this.

303
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,280
Some people thought

304
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,910
it might be

305
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,490
Princess Guantao's tomb.

306
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,000
But now it seems

307
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,870
it's unlikely to be

308
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,120
Princess Guantao's tomb.

309
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
Then let me make a bold guess.

310
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,260
Could it possibly be
the tomb of Emperor Taizong of Han?

311
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,860
You really dare to guess, kid.

312
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,120
You're quite bold.

313
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,870
Aren't you afraid that if word gets out,

314
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,270
people will say you're
just making a scene?

315
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,390
For centuries,

316
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,660
everyone has believed Emperor Taizong's
Zi Mausoleum is on Phoenix Mountain.

317
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,380
But we've gone through

318
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,670
tons of historical records,

319
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,320
and found the saying might be

320
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,260
based on a misunderstanding.

321
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,890
In fact,

322
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,640
it's made me even more convinced

323
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,220
the Zi Mausoleum isn't there.

324
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,500
Let's go.

325
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,960
Let's check out Phoenix Mountain.

326
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,910
In the Records of the Grand Historian,

327
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,670
Emperor Taizong of Han's will said:

328
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,200
"Zi Mausoleum shall follow
the natural landscape, no alterations."

329
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,910
That's why

330
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,960
people later believed

331
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,080
that the Zi Mausoleum
utilized the original terrain,

332
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,510
without building an earthen mound,

333
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,420
using the mountain as the mausoleum.

334
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:45,940
Look,

335
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,360
doesn't the Phoenix Mountain

336
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,020
look like a flying phoenix
spreading its wings?

337
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,290
That protruding hill

338
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,620
is the phoenix's head.

339
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,300
Looking from afar,

340
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,240
the mountain is steep and precipitous,

341
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,030
with an extraordinary grandeur.

342
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,240
It does look like

343
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,200
a large natural burial mound.

344
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
If we consider

345
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,670
"not building a mound,
but using a mountain as a mausoleum"

346
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,400
as a criterion for
identifying the Zi Mausoleum,

347
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,510
then I believe the tomb in Yin Village

348
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,040
also meets this condition.

349
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,500
We've measured it.

350
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,700
The tomb in Yin Village
is circular in shape,

351
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
with an elevation of
over 750 meters on all sides.

352
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
It's also the highest point
on the western side of Bailu Plain.

353
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,050
According to

354
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,440
Luo Tianxiang's
"Classified Records of Chang'an,"

355
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,150
the Zi Mausoleum is near
Phoenix Mountain north of Bailu Plain,

356
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,270
however,

357
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,440
Fang Kun and I are doubt about

358
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,670
the academic value of that book,

359
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,550
as we haven't found any records

360
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,080
of this person in other historical texts.

361
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,010
These stone tablets were erected
during the Ming and Qing dynasties.

362
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,920
Why have they stood here
for hundreds of years?

363
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,250
Because people

364
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,770
believe in them.

365
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,770
In the last century,

366
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,720
many renowned Chinese and foreign scholars

367
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,180
came to Phoenix Mountain
for field research

368
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,930
and reached the same conclusion.

369
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,170
They believed that

370
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,359
Phoenix Mountain is the Zi Mausoleum.

371
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
After the founding of New China,

372
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,510
we also conducted
several archaeological studies

373
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,950
and finally reached

374
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,579
[Zi Mausoleum of Emperor Taizong of Han]

375
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,780
the same conclusion.

376
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,290
Your speculation is bold.

377
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,270
I support

378
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,510
your idea,

379
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,000
but

380
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,420
if you want to topple a scholarly pillar,

381
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,450
you'd better tread carefully.

382
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,590
Do you know how significant this is?

383
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,550
I know.

384
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,480
Director Zhang,

385
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,580
we know this speculation
is too revolutionary.

386
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,210
If we're right,

387
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,160
we'll correct history.

388
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,650
If we're wrong,

389
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,000
we'll be a laughingstock.

390
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
It's more than just being a laughingstock.

391
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,640
It will be a forever stain
on your academic career!

392
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm not afraid.

393
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,970
Me neither.

394
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,030
Good.

395
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,750
Good lads.

396
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,070
I've always emphasized one thing:

397
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,170
stability.

398
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,550
You two

399
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,310
has brought out my ambition.

400
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,410
Alright.

401
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,030
Tell me, what's your plan next?

402
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,510
To reveal the truth,
we must first eliminate the false.

403
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,400
We want to apply

404
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,110
for an archaeological
survey of Phoenix Mountain

405
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,640
to see if there's
actually a tomb underneath.

406
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,160
I'll submit a report.

407
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,640
Wait for my news.

408
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,960
Cheers.

409
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,230
What's up? Speak.

410
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,680
Why are you drinking so fast?

411
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,720
No, I have to finish this.

412
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,250
You're acting weird today.

413
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Being this happy,

414
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,670
you must have some good news.

415
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,160
Look.

416
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,440
I'm going to be a father.

417
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,460
It's been 11 weeks.

418
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,680
Wen Wen.

419
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,480
Guang's drunk.

420
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,680
Help him inside.

421
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,040
Go inside and lie down.

422
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,960
Just one more drink.

423
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,000
Come on, up you go.

424
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,140
Get up.

425
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,750
Drink.

426
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,170
Take it easy.

427
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,900
I can walk on my own.

428
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,400
Slow down.

429
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,350
What's wrong?

430
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,850
I can't keep this baby.

431
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,240
Hey,

432
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,200
don't be foolish.

433
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,070
What if it's yours?

434
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,920
Remember,

435
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,480
this child

436
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,600
is yours and Guang's.

437
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,880
It's for your own good

438
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,200
to have the baby.

439
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,250
Don't do anything stupid.

440
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
What brings you here?

441
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,880
What are you doing up there?

442
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,790
I'm checking your electrical wiring.

443
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,830
It'll be freezing cold
during the New Year.

444
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,200
It's a pity if you
can't use a small heater.

445
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,350
I appreciate it.

446
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,220
But haven't you noticed
it's already been fixed?

447
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,820
Yeah, no wonder the circuit
looked different.

448
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,890
Who fixed it?

449
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Hou Yuelai had someone fix it.

450
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,350
Fine.

451
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,640
He beat me to it, huh?

452
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,160
Again.

453
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,640
Why are you here instead of going home?

454
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,010
I'm here to spend the New Year with you.

455
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,710
Don't you have your own home?

456
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,200
I have a home, but I can't go back.

457
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,270
My parents gave me a task.

458
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,240
What task?

459
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,040
They said,

460
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,940
if I don't bring home a girl this year,

461
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,080
I shouldn't bother coming back.

462
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,000
Then you'd better go find your girl now.

463
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,110
Why are you staying here?

464
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,480
Besides, I never said you could stay.

465
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,880
I don't need your permission.

466
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,960
It's not like I'm staying in your room.

467
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,110
You're quite thick-skinned.

468
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,480
You want to share a room with me?

469
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,200
I didn't say that!

470
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,070
What's wrong with you?

471
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,550
-I said I won't stay in your room.
-Ms. Luo.

472
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,410
Happy New Year.

473
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,560
Fugui.

474
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,030
Fugui.

475
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Mr. Fang is here too.

476
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,880
Happy New Year.

477
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,550
Let me.

478
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,510
Ms. Luo.

479
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,510
I heard you're not
going back for the New Year.

480
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,440
My wife and I made some food for you.

481
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,820
It's not easy being alone away from home.

482
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,640
Work's one thing,

483
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,090
but you still need to eat well.

484
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,590
Well, you're too kind.

485
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,920
We're really embarrassed.

486
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,790
Please take it back.

487
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,110
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

488
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,060
We can't help you with much else.

489
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,920
We can only make some food and drinks.

490
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,550
Right. They specially prepared these.

491
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,010
Take it.

492
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,560
Alright.

493
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,160
I'm leaving. Eat it while it's hot.

494
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,510
Bye.

495
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,720
Okay.

496
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,350
Let's go.

497
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,310
Happy New Year!

498
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,170
Happy New Year!

499
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,930
Hurry up.

500
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,550
You really know how to
maintain good relationships with people.

501
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,510
So much food.

502
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,240
Why are they being so nice to us?

503
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,100
Don't you know?

504
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,020
It's all because of the mess you made.

505
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,080
It's just about fixing t
he family temple, isn't it?

506
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,840
Shulan, slow down a bit.

507
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,480
Wait for me.

508
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,010
I can't keep up with you.

509
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,830
A heavy heart makes for a heavy body.

510
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,510
Your heart's

511
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,270
too full of messy thoughts—

512
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,120
that's why you're lagging.

513
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,790
Easy for you to say.

514
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,750
It's not my heart that's heavy—

515
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,030
it's all this stuff I'm carrying.

516
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,030
And it's all to help you.

517
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,660
Put it down.

518
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,790
Yeah, let's rest a bit.

519
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,550
What's the rush?

520
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,880
Who asked you to come?

521
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,590
I can carry it myself.

522
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,320
You insisted on coming with me.

523
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,610
Why are you mad now?

524
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,070
Getting grumpier with age.

525
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,480
Can't I even say anything?

526
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,110
If you don't want to come, then don't.

527
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,570
Why did you follow me here?

528
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,880
Listen, good thing
Jianhui has a good temper.

529
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,320
If it were me,
I would've divorced you already.

530
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,720
You seem quite close now.

531
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,520
Now you're speaking nice of him.

532
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,550
You weren't like this before.

533
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,680
We're all family.

534
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,720
No need to hold grudges.

535
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,880
Right?

536
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,130
Let me tell you,

537
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,680
if you keep making a fuss like this,

538
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,240
one day Jianhui might really leave.

539
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,160
Let's see how you'll manage then.

540
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,480
Relationships come and go

541
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,410
in a natural way.

542
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,970
If you two get divorced,

543
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,960
you'll really become

544
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,690
the disgrace of our Liu family.

545
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,070
Now you're talking to me about disgrace?

546
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,480
Look at the immoral things you've done.

547
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,010
You've embarrassed our whole family.

548
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,960
You're kneading it well.

549
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Madam Liu is here.

550
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,960
Madam Liu!

551
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,730
Jianhui.

552
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,920
What are you doing here?

553
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,310
Uncle Mu is teaching me
to make golden-thread pastries.

554
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,160
Shulan.

555
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,790
Why did you come here?

556
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,030
What kind of question is that?

557
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,750
He's obviously here waiting for you.

558
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,650
Did I ask you?

559
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,070
Fine, I'll stay out of it.

560
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,800
You two talk.

561
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,200
Come on, kids!

562
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,550
Time for presents!

563
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,270
Come here.

564
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,400
Presents are here.

565
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,960
No pushing!

566
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,640
Go quickly.

567
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,920
No pushing!

568
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,700
Come on, everyone line up.

569
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:02,790
Shulan.

570
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,370
Give it to me.

571
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,880
This is for you. Take it. Here.

572
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,070
You're not happy that I came.

573
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,010
Why should I be happy or not?

574
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,160
Whether you're sincere or not,

575
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,520
just showing up is a kind act.

576
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
And I won't turn your kindness away.

577
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,680
Once the dough's ready,

578
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,480
help me finish the pastries.

579
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,030
Haven't made these in years—

580
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,090
my hands are rusty.

581
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,020
If you don't want to go home this year,

582
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,360
let's just stay here.

583
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,420
I'll be with you.

584
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,380
Then...

585
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,720
let's give the kids their presents first.

586
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,160
Right,

587
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,110
the presents.

588
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm so slow at knitting.

589
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,440
All thumbs.

590
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,880
I was hoping to finish this vest

591
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,200
by the time our baby's born.

592
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,920
It'll be a gift

593
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,070
from his dad.

594
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,550
Don't close it for me,

595
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm still learning.

596
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,160
One wrong stitch messes everything up.

597
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,120
Look, I just got to this part—

598
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,640
Here.

599
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,160
This stitch.

600
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,750
Don't look at me.

601
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,880
Look at the New Year poster.

602
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,310
The seller said the more

603
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,830
you look at it,

604
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
the more your baby

605
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,950
will look like the poster baby.

606
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,880
So cute.

607
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,550
Have you thought of a name for the baby?

608
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,240
If it's a boy,

609
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,060
call him Niannian.

610
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,520
If it's a girl,

611
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,810
call her Huahua.

612
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,500
What's wrong with you?

613
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,940
Can you be serious?

614
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,440
Naming the baby's a big deal.

615
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,000
I bought a New Year poster
("Nianhua" in pinyin),

616
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,400
and you said calling them
Niannian and Huahua.

617
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,530
What if I buy a paomo?

618
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,160
One called Paopao, the other called Momo?

619
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,770
I can't think of one.

620
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,700
You try.

621
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,590
If it's a girl,

622
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,440
call her Dandan.

623
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,030
If it's a boy,

624
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,680
call him Dandan.

625
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,960
That's even worse
than Niannian and Huahua.

626
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,030
Dandan, Dandan.

627
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,420
Or

628
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,320
let's have Mu name the baby.

629
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,960
Why him?

630
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,440
Mu is educated, you know.

631
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,160
He's not an outsider, like our brother.

632
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,020
Why not let him?

633
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,960
This is my baby.

634
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,440
I know it's your baby.

635
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,130
But Mu is like the child's godfather.

636
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,570
That's close enough to a real father.

637
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,440
I... I was wrong.

638
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,400
Pregnant women shouldn't get angry.

639
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,660
What's wrong with you?

640
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,510
After you're pregnant, you get mad

641
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,440
so easily these days.

642
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,110
Alright.

643
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,270
I'll stop talking, okay?

644
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,400
I'll think of a name.

645
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,370
Ms. Luo,

646
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,130
the paste is ready.

647
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,040
How's the couplet coming along?

648
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,970
Just finished the last stroke.

649
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,090
There, top line's done.

650
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,240
Look, how's it?

651
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,160
Your handwriting is...

652
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:12,940
not bad.

653
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,110
It won't be embarrassing to put it up.

654
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,030
Not embarrassing?

655
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,480
This is something to be proud of.

656
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,070
What's this? Looks like paomo.

657
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,330
Will it hold the paper?

658
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,590
It's paste made from flour.

659
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,000
We've always used it at home.

660
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,350
It's sticky and lasts a long time.

661
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,350
And when removed,

662
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,480
it won't leave marks on the door or wall.

663
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,400
You can try it later.

664
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,130
Works great.

665
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,800
You're really good at this.

666
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,790
Impressive.

667
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,000
Bottom line's yours.

668
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,790
Mine?

669
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,000
Yes, help me think of one.
It's still blank.

670
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,590
Alright.

671
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,000
"One shovel divides
longitude and latitude."

672
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,320
Let me see.

673
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:50,920
Got it.

674
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,400
"Two young hearts connect as one."

675
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,310
The horizontal line is

676
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,310
"Love on the job."

677
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,970
How's that?

678
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,590
You're so...

679
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,810
Who's in love on the job with you?

680
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,110
Wait.

681
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,880
You even flipped your hair.

682
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
Can't you be serious for once?

683
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Serious for what?

684
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,030
Serious for what, Ms. Luo?

685
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,720
-You're really blending in around here.
-Stop it.

686
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,500
Listen...

687
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,510
Dad.

688
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,750
Mom.

689
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,520
It's cold today.

690
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,920
Let's skip washing the noodles.

691
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,960
-Just have it.
-Here, Fang.

692
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,350
Thanks, Auntie.

693
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,350
Here you go. You like strong flavor.

694
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,310
Extra spoonful for you.

695
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,440
Dad still knows me best.

696
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,590
Of course.

697
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,180
Uncle, Auntie, let's drink.

698
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,510
Okay.

699
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,170
Here, sweetie.

700
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,160
Don't forget to drink the noodle soup.

701
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,070
It's good for digestion and the stomach.

702
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,160
That's all pseudoscience.

703
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,330
Experts have already debunked it.

704
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,170
It's old wisdom from our ancestors.

705
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,750
Luo,

706
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,250
give Qing

707
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,200
more cucumbers.

708
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,000
Look at her hands. It's peeling.

709
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,400
Alright.

710
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
She must be lacking vitamins.

711
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,440
Alright. Here.

712
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,400
Sweetie, have more.

713
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,590
Auntie, would you like some?

714
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,240
Sure. I can handle two shots.

715
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,480
Okay.

716
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,790
Mom, if that's true,

717
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,550
with all my heart palpitations,

718
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,680
shouldn't I have heart disease by now?

719
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,520
You silly girl,

720
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,030
why can't you stop

721
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,240
talking nonsense?

722
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,880
Listen,

723
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,510
don't get mad at her.

724
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,570
It's the New Year.

725
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,240
We haven't spent the last
two Spring Festivals together.

726
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,830
It's okay,

727
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,880
It's been a while since Mom smacked me.

728
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,080
You're asking for it.

729
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,750
Your dad always plays
the good guy in front of you.

730
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,640
While I'm cooking and serving—

731
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,400
guess who ends up the bad guy?

732
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,160
Sweetheart.

733
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,720
How can you say that?

734
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,480
Look, I've been eating this whole time.

735
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,030
You're the real hero today.

736
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,350
Is it good?

737
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,750
Yea...

738
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,590
I haven't eaten yet.

739
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,590
Fang, eat more.

740
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,310
Come on, eat up.

741
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,880
Okay.

742
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,510
How about we raise glasses?

743
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,590
Okay. Come on, cheers!

744
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,030
-Uncle and Auntie, welcome to Qinchuan.
-Cheers.

745
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,720
Thank you.

746
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,030
Alright.

747
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,310
Today we're having
noodles with soybean paste and wine.

748
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,200
The more we eat, the better the year!

749
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,000
One more thing.

750
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,160
Let me say something.

751
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,360
Happy New Year, okay?

752
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,510
Okay, come on.

753
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,540
Wish you all...

754
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,750
Happy New Year!

755
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,300
Good.

756
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,110
Well,

757
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,560
Captain Luo,

758
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,240
I'll head back after I finish eating.

759
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,760
Why are you suddenly leaving?

760
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,680
I miss my parents too.

761
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,350
Right.

762
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,440
Let him go back.

763
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,200
It's the New Year after all.

764
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,680
Right.

765
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,470
Right.

766
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,400
Mr. Mu,

767
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,490
are you satisfied with this cover design?

768
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,650
It's quite good.

769
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,940
Simple and elegant.

[Appreciation of Black Pottery Figurines]

771
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,110
Should we invite

772
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,110
a celebrity to endorse the preface?

773
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,590
I heard the Qinchuan

774
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,830
Antiques Association just
appointed a new president—

775
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,240
Zhao Youlin from the Mingde Museum.

776
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,740
How about I invite him?

777
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,480
Him?

778
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,960
Better not.

779
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,070
He can't even explain
what a black pottery figurine is.

780
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,800
What can we expect him to write?

781
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,550
It's better to rely on ourselves
than to ask others.

782
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,950
I've already written it.

783
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,560
By the way,

784
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
what do you think

785
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,270
about the first print run?

786
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,200
100,000 copies.

787
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,010
That's not a small number.

788
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,750
It'll cost nearly two million
to self-publish.

789
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,350
How can we measure
cultural value with money?

790
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,920
Mr. Peng, just print as I said.

791
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,440

00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,960
You really have a heart of gold.

795
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,880
Mr. Mu,

796
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,590
with your passion for cultural relics,

797
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,960

799
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,310
I'm flattered.

800

This book only offers a general overview.

801
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,660
I'll still need your help

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,590
Don't worry.

804
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,110
I promise the book launch
will be a big deal.

805
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,680
I can assure you,

806
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,720
I'll get some real

807
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,470
heavyweight guests to attend.

808
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,400
However,

809
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,450
let's forget about those
pretentious people who feign knowledge.

810
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,000
We're not on the same level, after all.

811
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,440
The people I find for you
will definitely be professionals.

812
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,070
Remember I told you
about my friend's cousin,

813
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,600
the one who was involved in

814
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,550
bringing the black pottery figurines
back to China?

815
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,750
How about I invite him?

From the archaeological team?

Right.

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,860
That works.

819
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,970

a lot of things at home lately.

826

Sorry to keep you waiting.

827
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,960
Don't mention it.

828

About that journal submission
you asked about last time—

829
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,960
I've asked about it.

830
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,850
No problem.

831
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,330
Easy.

832
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,010
Then I...

833
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,920
I must thank you properly.

What's the matter?

837
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,290
Could you give a public lecture about

838
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,590
the cultural background
of black pottery figurines?

839
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,960

I've already promised this to him.

842
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:35,790
Don't let me

843
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,250
make a fool of myself then.

844
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,200

845
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,750

who's going to read this book?

851
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,000

that match their child's
cognitive development.

853
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,810
They call it "calcium for the brain."

854
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,840
I still enjoy books like this,

855
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,030
and I don't seem to lack calcium.

856
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,740
You don't lack calcium—

857
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,000
you lack common sense.

858

when facing problems.

Mr. Guo,

926
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,820
when did you first
hear about black pottery figurines?

927
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,620

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,480

929
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,070
There were six
black pottery figurines at that time.

930
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,930
Yeah, what a coincidence. Me too.

931
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,370
I still remember

932
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,240
the starting bid at that time was

933
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,800
$800 per piece.

934
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,110
But due to some special reasons,

935
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,640
the auction was called off.

936
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,400
If it had continued,

937
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,760
I believe the final price

938
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,070
would have been over $1,500.

939
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,940
In today's market,

940
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,200
it would be priceless.

941
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,250
Captain Qi.

942
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,920
What's going on with Mr. Guo Shilin?

943
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,420
Why is he supporting a Relics Dealer?

944
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,230
What?

945
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,200
How did he get
mixed up with a Relics Dealer?

946
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,670
I saw him at the Han-Tang Cultural Space

947
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,870
helping someone sell a new book.

948
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
The book is about

949
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,920
how to appraise black pottery figurines.

950
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,630
What?

951
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,070
Why are national treasures
called national treasures?

952
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,800
They must have outstanding cultural value.

953
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,670
Take black pottery figurines for example.

954
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,000
Why are they so valuable?

955
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,330
Because they're black.

956
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,880
And why are they black?

957
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,030
Because they were burned in a fire

958
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,800
during the Western Jin Dynasty.

959
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,230
Mr. Guo, am I right?

960
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,480
Yes, they were burned indeed.

961
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,630
That's a trace of history

962
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,190
left on the artifact.

963
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,510
To establish yourself
in the collection market,

964
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,970
you must understand this.

965
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,090
If you don't, you'll get scammed.

966
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,630
That's also why I wrote this book.

967
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,800
To decode the value of artifacts

968
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,840
from a historical
and cultural perspective.

969
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,670
Back to the point—

970
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,280
why do black pottery figurines
have collectible value?

971
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,360
First, their unique black color.

972
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,320
Second, their origin.

973
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,760
And for that,

974
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,020
we must consult Mr. Guo.

975
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,230
Why?

976
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,590
Because his current
excavation site is precisely where

977
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,650
black pottery figurines
were unearthed—Yin Village.

978
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,310
This Mu guy is quite cunning.

979
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,560
He's setting Guo up.

980
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,840
What burial level or rank

981
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,370
these figurines belong to?

982
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Whether he answers or not,

983
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,400
he's become a supporter of
his black pottery figurine collection.

984
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,320
Mr. Guo didn't answer.

985
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,840
It seems he thinks my question

986
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,070
is too elementary

987
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,840
to be worth answering.

988
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,190
So, let me answer for him.

989
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,630
Black pottery figurines are actually

990
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,360
clothed pottery figurines.

991
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,510
Mr. Guo Shilin

992
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
coming here

993
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,200
has actually added to his prestige

994
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,360
and increased his value.

995
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,440
Think about it.

996
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,170
Can burial objects from an emperor's tomb

997
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,960
be compared with those
from a commoner's tomb?

998
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,000
From an emperor's tomb?

999
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,000
Mr. Mu,

1000
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,310
I disagree with your statement.

1001
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,070
Is that so?

1002
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,750
Which part of what I said was incorrect?

1003
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,710
Aren't

1004
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,810
the black pottery figurines
from an emperor's tomb?

1005
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,440
I've also heard that

1006
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,760
a large tomb was discovered where the
black pottery figurines were unearthed.

1007
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,550
It's even in the shape
of the character "亚".

1008
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,110
If not an emperor's tomb,
what else could it be?

1009
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,150
The tomb's in the shape
of the character "亚".

1010
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,000
In the shape of the character "亚"?

1011
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,330
That's quite a big deal.

1012
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,130
That must be an emperor's tomb.

1013
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,000
Regardless of where
the black pottery figurines came from,

1014
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,060
we archaeologists

1015
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,320
only care about their
historical and cultural value.

1016
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,920
As for collecting and money—

1017
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,630
sorry,

1018
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,740
not my concern.

1019
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,800
I'm Fang Kun, a colleague of Mr. Guo.

1020
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,880
Mr. Fang,

1021
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,880
hello.

1022
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,080
You're right.

1023
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,760
If we only measure collections by money,

1024
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,550
that would be too narrow-minded.

1025
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,710
In fact, many of us who collect artifacts

1026
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,360
do it to preserve human civilization,

1027
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,730
to bring ancient Chinese culture

1028
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,000
to the world.

1029
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,150
Don't try to change the subject here.

1030
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,710
I didn't come here today

1031
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,240
to debate
the meaning of collecting with you.

1032
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,760
I just want to ask you one question.

1033
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
How did our black pottery figurines

1034
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,290
end up at a foreign auction?

1035
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,150
If you can't answer, I will.

1036
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,000
Through tomb robbing.

1037
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,970
Through smuggling.

1038
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Through shameless cultural theft.

1039
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,760
Anyone who promotes
black pottery figurine collecting today

1040
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,510
is supporting tomb raiders,

1041
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,530
whitewashing relics dealers,

1042
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,480
and fueling this dirty trade chain.

1043
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,030
I'm not against collecting,

1044
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,230
but I firmly oppose

1045
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,560
equating artifacts with monetary value.

1046
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,090
I've skimmed through your book.

1047
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,670
It clearly encourages

1048
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,130
profit-driven behavior.

1049
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,280
It will only

1050
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,000
stimulate tomb robbing and smuggling.

1051
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,840
Do tomb raiders only steal an artifact?

1052
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,030
No.

1053
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,520
What they steal is a witness to history,

1054
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,240
the key to civilization.

1055
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,400
Good!

1056
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,030
Good!

1057
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,630
Well said!

1058
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,230
Good!

1059
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,960
Good!

1060
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,510
Good!

1061
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,460
Guo Shilin!

1062
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,820
You really screwed me over this time.

1063
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,260
Alright, let's give a round of applause
to send off Mr. Guo.

1064
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,150
That went okay today.

1065
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,850
Yeah.

1066
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,480
Mr. Mu.

1067
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,980
Captain Qi,

1068
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,710
You head back first.

1069
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,670
-Okay.
-I'll go say hello.

1070
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,280
Alright, I'm leaving.

1071
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,710
Okay.

1072
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,290
Captain Qi,

1073
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,440
so you attended my lecture too?

1074
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,190
I should call you Expert Mu now.

1075
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,530
Don't tease me.

1076
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,110
Confucius only
passed on knowledge and never created—

1077
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,220
and here you're
writing books at your age.

1078
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,320
I have to learn from you.

1079
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,400
I'm so flattered.

1080
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,670
Is there anything
you don't want me to hear?
