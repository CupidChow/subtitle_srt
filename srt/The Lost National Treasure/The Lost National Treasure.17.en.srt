[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,740
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,229
Come on, Mr. Lu.

4
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,759
-I won't give in anymore!
-Let him go.

5
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,360
Let him go.

6
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
Come on, hit me.

7
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,940
-Come on.
-Look at her.

8
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,000
Lai.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,479
You bastard, what are you trying to do?

10
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,120
Come on. If you've got the guts, try me.

11
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,640
If you dare to lay a finger
on Xiaoman today,

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,840
I'll rip your arm off.

13
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,900
What I hate most is men hitting women.

14
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,000
This woman's crazy.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,860
If I don't hit her, she'll go wild!

16
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,950
What did you say?

17
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,880
Speak properly.

18
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,960
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,810
Sorry for causing you trouble.

20
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,590
What's going on here?

21
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,060
Must have gone gambling again.

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,580
Not just gambling.

23
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,880
Today he even tried to steal
my gold jewelry to pay off his debts.

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,230
There hasn't been much work lately.

25
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,510
I just wanted to earn
some money for the household.

26
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,570
Haven't I told you?

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,640
You can't make money
at the gambling table.

28
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,070
I have no other skills.

29
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,360
It's all about money. What can I do?

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,210
Lai,

31
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,829
do you want to be a technician?

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,800
Do technicians make money?

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,520
It depends on whether
you want to do it well.

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,930
There are many archaeological projects now

35
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,190
with a big shortage of technicians.

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,170
Everyone wants to hire a good technician.

37
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,300
Like Lu and Jiang He,

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,620
they've barely had a day off all year.

39
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,360
Mr. Lu even put a kid through college.

40
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,180
If you want to learn,

41
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,490
they could be your teachers.

42
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:51,930
Okay.

43
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,180
He'll learn.

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,640
Lai is not stupid.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,680
He learns things very quickly.

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,240
As long as you're willing to teach,

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,900
he'll definitely learn well.

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,930
Lai,

49
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,140
hurry up and say yes.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,370
I'll learn from you.

51
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,170
I will.

52
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,710
What are you thinking?

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
Letting Lai join the archaeological team.

54
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,130
Is he cut out for that?

55
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,500
You might as well let Xiaoman join
instead of him.

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,290
Of course I know

57
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,270
Lai isn't cut out for this kind of work.

58
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,340
Uncle Youliang's got five mouths to feed.

59
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,070
He's the only able-bodied one,

60
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,510
sticking to the gambling table every day.

61
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,370
It's not right.

62
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:46,680
Guo,

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,730
usually you won't
meddle in other people's affairs.

64
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,450
Be honest with me.

65
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,910
What exactly are you up to?

66
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,060
Don't keep me in suspense. Out with it.

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,690
Uncle Youliang's not
happy with our work, right?

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,060
If he stirs up trouble,

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,380
we might lose this job.

70
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,610
I'm just

71
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,730
thinking ahead.

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
Let's give Lai a job to do for now.

73
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,370
We'll see if he can handle it.

74
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,930
When Uncle Youliang sees

75
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,930
that his own son-in-law
is part of our archaeological team,

76
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,990
he'll be more inclined to support us.

77
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,890
I see you're quite a schemer.

78
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,670
The fetal heartbeat is a bit unstable.

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Nothing serious.

80
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,790
Unstable fetal heartbeat?

81
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,440
Look.

82
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,659
This is the baby's hand,

83
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,750
touching its head.

84
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,430
I see it.

85
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,180
Everything looks fine.

86
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,500
No intense activity,

87
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,409
and no signs of oxygen deprivation.

88
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,409
It's probably just due to your mood.

89
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,340
It's almost time for delivery.

90
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,310
Try to stay in bed

91
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,240
and keep your mood relaxed.

92
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,240
Take it slow.

93
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,850
Don't change your shoes?

94
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,440
Shulan, you're back.

95
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,850
Wen Wen,

96
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,410
get her a glass of water.

97
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:14,740
Okay.

98
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,140
Shulan,

99
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,220
you've been unhappy the whole way.

100
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,020
What's wrong?

101
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,000
Come, sit down.

102
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,080
I'm your husband.
Is there anything we can't talk about?

103
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,200
You should ask yourself that.

104
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,080
You don't tell me anything now.

105
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,110
It was fine before
when it was just the two of us.

106
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,970
If you didn't say, I wouldn't ask.

107
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,640
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

108
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,320
Whatever happens, I'll bear it with you.

109
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,470
But it's different now.

110
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,640
Now we have a baby.

111
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,270
I don't want our child

112
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,150
growing up in fear.

113
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,230
If something happens to us,

114
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,830
who'll take care of the baby?

115
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,020
Shulan,

116
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,490
have some water.

117
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,080
Pregnant women
shouldn't get too emotional.

118
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,740
Take your time and talk it out.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,520
Look,

120
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,560
even Wen Wen knows that.

121
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,670
Don't cry. What if it affects the baby?

122
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,270
What's the matter?

123
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,930
What did I do without telling you?

124
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,040
The house.

125
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,560
You must be in big trouble,

126
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,760
so you mortgaged our house.

127
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,060
So all this fuss is about that?

128
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,050
There are times when
the store has to stock up on inventory.

129
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,000
I just mortgaged the house for a few days

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,860
to raise some money for goods.

131
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,990
I'll redeem it once the goods are sold.

132
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,909
That's how business works

133
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,470
in the South Market.

134
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,020
Really?

135
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,320
You can go and ask around.

136
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:45,350
Look,

137
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,080
these golden tears for nothing.

138
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,790
So annoying.

139
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,710
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

140
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,130
I didn't want you to worry.

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,320
Oh, right.

142
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,640
I've chosen several names

143
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,710
for our baby.

144
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,470
Take a look.

145
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,080
Come on, pick one.

146
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,350
When did you do this?

147
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,400
So many names.

148
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,710
Huaijin.

149
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,100
Yangbo.

150
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,270
I like Lekang.

151
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,110
Happy and healthy.

152
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,710
That's all I wish for.

153
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,590
I also think Lekang is good.

154
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,110
Right?

155
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,790
Alright, up to you.

156
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,960
Lekang it is.

157
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,590
Lekang, the name your father gave you.

158
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,560
Do you like it?

159
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,390
It doesn't matter if he likes it or not.

160
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,350
As long as you do.

161
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,720
Guang.

162
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,750
Guang.

163
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,730
Coming.

164
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,800
What have you bought this time?

165
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,060
I bought you some meat,

166
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,220
to make a meat dish.

167
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,240
You're wasting money. There's plenty here.

168
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,750
I was worried you might
not have enough food.

169
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,550
How can a single guy
like you take care of yourself?

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,730
Give it to me.

171
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,550
Wait a moment.

172
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,600
I've already bought some food.

173
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,390
Look what this is.

174
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,070
What's this?

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,070
Today, let's try some foreign food.

176
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,530
Come on.

177
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,450
Sit down.

178
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,600
Take it out.

179
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,360
One for each.

180
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,100
Looks good, right?

181
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,270
Isn't this just a crusty pancake?

182
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,120
What pancake?

183
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,270
It;s pizza.

184
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,630
Pizza.

185
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,410
Cheers.

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,020
Cheers.

187
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,870
How does it taste?

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,600
Not as good as a roujiamo.

189
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,990
Doesn't even look as good as a roujiamo.

190
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,909
If you don't like it,

191
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,360
I'll get you something else next time.

192
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,820
No need.

193
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,690
It's just a pancake
with a couple slices of meat.

194
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,650
I can make it too.

195
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,870
If you don't believe me,

196
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,080
next time you come to Mu's place,
I'll make it for you.

197
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,120
It'll definitely taste better than this.

198
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,550
Of course I believe you.

199
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,790
When I was little,

200
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
I had no parents

201
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,810
and grew up eating from many households.

202
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,170
I remember the kind-hearted ones
gave me food to eat,

203
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,150
while the unkind ones gave me dog food.

204
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,550
At that time, I thought,

205
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:11,910
why

206
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,080
the dog stares at me when I eat?

207
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,610
It must be that the dog was hungry.

208
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,130
So I shared my food with it.

209
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,330
Looking back, I was such a fool.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,720
I thought I was being kind to the dog,

211
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,580
but it was the dog being kind to me.

212
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,450
Your mother was so kind.

213
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,430
She always saved the meat for me.

214
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,440
I still remember

215
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
the steamed dish she made for me.

216
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,550
Tasted amazing.

217
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,270
So good.

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,600
And you,

219
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,000
you only had half a bowl of goat's milk,

220
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,780
but you still left half for me.

221
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,820
How dare you bring that up?

222
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,270
That day,

223
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,680
I waited for you until dark,

224
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,410
but you never showed up.

225
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,520
The next day,

226
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,570
the goat's milk had gone sour.

227
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,880
But I still drank it.

228
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
You silly boy.

229
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,910
Oh, I almost forgot.

230
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,560
Take this.

231
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,680
What do you mean?

232
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,360
Living expenses in the city are high.

233
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't

234
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,980
pinch pennies.

235
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,000
I have money.

236
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,940
Take it,

237
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,720
and buy yourself

238
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,600
some nice clothes.

239
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,290
You're at the age

240
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,250
to find a boyfriend.

241
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,130
I already have.

242
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,960
There's someone I like.

243
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,690
Why don't you ask me who I like?

244
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,150
Must be

245
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,130
someone from our village.

246
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,860
Yes, from our village.

247
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,790
Who?

248
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,970
Do you really want to know?

249
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,030
If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

250
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,830
I'll tell you.

251
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,630
I'm going to cook.

252
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,750
After our recent investigation,

253
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
we've basically figured out
Liu Shusheng's background.

254
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
He's 40 years old,

255
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,320
dropped out in middle school

256
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,870
and started running with gangs.

257
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,730
Fighting, brawling, extortion,

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,720
pimping,

259
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,390
running gambling dens,

260
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,000
there's nothing he hasn't been involved in.

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,670
After getting married,

262
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,870
he settled down a bit

263
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,360
and opened a logistics station

264
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,270
called Shusheng Logistics.

265
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,750
Looks like a legit transport business,

266
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,870
but they're doing

267
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,330
all sorts of shady things
behind the scenes.

268
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
His crew's

269
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,130
made up of total thugs.

270
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,860
No one dares to mess with them.

271
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,670
Isn't this typical gang behavior?

272
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,630
What does it have to do with tomb raiding?

273
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,270
That's still unclear.

274
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,390
There's one more thing.

275
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,670
In his social connections,

276
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,890
there's someone

277
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,720
who stands out.

278
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,710
His brother-in-law,

279
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
named Mu Jianhui,

280
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,850
runs an antique shop

281
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,360
in the South Market.

282
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,600
Go on.

283
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,720
Well,

284
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,390
based on all of this,

285
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,840
I think

286
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,850
the person behind Hong Datong and Xing Zhaohu

287
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,790
is very likely to be Liu Shusheng.

288
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,480
Your reasoning makes sense,

289
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,830
but we still need to be cautious.

290
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,320
If we act without

291
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
solid proof,

292
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,650
we might scare them off.

293
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,600
If they run,

294
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,390
we may never catch them again.

295
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,080
So you mean?

296
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,240
Keep a close eye on Liu Shusheng

297
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,700
and the people around him.

298
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,200
They'll slip up eventually.

299
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,990
Once we have enough evidence

300
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,320
to catch them red-handed,

301
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,520
we'll make our move.

302
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,640
When are you leaving tomorrow?

303
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,820
Leaving where?

304
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,320
Aren't you taking a break tomorrow?

305
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,650
When are you going back?

306
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,610
Why would I go back?

307
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,670
What do you mean, why?

308
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,750
Before we left, Director Zhang reminded me

309
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,910
not to let work affect

310
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,110
you two having a baby.

311
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,080
You should take a break.

312
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,080
Can you stop worrying about me?

313
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,240
The sooner we finish surveying,

314
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,870
the sooner we can
go to the Lv Family Tomb.

315
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,960
But this survey isn't something

316
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,840
you can rush.

317
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,370
No one can predict the pace.

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Buddy,

319
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,460
I'm anxious for your sake.

320
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,440
What do you mean,

321
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,760
anxious for my sake?

322
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,520
Stop writing.

323
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,510
The Lv Family Tomb
archaeological team's been set up.

324
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,510
Guess who's on it?

325
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,410
Luo Qing, Xiaobai, and that group, right?

326
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,480
Guess again.

327
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,520
You're impressive,

328
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,440
[Qinchuan Provincial Archaeological Research Institute]

329
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,550
even managed to apply
for an internship at Lvjia Village.

330
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,610
Yeah, impressive.

331
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,910
But this time is different from before.

332
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,600
It's a systematic excavation,

333
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,960
and we'll be dealing with locals too.

334
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,200
There are a lot of miscellaneous tasks.

335
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,750
Got it.

336
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,480
So today we're
going to Lvjia Village first

337
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,030
to discuss renting a place, right?

338
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,630
Yes, we need to set up a base first.

339
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,670
Get ready for
the archaeological team's arrival.

340
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,200
Luo Qing.

341
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,610
Luo Qing.

342
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,200
Senior.

343
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,410
Xiaobai,

344
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,200
this is my senior,

345
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,910
also an expert in
artifact authentication at our institute,

346
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,570
Hou Yuelai.

347
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,030
This is my student, Jiang Xiaobai.

348
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,360
Hello, I'm Xiaobai.

349
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:54,880
Hello.

350
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,720
Hello.

351
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,010
Let's go. Get in the car.

352
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,270
What do you mean?

353
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,600
Aren't you going to Lvjia Village?

354
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,730
I'll give you a ride.

355
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,520
Let me be your driver this time.

356
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,860
You have your own work.

357
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,170
We can go by ourselves.

358
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,110
It's okay.

359
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,420
Taking you there

360
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,980
is also part of my job now.

361
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,550
I've already applied to join

362
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,440
the Lv Family Tomb archaeological team.

363
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,270
Really?

364
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:14,960
Well,

365
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,390
why would an artifact authenticator
like you go for fieldwork?

366
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,270
After doing artifact authentication
for so many years,

367
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,000
I feel

368
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,840
it's necessary to do some fieldwork.

369
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,510
Besides,

370
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,240
this tomb

371
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,630
might very well be our ancestor's tomb.

372
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,910
I think being in the lab and being on-site

373
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,270
must feel completely different.

374
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,840
Indeed.

375
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,790
But we're still
in the preparation stage now.

376
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,210
You can join us when we

377
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,830
get to the excavation stage,

378
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,570
I heard you're short-handed,

379
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,320
so I came to help out first.

380
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,630
You look

381
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
thinner than the last time I saw you.

382
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,200
Not really.

383
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,360
I've been eating well lately.

384
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
Let's go then. Get in the car.

385
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,960
Luo Qing,

386
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,000
I heard that Fang Kun

387
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,480
is going to Lvjia Village too?

388
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,510
No, he's back for Yin Village.

389
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,270
That's not necessarily true, Ms. Luo.

390
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,080
I feel like he

391
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
didn't come back just for Yin Village.

392
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,640
You forget that night...

393
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,870
Hurry, get in the car.

394
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,030
I haven't seen him in a long time.

395
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,080
Maybe I'll ask him to dinner, have a chat.

396
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,200
What's there to chat about?

397
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Every word out of his mouth is nasty.

398
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,890
Mr. Lu.

399
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,180
What's so special about this tile?

400
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,020
This is called a tile end.

401
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,780
There are barrel tiles
on the eaves of ancient buildings.

402
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,510
The tile end covers
the front of the barrel tiles.

403
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,690
So it's just an ancient tile.

404
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,850
Why are you picking it up?

405
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,060
It's a relic.

406
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,180
Relic?

407
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,730
When we encounter it during the survey,
we need to collect it

408
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,540
and mark where we found it.

409
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,450
Sir,

410
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,520
is this tile end valuable?

411
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,460
Listen to yourself.

412
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,329
All you talk about is money, money, money.

413
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,660
Can cultural relics be measured in money?

414
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,460
Right.

415
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,290
Sir, don't get mad.

416
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,900
I just don't know any better.

417
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,210
Hello.

418
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,680
Hello.

419
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,640
Who's it?

420
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,120
Hello, ma'am.

421
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,360
We're from the archaeological team.

422
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,050
If Fugui at home?

423
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,500
We'd like to discuss something with you.

424
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,290
He's not here.

425
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,890
He went to the fields.

426
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,590
I think this place
would be suitable as a base.

427
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,930
What base?

428
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,730
Well,

429
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,050
we'd like to ask

430
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,800
if you have any vacant houses

431
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
that we could rent

432
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,460
as our archaeology team base.

433
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,880
We all know Fugui is passionate
about cultural preservation.

434
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,290
So we'd feel at ease staying here.

435
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:01,690
Ma'am,

436
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,690
we'll pay you rent at market rates.

437
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,810
It's not about the money.

438
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,820
My relatives are coming to visit soon.

439
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,540
I'm not sure if this place will be free.

440
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,010
Then let's check out
other places in the village.

441
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,490
Sorry to disturb you.

442
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,800
Thank you.

443
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,000
What's up?

444
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,010
Eating well and sleeping soundly.

445
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,290
Why don't you ask how I've been lately?

446
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,690
With your strong voice,

447
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,820
do I even need to ask?

448
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,600
I heard your senior, Hou Yuelai,

449
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,640
has also joined your archaeological team.

450
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,690
He's working on authentication.

451
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,050
What's he doing there with you?

452
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,530
He's pursuing self-improvement,

453
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,360
to enhance his academic level
through fieldwork.

454
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,560
What, do we need to
report everything to you?

455
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,290
No need.

456
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,690
I'm just asking.

457
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,120
Why are you so sensitive?

458
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,730
I'm just caring about him.

459
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,640
If you really care,

460
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,900
come visit us in Lvjia Village sometime.

461
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,130
Bring some good food and let's catch up.

462
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,690
How's it going in Yin Village?

463
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,530
With me here, of course it's going well.

464
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,730
The village is giving us great support.

465
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,080
Did I tell you?

466
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Lai has also joined our team.

467
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,330
Recently,

468
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,850
I've found many cultural relic specimens.

469
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,900
Three tile ends,

470
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,050
two barrel tiles,

471
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,360
and...

472
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,320
Alright, stop.

473
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm busy now. Hanging up.

474
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,600
Okay then, bye.

475
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,890
[Shusheng Logistics]

476
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,390
Liu Shusheng

477
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,290
is either at the logistics station

478
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,880
or at the nearby market.

479
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,970
He only interacts with the same group.

480
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,970
Haven't seen him contact with strangers.

481
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,570
His wife, He Xiaofeng,
doesn't do much either.

482
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,600
Going shopping at the mall
and buying groceries.

483
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Nothing unusual.

484
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,040
Mu Jianhui's family has three people,

485
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,210
him, his wife, and a nanny.

486
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,250
His wife is pregnant

487
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,350
and stays home.

488
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,110
As for Mu Jianhui,

489
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,770
apart from his own Nameless Pavilion,

490
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,880
he basically doesn't go anywhere else.

491
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,680
A few days ago,

492
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,530
someone came to his shop

493
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,600
with

494
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,730
a black suitcase

495
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,650
and left empty-handed.

496
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,270
I've asked around.

497
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,010
He's mortgaged his shop

498
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
and property.

499
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,930
The visitor is a loan shark.

500
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,320
I suspect that suitcase was full of cash.

501
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,320
What does he need all that money for?

502
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,250
His business is

503
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,400
not so great,

504
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,300
but not that bad either.

505
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,960
If it were just for cash flow,

506
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,170
he wouldn't have mortgaged

507
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,170
the property.

508
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,690
You think he's planning to run?

509
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,550
It's possible.

510
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,160
This move was right.

511
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,300
You planned to use that active piece?

512
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,020
Chief Zhao, Captain Qi,

513
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,420
what active piece?

514
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,290
I have an informant.

515
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,290
I had him make contact with Liu Shusheng.

516
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,800
That guy is desperate now.

517
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,440
He took the bait immediately.

518
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,500
It has been agreed.

519
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,370
The deal is set for tomorrow noon
at the Honghui Restaurant.

520
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,050
Yongfu,

521
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,860
you keep an eye on
the Honghui Restaurant tomorrow.

522
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,190
Okay.

523
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,770
Du,

524
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,210
you watch Mu Jianhui.

525
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,150
Dacang,

526
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,520
you keep tabs on Liu Shusheng.

527
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,860
Yes, sir.

528
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,660
Let's try to catch him in the act.

529
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,560
Wen Wen, you can go back.

530
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,940
I'm leaving.

531
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,900
What are you carrying?

532
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,660
Mr. Hong gave me a nice tea set.

533
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,950
I'm taking it to Shusheng.

534
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,620
His place has so many tea sets.

535
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,880
Why bring him another?

536
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,290
Captain Qi,

537
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,150
Mu Jianhui left with his wife.

538
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,320
He took a suitcase.

539
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,220
What kind of suitcase?

540
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,280
About the size of a carry-on luggage.

541
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,580
It looked quite heavy.

542
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,690
Follow him.

543
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,070
Captain Qi,

544
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
it's almost noon now.

545
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,190
Liu Shusheng hasn't even left his house.

546
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,120
Stay calm.

547
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,070
Be patient.

548
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,290
Speak.

549
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,010
Mu Jianhui

550
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,470
seems to be heading to
Liu Shusheng's place.

551
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,490
Stop following.

552
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,620
Come meet up with us.

553
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,380
Don't worry about it.

554
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,540
Shulan.

555
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,850
Shusheng.

556
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,150
I didn't know you were coming.

557
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,490
I need to go out now.

558
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,280
You forgot about our appointment?

559
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,740
You're the one who forgot.

560
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,460
We agreed on a week.

561
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,930
I waited for seven days
and you didn't show up.

562
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,220
Well, I'm here now.

563
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,010
Too late.

564
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,890
Go prepare a couple of dishes.

565
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,320
Let's have dinner at home.

566
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,650
I need to go out for a bit.

567
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,650
Shusheng.

568
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,170
-Let's go inside.
-Let's go.

569
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,120
Let me tell you something.

570
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,720
What is it?

571
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,600
Come on.

572
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,080
Take good care of Shulan.

573
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,690
Okay.

574
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,980
Captain Qi,

575
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,350
how's it going?

576
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,680
He went in with the suitcase.

577
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,360
Could he be here to buy the alms bowl?

578
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,210
I told Yongfu

579
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,410
to have the informant

580
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,840
urge Liu Shusheng.

581
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,300
Let's see how he responds.

582
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,520
This is 3.5 million yuan.

583
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
Still short 500,000.

584
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,010
I've mortgaged both my house and shop.

585
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I really can't gather the rest for now.

586
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,450
But don't worry.

587
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,650
I won't default on

588
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,410
the remaining 500,000,

589
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,890
Mu Jianhui,

590
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,720
is that your mouth or your butt talking?

591
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,090
You really treat talking like farting?

592
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,610
You've got no credit with me.

593
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,700
Take your money back.

594
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,370
I've already found a buyer.

595
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,040
They're paying 4 million.

596
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,580
I'm going to deliver it to them now.

597
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,440
Hello?

598
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,520
Wait a moment.

599
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,650
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

600
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:50,760
Yes.

601
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,170
Did you hear that?

602
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,080
They're urging me.

603
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,650
Shusheng,

604
00:25:58,930 --> 00:25:59,990
sit down, sit down.

605
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,120
Let me finish what I have to say.

606
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,180
Alright. Go ahead.

607
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,400
Make it quick.

608
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,410
I wasn't planning to say this,

609
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,490
but since it's come to this,

610
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,420
there's no need to hide it anymore.

611
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,840
Do you know why

612
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
I must get this alms bowl?

613
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,150
Mu Jianhui,

614
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,210
stop being so mysterious with me.

615
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,410
Just get to the point.

616
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,690
Do you know the director of the Mingde Museum,

617
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,420
Zhao Youlin?

618
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,590
He's the one

619
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,410
who specifically wants this.

620
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,870
This man is very powerful.

621
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,250
We're like flies in front of him.

622
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,890
If this doesn't work out,

623
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,840
your sister and I will both be in trouble.

624
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,370
I'm not afraid of anything,

625
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,510
but what about your pregnant sister?

626
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,040
Blood is thicker than water.

627
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,250
When you robbed me back then,

628
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,250
why didn't you treat me like family?

629
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,170
When you cheated me in Lvjia Village,

630
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,450
why didn't you treat me like family?

631
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,340
You can't blame me for
what happened in Lvjia Village.

632
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,170
You're right.

633
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,930
You and I have a lot of messy history.

634
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,930
It's not sitting with
tigers and wolves I fear,

635
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,660
but two-faced people like you.

636
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,530
I know your tricks all too well.

637
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,280
You've fooled me
time and time again over the years.

638
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,840
You always have new tricks.

639
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,210
Why was I like that back then?

640
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,420
It was because I was dirt poor.

641
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,090
I was as poor as a church.

642
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,580
Even the pot was cleaner than my face.

643
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,860
If we switched places,

644
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,750
you wouldn't be as gentle as I was.

645
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,580
Besides, these years,

646
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,890
haven't you been sharpening your knives,

647
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,040
waiting to step on me?

648
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,300
I can't out-argue you.

649
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,120
There's only one answer for this:

650
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,490
No.

651
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,450
You've got a wide, open road in front of you

652
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,560
but insist on squeezing into an alley.

653
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,040
Look.

654
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:30,750
See?

655
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,430
See?

656
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,690
Done with your moving talk.

657
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,770
Now you're trying to provoke me.

658
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,970
Go take a look at Mingde Museum right now.

659
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,520
There's a Tang's tri-colored Heavenly
King figurine and a bronze mirror.

660
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,980
I sold them to Zhao Youlin.

661
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,410
Let me be honest with you.

662
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,490
I sold them to him for 2 million.

663
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,890
If he wants to sell,

664
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,810
it'll be at least 5 million.

665
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,690
What's the difference?

666
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,840
Here with us, these are illegal items.

667
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,650
Once he processes them,

668
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,210
they'll have a "birth certificate"

669
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,210
and become legal.

670
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,620
Trade this alms bowl

671
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,740
for a stack of birth certificates.

672
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,670
Is it worth it?

673
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,650
Zhao from the Mingde Museum,

674
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,780
I know what he's capable of.

675
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,080
But you, Mu Jianhui,

676
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,360
I don't trust.

677
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,930
I just don't believe

678
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,670
that this shabby alms bowl

679
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,840
can get you connected with him.

680
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,690
Maybe not in your hands,

681
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,890
but I'm sure I can make it happen.

682
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,480
Your brother-in-law has this confidence.

683
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,850
Once the items become legal,

684
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,230
finding buyers won't be a problem at all.

685
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,870
I'll owe you
the remaining 500,000 for now.

686
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,970
Once this path is smoothed out,

687
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,170
I guarantee you'll earn back 5 million.

688
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,740
Captain Qi,

689
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,020
Liu Shusheng just called the informant

690
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,480
and said he's not selling.

691
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:00,580
Okay.

692
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,510
Mu Jianhui stepped in.

693
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,470
He's here to buy the alms bowl.

694
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,320
Should we arrest him?

695
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:09,850
Jianhui,

696
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,470
my sister knows me.

697
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,360
I've always

698
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,930
-lived an honest life since childhood.
-Let me.

699
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,190
I say what's on my mind.

700
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,250
Look, my sister is about to have a baby.

701
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,800
I'm going to be the baby's uncle.

702
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,170
So,

703
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,450
I want to make a statement today.

704
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,490
All past grudges between our families,
let's wipe them clean.

705
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,760
We're one family now.

706
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,730
Let's make money together from now on.

707
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,660
-Okay.
-Cheers.

708
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,760
Your attitude change so fast.

709
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,010
Just now you were glaring at Jianhui,

710
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,940
and now you're like real brothers.

711
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,210
I don't care what you just talked about.

712
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,450
Everything's going well for us now.

713
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,410
No need to worry about life.

714
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,210
Let's just earn honest money.

715
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,380
Your sister just overthinks things.

716
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,490
Go check who it is.

717
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,020
Alright.

718
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,240
Okay, my dear sister,

719
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,840
you just focus on being a mom.

720
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:57,880
Okay?

721
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,800
Who are you looking for?

722
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,600
We're police.

723
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,750
Jianhui, quickly put away the goods.

724
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:10,740
Who is it?

725
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,320
Who?

726
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,280
We suspect you and Mu Jianhui

727
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,360
of illegally excavating ancient tombs

728
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,210
and trafficking cultural relics.

729
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,890
We're here to search your house.

730
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,750
You can't make such accusations.

731
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,520
Trafficking cultural relics is illegal.

732
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,650
How could we do that?

733
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,580
There must be some mistake.

734
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,280
[Search Warrant]

735
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,540
This is a legal search.

736
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,170
Officer,

737
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,840
we're law-abiding citizens.

738
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,930
How could we do that?

739
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,890
Trafficking cultural relics is illegal.

740
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,840
We won't do that.

741
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,040
That's right.

742
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,730
Everyone,

743
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,560
don't move.

744
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,760
Without permission,

745
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,570
you cannot leave this room.

746
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,730
Du, check other rooms.

747
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,550
Whose suitcase is that?

748
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,850
What's inside?

749
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,550
I brought it here.

750
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,920
Is there a problem?

751
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,030
Can we open it?

752
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,230
Sure.

753
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,370
That's a lot of money.

754
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,510
It's my own money.

755
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,180
Can I touch it?

756
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:41,840
Go ahead.

757
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,350
How should I call you, officer?

758
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,310
Qi Dacang.

759
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,990
Captain of the Cultural Relics Inspection Team, Qinchuan City Public Security Bureau.

760
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,650
Captain Qi,

761
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,940
go ahead with your search.

762
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,750
Can I eat now?

763
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,360
Yeah. It's getting cold.

764
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,080
Okay.

765
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,810
Done.

766
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,860
You've got some good stuff here.

767
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,000
What's wrong?

768
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,090
Jianhui, I'm not feeling well.

769
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:35,989
Officer,

770
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,850
can I go upstairs to rest for a while?

771
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,540
Feng, help her upstairs.

772
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,070
Alright.

773
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:43,770
Shulan,

774
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,590
let's go.

775
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,190
Be careful.

776
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,190
What's wrong?

777
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,050
What happened?

778
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,510
What...

779
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,290
Shulan.

780
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,380
What's going on?

781
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,710
She's bleeding!

782
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,470
Help! Take her to the hospital!

783
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,340
Please wait here.

784
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,680
Go get Qi Dacang right now!

785
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,840
Why did he barge into my house?

786
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,320
He made my sister bleed!

787
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,180
She's pregnant!

788
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,030
You can't handle cases like this!

789
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,570
You call yourself an advanced police station?

790
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,900
And what? The No.1 team?

791
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,380
What kind of No.1 team is this?

792
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,780
Is this how you do things?

793
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,250
Du.

794
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,190
Come.

795
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,700
What's going on?

796
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,390
Chief Zhao,

797
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,900
we've got a problem.

798
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,270
What?

799
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,650
During our search,

800
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,650
Mu Jianhui's wife fell.

801
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,500
She's an older pregnant woman.

802
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,330
There was a lot of bleeding.

803
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,610
Did you get physical with them?

804
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,500
No, we didn't.

805
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,900
We followed the procedure completely.

806
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,990
His wife said herself

807
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,790
that she was tired

808
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,650
and wanted to go upstairs to rest.

809
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,340
My goodness.

810
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
Who knew she'd fall going upstairs?

811
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,310
Captain Qi is still at the hospital.

812
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,190
She's been taken into surgery.

813
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,420
What about the alms bowl?

814
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,900
We didn't find it either.

815
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,520
We've brought Liu Shusheng and his wife

816
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,450
back here first.

817
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,320
I'd like to ask,

818
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,570
what crime have I committed?

819
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,970
Why are you detaining me?

820
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,780
We're not detaining you.

821
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,080
We just want you to clarify the facts.

822
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,860
What facts?

823
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,210
I don't know anything else.

824
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,470
I just saw you bullying a pregnant woman.

825
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,150
Be careful what you say.

826
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,860
We just want to ask about
a case involving cultural relics.

827
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,320
We hope you can cooperate.

828
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,940
Do you know Big Head?

829
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,180
No, I don't.

830
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,280
He knows your husband.

831
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,600
Then go ask my husband.

832
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,800
Why are you asking me?

833
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,850
Why did Mu Jianhui

834
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,910
come to your house?

835
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,490
He's my brother-in-law,

836
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,820
coming to visit us.

837
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,460
Do I need to explain that?

838
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,770
Well,

839
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,990
if he was just visiting you,

840
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,650
why did he bring so much money?

841
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,220
We're short on money for our business.

842
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,540
He was helping us out.

843
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,250
What kind of business

844
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,510
needs that much money?

845
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,980
Don't ask me about the business matters.

846
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,830
I don't know anything.

847
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,880
You should ask my husband about it.

848
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,770
You seem to be a high-ranking officer.

849
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,100
Let me ask you one thing.

850
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,540
Your subordinates

851
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,980
came to my house,

852
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,740
accusing me of tomb robbing

853
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,940
and trafficking relics.

854
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,340
Do you have any evidence?

855
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,200
We should go by evidence, right?

856
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,270
Do you know Hong Datong?

857
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,250
No.

858
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,470
Also known as Big Head.

859
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,370
That guy?

860
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,150
I've had drinks with him.

861
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,340
Just had drinks?

862
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,120
Yes, just had drinks.

863
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,130
When I was young,

864
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,450
I used to fool around.

865
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,660
That's when I met him.

866
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:04,940
Well,

867
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,300
that's ancient history.

868
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,400
We haven't been in touch for ages.

869
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,660
I'm a legitimate businessman now.

870
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,490
Let me ask you,

871
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,180
in recent years,

872
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,750
have you had any contact

873
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,770
with Big Head?

874
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,820
I already told you.

875
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
We haven't been in touch for ages.

876
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,280
I even deleted his number.

877
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,890
Then why was he driving your car?

878
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,940
He stole it.

879
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,660
I'm reporting it now.

880
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,060
It's not too late, right?

881
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,520
The car was stolen?

882
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,220
Can you take responsibility
for that statement?

883
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,010
Liu Shusheng,

884
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,790
I'll give you one more chance.

885
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,340
What's the deal with the car?

886
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,270
Think carefully before you speak.

887
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,820
You... I...

888
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,290
I lent it to him.

889
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,520
The thing is, he came to my house,

890
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,960
asking to borrow the car.

891
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,650
We used to hang out together after all,

892
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,910
and I'm a loyal friend.

893
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,940
It wouldn't have been right

894
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,130
to refuse,

895
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,460
so I let him take it.

896
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,940
Who knew he'd use it for that business?

897
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,800
What business?

898
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:16,970
What did he do?

899
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:18,860
I don't know.

900
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,500
I just heard

901
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,060
that he was involved in relics business,

902
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,790
and that he got killed in a car crash.

903
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,790
Who told you that?

904
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,290
It's been too long,

905
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,620
I can't quite remember.

906
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,660
I'll let you know if I recall.

907
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,170
Liu Shusheng,

908
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,590
let me tell you,

909
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,170
this is a confidential relics case.

910
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,070
Either there's a mole in our team,

911
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
or you're the one behind Big Head.

912
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:50,940
Well, officer,

913
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,170
you can't just say things like that.

914
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,500
You can't run a case based on assumptions.

915
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,290
You need evidence.

916
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,220
You can't just accuse me of that.

917
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,540
Your people came to my house

918
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,470
and searched it.

919
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,130
Right? They didn't find any relics.

920
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,730
You don't have any evidence.

921
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,860
Look, you...

922
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,610
your people searched it all

923
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,270
and even made my sister bleed.

924
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,460
She's pregnant.

925
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,940
If anything happens to her or the baby,

926
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm telling you, I won't live either.

927
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,050
You police can't bully us citizens,

928
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:16,690
right?

929
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,210
We're all law-abiding people.

930
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:18,860
If this is how you handle things,

931
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,060
I won't say another word from now on.

932
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,930
Liu Shulan's family.

933
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:36,980
How's my wife?

934
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,210
Is she in danger?

935
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,210
The blood loss is too severe.

936
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,090
We've prepared 1,200 milliliters of blood,

937
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,020
but it's not enough.

938
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,150
The nearest blood bank is an hour away.

939
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,130
The patient urgently needs

940
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,610
AB-type blood and platelets.

941
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,500
I'm AB type. Me.

942
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,020
Wang.

943
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:48,790
Wang,

944
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,500
take him for testing.

945
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,030
Alright.

946
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:50,900
Come with me.

947
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,380
Captain Qi.

948
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,500
The patient has a placental abruption.

949
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,210
More than two-thirds has detached.

950
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,690
The baby's blood supply has been affected.

951
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,450
We need to perform an emergency C-section.

952
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,180
If you agree, please sign here.

953
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,970
Can the baby be saved?

954
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,130
It's hard to say right now.

955
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,210
We'll do everything we can

956
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,010
to prevent oxygen deprivation.

957
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,680
Please, I'm begging you.

958
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,340
Please.

959
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,550
How's it going on your end?

960
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,720
Chief Zhao,

961
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,550
we can't continue on our side.

962
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,950
That He Xiaofeng is just a shrew.

963
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,280
How can we question her?

964
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,590
Leave her alone for a while.

965
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,570
That Liu Shusheng

966
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,830
is a tough nut to crack.

967
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,980
He's very aware of
counter-investigation techniques.

968
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,940
We haven't found any relics yet.

969
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,860
We're too passive.

970
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,690
And we can't ask too many questions.

971
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,380
We have to protect our informant too.

972
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,640
The real trouble right now is Liu Shulan.

973
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,470
I'll go to the hospital

974
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,610
to check on the situation later.
