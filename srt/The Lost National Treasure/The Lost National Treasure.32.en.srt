[Episode 32]

3
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,890
We're giving you a chance now.

4
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,509
Adjust your attitude

5
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,479
and tell us the truth.

6
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,950
Maybe you can get lenient treatment.

7
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,150
If you are glib-tongued or play tricks,

8
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,160
you'll be punished more severely.

9
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,180
I'll tell you.

10
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,530
I'll tell you everything.

11
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,610
What happened in Qingyuan County
this time?

12
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,840
Who is the organizer?

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,300
I don't know his real name.

14
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,480
All I know is
his nickname is Three Fingers.

15
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,770
Because he only has
three fingers on his right hand.

16
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,590
I don't know much

17
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,720
about other things.

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,120
We didn't talk much
during those few days of work.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,630
Have you had any contact
with Three Fingers

20
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,840
after that?

21
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,680
No.

22
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,000
I tried calling him.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
His phone was off.

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,000
He might be dead.

25
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,150
Why did you fight?

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,690
I don't know either.

27
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,490
We scouted out the place that day.

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,220
We were planning to dig a hole.

29
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,430
After we arrived,

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,360
I was keeping watch in the car.

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,630
As soon as they entered,

32
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,560
a group of people surrounded them.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,590
With sticks and hammers,

34
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,650
they smashed them.

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,030
They seemed to want them dead!

36
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,000
Goodness! They

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,930
got into a melee.

38
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,790
Someone's head was bleeding...

39
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,280
Get to the point, get to the point.

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,680
Upon seeing this terrible situation,

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,710
I thought if I didn't run,
I wouldn't be able to save my life.

42
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,910
So I turned on the lights
and stepped on the gas,

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,710
and I ran away.

44
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,680
So how did you know they were from Hedong?

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,970
It's their accents.

46
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,840
Brothers, kill him for me!

00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,440
Why are there so many people here today?

49
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,360
Good question.

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,630
We are from

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
the Qinchuan City Public Security Bureau.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,910
This is Deputy Chief

53
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,370
of Qingyuan County Public Security Bureau.

54
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,400
If it weren't for a big deal,

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,430
we wouldn't make such a grand display.

56
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,400
Do you know why?

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,480
I don't know.

58
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,840
You just won't change your mind
until you face the consequences, huh?

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,150
Do I have to make you repeat

60
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,079
what you did in Chengguan Village?

61
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,030
The wound on your face

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,010
didn't come from a fall.

63
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,690
You fought with someone, didn't you?

64
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,410
I did get into a fight in Qingyuan County.

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,560
With whom?

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,910
Be honest!

67
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,000
How many things have you been hiding
from me

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,080

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,540
Do you think you're smart?

70

If I hadn't used my brain

71
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,269
or known anything,

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,730
how would I have known
you fought in Qingyuan County?

73
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,950
I fought Uncle's men.

74
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,040
He stole my goods.

75
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,659
I couldn't take it anymore.

76
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,750
How did you find them?

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,370
King Hua told me.

78
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,840
He told me

79
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,070
Uncle's men

80
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,270
would have a deal
in Chengguan Village, Qingyuan County.

81
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,210
He asked me to find people
to deal with him.

82
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,350
You beat one of them

83
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,510
the hardest,

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,540
didn't you?

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,860
The one who sold the explosives to me.

86
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,800
Is it the one
with three fingers on his right hand?

87
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,090
I don't think so.

88
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,310

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,540

91
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,610
Is it the stolen official seal
in Yin Village?

92
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,070
Yes, we heard some news
from the black market

93
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,040
that the official seal
unearthed in Yin Village

94

97
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,800
Okay.

This place is so great.

99
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,560
It's quite nice.

Please.

106
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,190
Okay. Okay. Okay.

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,640
Please. Please. Please.

108
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,430
Come on, have a seat.

109
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,800
Have a seat. Have a seat.

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
This face is unfamiliar.

111
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,340
Is he the one

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
who wants to join the association?

113
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,480
That's right.

114
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,270
Mu Jianhui, Mr. Mu.

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm so flattered.

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,120
How dare I call myself like that
before Qin?

117
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,870
I'm just

118
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,130
a beginner who likes collecting things.

119
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,480
You're being modest.

120
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,240
After all, you've published a book.

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Published a book?

122
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,230
What book?

123
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,530
It's not really a book,

124
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,090
just some random thoughts.

125
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,950
It's not a big deal.

126
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,880
Appreciation of Black Pottery Figurines.

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,430
Are they the batch
that returned 10 years ago?

128
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,030
Yes.
I would appreciate your expert revision.

129
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,840
This is great.

130
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,640
I love to exchange ideas
with you young people.

131
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,740
Sit, sit, everyone, please sit down.

132
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,560
Alright, thank you.

133
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Okay. Okay. Okay.

134
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,780
I've always wanted

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,390
to visit you.

136
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,070
But I didn't have a chance.

137
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,180
I dared not bother you.

138
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,159
Chairman Lin, thank you for letting me

139
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,270
learn from Qin face-to-face.

140
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,630
I'm so flattered.

141
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm so flattered.

142
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm just the Vice Chairman.

143
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,290
Why isn't Chairman Zhao here?

144
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
Youlin isn't coming.

145
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,470
He's not feeling well.

146
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,390
Lin.

147
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,930
You should take care of the association
from now on.

148
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,120
Youlin

149
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,550
has resigned.

150
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,560
I heard

151
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,360
he quit his position
as Director of Mingde Museum.

152
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,390
I didn't expect that
he would also resign as Chairman.

153
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,950
It's really a pity.

154
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,000
Pity?

155
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,070
It's nothing pitiful.

156
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,290
These past few days,

157
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,540
I've reflected on myself at home.

158
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,320
What is the ultimate development direction

159
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,090
for the Qinchuan collecting community?

160
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,870
I thought about it repeatedly at home.

161
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,190
I suddenly recalled a saying
from Confucius.

162
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,140
"A noble person
focuses on strengthening the roots;

163
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,670
once the roots are firm,
the path of virtue naturally unfolds."

164
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,650
What exactly is the root

165
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,170
of the collecting community?

166
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,550
Can any of you

167
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,680
tell me?

168
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,350
Chairman.

169
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,250
I'm just a rough man.

170
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,400
This is what I think.

171
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,630
I believe,

172
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,120
the collecting community
is rooted in genuineness.

173
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,070
Value.

174
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,240
Qin,

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,510
please allow me to say something.

176
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,040
You can just listen for fun.

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,660
I remember Zhuang Zhou once said,

178
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,510
"Hui Shi is hugely learned,
with five cartloads of books."

179
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,630
It means Huizi collected books that could
be loaded in more than five carts.

180
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,090
That's how "profoundly learned" came from.

181
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,070
So,

182
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,540
the root of the community

183
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,270
lies in preserving traditional culture,

184
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,910
much like Noah's Ark.

185
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,470
Listen to him. Listen to him.

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,730
Just based on what he just said,

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,240
I know this book

188
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,370
is far from being just empty talk.

189
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,150
Qin.

190
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,170
You have a great eye for talent.

191
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,030
Jianhui, make a toast.

192
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
Yes. Yes. Yes.

193
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,630
Let me toast you with tea instead of wine.

194
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,910
Come on, come on, come on.

195
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,480
Okay. Okay.

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,010
Let me say something first.

197
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,430
Don't just talk the talk.

198
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,960
We should work
to offer constructive suggestions

199
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,240
to the Qinchuan collecting community.

200
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,790
Yes. Yes. Yes.

201
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,510
Come on. Come on.

202
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,480
Come on. Come on.

203
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,180
Come on.

204
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,550
Cheers.

205
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,550
Okay. Okay. Okay.

206
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,390
Please, sit down.

207
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,800
Recently,

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,360
a Han Dynasty official seal
is scheduled for auction in Hong Kong.

209
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,820
I think,

210
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,860
why don't we buy it at auction?

211
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,970
If we bring it back,

212
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,390
our Antiques Association
can seek a good reputation.

213
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,970
The official seal is too small.

214
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,040
Can it be considered a relic?

215
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
There's no collection value at all.

216
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm not sure about that.

217
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,550
There are many official seals unearthed
in the Han Dynasty's Yang Mausoleum.

218
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,000
The official institutions on these seals

219
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,550
symbolize the centralization
in the mausoleum complex.

220
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,840
Don't underestimate
the small official seal.

221
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,150
It means a lot.

222
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,160
The research value is huge.

223
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,600
The archaeological team thinks
it's a treasure.

224
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,430
That's right.

225
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,800
Collecting should
go beyond monetary gains.

226
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,960
An item's cultural quality and heritage

227
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,480
are the most important.

228
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,530
Well said, Qin.

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,040
That's it.

230
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,400
Let's go to Hong Kong together.

231
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,670
What do you think?

232
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,910
I agree.

233
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,310
We can do this.

234
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Come on. Come on.

235
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,480
Come on. Come on.

236
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,060
Come on.

237
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,520
After the meticulous investigation
of the police departments in two regions,

238
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,010
everyone unanimously believes,

239
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,240
the Yin Village grand tomb case

240
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,840
and the gang fight

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
and grave robbery case in Qingyuan County

242
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
were committed by the same gang.

243
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,600
These cases meet the conditions
for consolidation.

244
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,080
Therefore, the bureau has decided

245
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,300
to form a special investigation team

246
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,030
dedicated to

247
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,030
the 317 Serial Gang

248
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,850
Tomb-Raiding Case.

249
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,000
I will serve as the team leader.

250
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Qi Dacang

251
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,130
and Wu Zhenchuan
are the deputy team leaders.

252
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,670
But

253
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,370
this cultural relics case

254
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,210
has its own unique characteristics.

255
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,670
We need help
from the Cultural Relics Bureau.

256
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,470
Captain Yang.

257
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,510
Please say something to everyone.

258
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,970
We're investigating the official seal now.

259
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,510
We've contacted the auction house
in Hong Kong.

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,460
However, they emphasized

261
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,430
the lawfulness of formalities.

262
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,780
They don't want to give us information
about the proxy bidder.

263
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,460
Has Xiao Guoqiang been found yet?

264
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,030
Sir,

265
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,000
not yet.

266
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,270
How's the investigation
of Three Fingers and Gunner?

267
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,670
Sir,

268
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,550
I gave the National Cultural Relics Crime
Information Center

269
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,120
their clues.

270
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,390
They are in trial operation.

271
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,850
Let's give it a try as well.

272
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,750
I've also sent investigators

273
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,410
to the hospital to look into it

274
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,910
to see if there's a seriously ill person
with a strong suspicion.

275
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,510
But there are no leads so far.

276
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,100
Chief Zhao.

277
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,480
I have an idea,

278
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
but it's a risky move.

279
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,680
Go ahead.

280
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,630
Look,

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,330
Uncle's gang has long drawn attention
for its high profile.

282
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,690
They've offended many tomb raiders.

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,910
We might as well

284
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,510
leverage opposing forces to our advantage.

285
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,840
We can spread the news about Three Fingers

286
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,270
to see if there are any of his enemies

287
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,390
provide us with some leads.

288
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,410
Chief Zhao,

289
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,480
I think this is a bit risky.

290
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,150
If we spread the news,

291
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,210
would we alert Three Fingers?

292
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,510
That's why I said it's a risky move.

293
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,080
If we don't take this risky move now,

294
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,630
we're stuck

295
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,270
in a dead end.

296
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,720
But if we take this risky move,

297
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,510
there

298
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,720
might be

299
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,170
a silver lining,

300
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,150
right?

301
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,200
Alright.

302
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,860
I agree to give it a try.

303
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,100
[Hong Kong]

304
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,240
Qin.

305
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,480
I heard

306
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,360
we're not the only ones
keeping an eye on this official seal.

307
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Some foreigners are also eyeing it.

308
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,090
Don't worry.

309
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,450
In the battle of determination,

310
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,600
we Chinese people never lose.

311
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,840
Qin.

312
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,560
Qin is here. Qin.

313
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,910
Everyone's here.

314
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,360
Qin. Qin. Qin.

315
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,960
Youlin.

316
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,120
Why didn't you tell me in advance
that you were coming to Hong Kong?

317
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,320
I didn't know about it either.

318
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,120
I was thinking

319
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,150
I could go first

320
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,390
to buy it.

321
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,320
Consider this purchase

322
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,520
as a contribution to Qinchuan culture.

323
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,390
Qin

324
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,080
has foresight.

325
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,270
Since Qin is here,

326
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,870
I'm relieved now.

327
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,530
Mr. Mu, you're here too.

328
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
I didn't even recognize you.

329
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,840
Is it because
you've changed your appearance,

330
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,440
or did I just not see clearly?

331
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,720
You two know each other?

332
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,320
We've met,

333
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,160
but not really acquainted.

334
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,750
Well said.

335
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,200
You really live up to the old saying.

336
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,070
"Human connections are fragile,"

337
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,850
you know,

338
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,490
"and life is an ever-changing game."

339
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,760
Awesome.

340
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,320
Alright.

341
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,000
You must all be tired.

342
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,570
We have an auction to attend tomorrow.

343
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,270
Let's go back and rest first.

344
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,440
Okay. Okay. Okay.

345
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,800
Goodbye.

346
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:37,750
Qin.

347
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,720
Qin.

348
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,270
Look,

349
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,840
about tomorrow's matter...

350
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:47,910
Youlin.

351
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,810
You shouldn't go to the auction tomorrow.

352
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,320
Why?

353
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,000
Why?

354
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,870
If you go,

355
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,750
even if the item acquired at auction
is genuine,

356
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,750
others will still assume it's fake.

357
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,790
Qin.

358
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,850
Well,

359
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,360
I know this time,

360
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,180
I've disgraced the association

361
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,720
and the museum.

362
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,670
Well, could you

363
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,610
give me a chance

364
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,600
to turn over a new leaf?

365
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,870
Chances

366
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,960
are for those who are really capable,

367
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,350
not for local tycoons.

368
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,630
Well said.

369
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
Although I'm a local tycoon,

370
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,950
I'm doing legitimate business.

371
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,060
The capable person you mentioned

372
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,840
is doing shady business.

373
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,270
Do you know that?

374
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,830
Have a drink.

375
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,270
I see you're still

376
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,470
quite confident.

377
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,670
Why wouldn't I?

378
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
You just went to Qin

379
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,430
and exposed my past, didn't you?

380
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,030
Zhao,

381
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,780
you're the one who should be worried.

382
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Once this card is played,

383
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,540
do you have any cards left?

384
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,810
Do you know how many cards
I still have in my hand?

385
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,080
One,

386
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,270
two,

387
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,320
three...

388
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,010
I can't even count them all.

389
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,720
You think by kicking me out,

390
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
you can get on board?

391
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,090
Do you know how big this ship is?

392
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,120
One, two, three?

393
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,750
Why? You think a pawn becomes a queen

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,480
and can dominate the game?

395
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,750
You probably don't even know your opponent

396
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,790
in the game.

397
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,510
So what?

398
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,210
Once the game has started,

399
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,360
no matter who is on the other side,

400
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,760
I have to play it through.

401
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,200
It's just an auction.

402
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,410
It's not good if he wins the bid.

403
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,030
Qin.

404
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,550
This way, please.

405
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,920
Director Wang.

406
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,810
Chairman Lin.

407
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,340
Jianhui.

408
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,550
Have a seat.

409
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,080
Alright.

410
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,740
Ladies and gentlemen,

411
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,400
the Hong Kong Jiahua Auction House's

412
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,070
32nd Antique and Cultural Relics

413
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,110
Premium Auction has now officially begun.

414
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:51,840
Now, I'll introduce
the first item up for auction.

415
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,810
[Hong Kong Jiahua]

416
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,540
It's a Songkeng Duan inkstone.

417
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,240
This inkstone was made
during the Ming Dynasty.

418
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,790
The stone is solid, smooth,
and fine-grained.

419
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,030
The carving is exquisite.

420
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,000
The starting bid is 450,000 yuan.

421
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,290
Any bids, everyone?

422
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,030
450,000.

423
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,200
We have 450,000.

424
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,030
Any other bids?

425
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,680
460,000.

426
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,550
460,000 from the center section.

427
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,210
470,000, thank you very much.

428
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,070
480,000.

429
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,310
480,000 yuan from No. 3035.

430
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,920
Any more bids?

431
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
480,000 yuan,

432
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,920

433
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,070
480,000 yuan,

434
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,000
going twice.

435
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,030
480,000 yuan,

436
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,750
last call.

437
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,590
Your bidding number, please.

438
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,030
Sold!

439
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,000
Congratulations, No. 3035.

440
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,110
Next, we'll introduce
a bronze official seal.

441
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,030
This official seal was made
during the Han Dynasty.

442
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,920
It's over 2,000 years old.

443
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,550
The bottom is engraved with the four
characters "Music Bureau Director's Seal."

444
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,030
The seal was once in private collection
in late Qing Dynasty.

445
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,070
It was later lost overseas due to the war.

446
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,310
It has been owned
by a Japanese collector since then.

447
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,240
The starting bid is 100,000 yuan.

448
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,830
Are there any interested bidders?

449
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,630
100,000 yuan.

450
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,720

00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,440
150,000 yuan.

454
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,480
150,000 yuan.

455
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,450
The current bid is 200,000.

456
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,400

00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,160

800,000, thank you very much.

465
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,390
The gentleman in the front row
has bid 800,000.

466
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,510

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:31,930
going...

469
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,920
850,000 yuan.

470
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,580

471
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,670

473
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,030
850,000 yuan,

474
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,880
going once.

475
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,880
850,000 yuan...

476
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,200
900,000.

477
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,680
Back to the left section: 900,000.

478
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,030

900,000 yuan, going twice.

484
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,350
950,000.

485
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,890
950,000 yuan, thank you very much.

486
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,240
950,000 yuan.

487
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,700
Any more bids, ladies and gentlemen?

488
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,030
950,000.

489
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,790
950,000,

490
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,070
going once.

491
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,960
950,000 yuan,

492
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,040
going twice.

493
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,350

494
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,240
One million.

495
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,600
Back to the center section.

496
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,510
One million yuan from Bidder No. 5659.

497
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,330
Any more bids, ladies and gentlemen?

498
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,480
One million.

499
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,110
One million yuan, going once.

500
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,830
One million yuan,

501
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,160
going twice.

502
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,270
One million yuan,

503
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,310
last call.

504
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,660
Your bidding number, please.

505
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,920
Sold!

506
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,160
Congratulations to Bidder No. 5659.

507
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,760
You now own the Han Dynasty
bronze Music Bureau Director's Seal.

508
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,510
Now we'll proceed with the next item.

509
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,890
Have you eaten?

510
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,020
I'm not eating.

511
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,110
The official seal

512
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,810
has been sold to a bidder.

513
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,590
Who is the bidder?

514
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,270
Get it back.

515
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,110
What?

516
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,690
A foreigner?

517
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,300
That's even worse.

518
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,310
It can't be...

519
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,440
Yes.

520
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,170
It's exactly who you're thinking of.

521
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,610
Mu Jianhui is quite capable, isn't he?

522
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,770
We underestimated him.

523
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,200
Qin.

524
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,960
What do you mean?

525
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,000
We agreed on this before coming.

526
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,720
We're here
on behalf of the Antiques Association

527
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,310
to bring back the cultural relic.

528
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,510
Although I bought it,

529
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,250
I'm willing to donate it
to the association.

530
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,290
Well...

531
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,010
I'm afraid that might not be appropriate.

532
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,160
What's not appropriate about it?

533
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,830
I believe whether it's Chairman Lin
or Director Wang,

534
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,400
whoever bought it would donate it
to the association.

535
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,750
Does our Antiques Association

536
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,750
accept donations based on seniority?

537
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,880
That's not the case.

538
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,920
Although I'm new here,

539
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,850
I care about the association's development

540
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,510
just as much as everyone else.

541
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,210
Jianhui,

542
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,640
don't misunderstand us.

543
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,210
Qin is looking out for you.

544
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,590
This one million yuan

545
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,320
is not a small amount after all.

546
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,030
As long as
it benefits the association's development,

547
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,350
my personal gain or loss doesn't matter.

548
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,590
Everyone knows
our association is in Hong Kong now.

549
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,770
If we return empty-handed,

550
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,270
who knows what rumors will spread.

551
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,590
Qin,

552
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,400
Mu has a point.

553
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,700
Is it because that landfill

554
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,590
is occupying your family's land?

555
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,070
Auntie,

556
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,550
everything in our village
has to go through Uncle Youliang.

557
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,960
How can you not know
whose land is occupied?

558
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,790
That's what I thought.

559
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,720
You don't usually come to my house,

560
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,000
but you came to my house today

561
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,830
to get some information, right?

562
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,400
Xian.

563
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,030
-You're back.
-Mr. Fang is back.

564
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,350
I'll go get you some food.

565
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,350
No rush, no rush, Auntie.

566
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,640
They haven't come back yet.

567
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,550
I'll go rest for a bit.

568
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,350
-You take a rest.
-You guys go on.

569
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,350
Let me tell you,

570
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,350
that garbage dump

571
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,000
is full of flies.

572
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,200
The stench is overwhelming.

573
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,060
It's making people very annoyed.

574
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,710
If you set up another one,

575
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,340
what are we supposed to do?

576
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,050
Auntie,

577
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,450
is the garbage dump you mentioned
the landfill?

578
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,760
That's right.

579
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
It's occupying Yin Village's land?

580
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,790
That's what everyone's saying anyway.

581
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,590
I don't know.

582
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,560
Uncle.

583
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,070
-Chief is back.
-You're back.

584
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,160
Auntie, I'll head back first then.

585
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,510
Yes, yes, yes.

586
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,720
You go ahead with your business.

587
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,120
Uncle.

588
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,570
What's the deal with the landfill?

589
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,110
Do you know about
the first phase of the project?

590
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,200
They say this second phase

591
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,160
is even bigger than the first phase.

592
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,420
They say times are changing too fast now,

593
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,200
so they need to build an even bigger one.

594
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,010
Well...

595
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,510
What's the specific area it covers?

596
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,720
It seems

597
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,080
both Yin Village and Chenjiapo
are involved.

598
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,240
The grand tomb in Yin Village...

599
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,480
I was so angry
that I forgot to look at the planning map.

600
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,310
Seems it's very close to the tomb.

601
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,040
How can that be acceptable?

602
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,330
Which leader organized the meeting?

603
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,010
With so many leaders, how can I remember?

604
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,270
Director,

605
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,000
we've seen the planning map

606
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,880
of this landfill for the second phase.

607
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,750
The location has already

608
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,920
been marked right up
to the edge of our outer burial pit.

609
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,250
We really need to hurry.

610
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,720
I've known this for a while.

611
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,270
Let me speak frankly.

612
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,270
Pushing back against their plan

613
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,850
won't be a simple task.

614
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,160
Because this matter

615
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
isn't something that just a few people

616
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,920
has decided on a whim.

617
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,960
It must have gone through discussions
from various aspects

618
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,680
before they decided to do this.

619
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,610
In recent years,

620
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,240
our archaeological work

621
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,680
and their urban development

622
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,280
are bound to have conflicts.

623
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,070
Although some have proposed

624
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,480
the idea of whether we could

625
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,750
conduct archaeological work first

626
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,010
before land transfer,

627
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,400
this is still in the discussion stage.

628
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,240
We also hope

629
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,570
this idea can be implemented soon,

630
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,080
right?

631
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,780
It's like this.

632
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,290
I will report this matter to my superiors.

633
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,540
But there's one thing we must ensure.

634
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,030
We absolutely can't allow
the grand tomb in Yin Village

635
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,160
to be damaged again.

636
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,410
Director, well,

637
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,920
let me speak frankly

638
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,310
and share some personal thoughts with you.

639
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,590
We didn't come to see you today

640
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,350
just because of
the grand tomb in Yin Village.

641
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,810
There are also personal feelings involved.

642
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,000
As you know,

643
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,310
we've been doing archaeological work
in Yin Village for so many years.

644
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,920
We've developed feelings

645
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,980
for the villagers.

646
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,550
We also need to consider

647
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,010
the people of Yin Village.

648
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,310
I-I understand your feelings
for Yin Village.

649
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,030
I'll do my best to handle this matter.

650
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,560
I called you both here today

651
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,110
to discuss another matter.

652
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,870
The stolen official seal

653
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,690
in the grand tomb in Yin Village

654
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,210
has been found.

655
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,030
Where did you find it?

656
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,090
This official seal

657
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,030
was first smuggled to Hong Kong.

658
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,730
After being laundered,

659
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,180
it appeared at an auction.

660
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,720
Now it's in the hands of

661
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,920
our Qinchuan Antiques Association.

662
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,350
They plan to donate it

663
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,740
to our archaeological team
for research purposes.

664
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Donate it to us? That's great news.

665
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,350
Yes, it's good news indeed.

666
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,560
However, there's something

667
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,510
that makes me feel

668
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,960
uncomfortable.

669
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,110
I think

670
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,850
you two should know.

671
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,310
Although the Antiques Association
is donating this official seal,

672
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,920
the person who bought it

673
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,010
at the auction in Hong Kong

674
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,680
is called Mu Jianhui.

675
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,840
Mu Jianhui?

676
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,070
I don't know the specifics,

677
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,370
but Yang Qingshi mentioned this person
to me before.

678
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,780
What do you two think

679
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,130
of this matter?

680
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,930
To be honest,

681
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,910
emotionally, I can't accept it.

682
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,830
But rationally,

683
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,590
I have to accept this reality.

684
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,350
Mu Jianhui...

685
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,590
The fault doesn't lie
with the official seal,

686
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,790
but with the tomb raiders.

687
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,880
We can't let their shamelessness and greed

688
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,680
block the path for cultural relics
to return home.

689
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,160
Captain Qi.

690
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,640
Captain Qi.

691
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,840
What brings you here?

692
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,810
I've been waiting for you.

693
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,990
Let's go inside and talk.

694
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,770
Right here.

695
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,730
Right here.

696
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,320
Alright.

697
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,480
Days ago,

698
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,310
someone

699
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,960
bought back the stolen official seal
in the Han mausoleum

700
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,880
at an auction.

701
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,930
He even wants to donate it to you.

702
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,780
Are you

703
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,380
aware of this?

704
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,350
Yes.

705
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,480
Director Lu told us about it.

706
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,640
It's Mu Jianhui who wants to donate it.

707
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,790
At the last book signing event,

708
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,920
I wanted to ask you

709
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,410
what exactly this Mu Jianhui does.

710
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,200
Is he a Relics Dealer?

711
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,800
I wouldn't dare say that.

712
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,360
There's no solid evidence.

713
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,550
As for the case,

714
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,510
I can't say much.

715
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:48,880
Do you understand?

716
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,240
Yes.

717
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,240
Let me just introduce

718
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,070
this Mu Jianhui.

719
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,070
Ten years ago,

720
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,510
he was selling goods
on the street in South Market.

721
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,720
Then one day,

722
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,970
he suddenly made it big.

723
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,160
He opened a shop.

724
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,160
His shop

725
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
is not much different from others'.

726
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,720
But the police force feels

727
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,790
this man is not simple.

728
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,710
We've been following him
for so many years,

729
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,560
but haven't found anything.

730
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,060
Let me put it simply.

731
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,830
Over these years,

732
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,920
he's written a book,

733
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,680
joined the Antiques Association,

734
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,480
and mingled with the big shots
in Qinchuan.

735
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,080
He's become a cultured person.

736
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,160
But underneath this facade,

737
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,400
how much dirt there is

738
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,200
on his hands and feet

739
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,680
is unclear.

740
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,240
Understand?

741
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,680
Then about this official seal, we...

742
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,330
Accept it without fail.

743
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,750
Got it.

744
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,320
Got it.

745
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,200
Mother.

746
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,270
This fellow is sincere.

747
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,830
Please help him.

748
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,750
Show him the way.

749
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,690
Show me the way, show me the way.

750
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,590
Help him avoid unnecessary detours.

751
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,590
It can be done.

752
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,360
That's great, that's great.

753
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,420
A small token of appreciation,
not much, but sincere.

754
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,620
Wish you all the best.

755
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,720
Wish you all the best.

756
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,480
Take care on your way.

757
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:31,750
I'm leaving.

758
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,310
Alright, alright.

759
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,510
I'm going, I'm going.

760
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,350
It can be done.

761
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,110
Gou Sheng.

762
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,360
Isn't this Captain Yang?

763
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,350
Y-You didn't tell me you were coming.

764
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,010
Have a seat.

765
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,280
I dare not.

766
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,760
If I sit here,

767
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,070
people in the South Market will think
I came to you for fortune-telling.

768
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,510
We haven't seen each other
for over 10 years.

769
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,400
If it wasn't for you guys back then,

770
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,130
calling me in for questioning,

771
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,640
my mother's reputation
as a dog spirit medium

772
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,070
wouldn't have spread so far.

773
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,270
Don't talk nonsense.

774
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,170
Let me tell you,

775
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,550
spreading feudal ideology is illegal.

776
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,810
What's the matter?

777
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,770
Why did you call me here?

778
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Are you turning yourself in or what?

779
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,400
I know

780
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,550
who Three Fingers

781
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,810
you're looking for is.

782
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,970
You know Three Fingers?

783
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,270
Come on.

784
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,050
Tell me.

785
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,720
Who

786
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
is Three Fingers?

787
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,790
Years ago,

788
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,680
I had just gained a bit of fame.

789
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,100
Someone came to me for a fortune-telling.

790
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,510
He said he was planning
to do something in a few days.

791
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,310
He asked if he could make a fortune.

792
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,400
So I consulted my mother about it.

793
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,200
My mother said it would work out.

794
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,880
Who would have known

795
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
he was planning to make explosives?

796
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,800
That idiot was making them
in his own house.

797
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,510
It exploded, blowing off even the roof.

798
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,200
He didn't make any money
or finish the deal

799
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,440
and even got arrested

800
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,200
by the police.

801
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,310
He brought shame to his ancestors.

802
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,830
He has a problem with his brain,

803
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,550
yet he blamed me.

804
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,510
As soon as he got out,

805
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:03,920
he came right here

806
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
to beat me up.

807
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,360
While he was hitting me,

808
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,450
I saw that his right hand
only has three fingers.

809
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,510
If you ask me, it's a wonder
the explosion didn't kill him.

810
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,680
So, this Three Fingers,

811
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,330
what's his name?

812
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,600
I don't know his name.

813
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,730
You don't know his name.

814
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,480
I don't know.

815
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,240
What does he look like?

816
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,970
How old is he?

817
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,830
A bit over 170 cm tall.

818
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,610
Square-faced.

819
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,580
A young man in his twenties.

820
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,510
In his twenties.

821
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,680
In which year?

822
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,370
Not long after
the black pottery figurine incident.

823
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,890
If I calculate,

824
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,430
it's been about 10 years.

825
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,200
Ten years ago, which month?

826
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,790
Which month? It was winter. It was cold.

827
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,790
Tell me,

828
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,440
how many years did he serve in prison?

829
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,410
How many years?

830
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,550
I feel like it has been over three years.

831
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,830
Over three years.

832
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,560
Three years.

833
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,550
What accent does he have?

834
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,270
Qinchuan accent.

835
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,240
Qinchuan accent.

836
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,310
He should be a local from Qinchuan.

837
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,160
Anything else? Any other characteristics?

838
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,690
Other characteristics...

839
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,350
There aren't any.

840
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,440
No other special features.

841
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,900
He's just a normal person.

842
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,450
Alright.

843
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,400
That'll do.

844
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,330
Good, Gou Sheng.

845
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,640
You could be a big help.

846
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,820
Let me tell you,

847
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,440
if the case is solved,

848
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,760
I'll apply to the higher-ups

849
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,760
to give you a proper commendation.

850
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,750
If you have any more information,

851
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,750
report to me

852
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,390
immediately.

853
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,340
No problem.

854
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,030
Can you do it?

855
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,440
Sure.

856
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,640
You shouldn't spread

857
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,400
feudal thinking.

858
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,110
That's illegal.

859
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,830
My mother just helped you,

860
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,310
and now you turn your back on her.

861
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,000
A person from Qinchuan.

862
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,270
Imprisoned in the winter of 2002

863
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,000
or the spring of 2003

864
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,030
and charged with
illegal manufacture of explosives.

865
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,360
He blew up his own house.

866
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,110
Imprisoned in his twenties.

867
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,110
Released
after serving more than three years.

868
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,480
Usually eligible for sentence reduction.

869
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,400
We could consider increasing the sentence

870
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,670
by one or two years.

871
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,360
Another characteristic:

872
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,480
square-shaped face,

873
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,409
over 170 cm tall.

874
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Are these enough?

875
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,760
With this criminal record,

876
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,800
we can narrow it down to

877
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,630
location, charge, and length of sentence.

878
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,630
That's quite detailed.

879
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,280
We should be able to find him quickly.

880
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,630
Good.

881
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,030
Well done, Captain Yang. I didn't expect

882
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,880
to find a breakthrough
in the old black pottery figurine case.

883
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,199
That's right.

884
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,400
Maybe Gou Sheng's mother is helping us.

885
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,280
Anyway,

886
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I believe

887
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,020
justice will prevail.

888
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,440
Today, the Qinchuan Antiques Association

889
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,070
is holding a relic donation ceremony for
the Han mausoleum archaeological team

890
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,190
in Yin Village.

891
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,710
The representatives for this donation
include

892
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,550
Mr. Qin Jiming, Chairman
of the Qinchuan Antiques Association.

893
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,510
Bravo! Bravo!

894
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,760
Bravo! Bravo!

895
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,740
Mr. Lin Shenghui, Vice Chairman.

896
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,290
Bravo! Bravo!

897
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,230
[Qinchuan Antiques Association
Western Han Relic Donation Ceremony]

898
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,150
And a private collector, Mr. Mu Jianhui.

899
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,550
Bravo!

900
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,110
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

901
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

902
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,320
The donated cultural relic

903
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,590
was recently acquired at an auction
in Hong Kong.

904
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,000
It's a Han Dynasty bronze official seal
from the Music Bureau.

905
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,430
Qin,

906
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,130
could you please share

907
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,930
your thoughts on this donation?

908
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,000
Certainly.

909
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,020
I'd be glad to

910
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,890
share with everyone.

911
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,440
Alright.

912
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,800
Even in a humble position, one must not
forget to worry about the country.

913
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,130
From the moment we heard

914
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,550
that this official seal

915
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,760
was to be auctioned

916
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,450
in Hong Kong,

917
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,400
my colleagues at the Antiques Association
and I

918
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,070
felt extremely anxious.

919
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,450
We feared
the relic might fall into the wrong hands.

920
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,070
So we immediately went to Hong Kong
to secure it.

921
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,840
Were you confident that
you could definitely retrieve the seal?

922
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,570
No, I wasn't.

923
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,510
But I had to go all in.

924
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,360
We had to use all our collective efforts

925
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,280
to bring the relic back at all costs,

926
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,360
letting it return to its home.

927
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,000
That's our shared wish.

928
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,300
I heard that

929
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,960
this seal was acquired by Mr. Mu

930
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,440
at a high price.

931
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,630
Do you think
it's worth spending so much money?

932
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,170
Of course it's worth it.

933
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,710
Cultural relics have a price,
but they are also priceless.

934
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm very happy

935
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,870
to exchange tangible price
for intangible value.

936
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,440
This is also

937
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,840
due to the influence of
the Antiques Association, Chairman Qin,

938
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,760
and Chairman Lin's passion.

939
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,560
Without their support,

940
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,020
I might not have had this determination.

941
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,930
I know Mr. Fang
from the archaeological team.

942
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,710
Mr. Fang, do you remember me?

943
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,160
I have a deep impression.

944
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,210
I have an equally deep impression.

945
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,890
We had a discussion

946
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
at my book launch.

947
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,320
Mr. Fang,

948
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,630
you said something
that left a deep impression on me.

949
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,230
I still remember it vividly.

950
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,070
What tomb raiders steal

951
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,810
is a witness to history

952
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,880
and the key to civilization.

953
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,630
Now,

954
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,760
I am honored

955
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,880
to return the witness of history
and the key to civilization

956
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,960
to the country.

957
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,440
The Antiques Association and I

958
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,460
will continue to do our utmost

959
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,000
to bring more lost cultural relics home
as soon as possible.

960
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,350
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

961
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,150
Thank you very much, Mr. Mu,

962
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,280
for remembering what I said back then.

963
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,510
If I had known

964
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,670
that each of my words was worth a million,

965
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,190
I would have definitely said more.

966
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,790
It might have made Mr. Mu here

967
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,240
donate a few more pieces.

968
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,760
Kun, you can say a few more words now

969
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,090
to make him donate more.

970
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,280
If circumstances allow,

971
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,950
I am willing to make every effort

972
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,590
to bring all cultural relics back home.

973
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,030
Great!

974
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,160
Now, let's officially begin
the donation ceremony.

975
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,630
I think,

976
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,880
Mu Jianhui must be kicking himself now.

977
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,190
Why?

978
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,760
It was supposed to be a chance
to show off cheaply,

979
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,510
but he ran into you.

980
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,960
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

981
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,550
I was thinking

982
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,510
we could just grit our teeth
and accept the official seal.

983
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,840
Who knew that guy would have
to provoke me?

984
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,070
Anyway, isn't it enough that
we got the official seal?

985
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,010
Perfect, everyone's here.

986
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,270
Director.

987
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,070
What are you discussing here

988
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,400
that makes you so happy?

989
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,110
Director.

990
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Do you have any instructions for us?

991
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,880
Seeing how happy you all look,

992
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,070
I almost don't have the heart to say it.

993
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,730
It's always when you're happy

994
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,530
that I have to be the bearer of bad news.

995
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,960
What do you mean?

996
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,840
Don't tell me the excavation plan
is going to be interrupted again.

997
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,040
It's not that sudden,

998
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,290
but it's directly related to that.

999
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,440
You all know

1000
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,300
about the landfill issue.

1001
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,670
The city is in a hurry to make plans.

1002
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,920
Then,

1003
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,360
we've been negotiating this matter
for the past few days.

1004
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,890
Finally,

1005
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,990
we've reluctantly agreed on a condition.

1006
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,560
What condition?

1007
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,990
They're giving us three months.

1008
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,550
Within these three months,

1009
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,510
we must find direct evidence to prove

1010
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,190
that the grand tomb in Yin Village
is the Zi Mausoleum.

1011
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,030
Three months? You're joking.

1012
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,920
To find it within this timeframe?

1013
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,550
We don't even have

1014
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,920
a single clue about direct evidence yet.

1015
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,480
I'm in this field too.

1016
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,710
I understand the difficulty.

1017
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,840
But everyone has their own challenges.

1018
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,000
Everyone has their own troubles.

1019
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,550
Now,

1020
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,320
the speed at which cities generate garbage

1021
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,280
is too fast.

1022
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,510
Mountains of garbage
are generated every day.

1023
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,960
Where do you expect them to pile it up?

1024
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,550
Yeah.

1025
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,590
But it can't be placed in a place

1026
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,400
that might be an emperor mausoleum, right?

1027
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,630
They can't pile it up here either.

1028
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,280
That's right.

1029
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,880
Exactly.

1030
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,040
That's why I said

1031
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,110
everyone has their own difficulties.

1032
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,630
Look,

1033
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
our people

1034
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,840
and the district leaders

1035
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
have been running to the city every day.

1036
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,480
Finally,

1037
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,090
they've negotiated this result.

1038
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,360
I'm passing this pressure

1039
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,480
onto you now.

1040
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,690
You must do it

1041
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
within three months.

1042
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,520
If we can't find evidence in three months,

1043
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,880
this place will become a landfill.

1044
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,000
What counts as direct evidence?

1045
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,590
For example, textual evidence.

1046
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,510
If we could find texts

1047
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,760
related to Emperor Taizong of Han
in the pit,

1048
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,480
that would be direct evidence.

1049
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,070
Didn't they donate an official seal?

1050
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,670
Are there any characters on that seal?

1051
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,530
Yes, there are.

1052
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,030
"Music Bureau Director's Seal,"

1053
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,150
just as Fang Kun wrote.

1054
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:05,950
Nothing else.

1055
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,330
This can't be considered direct evidence.

1056
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,940
Without direct evidence,

1057
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,640
should we look for other evidence?

1058
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,390
What other evidence?

1059
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,980
The structure, for instance.

1060
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,960
Hasn't that been confirmed already?

1061
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,880
We've already discovered

1062
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,800
that it's a large Y-shaped grand tomb.

1063
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,600
But we haven't found
its outer enclosure wall yet.

1064
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,320
If we could find
the outer enclosure wall,

1065
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,320
which can prove that
the Y-shaped tomb and the Dou Mausoleum

1066
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,650
are enclosed together,

1067
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,280
we can basically prove

1068
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,030
that this Y-shaped tomb
is Emperor Taizong of Han's tomb.

1069
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,550
So this outer enclosure wall is crucial,
isn't it?

1070
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,710
Then let's hurry
and find the outer enclosure wall.

1071
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,840
I think this plan

1072
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,550
still carries significant risks.

1073
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,080
We can't deduce backwards.

1074
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,030
Emperor Taizong of Han's Zi Mausoleum

1075
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,800
is in a transitional stage

1076
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,110
of the Western Han
Imperial Mausoleums' development.

1077
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,100
The Chang Mausoleum
of Emperor Gaozu of Han

1078
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,230
only has one large mausoleum complex

1079
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,560
enclosing the emperor and empress tombs.

1080
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,400
After the Yang Mausoleum,

1081
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,710
besides the large mausoleum complex,

1082
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,760
the emperor and empress tombs
have their own small mausoleum complexes.

1083
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
So from then on,

1084
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,190
"Same Cemetery, Different Tombs"

1085
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,150
has become a more mature pattern.

1086
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,030
Emperor Taizong of Han

1087
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,590
was right in this transitional period
of structural development.

1088
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,440
Emperor Taizong of Han

1089
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,570
was also very frugal

1090
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,070
and advocated for modest burials.

1091
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,760
So the exact structure
of this mausoleum complex

1092
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,480
and whether it has

1093
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,590
a rammed earth outer enclosure wall
around it

1094
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,190
can't be further confirmed.

1095
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,230
You're spot on.

1096
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,230
But we have no other choice now,

1097
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,070
right?

1098
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,440
Since we can't find this

1099
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,020
written evidence,

1100
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,960
we have to keep looking for another way.

1101
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,230
We'll keep searching for written evidence

1102
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,960
while exploring another path,

1103
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,470
right?

1104
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,010
I agree with what Mr. Fang said.

1105
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,150
We're stuck in a dead end, after all.

1106
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,750
There's always another way.

1107
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,760
What's going on?

1108
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,440
Why did the power go out?

1109
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,280
The power's out.

1110
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,670
Why did the power suddenly go out?
