[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,820
[Episode 8]

3
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,270
Why didn't you listen to me?

4
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,200
Guang, you scared me.

5
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,390
I woke up early.

6
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,170
So I thought
I could help you with something.

7
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,030
By the way.

8
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,310
Guang.

9
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,430
Here's the deposit
you left at the front desk.

10
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,160
I spent a bit buying groceries.

11
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,190
You've already checked out of the room.

12
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,450
So where will you stay?

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,910
I asked around.

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,750
The hostel charges 80 yuan a night.

15
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,700
Too expensive.

16
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,510
I noticed you have
a spare kitchen in your yard.

17
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,050
I've already cleaned it up.

18
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,660
If you don't mind,

19
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,079
I can sleep there.

20
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,470
Guang.

21
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
Take this 5,000 yuan for now.

22
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,020
You can either go back to study

23
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,950
or stay in Qinchuan to find a job.

24
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,040
It's up to you.

25
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,310
Guang.

26
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,430
Did I do something wrong?

27
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,000
No.

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,560
The work here will get your clothes dirty.
It's not suitable for you.

29
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,310
Besides, it's not proper
for a man and woman to be alone.

30
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,240
If word gets back to our hometown,
it won't be good for you.

31
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,970
I don't care.

32
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,430
And I'm not afraid of getting dirty.

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,280
Guang.

34
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,910
I beg you.

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,310
If you kick me out,

36
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,750
I'll have nowhere to go.

37
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,079
Stop talking nonsense.

38
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Where there's money, there's a way.

39
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,120
If you run out of money, come back to me.

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,710
Guang.

41
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll tell you the truth.

42
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,410
I was sold by
Wang Huifang from our village

43
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,590
to a salon at the train station.

44
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,820
I thought I was going to
learn hairdressing,

45
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,840
but it turned out

46
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,500
to be that kind of dirty place.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I did everything I could to run away.

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
They're definitely
looking for me.

49
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,040
I can't stay in Qinchuan alone.

50
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,690
Don't cry.

51
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,790
So,

52
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,400
hurry back to your hometown.

53
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,130
The days after going back home,

54
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,820
I can see what's ahead.

55
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,230
Work at the shoe factory,

56
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,010
pay for my brother's education

57
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,090
and marry anyone.

58
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,040
That's how people

59
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,870
in the village have lived for generations.

60
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,580
I'm not willing to live like that.

61
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,560
What's there to be unwilling about?

62
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,690
You've already come out, haven't you?

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,240
I can do any job.

64
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,250
I can learn what I don't know how to do.

65
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,070
I promise I'll listen to you.

66
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,920
Why do you have to stick with me?

67
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,310
Because you're a good person.

68
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,560
I'm not a good person.

69
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,270
Back in the village, you treated me well.

70
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,760
If you're not a good person,
then who is a good person?

71
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,970
You just said

72
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,990
you'll listen to whatever I say.

73
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,430
Then take this money

74
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,950
and find a job in Qinchuan.

75
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,320
Once you've found one, move there quickly.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,600
The hostel's too expensive.

77
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,190
I'll sleep in the kitchen...

78
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,990
You just said you'd listen to me.

79
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,240
Also,

80
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,250
don't come to this place

81
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,400
when you have nothing to do.

82
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,560
Why?

83
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,160
What?

84
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,190
Because

85
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,480
I

86
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,230
like peace and quiet now.

87
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Since when did you like being alone?

88
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,750
W-Why do you have so many questions?

89
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,000
The food's getting cold.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,260
I'll warm it up for you.

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,120
Tang!

92
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,680
Tang!

93
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,270
Captain Yang's here.

94
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,430
Where's the director?

95
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,890
He didn't sleep last night.
He's exhausted.

96
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,110
He went to take a nap.

97
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,600
As soon as I heard that voice,
I knew it was you.

98
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,480
What's up? Does anything happen?

99
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,540
You're exhausted.

100
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,000
I was just about to ask you something.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,870
There's been nothing
going on recently, right?

102
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,870
I would have told you if there was.

103
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,290
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

104
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,720
It's just that

105
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,870
I'm exhausted.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm worn out.

107
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,400
Thank you for your hard work.

108
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,190
Captain Yang.

109
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,480
The motorcycle you applied for me.

110
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,630
It has broken down 3 times in 6 months.

111
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,430
Captain Yang.

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Please apply for
another one for our station.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,720
There are 4 of us at the station,

114
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,870
but we only have 1 motorcycle.

115
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,930
That's not enough.

116
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,160
Every time I come to your station,
I get nervous.

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,240
First, it was a bicycle,
now it's a motorcycle.

118
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,720
After getting equipment,
you want more staff.

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,870
Even if my reputation isn't worth much,

120
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,390
I can't keep begging

121
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,750
the leaders every day.

122
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,159
But it's all for public business,
isn't it?

123
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,220
So you know it's for public business.

124
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,340
Then why did you run away

125
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,370
when Yan Shoucun called you over?

126
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,090
What? He complained about me.

127
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,720
Of course.

128
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,000
Listen to me.

129
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,870
He rushed us over there,

130
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,159
saying the dog barked
and there were tomb raiders.

131
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,159
When we got there,

132
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,670
he knew nothing about it.

133
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,250
So you didn't check around?

134
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,000
That's a false report.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,270
I can't indulge him.

136
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,000
He is stubborn.

137
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,630
I think

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,160
he should quit being
a cultural relic protection volunteer.

139
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,760
You think being a cultural relic
protection volunteer is good?

140
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,820
The yearly allowance is
only a few hundred.

141
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,150
Why should he
be guarding it day and night?

142
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,410
Ever since Professor Zan
had that incident,

143
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,200
Yan Shoucun has been living in the fields,

144
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,650
just him and his dog, for all these years.

145
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,190
Captain Yang,

146
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,370
I know that he's righteous.

147
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,480
But I have my own difficulties.

148
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,850
We're already short-staffed.

149
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,840
Yin Village is far from
the cultural protection area.

150
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
I have to patrol a huge area

151
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,510
just for him.

152
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,200
You see, you can't solve

153
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,920
the staffing issue.

154
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,600
For cultural relic protection volunteers,

155
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,460
can you help us recruit a few more?

156
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,240
Got it.

157
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,630
Okay.

158
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,450
Captain Qi. Shilin.

159
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,390
Why are you carrying luggage to a wedding?

160
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,480
Work's done for now.

161
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,150
I want to take a break.

162
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,480
Ms. Luo, let me help you.

163
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
It's fine. Hello.

164
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
Why haven't you left?

165
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,350
I haven't. I was waiting for you.

166
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,870
Waiting for me?

167
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,840
I need to talk to you.

168
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,500
Then say it.

169
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,880
I can't.

170
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,170
It's a private matter.

171
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,200
I can only tell you.

172
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,530
It's fine, you two talk.

173
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,520
Talk later.

174
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,630
We're going to the wedding.

175
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,890
You should go back now.

176
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,200
But...

177
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,050
Captain Qi.

178
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,110
How's Yin Village?

179
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,060
I heard there were
a few more groups of tomb raiders.

180
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,360
Yes.

181
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,800
Some were caught,

182
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,670
but some are still at large.

183
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,510
What's under Yin Village?

184
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,600
We've discussed it.

185
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,290
Director Zhang thought

186
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,750
we should check the area
around Yin Village,

187
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,330
to see if there are any relics.

188
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,990
And asked me to take some time
for a field survey.

189
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,750
But, I'm so busy

190
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,290
every day.

191
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,390
I don't even have time
to visit Yin Village.

192
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,030
Yes, I know you're really busy.

193
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
I heard that in your institute,

194
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,200
a worker's family follows her husband

195
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,840
around every day to get pregnant.

196
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,630
Wherever her husband goes, she goes.

197
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,270
Who is it?

198
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,200
Who knows?

199
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,440
Wait, wait.

200
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,120
Captain Qi.

201
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,030
You still have a lot to do at the station,

202
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,160
but you keep gossiping and teasing me.

203
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm too busy.

204
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Why hasn't she gotten pregnant yet?

205
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,060
You...

206
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,930
Never mind.

207
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,120
I'll handle the Yin Village matter
for you.

208
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,450
I'm on vacation anyway.

209
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,690
Uncle.

210
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,250
It's so lively.

211
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,320
It's really lively.

212
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,520
Dacang, you're here.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,730
Eat peanuts.

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,320
Thank you, thank you.

215
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,530
Uncle Youliang.

216
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,780
A grandson
has made him really proud.

217
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,600
Look at this big 100-day banquet.

218
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
It must cost a lot.

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
It's not easy

220
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,480
to change people's minds around here.

221
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,280
Exactly.

222
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,000
It's even grander than your wedding.

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,870
That's for sure.

224
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,270
Hello.

225
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,190
Hello.

226
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,690
Good, this is fine.

227
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,550
Who's playing this?

228
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,480
It sounds awful.

229
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,960
Probably my brother-in-law.

230
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,820
It's terrible.

231
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,400
Dacang, you're back.

232
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,440
Aunt.

233
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,720
So much food.

234
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,720
It's all food.

235
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,270
Uncle.

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,690
Dacang's here.

237
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:46,480
You take care of him.

238
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,340
Grandpa. Aunt.

239
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,450
I was wondering
who was playing that horrible sound.

240
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,800
You're still alive?

241
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,250
Fang Kun.

242
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,150
You idiot, why didn't
you tell me you were back?

243
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,610
Are you trying to do magic?

244
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,750
Ms. Luo.

245
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,440
Long time no see.

246
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,430
Why so formal?

247
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,470
We've worked together for so long,
don't we get a hug?

248
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,970
Since when did you pick up this habit?

249
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,420
I can't eat anymore.

250
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,600
You've changed.

251
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,060
How have I changed?

252
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,740
You've gotten thinner

253
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,690
and tanner.

254
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,980
Seems like you've gotten a little older.

255
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,630
You're the one getting older.

256
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,980
Don't you dare to say that again.

257
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,960
You're the one getting older.

258
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,620
Captain Qi.

259
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,750
Do these two look like fighting chickens?

260
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,000
They start pecking each other
as soon as they meet.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,550
Grandpa.

262
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,260
Do you remember me?

263
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,720
Of course.

264
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,240
Even though I may have
poor eyesight and hearing,

265
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,080
my mind is still sharp.

266
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,910
Since our village discovered
the black pottery figurine,

267
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,770
you three have been staying here.

268
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,350
Always either

269
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,550
looking for old photos
or searching for looting pits.

270
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,250
If Zan knew you three
had become successful,

271
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,670
he'd be very proud.

272
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,890
Alright.

273
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
How many people have arrived?

274
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,840
Chief Qi, everyone
from the village is here.

275
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,900
Alright, alright.

276
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,970
See the baby.

277
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,390
So cute.

278
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,270
Sit down. The banquet will start soon.

279
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,930
The banquet is about to start.

280
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,520
Here.

281
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,870
Take a look at my grandson.

282
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,630
Is everyone here?

283
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,790
Yes, everyone's here.

284
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,290
Is everyone here?

285
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,890
Let's get ready to start the banquet...

286
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,490
How can you start without me?

287
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,140
You think I won't start the banquet

288
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
without you?

289
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,510
You're still bringing the dog?

290
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,630
Hurry up, find a seat.

291
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,790
Come on, hurry up.

292
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,990
Kun, why're you back?

293
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,870
Just got here.

294
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,200
Move your dog away.

295
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,790
Don't let it hurt my baby.

296
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,080
I'll sit here, I'll sit here.

297
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,960
Thank you, thank you.

298
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,760
Thank you, everyone, for coming

299
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,080
to my grandson's 100-day banquet.

300
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,960
I've prepared eight cold
and eight hot dishes.

301
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,070
Let's begin the banquet.

302
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,510
Come on, come on, Uncle Shoucun.

303
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,440
Come on, come on.

304
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,020
Eat more, eat more.

305
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,460
Aunt, enjoy your meal.

306
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,320
Eat more, eat more.

307
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,650
You eat, Uncle, you eat.

308
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,140
Delicious, it's very delicious.

309
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,570
You are so thin.

310
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,410
And you haven't cut your hair.

311
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,630
Look at your lips.

312
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,020
Eat more meat and get some nutrition.

313
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,530
I heard that

314
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,070
Xiaoxue has given birth.

315
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,060
Is it okay for you to come back now?

316
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,790
Bai and the others
are taking care of her over there.

317
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,390
It's fine.

318
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,350
What do you want to eat?

319
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,250
Heizui's grown so big.

320
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,080
It's been years since I've seen him.

321
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,200
I remember Captain Luo
used to be afraid of dogs.

322
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,800
Now you are crazy about them.

323
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,870
People change.

324
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,210
Now the dogs are afraid of her.

325
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,750
Captain Luo is decisive and authoritative

326
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,030
at the construction site.

327
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,310
Right, Heizui.

328
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,240
In my memory,

329
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,360
Captain Luo wasn't exactly gentle.

330
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
But now, she is forceful in her actions

331
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
and sharp with her words.

332
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,790
I wasn't gentle?

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,260
That's how you felt it.

334
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,560
Because I only treated you like that.

335
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,460
Alright.

336
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,270
Come, come.

337
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,790
Dacang.

338
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,130
Don't rush off.

339
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,670
These past few nights,

340
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,270
Heizui's been barking a lot.

341
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,360
The tomb raiders have been showing up
on the site every other day.

342
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,150
Even more often than the people from
Cultural Relics Management Office.

343
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,250
Are you going to do
something about it or not?

344
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,180
Of course I will.

345
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,830
It's the peak season for tomb raiding.

346
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,030
I know.

347
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,430
Well, Uncle.

348
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,930
Keep an eye out for me.

349
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,840
Let me know immediately
if anything happens.

350
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,750
One more thing.

351
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,600
We need more

352
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,260
cultural relic protection volunteers.

353
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,720
Uncle Shoucun can't handle it all
on his own.

354
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,520
Uncle Youliang.

355
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,190
By the way,

356
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,700
I need to keep doing field survey
in Yin Village for a few more days.

357
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,710
Can I stay at your place a bit longer?

358
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,790
Would that be okay?

359
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,589
Same as before.

360
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,250
I'll pay for food and lodging.

361
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,130
What are you surveying for?

362
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,530
Uncle.

363
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,430
You know how our village
keeps attracting tomb raiders.

364
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,579
Our director

365
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,740
wanted us to go over the whole village

366
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,859
to see what exactly is there.

367
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,790
I've got something else going on.

368
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,790
So Luo Qing will do the visits for me.

369
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,260
What will you do after the survey is done?

370
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,869
If there's a high preservation value

371
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,069
or serious damage,

372
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,420
I can apply for

373
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,300
more relics protection funding.

374
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,420
Alright, I support that.

375
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,510
What are you doing?

376
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,660
Be careful not to fall.

377
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,720
Last year during spring irrigation,

378
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,970
a few families found

379
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,980
their land wasn't absorbing water.

380
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,940
Turned out the place

381
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,670
was riddled with looting pits.

382
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,470
Those fools have ruined our land

383
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,030
by digging up graves.

384
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,800
Here's the thing.

385
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,460
There are two empty rooms at home.

386
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,760
I'll have your aunt clean them up.

387
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,820
You can stay there.

388
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,310
Great, thanks. Uncle.

389
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,710
Then I won't see you off.

390
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,260
You can head back.

391
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,240
Yeah, go back.

392
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,870
Bye, Uncle.

393
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,480
Take care.

394
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,300
We're leaving, Uncle.

395
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,810
We're leaving.

396
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,630
Congratulations, congratulations.

397
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,900
Dacang, you'll handle it.

398
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,530
I'll take care of it.

399
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:04,930
Hello?

400
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,800
What happened?

401
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,270
On my way.

402
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Look, there's another looting pit.

403
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,210
You're totally drunk.

404
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,450
Professor Guo, come with me.

405
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,160
No problem.

406
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,290
The situation is urgent.
I can't take care of you two.

407
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:21,820
Alright.

408
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,960
Right. Kun, see Luo Qing off.

409
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,460
Give me my suitcase.

410
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:25,920
Okay.

411
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,670
Alright.

412
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,470
Be careful.

413
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,330
He drank too much.

414
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,200
Slow down.

415
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,520
You just hanging out here?

416
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,090
Where are you going?

417
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,860
None of your business.

418
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,870
Where are you staying?

419
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,460
Not telling you.

420
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,710
If you don't tell me,
how can I take you home?

421
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,070
So don't bother.

422
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,130
Got someone at home
you don't want me to see?

423
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,640
What's wrong with you?

424
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,000
I heard Hou Yuelai still hasn't

425
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,750
given up on you all these years.

426
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:20,760
You two…

427
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,470
Didn't spark anything?

428
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,780
You must've been in the desert too long.

429
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
You've become so gossiping.

430
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,480
Just caring about an old friend.

431
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,110
You stayed in Qinchuan back then,

432
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,500
because of Hou Yuelai, didn't you?

433
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,550
It was for you.

434
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,170
What, scared?

435
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,750
You serious?

436
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,730
What do you think? Nutcase.

437
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,720
If it really was for me,

438
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,250
I might have to go cry it out.

439
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,960
Cry?

440
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,050
Go ahead, cry for me right now.

441
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,600
Alright, so where
are you actually staying?

442
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,860
At the Ms. Zan's house.

443
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,280
Okay. Then tell her

444
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,210
I'll drop by sometime
to visit her and Mr. Zan.

445
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,230
[Fengjiapo Village]

446
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,040
What happened?

447
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,990
You're here.

448
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,790
Captain Yang.

449
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,810
During a routine patrol,
the cultural relic conservator

450
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,940
discovered a large empty area.

451
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,430
It was very strange.

452
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,350
So they took a closer look.

453
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,490
The surface was covered
with a layer of fresh dirt.

454
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,560
When he dug down,
it turned out to be a looting pit.

455
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,090
I'll go down and take a look.

456
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
It's clearly new.

457
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,070
Alright.

458
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,350
Careful.

459
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,380
– Pull.
– Slow down.

460
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,970
Come up.

461
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,680
Easy, easy.

462
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,460
Okay.

463
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,640
How is it?

464
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,950
It appears to be a tomb
from the Sui and Tang dynasties.

465
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,590
Already completely emptied.

466
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,980
I'll report it to the bureau right away.

467
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,530
See if we can do a salvage excavation.

468
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,240
Thanks.

469
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,790
Go quick.

470
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Look here.

471
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,310
This dirt looks freshly dug.

472
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,690
Yeah.

473
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,680
You can tell it's all new.

474
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,490
Captain Qi.

475
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,240
This spot is really close to the village.

476
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,580
Someone might have heard the explosion.

477
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,270
I think we should gather the villagers
and ask around in a meeting.

478
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,940
What do you think?

479
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,750
Yeah, good idea.

480
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,790
Everyone.

481
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,680
Please come to the village square.

482
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,790
Everyone, come to
the village square for a meeting.

483
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,550
Be quiet, folks.

484
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,340
Listen to the folks from
the Cultural Heritage Bureau.

485
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,440
Everyone,

486
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,720
has anyone heard
any strange noises recently?

487
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,720
Like an explosion.

488
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,160
Similar to the sound of gunfire.

489
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,590
Whose home is closest to the south side?

490
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,590
Uncle.

491
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,590
Isn't your place nearby?

492
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,300
Yeah.

493
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,270
Bro.

494
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,310
His place is pretty close.

495
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,830
Did you hear anything?

496
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,420
Didn't hear anything.

497
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,440
Exactly.

498
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,880
Bro.

499
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,740
Nothing at all.

500
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,400
What time do you usually
sleep and wake up?

501
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,230
I go to bed around eight or nine at night.

502
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,540
Get up around five or six in the morning.

503
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,270
Seen any strangers?

504
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,240
No.

505
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,800
You didn't even think about it.

506
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,920
Let me ask you.

507
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,880
Within the past two weeks...

508
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,830
Nope.

509
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,370
Haven't seen anyone.

510
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,260
You're all so quick to answer now.

511
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,350
I haven't even finished asking.

512
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,810
You have an answer
without even thinking about it.

513
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,870
I really haven't seen any strangers.

514
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,000
Hello?

515
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,240
Anyone home?

516
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,090
Why are you all here?

517
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,030
Can we come in for some water?

518
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,680
Of course, come on in.

519
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,920
Come in, have a seat.

520
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,870
Come inside, come in.

521
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,810
Sister-in-law.

522
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,310
What a coincidence.

523
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,590
Why are you just standing there?

524
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,520
Pour some water.

525
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,590
Let me do it.

526
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,590
Have a seat.

527
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,400
Your courtyard here

528
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,160
is quite far from
other villagers, isn't it?

529
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,720
This is an old house.

530
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,000
I never moved.

531
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,270
Here, have some water.

532
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:12,930
Don't be polite.

533
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,830
No, thanks, I'm good.

534
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,510
No, really. Thanks.

535
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,110
Thank you.

536
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,340
Sit down.

537
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,070
Honestly.

538
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,270
You know.

539
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,500
They said your place
is kind of close to that looting pit.

540
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,550
I didn't think it'd be this close.

541
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,350
And only your family is here.

542
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,890
No one else could've heard anything.

543
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,160
Forget explosions,

544
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,640
even if tomb raiders were whispering,

545
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,550
you'd probably hear it clear.

546
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,680
Right?

547
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,640
I can't even think of an excuse for you.

548
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,210
You don't even know how to lie.

549
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,160
With the location of  your house,

550
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,030
how could you not hear it?

551
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,350
What? Are you one of the tomb raiders?

552
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
No, no, no, no way.

553
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
I'm an honest person.

554
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,650
Never done anything illegal.

555
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,410
That's true.

556
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,030
Sister-in-law, listen.

557
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,440
Don't be nervous.

558
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,640
Just tell the truth.

559
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,830
We've already figured it out.

560
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,290
We know everything.

561
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
If you ask me,

562
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,980
it's not that serious.

563
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,060
But look at your husband's attitude.

564
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
If you knew something
and didn't report it,

565
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,790
then it'll become very serious.

566
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,030
I'll tell you.

567
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,760
Did you hear anything?

568
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,280
Yeah, sounded like a gunshot.

569
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,870
Sleep, sleep, sleep, whatever.

570
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,680
Who's that?

571
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,240
I'll go check it out.

572
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,100
But who's gonna refuse it?

573
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,110
I know it's dirty money.

574
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,440
We don't dare to spend it.

575
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,170
You don't dare to spend it,
but you dare to take it?

576
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,250
Ding Yan.

577
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,830
Check with the Chief

578
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,620
and ask if there are any nearby cameras.

579
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,150
Alright.

580
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,840
When did this happen?

581
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,680
A few nights ago.

582
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,920
Did you see the person clearly?

583
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,260
I went outside.

584
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,530
But they were already gone.

585
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,100
If anything else happens,

586
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,920
call me.

587
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,260
Call me right away.

588
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,480
Officer.

589
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,270
Do you think
they'll come back for revenge?

590
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,480
What's there to be afraid of?

591
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,030
I'm from the Cultural Heritage Bureau.

592
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,650
This is from the Public Security Bureau.

593
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,720
We're here to protect you.

594
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,380
Don't talk to outsiders about

595
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,240
everything that happened today.

596
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,310
If it affects the investigation,

597
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,110
you'll be legally responsible.

598
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,530
I won't say anything.

599
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,680
If anything happens, call right away.

600
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,970
Don't be scared.

601
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,450
Okay.

602
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,980
Take care.

603
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,700
Take care.

604
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,060
[Qinchuan Relics Inspection Team]

605
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,790
[Qinchuan Municipal
Cultural Heritage Bureau]

606
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,020
We asked the traffic police

607
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,290
to help us check.

608
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,190
The nearest camera to the village

609
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,810
is on the provincial road.

610
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,730
It's a high-traffic area.

611
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,060
Most of them are vans
without license plates.

612
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,360
So there's really no way to trace it.

613
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,750
At the time,

614
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,000
if someone had reported it,
we would've caught them red-handed.

615
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,970
But,

616
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,960
honestly.

617
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,860
The problem is
our inspection frequency is too low.

618
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,810
And the villagers' awareness
of heritage protection is weak.

619
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,960
Captain Qi.

620
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,610
Are you saying
we didn't do our job properly?

621
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,790
I'm not the type

622
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,720
to say sweet things.

623
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,130
That's exactly what I mean.

624
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,350
We're not even doing the basics enough.

625
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,590
Not doing enough?

626
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,240
We've been working all year

627
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,660
without taking any time off.

628
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,720
Ask everyone here.

629
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,490
Who's had a day off on a Sunday?

630
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,240
I didn't even go back
when my wife gave birth last year.

631
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,610
Daytime's for fieldwork.

632
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,980
Nighttime's for patrols.

633
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,310
How many of us
have gotten a full night's sleep?

634
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,870
Here's the thing, Captain Qi.

635
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,980
It's just a few of us

636
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,570
in this Inspection Team.

637
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,760
There are hundreds of

638
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,970
heritage protection units.

639
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,320
If we didn't eat or drink all year,

640
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,300
we still couldn't finish it all.

641
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,760
Are you done complaining?

642
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,210
What's there to complain about?

643
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,900
Now that the tomb was looted.

644
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,220
What does that mean?

645
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:00,490
It shows that we haven't
done our job properly.

646
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,890
Heritage protection
is all about prevention.

647
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,700
How do we prevent it?

648
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,810
Mobilize the masses.

649
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,240
Mobilizing the masses
to protect is the only way

650
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,640
to stop the tomb raiders.

651
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,640
I've been applying to
the higher-ups for years

652
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,420
to strengthen
the cultural relic conservator program

653
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,930
and to increase
the intensity and scope of publicity.

654
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,420
I know it's not something
that happens overnight.

655
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,000
But,

656
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,160
that's not an excuse

657
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,400
for not doing your job properly.

658
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,110
Captain Qi.

659
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,700
I have a request.

660
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,320
You know we're
an administrative law enforcement agency.

661
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,400
We can't really deter tomb raiders.

662
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,660
Next time,

663
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,140
could we take a joint law enforcement?

664
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,940
That's a great idea.

665
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,160
I've been thinking about it too.

666
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,670
Our two departments

667
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,640
have always worked together.

668
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,160
But this requires an official application.

669
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,080
Alright.

670
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,820
One more thing,

671
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,330
I need your help with

672
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,330
some publicity work

673
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,770
to promote the cultural relic
protection volunteer program.

674
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,830
Our first stop will be in Yin Village.

675
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,950
Protect cultural relics.

676
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,670
Guard our beautiful home.

677
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,320
Protect cultural relics.

678
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,380
It starts with me.

679
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,680
Start from childhood.

680
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,750
Fellow villagers.

681
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,190
Protect cultural relics.

682
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,820
Guard our beautiful home.

683
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,410
Thousand-year-old cultural relics

684
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,010
are profound and extensive.

685
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,280
Loved by future generations.

686
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,500
Passed down through generations.

687
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,830
Knock.

688
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,040
What?

689
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,140
Scared?

690
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,200
We're already here.

691
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,120
Oh, it's you two.

692
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,470
Ms. Zan.

693
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,710
Why didn't you call us in advance?

694
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,400
We didn't want to disturb you.

695
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,380
It's early.

696
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,320
Am I Acalanatha?

697
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,350
Come on in.

698
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,040
You're here.

699
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,430
Don't bother changing shoes.

700
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,430
No need to change.

701
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,630
You brought so much.

702
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,360
Give it to me.

703
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,200
Come in.

704
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,840
Fang Kun.

705
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,050
What are your plans

706
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,980
now that you're back?

707
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,050
Take a break.

708
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,040
So, you're

709
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,560
going back?

710
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,390
You got to

711
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,510
let the past be past.

712
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,550
All these years,

713
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,160
you shut yourself up in Yusai,
refusing to come back.

714
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,150
I understand

715
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,840
you.

716
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,030
If I hadn't gone back

717
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
to the village to
call people that night...

718
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,910
If I had caught
the tomb raiders with Mr. Zan...

719
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,670
This isn't your fault.

720
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,880
Let it go.

721
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,790
It's time to let it go.

722
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,630
Ms. Zan.

723
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,900
I've got something I need your help with.

724
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,270
Mr. Zan did some exploration
on the plain before.

725
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,750
I'd like to borrow his work notes.

726
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,239
Alright.

727
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,350
I'll get them for you.

728
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,080
Why do you need his notes?

729
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,140
I'm planning to do a field survey
on the plain.

730
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
It hasn't changed at all, has it?

731
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,710
What changes could there be?

732
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,320
The people haven't changed.

733
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,220
How haven't they changed?

734
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,080
Some people just walk faster now.

735
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,920
Wait.

736
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,800
Fang Kun's back.

737
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
Let's talk it over first.

738
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,530
Who's leading the field survey this time?

739
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,030
Me.

740
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,990
Why you?

741
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,920
Some people have no sense of
organization or discipline.

742
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,990
He might just mess things up

743
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,220
and leave me to clean up.

744
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,990
So from now on,

745
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,230
all instructions will come from me.

746
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,200
Why are you still seeing people
with the same old perspective?

747
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,210
I've been gone for a few years,
and you think I haven't changed at all?

748
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,950
Who was it then?

749
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,950
Ran off, leaving the whole team behind.

750
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,470
Went deep into the desert.

751
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,480
What do you mean?

752
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,690
You're asking Bai about me?

753
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,140
You can't forget me, huh?

754
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,070
You really haven't changed at all.

755
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,280
Stop arguing, stop arguing.

756
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,610
-Listen to me.
-Ms. Luo.

757
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,390
-This field survey.
-Ms. Luo.

758
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,910
We will follow Luo Qing’s instructions.

759
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,720
Ms. Luo.

760
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,950
Hello, hello.

761
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,550
Bai, what are you doing here?

762
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,910
Mr. Jiang told me you're here.

763
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,640
So I came over.

764
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Can I join you?

765
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,840
W-we're not here for fun or vacation.

766
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,900
We're here to work.

767
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,320
I know,

768
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,950
I've done my homework on

769
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,430
Yin Village, Dou Mausoleum,
South Mausoleum and Zi Mausoleum.

770
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,500
I've read the county records and maps.

771
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:07,900
Look.

772
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,200
Bai, your internship is over.

773
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,640
This is my personal route now.

774
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,390
I understand.

775
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,200
But I really want to be with you.

776
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,300
I've loved Chinese culture
since I was little,

777
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,070
interning with you

778
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,070
just made me more certain to do this.

779
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,050
Please, can you

780
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,430
give me a chance to learn?

781
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,760
Sure, no problem.

782
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,240
Really? Thanks, bro!

783
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,950
No need to thank me.

784
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,880
Just call me Bai.

785
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,360
I'm Fang Kun.

786
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,160
Alright, Kun.

787
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,800
Fang.

788
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,880
-Uncle.
-Uncle.

789
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,010
Why are you here too?

790
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,640
Hello.

791
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,480
Why are there more people?

792
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,080
We'll need to rearrange
the accommodations.

793
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,620
Charge whatever is needed.

794
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,160
Well...

795
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,070
Come, come, come.

796
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,030
Come in, come in.

797
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,880
What's going on?

798
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,380
You're usually so sharp.

799
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,620
Why can't you

800
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,840
figure this out?

801
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,950
What?

802
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,280
What?

803
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,570
You really think Bai's here
for an internship?

804
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,550
So?

805
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,640
Well.

806
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,300
Y-You're paving the way for him.

807
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,390
Chief.

808
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,660
Chief.

809
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,970
-What's wrong?
-Chief.

810
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,390
Hurry, go check
the foundation of the wellhouse.

811
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,680
They've dug something up.

812
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,110
What is it?

813
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,070
I don't know either.

814
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,070
You go take a look.

815
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,210
What kind of foundation is it?

816
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,540
There are a lot of cherry trees
being planted in the village now.

817
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,550
They drilled a well

818
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,640
for irrigation.

819
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,990
What is in the foundation?

820
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,390
I can't really say.

821
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,690
I just dug a bit but couldn't go further.

822
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,160
It felt like I hit something hard.

823
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,910
Hard?

824
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,700
What did you dig up?

825
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,300
Take a look.

826
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,030
What is this?

827
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,690
Just a few hard things.

828
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,320
It's nothing, it's nothing.

829
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,930
Keep digging.

830
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,070
Okay, everyone, keep digging.

831
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,200
Wait, wait a second.

832
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:17,990
What's up?

833
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,280
This looks like river pebbles.

834
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,070
How could there be river pebbles here?

835
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,320
What river pebbles?

836
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,840
It's fine, it's fine.

837
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,240
Keep going, keep going.

838
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,500
Wait, wait. Come here.

839
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,360
Guo.

840
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,140
Take a picture
and show it to Director Zhang.

841
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,180
Be careful.

842
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,620
What are you doing?

843
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,350
I'm checking the coordinates.

844
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,240
Give me that locator. Did you bring it?

845
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,810
Yes, yes, I brought it.

846
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,490
Here's the notebook.

847
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:58,830
Bai.

848
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,910
Didn't you do
a lot of work on this already?

849
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,780
Let me ask you.

850
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,450
Which river is closest to Yin Village?

851
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,950
The Zishui River.

852
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,320
It's about five kilometers away.

853
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,780
Are there river pebbles
in the Zishui River?

854
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,350
It doesn't seem to be
mentioned in the literature.

855
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,210
Okay, let me tell you.

856
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,280
Literature

857
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,840
is just a reference, not the whole truth.

858
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,090
We're in the downstream
of the Zishui River.

859
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,880
Downstream areas usually
have river pebbles.

860
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,210
It's common knowledge.

861
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,990
Got it?

862
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,620
Okay.

863
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,430
Chief.

864
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,550
Will we dig up some treasure?

865
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,160
Uncle.

866
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,950
Let's study this for a couple of days.

867
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,550
Can you stop the work for now?

868
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,360
We can't stop.

869
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,820
We've already invested
a lot of money into this.

870
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,760
We can't delay the work.

871
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,840
Those river pebbles don't matter.

872
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,320
There are all kinds of
strange things out here.

873
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,650
You're saying anything

874
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,540
that's dug up is a cultural relic?

875
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,270
Impossible.

876
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,570
Uncle, we wouldn't dare.

877
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,950
If you dig up some ruins down there,

878
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,690
and it gets destroyed.

879
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,490
The consequences could be huge.

880
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,680
Alright, alright, let's stop for two days,

881
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,880
But you have to figure this out quickly.

882
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,310
Okay, okay.

883
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,200
We can't delay the schedule.

884
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,430
Alright, alright,

885
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,360
Get this figured out fast.

886
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,530
[Beijing]

887
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,010
At a typical auction,

888
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,390
this is how

889
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,030
they display porcelain.

890
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,190
Small cabinets
with lights shining on them.

891
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,060
It looks beautiful.

892
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,550
It doesn't work
in our place.

893
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,550
In our small town,

894
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,030
we just stretch some wire,

895
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,310
put some clips on it,
and hang the paintings.

896
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,360
Different places, different methods.

897
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,490
This is the capital.

898
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,880
You really have to

899
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,070
come often to auctions.

900
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,990
Auctions all around the world
are pretty much the same.

901
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,990
That's right, they're all like this.

902
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,450
Look, it's just like this.

903
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,620
Let's sit over there, it's empty.

904
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,540
Sit.

905
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,290
Mr. Zhao.

906
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,070
You're here.

907
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,030
It's been so long
since we last saw each other.

908
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,090
Alright, alright.

909
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,470
This is...

910
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,720
Ladies and gentlemen.

911
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,590
Good morning.

912
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,470
Zhao Youlin.

913
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,990
This is our first item
for today's auction.

914
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,160
No. 7201.

915
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,640
A Famille Rose "Hundred Flowers" Cup

916
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,910
from the Qianlong Emperor period
of the Qing Dynasty.

917
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,150
The starting price is

918
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,930
30,000 yuan.

919
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,990
Anyone for 30,000?

920
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,590
30,000.

921
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,140
30,000.

922
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,720
I see No.872 wants it.

923
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,390
35,000.

924
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,200
No.868 makes it 35,000.

925
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,510
Anyone for 40,000?

926
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,550
Bid from the proxy bidder, 40,000.

927
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,550
45,900. Let's back in the hall.

928
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,510
Now No.900 mkaes it 45,000.

929
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:44,950
50,000.

930
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,280
No.892 makes it 50,000.
