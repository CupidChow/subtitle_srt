00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,000
[Li Yuanguang]

4
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,070
Sorry,

5
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,790
the number you have dialed
is currently out of service.

6
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,120
Please try again later.

7
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,960
Grandpa.

8
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,020
Come on.

9
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,390
You've been smoking
that tobacco all your life.

10
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,170
Have one of my cigarettes.

11
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,090
These cigarettes taste good.

12
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,930
Grandpa,

13
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
I've let you down.

14
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,590
I've disgraced our Qi family.

15
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Kun, there must be someone there.

16
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,210
Who is it?

17
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,160
Who's there?

18
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,080
Who?

19
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,230
What are you shouting about?

20
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,470
Youliang.

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,310
Why aren't you sleeping
in the middle of the night

22
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,710
but coming here instead?

23
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,240
Mind your own business.

24
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,450
You think you're in charge
just because of some authority?

25
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,130
It seems the act we put on
during the day worked.

26
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,760
What do you mean?

27
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,610
I guess we'll be adding new members
to our cultural preservation team.

28
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,440
Hello?

29
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,240
This is the Maternal
and Child Health Hospital.

30
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,040
Are you Wen Wen's family member?

31
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,120
Yes.

32
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,770
What's wrong with you?

33
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,450
How could you leave the mother alone
while she was giving birth?

34
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,750
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,670
I'll be there right away.

36
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,070
Lai.

37
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,950
Lai.

38
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:38,950
Lai.

39
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,310
Lai.

40
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,750
Who is it this time?

41
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,300
I'll go check.

42
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,430
Hello, Dad.

43
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,000
Lai.

44
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,310
Where are you?

45
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm in the field.

46
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,160
Which field?

47
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,070
I'm right here at your house.

48
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,130
Why can't I see you?

49
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,510
You went to the field?

50
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,770
You must be lying to me.

51
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,560
Dad, you need to leave quickly.

52
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,390
Don't stay in the field anymore.

53
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,190
Where are you?

54
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,310
You must have gone gambling again.

55
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,159
Dad, listen to me.

56
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:40,680
Don't stay in the field anymore.

57
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,720
-Come back quickly...
-You should go now.

58
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,159
Dad.

59
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,920
Dad.

60
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,360
Open your eyes wide.

61
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,630
If you let anyone else in,
I'll deal with you too.

62
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,480
Got it.

63
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,920
Who is it?

64
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,750
What's the situation?

65
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,190
What happened?

66
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,050
An old man came.

67
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,430
Seems like it's Lai's father.

68
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,430
I knocked him out.

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Let's continue; it's fine now.

70
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,400
It's fine now?

71
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,430
Get back to work.

72
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,510
Okay, let's go.

73
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,350
Hurry.

74
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,190
Uncle.

75
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,360
Washing once is enough.

76
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,780
Why do you wash every day?

77
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,980
Don't you know how precious water is?

78
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,580
Or you can wash with my water.

79
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,970
What do you mean?

80
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,630
Are you suggesting
I use your foot-washing water

81
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,490
to wash my face?

82
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,890
Wash wherever you want.

83
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,640
You...

84
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,360
Something's happened!

85
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,890
My dad might have been
killed by tomb raiders!

86
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,170
Captain Qi,

87
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,400
tomb raiders have come to Yin Village.

88
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,980
There are four or more of them.

89
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,510
Okay.

90
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,360
Okay.

91
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,360
-Okay.
-Come here!

92
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,030
Uncle Shoucun.

93
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,030
Quickly, go gather some people
from the village. As many as you can.

94
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,840
I'm not going.
I want to catch the tomb raiders.

95
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,360
Yan Shoucun.

96
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,390
If you don't go, I'll use a loudspeaker

97
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,990
to reveal everything
about you and Chunhua tomorrow.

98
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,390
Hurry up! Did you hear me?

99
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,280
Let's go!

100
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,669
You!

101
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,480
Be careful.

102
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,610
Lower it.

103
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,170
There's someone over there.

104
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,720
Get down.

105
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,410
Why is there only one person left?

106
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,330
They might be underground.

107
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,270
[Uncle Youliang is injured]

108
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,400
My dad is over there.

109
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,710
That's my dad.

110
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,960
Where are you going?

111
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,150
My dad was beaten to death
by him over there.

112
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,010
What can you do if you go there now?

113
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,270
Hei.

114
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,950
What's wrong?

115
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,630
Lift the goods up. What else?

116
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,550
Okay, coming.

117
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,320
Dad.

118
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,390
Dad.

119
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,440
Dad.

120
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,960
Dad, what happened to you?

121
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
He's alright,

122
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,050
just passed out.

123
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,030
Dad.

124
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,040
Are you okay?

125
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,200
Lai.

126
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,720
-Take your dad to the hospital. Hurry.
-Okay.

127
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,290
What about you?

128
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,840
I'll stay here and wait for
Captain Qi and his team to arrive.

129
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,480
We can't let these people
take away the artifacts again.

130
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,360
There are four of them.
How can you fight them alone?

131
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,390
Don't worry about it; just go quickly.

132
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,360
Don't risk your life
for these few treasures.

133
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,200
How come you still haven't
corrected your mindset?

134
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,790
They're not treasures.

135
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,030
They're artifacts; they're history.

136
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,360
I don't understand you.

137
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,840
Get up.

138
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Let me get my dad to safety first.

139
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,440
I'll come back with help.

140
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,150
-Go.
-Kun.

141
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,640
You must be careful.

142
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,280
-Go quickly.
-I'm leaving.

143
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,670
Dad.

144
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,770
I'm here.

145
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,220
Open the door!

146
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,630
Hurry up!

147
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,120
What's going on so late at night?

148
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,080
Liu, tomb raiders have hit the fields.

149
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,000
Hurry up!

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,030
Tomb raiders have come to the fields.

151
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,550
Auntie!

152
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
Open the door, quickly!

153
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,910
Grab the weapons, Uncle! Let's go!

154
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,510
Tomb raiders have come to the fields!
Let's go!

155
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,750
Uncle Zhao, hurry up!

156
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,470
Hurry up, Hei.

157
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,330
Another one.

158
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,470
We've struck it rich.

159
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
We've hit the jackpot this time.

160
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,530
Be careful.

161
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,440
Scar.

162
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,930
Answer the phone.

163
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,440
Captain Qi, where are you now?

164
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,550
Don't do anything rash.

165
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,100
I'll be there soon.

166
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,360
Hurry up. I think they're about to leave.

167
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,940
Brother.

168
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,560
It's done.

169
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,770
Liu!

170
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,670
Shine on me!

171
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,030
Come on.

172
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,550
Liu.

173
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,700
Why are you shining the torchlight on me?

174
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,360
Wait.

175
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,000
Dude, who are you?

176
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,930
Did you mistake me for someone else?

177
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,200
Who am I?

178
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,840
I'm Luo Kun, from

179
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,260
Du Mausoleum Village.

180
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,680
Don't you remember me?

181
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,320
We played mahjong together in town,
remember?

182
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,200
I remember.

183
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,150
I remember.

184
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,410
Have you forgotten those times

185
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,840
we played mahjong together in town?

186
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,390
Let's go!

187
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,720
Kun!

188
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,090
Give me a ride, will you?

189
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,720
Leave us alone!

190
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,330
Let's go!

191
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,830
That guy is catching up!

192
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,040
Drive faster.

193
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,750
Hurry up, find a way to shake him off.

194
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,370
Brother.

195
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,290
What should we do?

196
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,130
We can't be bothered with him anymore.

197
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:07,660
Let's go.

198
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,550
Run!

199
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,750
Stop!

200
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,000
Stop!

201
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,440
Stop!

202
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,030
Don't run!

203
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,080
Still running?

204
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,770
Hurry up!

205
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,370
Still running?

206
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,120
Catch him!

207
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,600
Get him!

208
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,160
Let's go.

209
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,430
Fang Kun.

210
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:33,910
Kun.

211
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,000
Kun.

212
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,000
Kun!

213
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,300
He's bleeding.

214
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,150
What should we do?

215
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,530
Hurry up, call someone.
Make a phone call right away.

216
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,630
Hurry up.

217
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,670
Hurry up!

218
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,480
Scar, Wu.

219
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,120
You two, clean this place up quickly!

220
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,080
What are we cleaning up, Brother?

221
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,870
What else?

222
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,940
Are you a dummy?

223
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,320
Hei knows this place.

224
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,440
He'll surely lead those
who are following him here soon.

225
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
You two, hurry up.

226
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Clean up everything we've used.

227
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:28,960
-Go quickly.
-Okay.

228
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,000
-Take what you need and stash what you must.
-Okay.

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,930
I'll make a call.

230
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,890
Answer the phone, will you?

231
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,680
Playing hide and seek with me
at a time like this, huh?

232
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,650
Hurry up!

233
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,980
Be careful.

234
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,960
What do you mean?

235
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,240
King Hua has already fled Qinchuan.

236
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,000
He doesn't dare to come back.

237
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,760
I'll take over here from now on.

238
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,810
Just leave the goods here.
You're free to go.

239
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,109
I won't let you work for nothing.

240
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,310
This is just a small amount of money.

241
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,200
Let me see the goods.

242
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,280
Don't move!

243
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,960
Everyone back off!

244
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:36,020
[Delivery Room]

245
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,590
Turn right up ahead.

246
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,650
The car is burned this badly.

247
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,420
We don't even know what happened inside.

248
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,010
The key question is:

249
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,240
They could've just driven away,

250
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,300
so why burn the car?

251
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,560
What now?

252
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,590
Take a few people
and go check it out first.

253
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,120
Alright.

254
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,690
Let's go.

255
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,510
Be careful.

256
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,540
Where is it?

257
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,110
Guang,

258
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,370
how did it go?

259
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,350
I got it.

260
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,750
No issues, right?

261
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,560
No issues.

262
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,150
Don't worry;
everything has been taken care of.

263
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,140
Do you want the goods more than your life?

264
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Unload the cargo.

265
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,750
Brother...

266
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,210
Unload!

267
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,040
Leave the vehicle to us too.

268
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,000
Brother.

269
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,080
I've given you the goods.

270
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,720
Let us keep the vehicle.

271
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,610
Get lost now.

272
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,510
It's good that no one got hurt.

273
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,070
Wen Wen's family.

274
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,350
Congratulations.

275
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,440
Both mother and child are safe.

276
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,160
It's a boy.

277
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,640
Brother,

278
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,110
where are you?

279
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:10,960
Guang,

280
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,030
you have a son now.

281
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,350
What?

282
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,230
Wen Wen has given birth.

283
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,890
Come to the hospital quickly.

284
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,660
Captain Qi.

285
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,790
There's no one inside.
The scene has been cleaned up thoroughly.

286
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,190
Nothing was left behind.

287
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,910
These people are quite experienced,
aren't they?

288
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
They knew Hei would bring us here,

289
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,650
so they must have come back in advance

290
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,400
and removed all biological information.

291
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,260
So what do we do now?

292
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,030
Call for more people.

293
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,110
Especially the crime scene investigators.

294
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,350
Search inch by inch.

295
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,090
If you can't find anything
in the abandoned power plant,

296
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,510
expand the search
to the surrounding areas.

297
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,070
The same goes for
the area around the looting pit.

298
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,270
If that doesn't work,

299
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
we'll use sieves.

300
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,410
Sift through this entire area for me.

301
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,680
What's done leaves a mark.

302
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,240
I don't believe
they didn't leave a single trace behind.

303
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,440
As long as they've set foot on this land,

304
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,610
they can't escape.

305
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,480
It's the inspection team.

306
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,280
Captain Yang.

307
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,760
It's been burned to this state.

308
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,310
-Captain Yang is here.
-Captain Qi.

309
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,170
How's it going?

310
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,960
The suspects had already fled
when we arrived.

311
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,160
We don't have any leads either.

312
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,060
We're preparing
for a comprehensive search.

313
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,110
A thorough sweep.

314
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,510
Get some instant noodles ready.

315
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,550
We might end up spending the weekend here.

316
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,030
Got it.

317
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,950
[ICU]

318
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,190
We don't know
what the situation is inside.

319
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,990
It's been so long already.

320
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,810
Doctor.

321
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,020
Fang Kun's family.

322
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,000
-Yes.
-Yes, I am.

323
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,270
How's my child doing?

324
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,960
The patient has extensive
abrasions and bruises all over the body.

325
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,680
Surgery and debridement
have been completed.

326
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,170
It will take some time,
but he should recover.

327
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,030
The more concerning issue

328
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,830
is his contrecoup brain injury.

329
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,030
There are contusions
and hematomas in the brain.

330
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,960
His vital signs are still unstable.

331
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,420
As for how it will develop,

332
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,070
we need to observe further.

333
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,320
I'll notify you promptly
if there are any changes.

334
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,780
Doctor.

335
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,580
-Mom.
-Auntie.

336
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,310
Look at him.

337
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,200
I said I'd go,
but he insisted on going himself.

338
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,720
Why did he ask me to call for help?

339
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,320
Look at what's happened now.

340
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,130
Are you okay?

341
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,010
How is it?

342
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:49,960
Dacang.

343
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,650
What's the situation?

344
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,270
-Dacang.
-He's now...

345
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:51,790
Dacang,

346
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,830
have you caught those thieving brats?

347
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,630
They got away.

348
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
How could you let them escape?

349
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,750
What are you police good for, huh?

350
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,590
With so many of you,

351
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,240
you couldn't even catch a few thieves.

352
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,750
Even Heizui is better than you.

353
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,880
Heizui knew

354
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,540
how to latch onto those thieves
and never let go.

355
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,950
Why don't you arrest Lai?

356
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,830
Lai has been living in the fields.

357
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,000
Those thieves were stealing things there.

358
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,730
How could Lai not know about it?

359
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,480
What?

360
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,750
Living in the fields? What do you mean?

361
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,600
Kun and I

362
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,680
discovered during our patrol

363
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,330
that Lai was living in your fields.

364
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,440
Lai must be in cahoots with them.

365
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,560
Xiaoman.

366
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,320
-You should arrest Lai—
-Stop it.

367
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,230
Dear,

368
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,720
you're awake?

369
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,400
I'm very dizzy.

370
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,920
What happened?

371
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,240
You, you scared me to death.

372
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,550
It's alright now.

373
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,440
It's good that you're awake.

374
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,240
Why can't I remember anything?

375
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,970
Where's Lai?

376
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,110
He's here.

377
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,650
Dad, I'm here.

378
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,330
What's going on?

379
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,550
Li Chunlai.

380
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,190
Come out for a moment.

381
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,550
Li Chunlai.

382
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,310
I'm coming.

383
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,880
Xiaoman, what's wrong?

384
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,550
You're just a hopeless mess,

385
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,750
a complete mess!

386
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,650
I must've been blind all these years,

387
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,400
living with someone like you.

388
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,510
Hurry up and sign the divorce papers.

389
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,260
Get out of my house right now!

390
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,270
I never want to see you again in my life!

391
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,800
Xiaoman!

392
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,400
Can't you talk nicely?

393
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,390
If it weren't for Lai this time,

394
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,160
your dad would still be
lying out in the field.

395
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,270
If not for him,

396
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,480
how else could those thieves have gotten
into our fields to raid the tombs?

397
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,070
He's the one

398
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,960
who caused my dad to end up like this.

399
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,750
How can you still speak for him?

400
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,740
If it weren't for you and my dad

401
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,800
insisting on finding someone,

402
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,030
just so there'd be someone
to handle the funeral later,

403
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,750
my life

404
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,270
wouldn't be ruined.

405
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,960
Mom, my life

406
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,590
is ruined.

407
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,570
If you're not ashamed
to bury a person like that

408
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,160
in our Qi family's ancestral grave,
I certainly am.

409
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Let me make this clear today:

410
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,450
I won't live with him anymore.

411
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,070
If anyone wants to live with him,
they can go ahead.

412
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,830
Lai.

413
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,440
What's going on here?

414
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,480
I agree.

415
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,850
I agree to divorce.

416
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,480
Mom.

417
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,510
Xiaoman is right.

418
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,790
I haven't been good since I was young,

419
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,080
and I can't learn to be good.

420
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,590
I'm just a hopeless mess.

421
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,840
To be honest,

422
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,740
I don't even think much of myself,

423
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,550
let alone Xiaoman.

424
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,830
I'll sign it.

425
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,280
I'll sign it.

426
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,550
Brother.

427
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,170
I didn't raid any tombs.

428
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,680
Those thieves in the field that day

429
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,880
were afraid I would report them,

430
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,070
so they made me take this against my will.

431
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,530
One of them recognized me.

432
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,960
I was afraid they would retaliate
against my family,

433
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,560
so I didn't dare tell anyone.

434
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,050
I haven't spent a penny
of this 5,000 yuan.

435
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,040
It's all here.

436
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Then why

437
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,790
did you tell Fang Kun later?

438
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:26,970
I was afraid...

439
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,500
I was afraid they would kill my dad.

440
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,190
Since you consider me your brother,

441
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,450
there's just one thing

442
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,000
I can say to you:

443
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,160
Be honest

444
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,590
and cooperate with the investigation.

445
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,960
Okay.

446
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,000
I'll cooperate fully.

447
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,040
Brother.

448
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:47,800
Brother.

449
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,350
Well...

450
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,720
Give me a moment.

451
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,640
Dad,

452
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,590
I'm sorry.

453
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,590
Bed 20, Wen Wen.

454
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,460
Yes.

455
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,820
Take a look.

456
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,420
Look at this little face.

457
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,620
Come here, sir.

458
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,640
Hold your child.

459
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,270
I... I'm not...

460
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,070
the ch... child's fa... father.

461
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,510
Madam, come on.

462
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,960
Take a look at your baby.

463
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,110
So fair and chubby.

464
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,230
She can breastfeed soon.

465
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,880
Make sure the mother gets plenty of rest.

466
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,410
Alright.

467
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,530
Wen Wen,

468
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,480
don't you think it's time

469
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,850
to feed the baby?

470
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:36,720
Wen Wen.

471
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,850
Guang, you're back.

472
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,680
Hurry up.

473
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,020
Come see your baby.

474
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,160
Isn't it fair?

475
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,080
Do you dare to hold it?

476
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,330
I don't dare to hold it.

477
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,210
Is everything alright?

478
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,680
Guang,

479
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,690
then you...

480
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,170
Stay with Wen Wen and the baby.

481
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,590
I'll head back first.

482
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,370
Call me anytime if you need anything.

483
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:06,970
Okay.

484
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,170
You're looking at me, aren't you?

485
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,110
What's wrong?

486
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,400
Look.

487
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,480
This is for you.

488
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,380
-Captain Qi.
-Captain Qi.

489
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,930
Captain Qi.

490
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,140
It's very deep.

491
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,400
-Be careful.
-Okay.

492
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,540
It looks like an outer burial pit.

493
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,080
Let's go down and take a look.

494
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,070
Is there enough air down there?

495
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,730
I've kept the blower running.

496
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,030
It should be fine.

497
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,790
Ensure safety at all costs.

498
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,160
Yes.

499
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,240
Alright, it shouldn't be a problem.

500
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,790
I'll go down.

501
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,400
I'll go down too.

502
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,240
You can't go down.

503
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,160
You don't know what's down there.

504
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,830
What are you going down there for?

505
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,680
Give me the safety helmet.

506
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,400
Don't rush.

507
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,290
I called you two here

508
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,880
because it's been approved.

509
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,680
Though the entrance is safe,

510
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,830
there are still risks below.

511
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,920
You must strictly follow
the operating procedures.

512
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,070
Ensure the safety of the artifacts

513
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,640
and your own lives.

514
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
This is no joking matter.

515
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,280
Don't worry.

516
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,420
Be careful.

517
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,110
Right.

518
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,699
Be careful.

519
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,480
Okay.

520
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,570
Come on, get up.

521
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,320
The rope.

522
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,870
Alright.

523
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,790
It's fine.

524
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,360
Okay.

525
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,150
These must have been shattered
by the explosives.

526
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,510
Yes.

527
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,540
These tomb raiders, coming back and forth,

528
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,000
must have trampled and damaged
quite a few pottery figurines.

529
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,850
Luo Qing.

530
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,050
Luo Qing, look.

531
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,150
Look at this bronze sheet.

532
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,670
It's like a leaf.

533
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,190
Yes.

534
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,510
The tip of the leaf is golden.

535
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,400
It's gold.

536
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,030
Could it be...

537
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
-The gilt bronze?
-The gilt bronze?

538
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
If this is really gilt bronze,

539
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,330
it would be
a major archaeological discovery for us.

540
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,440
Luo Qing.

541
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,800
What's wrong?

542
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,320
Tell me why.

543
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,710
Why did it have to turn out like this?

544
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,430
Why was it treated like garbage?

545
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,650
Everything here has been destroyed.

546
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,030
This place held Fang Kun's life's work

547
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,490
and Mr. Zan's dedication.

548
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,110
What they destroyed like trash

549
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,220
was the lifelong effort and passion
of us archaeologists.

550
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,920
To hell with being a researcher.

551
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,590
To hell with the research results.

552
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,250
Even if I have to quit,
I'll fight them to the end.

553
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,280
Don't they say tomb raiders
are always one step ahead of us?

554
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
They say we archaeologists

555
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,010
are always chasing after them.

556
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Fine, let's try.

557
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,690
Let's see who's really faster.

558
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,230
What's going on?
What's the situation down there?

559
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,430
Their main target is bronze artifacts.

560
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,320
Specifically, gilt bronze.

561
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,050
Gilt bronze?

562
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,800
Yes.

563
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,230
It's a metal processing technique.

564
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,110
An amalgam of gold and mercury

565
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,760
is applied to the surface of the bronze.

566
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,800
This technique existed as early as
the Warring States period.

567
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,480
This technology

568
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,580
was very advanced

569
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,550
at that time.

570
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,800
Gilt bronze horses have been
unearthed from Mao Mausoleum before.

571
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,000
Judging from the sounding stone fragments
left below,

572
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,630
this appears to be a tomb pit
belonging to the Music Bureau.

573
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,320
The most common items in such a pit
are chime bells and sounding stones.

574
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,550
We didn't see any bronze artifacts
down there,

575
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,000
nor did we see any chime bells.

576
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,400
I guess these tomb raiders
don't know much about pottery figurines.

577
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,930
They carelessly trampled and damaged
many pottery figurines.

578
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
We're in trouble.

579
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,200
To tomb raiders,

580
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,290
bronze artifacts are already
very valuable,

581
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,910
let alone gilt bronze.

582
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,590
The loss this time

583
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
is immeasurable.

584
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,480
This is an outer burial pit.

585
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,140
How do you know?

586
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,040
This is called an official seal.

587
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,090
The Music Bureau Director's Seal

588
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,500
is the official seal of the Music Bureau.

589
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,960
What's the Music Bureau?

590
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,760
It's equivalent to today's
China National Traditional Orchestra.

591
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,030
The Music Bureau was established
by Emperor Wu of Han.

592
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,030
It mainly collected folk music
from various regions,

593
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,320
then adapted and composed it

594
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,150
before performing.

595
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,920
These chime bells were used to play music.

596
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,250
Can music really be made

597
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,850
just from these things?

598
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,690
These are burial objects.

599
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,760
Real chime bells are much larger
than these.

600
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,420
They're hung on a large frame,

601
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,460
arranged according to pitch,

602
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,560
and then struck one by one
with wooden mallets.

603
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,970
All different sounds?

604
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,090
They can produce different sounds.

605
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,960
If struck according to the musical score,

606
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,440
they can produce music.

607
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,790
A set of chime bells was unearthed from
the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng before.

608
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,950
It had 19 Niu bells,

609
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,550
45 Yong bells,

610
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,550
plus a large Bo bell gifted
by King Hui of Chu.

611
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,660
There were 65 pieces in total.

612
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,880
That entire set of chime bells

613
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,140
was large enough to fill an entire stage.

614
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,740
With so many chime bells,

615
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,340
how much could they sell for?

616
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,590
It's not just because they're chime bells

617
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,550
but also because of their craftsmanship.

618
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,610
Take another look.

619
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,510
What makes these bronze artifacts

620
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,970
different from the ones
you've seen before?

621
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,960
What difference?

622
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,110
They're green.

623
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
There's a bit of yellow in this green.

624
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,330
This is called the gilt technique.

625
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,880
I'll explain it to you in detail
when we have time.

626
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,400
You just need to know one thing:

627
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,460
This batch of goods

628
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,400
is enough for us
to live on for the rest of our lives.

629
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,530
It's that valuable?

630
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,550
Guang,

631
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,110
now that you have a child,

632
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,730
have you thought about the future?

633
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,370
The future?

634
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,110
I'll continue to work with you

635
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,510
to earn more money to raise my child.

636
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,710
Others call us tomb raiders.

637
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,710
We can't be tomb raiders forever.

638
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,400
We've been stuck before,

639
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,230
but every step we take

640
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,230
is a step forward.

641
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,400
We have to keep climbing,

642
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,800
pull ourselves out of this situation,

643
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,670
and one day stand tall in the sunlight.

644
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,590
Let those who look down on us see clearly

645
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,360
who truly stands above the rest.

646
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,550
Captain Qi, you're here.

647
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,510
Well,

648
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,320
how's Fang Kun?

649
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,330
He's got a brain injury.

650
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,120
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.

651
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,270
I'm partly responsible too.

652
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,100
If only I had patrolled more carefully.

653
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,420
Don't worry about it.

654
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,320
What?

655
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,680
They took the goods. Where did they go?

656
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,020
Okay. Don't panic.

657
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,480
Go find him.

658
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,040
If anything happens,

659
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,090
contact me by phone immediately.

660
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,010
Mr. Zhao,

661
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,540
Mu Jianhui is here.

662
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
What's he here for?

663
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
He says he's got a new batch of goods.

664
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:17,790
Tell him to come in.

665
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,560
Alright.

666
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,010
Mr. Zhao.

667
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,360
Mr. Mu, please have a seat.

668
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,690
Okay.

669
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,820
You're quite impressive these days.

670
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,820
One moment you're on TV,

671
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,780
the next you're publishing a book,

672
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,480
and now you're sourcing goods.

673
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,540
How do you even find the time for that?

674
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,590
Birds of prey don't raise doves.

675
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,650
I'm just learning from you, Mr. Zhao.

676
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,840
Where did you get the goods?

677
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,240
There's been such a big case
in Bailu Plain.

678
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,630
It's all over the news.

679
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,820
Haven't you heard about it, Mr. Zhao?

680
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,920
You got the goods
from the big tomb in Yin Village?

681
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,440
That's right.
