[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,880
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,150
If one project is enough to wear you out,

4
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,710
then I suggest

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,570
you might as well

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,259
go back to the institute
and do a desk job.

7
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,210
Wouldn't that be much easier?

8
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,400
Though you'd lose fieldwork subsidies,

9
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,400
you could marry me.

10
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,020
You don't like eating much anyway.

11
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,120
Once I'm officially employed,

12
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,840
my salary should be enough to support you.

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,330
What do you think?

14
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,510
Are you crazy?

15
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,480
Who wants to marry you?

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,110
Murdering your husband.

17
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,870
You'd be dead the moment you marry me.

18
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,070
I’d beat you to death.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,910
Shut up!

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,840
Ancestors, please show your divine power.

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,000
Come and testify for me,

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,140
or at least be a witness.

23
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,340
You can't mess with

24
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,370
women who do field archaeology.

25
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,550
They're stronger than mules.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,020
Who are you calling a mule?

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,290
I’m telling you,

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,079
it’s only because I haven’t eaten today.

29
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,900
Otherwise, you'd

30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,310
already be in an ambulance.

31
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,520
Are you sure, Luo Qing?

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Why don't you try?

33
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,550
Here, I’ve got a piece of chocolate.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,450
Eat it.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,930
Let’s see if I end up in the ER today.

36
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,510
Come on.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,050
You still don’t believe me?

38
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,170
Who eats chocolate when they're hungry?

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,840
Next time, remember to bring a roujiamo.

40
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,590
Fine, if you want roujiamo,

41
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,790
I’ll stuff myself inside it if I have to.

42
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,120
Is it dry?

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,620
I'll bring you a bowl of chicken soup.

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,829
There’s a saying,

45
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,480
no plan is ever perfect,

46
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,200
but your determination can be.

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,600
The best plan you can think of right now,

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560
that’s already the best one.

49
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,520
Sometimes, completion is more important
than perfection.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,940
Even if you screw it up,

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,079
so what?

52
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,430
You've done your best.

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
If you're wrong, it won't matter.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,470
You’ve got

55
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,470
Mrs. Zan and Director Zhang backing you.

56
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,870
Right?

57
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,079
Even if

58
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,960
you smash the ancestors' skulls,

59
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,270
you’d still have Mr. Zan.

60
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,210
What are you afraid of? We're all here.

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,750
Right?

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,090
Alright.

63
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,040
Eat up and get to bed.

64
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,570
Once you wake up, it’s a new day.

65
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,270
Jianhui, no matter how much you drink,
you’ll be fine.

66
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,720
It doesn’t get you drunk.

67
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,370
Yeah, Jianhui.
This wine’s over thirty years old.

68
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,980
It does have a smooth taste.

69
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:38,630
But,

70
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,860
there's a hint of Chinese herbal medicine.

71
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,520
Maybe it’s been aged too long.

72
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,570
What's wrong with you?

73
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,610
Driving so fast.

74
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,670
Trying to reincarnate or what?

75
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,560
You’re nuts.

76
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,830
You’ll have a crash sooner or later.

77
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:22,980
Wen Wen.

78
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,720
Wen Wen.

79
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,000
Wen Wen.

80
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,330
I'm not that kind of sleazy person.

81
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,850
There was something wrong with the wine.

82
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,780
Liu Shusheng set us up.

83
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,060
Sorry!

84
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,330
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

85
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,470
What time are you coming over?

86
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,270
Call me back when you wake up.

87
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,730
You’re here.

88
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,570
-Guang.
-Brother.

89
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
What brings you here?

90
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,650
Just passing by.

91
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,360
So I came to see you.

92
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,840
How’s the place?

93
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,170
It's great.

94
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,000
Have you been drinking?

95
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,010
Had a few drinks last night.

96
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,750
Don't drink so much.

97
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,270
It's not good for your health.

98
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,790
I can still smell it now.

99
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,320
Brother.

100
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,640
Wen Wen must still be asleep.

101
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,890
She hasn’t picked up all morning.

102
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,550
She went with your sister-in-law.

103
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,550
The signal's poor in the mountains.

104
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,390
I see.

105
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,460
She said she was going to pick up
the photos yesterday,

106
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,460
but still hasn’t brought them back.

107
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,480
I’ll go get them later.

108
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,140
No need. I’ll get them for you.

109
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,500
There's an urgent job.

110
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,000
You need to go out of Qinchuan.

111
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,060
Give me your phone.

112
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,930
Go out of Qinchuan?

113
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,270
Get a new SIM card when you get there.

114
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,880
Don't let anyone know
you're coming from Qinchuan.

115
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,480
Do I need to leave now?

116
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,730
Yes, the goods are urgently needed.

117
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,390
Pack your things.

118
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,320
Okay.

119
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,770
Go ahead.

120
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,870
Mr. Guo. Mr. Fang.

121
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,630
We've discovered two tomb passages so far.

122
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,750
The east one is the longest.

123
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,480
It's 134.5 meters long.

124
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,860
The narrowest part is 9.7 meters.

125
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,600
The widest part is 40.2 meters.

126
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,270
So wide?

127
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,460
If it isn't a feudal prince's tomb,

128
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,440
it has to be at least
a marquis-level tomb.

129
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,360
Could it be Princess Guantao's tomb?

130
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:30,870
Guo.

131
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,650
You're the Captain now.

132
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
A lot of people listen to you.

133
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,730
You’ve got to be
responsible for what you say.

134
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,840
Be cautious and don’t make wild guesses.

135
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,080
How can I be cautious?

136
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,080
The scale of this tomb
is right here for all to see.

137
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,190
All we've done is hit the edge

138
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,710
and found two passageways.

139
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,510
We don’t even know if it’s a Zhong-shaped
tomb or a Ya-shaped one yet.

140
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,190
Alright.

141
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,890
Let's continue exploring.

142
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,340
Okay.

143
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, my land.

144
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,280
Captain Guo.

145
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,550
Smells good, huh?

146
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,520
It's delicious!

147
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,200
You scared me to death!

148
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,630
Mr. Lv.

149
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,480
How's Xiaoman doing?

150
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,240
Is her training completed?

151
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,040
Add a bit more.

152
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
I was just about to mention that.

153
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,270
Xiaoman is smart.

154
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,080
She's attentive and hardworking.

155
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,960
When she’s working,

156
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,000
she's no worse than us old technicians.

157
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,800
In my opinion,

158
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
with a bit more practice,

159
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,860
she could become a top expert.

160
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,160
That's right.

161
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,790
Captain Guo, didn't you hear that?

162
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,480
You should express your opinion quickly.

163
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,200
Xiaoman is so good.

164
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
If you don't recruit her soon,

165
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,630
someone else might snatch her up,

166
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,240
right?

167
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,370
Xiaoman.

168
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,350
Starting today,

169
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,030
you’re officially
the archaeological team's apprentice.

170
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,430
Twenty yuan a day.

171
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,510
Is that okay?

172
00:14:59,550 --> 00:14:59,910
What?

173
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,360
What are you doing, Xiaoman?

174
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,490
Come on, thank them.

175
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,750
Thank you, Captain Guo.

176
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,610
Thank you, Kun.

177
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Thank you, Mr. Lv.

178
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,440
I’ll work hard, I promise.

179
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,240
Well, I never thought

180
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,960
that my girl

181
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,490
would find a job
in your archaeological team.

182
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,480
-Auntie
-It’s good.

183
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,960
We work with dirt all day,

184
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,290
not much different from what you folks do.

185
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,790
If Xiaoman does
anything wrong in the future

186
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,320
or doesn't listen, just let me know.

187
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll talk to her.

188
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,870
Alright, no worries, it’s all good.

189
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,800
We haven't found anything bad yet.

190
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,600
Uncle, have you eaten?

191
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,860
-I’ll get some for you.
-Uncle Youliang.

192
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,080
Fang.

193
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,270
Come here.

194
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,210
I’ll get it, Auntie.

195
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,270
The things I told you about,

196
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,130
why didn't you listen to any of it?

197
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,440
I told you not to ruin

198
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,640
other people's land.

199
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
But you went ahead

200
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,240
and messed it up from east to west.

201
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,270
What do you mean, Uncle?

202
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,080
What do I mean?

203
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,600
Guo just had me look at his land.

204
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,390
You've ruined it.

205
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,000
Guo?

206
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,870
Which one?

207
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,790
We've never even been to his land.

208
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,670
What nonsense is he talking about?

209
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,000
Guo is an honest man.

210
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,160
What's wrong with him?

211
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,480
Why would he make things up
and slander the archaeological team?

212
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,410
Uncle Youliang.

213
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,960
We coordinate every day
when we go out to survey.

214
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,150
There's no Guo as you mentioned.

215
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,810
We've never been to his place.

216
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,320
I work with
the archaeological team every day.

217
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,240
How could I not know?

218
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,440
Shut up. This has nothing to do with you.

219
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,910
Look at you.

220
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,790
Not listening to
your own daughter's words,

221
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,850
but believing outsiders' nonsense.

222
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,000
Fang.

223
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,290
Don't mind him. Come, let's eat.

224
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,510
Kun, let's eat, let's eat.

225
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:30,910
Okay.

226
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,120
Our plan is working well.

227
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,480
Right.

228
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,750
You bunch of idiots.

229
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,150
Idiots.

230
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,030
You've ruined my land

231
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,030
like this.

232
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,030
How dare you come here?

233
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,670
W-What are you doing?

234
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,360
Let go of me. What are you pulling me for?

235
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,270
Look what you've done to the land.

236
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,870
And you still dare to come to my land?

237
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,320
Let go!

238
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,150
You're still trying to control me?

239
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,000
Who are you anyway?

240
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,240
Look what they've dug up.

241
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,670
Move.

242
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,960
Don't pull me!

243
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,150
Come and see, come on.

244
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,870
Come see what you've done!

245
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,440
Come here.

246
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,960
What are we looking at?

247
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,630
Look.

248
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,130
Look at what you've dug up.

249
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,150
The archaeological team
need to watch this!

250
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,630
Look at what you've done to the land.

251
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,890
Look, look here, here.

252
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
From east to west.

253
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Look! Look! Look!

254
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,110
Uncle Guo.

255
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,990
This land wasn't dug up by us.

256
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,920
We never even entered
your land during our survey.

257
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,510
Exactly.

258
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,640
Show your evidence.

259
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,000
You said you haven't been to
Uncle Guo's land.

260
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,640
You've been to my land, haven't you?

261
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,240
My land has been dug up just like this.

262
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,349
It’s full of holes now.

263
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,750
All my crops are ruined.

264
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,440
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

265
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,170
Impossible.

266
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,790
We...

267
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,109
Impossible.

268
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,119
We refilled all the exploration holes.

269
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,550
How could I have dug up your land?

270
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,069
I think you

271
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,550
are just refusing to admit it now.

272
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:24,920
Let's go.

273
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,480
Let's go to my land
and confront each other.

274
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,030
You won't shed tears
until you see the coffin.

275
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,640
Follow me.

276
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,350
Let's go! Let's go!

277
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,590
Let's go.

278
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,170
Let's go to my land.

279
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,900
Let's go, let's go.

280
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,700
I'll show you.

281
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,880
This is my land, look.

282
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,830
Look what you've done.

283
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,750
Look, look, look.

284
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,830
Take a good look.

285
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,590
Look at this land.

286
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,650
Look at these pits.

287
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,930
Look around, look at this land.

288
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,830
No.

289
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,720
They're all big pits, one after another.

290
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,550
It wasn't us.

291
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,330
Didn't we refill them back?

292
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,720
Yes, we didn't do this.

293
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,110
This pit is the biggest, come and see.

294
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,170
I'm furious, look.

295
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,000
The proof’s right there.

296
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,400
Nothing more to say, huh?

297
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,150
Uncle Guo.

298
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,310
We were drilling.

299
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,240
We filled the holes after drilling.

300
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,880
This really wasn't done by us.

301
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,920
You’re still denying it.

302
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,240
Even with the evidence
right in front of you.

303
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,750
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

304
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,830
It's like the ox doesn't
know its horns are curved,

305
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,070
the horse doesn't know its face is long.

306
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,750
I don't think you're
the archaeological team,

307
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,590
you're a demolition crew!

308
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,880
Watch your words.

309
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,440
We need evidence.

310
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,000
You keep asking for evidence.

311
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The evidence should be your dog's name.

312
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,110
Evidence? You're standing on it.

313
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,770
How can you say that?

314
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,920
Still asking for evidence, huh?

315
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,510
You ruined someone’s land
and acted like nothing happened.

316
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,640
My land is ruined.

317
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,550
Only you have been to my land.

318
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,510
If it wasn't you,

319
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,400
then it was his dog.

320
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,960
Exactly.

321
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,070
We took photos
during our survey.

322
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,170
We can use the photos as evidence.

323
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,510
Photos?

324
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,000
Use the photos as evidence?

325
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,920
Right? Look.

326
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,200
We refilled them all back.

327
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,550
Put away that camera quickly.

328
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,000
Look.

329
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,460
See, this is the photo.

330
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,480
Look, we've done a good job.

331
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,790
Someone's been eating meat on the sly
and wiping their greasy mouth.

332
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,960
Can you show me the bones?

333
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,110
Xian, Uncle.

334
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,880
What’s going on this early in the morning?

335
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,240
What's going on here?

336
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,640
Look what you’ve done.

337
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,960
And you still have the nerve to ask?

338
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,750
How did the land end up like this?

339
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,680
If this was my land, I'd be angry too.

340
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,830
That's right, Fang Kun.

341
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,680
What did you promise me before?

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
You know I'm angry.

343
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,680
And you've dug up my land like this.

344
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Xian, Xian, Xian.

345
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,070
Our work method

346
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,620
is drilling holes,

347
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,270
Four centimeters per hole.

348
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:16,960
Have you seen it before?

349
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
I haven't. If you don't believe me,
go and see for yourselves.

350
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,310
Alright, this kind of thing.

351
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,550
Honestly, we wouldn't waste our time

352
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,640
doing something like this.

353
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,920
Exactly, doing it this way
increases the workload.

354
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,720
That's right.

355
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,510
No matter what,

356
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,920
let's find someone

357
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,590
and get this land filled in first.

358
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,310
What do you think?

359
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,550
The problem is my crops are ruined.

360
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,550
No. Why should we?

361
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,830
Don't say anymore.

362
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,030
Why should we do that?

363
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,920
Right, right.

364
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,830
You're right.

365
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,830
Even if we refill it,
the crops are ruined anyway, right?

366
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,440
Okay.

367
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,550
Xian, we've dealt with each other before.

368
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,350
You know what kind of person I am.

369
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,720
Can you give us a little leeway here?

370
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,920
We’ll move fast

371
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,590
to figure out what really happened

372
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,720
and work out a solution for you.

373
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,610
How about that?

374
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,160
So how long will it take?

375
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,270
As soon as possible.

376
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,350
As soon as possible, as soon as possible.

377
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,440
As soon as possible, as soon as possible.

378
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,790
That’s right, exactly.

379
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,480
Anyway, they can't run away.

380
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,260
Right.

381
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,170
This matter,

382
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
if it's not resolved,

383
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,720
don't even think about
setting foot on our land.

384
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,510
That's right, don't even think about
entering our land.

385
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,910
Open the door, Youliang.

386
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,630
Open the door, open the door!

387
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,480
Open the door, open the door!

388
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,240
Open the door, open the door!

389
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,310
Honey.

390
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,960
Didn't you hear them

391
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,400
knocking on our door like that?

392
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,860
Aren't you going to do
something about this?

393
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,210
What does it have to do with me?

394
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,950
I told this group long ago

395
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,830
not to ruin other people's land.

396
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,010
They didn't listen.

397
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,280
What now?

398
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,030
They have the ability to cause trouble

399
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,890
but not the ability to resolve it.

400
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
Now they come looking for me.

401
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,970
And they're all pointing their guns at me.

402
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,120
The people who ruined the land are back.

403
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,400
One at a time, speak one at a time.

404
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,660
I can't hear anything.

405
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
Speak one at a time.

406
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,680
Speak one at a time.

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,930
That's how it is.

408
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,310
You agreed to dig small holes at the time.

409
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,860
Exactly.

410
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,550
Now you've dug big holes all over my land.

411
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,550
That's right.

412
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,720
What are you going to do about it?

413
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,160
No, your land is completely ruined.

414
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,090
It's all ruined.

415
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,920
There are big holes everywhere.

416
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,050
They're very large.

417
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,590
You're a grown man.

418
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,960
How can you be so narrow-minded?

419
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,370
Why are you always picking on these kids?

420
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,590
If you don't handle this matter,

421
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,140
just wait and see.

422
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,140
Your daughter will fight with you
when she comes back.

423
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,530
What's wrong with you two?

424
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,110
Always at odds with me.

425
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,040
What's the matter?

426
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,490
You're on the same side now?

427
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,220
Whether you want to deal with it or not,

428
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,650
anything that happens in Yin Village

429
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,330
will ultimately

430
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,060
fall on you as the Chief.

431
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,640
He's coming out, he's coming out.

432
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,790
The Chief is coming out.

433
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,590
Chief, Chief.

434
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,040
Let me tell you, let me tell you.

435
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,170
Alright, alright.

436
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,920
Stop arguing, will you?

437
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,220
This matter is unclear right now.

438
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,270
Everyone has their own side of the story.

439
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,590
Everyone thinks they're right.

440
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,350
Let's do this.

441
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,550
Let's go to the village committee
to find a witness, okay?

442
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,070
Good.

443
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,640
That works, that works.

444
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,840
Quiet down, quiet down.

445
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,510
Today's matter

446
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,290
is mainly to resolve the issue
between the archaeological team

447
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,660
and our villagers.

448
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,310
The archaeological team

449
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,990
claims they didn’t

450
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,440
ruin the land.

451
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,880
But there’s no way

452
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,960
we’d

453
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
ruin our own land,

454
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,440
right?

455
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,720
Exactly!

456
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,930
This isn’t hard to sort out.

457
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,680
Yan Shoucun

458
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,970
has been guarding the land.

459
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,850
Heizui is very smart.

460
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,160
First,

461
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,960
it definitely wouldn't bark at villagers.

462
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,560
Secondly,

463
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,350
it wouldn't bark at
the archaeological team members either.

464
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,480
That should make it easy to figure out.

465
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
It must have been done by outsiders.

466
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,560
Shoucun,

467
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,080
can you tell us what's been happening
these past few days?

468
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,370
I don't know.

469
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,420
How can you not know?

470
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,360
Are your ears stuffed with donkey hair?

471
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,510
Or has your Heizui gone mute?

472
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,240
You don’t even know
if the dogs have barked?

473
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,640
You can't be afraid of offending outsiders

474
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,960
and forget that

475
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,000
you're from Yin Village.

476
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Anyway, these past few days,

477
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,920
Heizui hasn't made a single sound.

478
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,030
Uncle Shoucun, think carefully again.

479
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,160
You must have been sleeping deeply
and haven't heard it.

480
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,070
I'm not a pig,

481
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,770
sleeping so deeply.

482
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,180
If Heizui barked once,

483
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,310
everyone on the plain would hear it.

484
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,030
When I sleep, his one ear is always up,

485
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,490
just waiting for bad guys
to come to the site.

486
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,310
Anyway, Heizui hasn't barked
these past few days.

487
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,400
I don't know about this.

488
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,270
I still need to go on patrol.

489
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:03,810
Let's go, Heizui.

490
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,830
You're just a pig.

491
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,160
Yan Shoucun, come back.

492
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Did you hear that?

493
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,850
Shoucun is honest.

494
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,210
He wouldn't talk nonsense.

495
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,280
No outsiders have been here.

496
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,160
Then it must be your archaeological team.

497
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,790
That's right, no outsiders have been here.

498
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,000
Why do no outsiders
being here mean we did it?

499
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Were we farting against the wind?

500
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,240
Digging up our own land ourselves?

501
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,960
Who knows?

502
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,510
What do you mean?

503
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,200
What do you mean?

504
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,130
What do you mean?

505
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,270
What do you mean?

506
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,720
Uncle Youliang.

507
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,480
You've gone too far.

508
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,920
Look.

509
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,900
We have photos of
our archaeological work every day.

510
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
This is evidence.

511
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,910
Moreover,

512
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,200
we've been coming to Yin Village
for so many years, right?

513
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,270
Why would we dig up your land
at this critical moment?

514
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,070
It doesn't make sense, does it?

515
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,480
Look at those photos, right?

516
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,640
You took them.

517
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,240
You can show whatever you want.

518
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,790
What do you mean?

519
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,180
Can you take a photo while digging a hole?

520
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,960
Uncles. Aunties.

521
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,570
We're here today to solve the problem.

522
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,130
Let’s talk calmly.

523
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,480
Don’t get angry, okay?

524
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,410
Don't get angry.

525
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
I also grew up working in the fields.

526
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,160
I care about our crops more than anyone.

527
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,110
If the archaeological team
ruined the land,

528
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,240
how could I ignore it?

529
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,720
Right?

530
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,830
I swear to the City God,

531
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,310
the archaeological team
has absolutely never ruined our land.

532
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,960
Xiaoman,

533
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,010
you grew up in Yin Village, that’s true.

534
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,300
But now you get paid by
the archaeological team.

535
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,550
Whoever gives you the food,
you watch their moods.

536
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,030
Whoever pays you the salary,
you follow their rules.

537
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,240
Everyone knows this.

538
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,870
That's right, that's right.

539
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,590
Xian,

540
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,400
what do you mean by that?

541
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,280
You...

542
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,830
I would never lose my conscience

543
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,960
just for a paycheck.

544
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,490
If they did it, they did it.

545
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,940
If they didn't, they didn't.

546
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,000
If you haven't taken any benefits
from the archaeological team,

547
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,920
why is it only your land

548
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,920
that hasn't been dug up?

549
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,160
Right, right.

550
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,350
What nonsense are you talking about?

551
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,150
That's right.

552
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,640
What's going on?

553
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,900
Then I suspect you too.

554
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,400
My family hasn't eaten lamb,
yet we smell of it.

555
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,750
Haven't eaten lamb?

556
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,400
The archaeological team’s
lodging and meal expenses,

557
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,660
didn't they all send it to your Qi family?

558
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,720
Nonsense, is this the same thing?

559
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,070
Why is that?

560
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,770
Whoever’s wife it is, take her home.

561
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,170
Chief, Chief, calm down.

562
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,200
Don't listen to her.

563
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,920
You are so troublesome.

564
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,850
The Chief is surely on our side, right?

565
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,240
Stop gnawing on that bun.

566
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,640
You say something first.

567
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,960
That archaeological team

568
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,260
and our villagers,

569
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,550
we’re like a stick hitting a stove door.

570
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,790
What are we here for today?

571
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,590
Let's get to the point.

572
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,920
Stop talking nonsense.

573
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,070
That's right.

574
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,440
Let's think about
how to solve this problem.

575
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,790
How do you suggest we solve it?

576
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,550
You're responsible for the land
you dug up.

577
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,550
You're not offering any solutions.

578
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,070
Guo.

579
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,960
You're an elder in our village.

580
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,720
We can't

581
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,680
let these youngsters make the decisions.

582
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,010
How should we handle this?

583
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,540
I’ll listen to you.

584
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,850
Debts must be paid.

585
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,590
My land is ruined.

586
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,160
The cherry trees were planted for nothing.

587
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,220
Buying seedlings,

588
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,150
fertilizing,

589
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,260
plowing, watering,

590
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,550
plus compensation for lost crops,

591
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,480
labor costs, everything counted.

592
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,790
We're not trying to
take advantage of anyone.

593
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,270
Everyone should get their fair share.

594
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,200
Exactly, I'm not looking to
profit from this either.

595
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,790
How is this our fault?

596
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,400
That's right.

597
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,240
Don't be angry, don't be angry.

598
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,000
Everyone, listen to me, listen to me.

599
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,460
Sister.

600
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Fang Kun, Shilin.

601
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,270
You’ve spent quite some time
out on the plain too,

602
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,380
You've seen it with your own eyes.

603
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,310
We farmers live off the land.

604
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,160
Those few acres of land have been ruined.

605
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,640
We'll starve next year.

606
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,790
Fellow villagers.

607
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,240
Well.

608
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,680
The archaeological team
is like a guest in my home.

609
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,170
They're reasonable people.

610
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,920
Well, how much land did they ruin?

611
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,400
They should compensate us accordingly.

612
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Right?

613
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,670
Uncle Guo.

614
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,270
Five thousand yuan should be fair, right?

615
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,270
That's about right.

616
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,130
Five thousand.

617
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,750
Five thousand.

618
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,440
Five thousand.

619
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,070
You, that's enough.

620
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,880
After all this time,

621
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,790
it's just a self-directed play.

622
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,590
What do you mean?

623
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,520
What do you mean?

624
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,830
What do you mean? What play?

625
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,720
You're trying to pin the blame

626
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
on our archaeological team.

627
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,770
Putting on this act just to extort money.

628
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,750
Who’s extorting your money?

629
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,350
Who’s extorting your money?

630
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,440
Who’s extorting your money?

631
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,700
We wouldn’t ruin land just to make money.

632
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,710
Whoever’s responsible
should take the blame.

633
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,390
Bring out the evidence.

634
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,450
Let’s speak with evidence.

635
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,750
Kun.

636
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,610
Don't come out.

637
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,830
Come here.

638
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,870
Come here.

639
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,350
We've known Fang Kun
and the others for years.

640
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,110
For years!

641
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,750
Do they seem like the type
to do something like this?

642
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,790
I don’t care about all that!

643
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,750
You don’t care about anything?

644
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm not that free.

645
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,240
Why should I care about this?

646
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,920
Didn't you hear what the villagers said?

647
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,750
They're saying we've taken some benefits
from the archaeological team.

648
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,750
If I don't take that oil bottle,
I won't get my hands dirty.

649
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,080
Okay.

650
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,000
Let me tell you,

651
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,680
as long as these folks
don’t stay in our house,

652
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,920
we won’t get that kind of gossip.

653
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,590
Do you know what this is called?

654
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,680
Putting on makeup
before going to the coffin.

655
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,720
Wanting respect even when you're dead.

656
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,110
You’re afraid a stalk of lamp grass
on your back might crush you.

657
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,350
Xiaoman, why are you talking to
Dad like that?

658
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,070
Dad, don't stoop to her level.

659
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,090
-Xiaoman.
-Get out!

660
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,130
Stop stirring up trouble here.

661
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,290
Hearing you annoys me so much.

662
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,000
[Yin Village]

663
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,510
If they don't let us stay, we won't stay.

664
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,750
If we're not welcome here,
we'll be welcome elsewhere.

665
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,030
We have plenty of places to stay.

666
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,830
But what good is
living in a five-star hotel?

667
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,160
What can you do
if they don't let you into the fields?

668
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,960
Then let
the district government coordinate.

669
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,530
I can't stand this humiliation.

670
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,680
Guo, I'm not saying this to be mean,

671
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,010
your temper right now...

672
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,420
What?

673
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,310
The things you just said to Uncle Guo,

674
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,810
I think you went a bit too far.

675
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,480
Look how upset you made Uncle Guo.

676
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,940
He didn't seem to be lying.

677
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,680
Xiaoman might be right.

678
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,660
No farmer would ruin their own land
for no reason.

679
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,160
Maybe there’s really something fishy
going on here.

680
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Mr. Fang. Mr. Guo.

681
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,350
I have an idea,

682
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,110
just throwing it out there,

683
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,240
It's up to you whether to listen or not.

684
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,590
When we were drilling
the Du Mausoleum before,

685
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,850
some things happened.

686
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,240
Some local villagers,

687
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,550
seeing our archaeological team

688
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,950
dig up quite a few brick
and tile fragments.

689
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,680
They heard

690
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,880
that Qin bricks and Han tiles
can be sold for money.

691
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,940
So they got greedy.

692
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,440
They sneaked into the land at night
to steal tile fragments.

693
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,480
I guess you're right, Lu.

694
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,110
I just took a close look at that land.

695
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,600
There are indeed obvious signs of digging.

696
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,680
I guess someone

697
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,540
was looking for something there.

698
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,270
Then let's catch

699
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,530
those who are digging illegally, right?

700
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,790
It seems our archaeological team

701
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,250
will have to play the role of
Relics Inspection Team this time.

702
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,920
How many did you dig?

703
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,190
Got two, two.

704
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,880
Lai.

705
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Lai, look.

706
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,950
Finders keepers, right?

707
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,070
What are you doing?

708
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,800
Who's there?

709
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,300
Don't move!

710
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,190
Don't run!

711
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,770
Who is it?

712
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,720
Put it down!

713
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,380
Put it down!

714
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,750
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

715
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,310
It hurts, it hurts!

716
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,550
You good-for-nothing!

717
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,940
You little thief!

718
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,370
What's going on?

719
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,660
What happened?

720
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,510
You're chasing away
the archaeological team?

721
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,640
This was all your son-in-law's doing.

722
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,120
What's going on, Lai?

723
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,240
I just dug up a few acres
of our village's own land.

724
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,790
You dug up the land?

725
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,880
Didn't you know this is illegal?

726
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,110
I didn't know!

727
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,350
You got yourself into this mess.

728
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,350
You deal with it yourself.

729
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,720
Dad!

730
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,550
Take him away.

731
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,590
Dad, I'm sorry!

732
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,680
Xiaoman, I'm sorry!

733
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,480
How could you do such a thing?

734
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,890
I only dug this one time!

735
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,210
I didn't know!

736
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,880
T-This can't be dug up!

737
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,720
This, this...

738
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,760
Dacang, please spare me this time.

739
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,270
Please spare me this time.

740
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,240
I won't dare do it again!

741
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,770
Xiaoman!

742
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,960
Xiaoman, please beg Dacang for mercy!

743
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,480
The kid’s still young.

744
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,880
Don't mention me and the child.

745
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,720
I feel sick.

746
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,550
What have you done?

747
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,750
I’m ashamed.

748
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,580
Very ashamed.

749
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,760
What have you done, Lai?

750
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,370
I’m so ashamed.

751
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,239
That’s it. Take him away.

752
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,360
No!

753
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,699
No, don't rush!

754
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,699
This thing?

755
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,030
The land belongs to our family.

756
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,030
The things belong to our family.

757
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,480
This is all ours, right?

758
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,030
How is this breaking any law?

759
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,840
Alright.

760
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,960
Stop shouting.

761
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,040
Take care of things at home.

762
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,120
Comrade, let's go.

763
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,489
Let's go.

764
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,710
W-Where are you taking him?

765
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,400
This isn't illegal!

766
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,630
I was digging on our own land!

767
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,690
I didn't go dig anywhere else, right?

768
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,030
Chief.

769
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,810
Did we do the wrong thing here?

770
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,500
We can't say we did wrong.

771
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,150
If

772
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,880
you had chosen to settle things
peacefully at the time

773
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
and just paid the villagers,

774
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,150
those thieves wouldn’t have been caught,

775
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,950
and the cultural relics
would keep disappearing.

776
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,120
And the villagers' land

777
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,840
would also

778
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,600
suffer some damage.

779
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,110
By then,

780
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,790
even if we

781
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,840
use up all the savings our institute
has accumulated over the years,

782
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,840
we still can't compensate
for all the village's land.

783
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,190
However,

784
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,480
this time

785
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,110
you've publicly

786
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,170
embarrassed the Chief.

787
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,030
From now on, your work in the village

788
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,760
will be difficult to carry out.

789
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,320
Who could have guessed that
among those people

790
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,450
was his son-in-law?

791
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,480
Right?

792
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,280
We also didn't expect
Xiaoman to call the police directly.

793
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,680
This situation is messed up
all around now.

794
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,030
A cow's tail

795
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,800
can only cover one cow's ass.

796
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,140
We can't worry about everything.

797
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,070
Dealing with villagers is much harder
than archaeology.

798
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,530
That's absolutely right.

799
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,510
People who don't understand
our archaeological work

800
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,670
think we’re just old scholars.

801
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,110
But once they interact with us,
they'll find out

802
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,760
we’re also worldly people.

803
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,290
Dealing with villagers

804
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,000
means you have to study
human nature and social customs.

805
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,550
Sometimes, no matter how nicely you speak,

806
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,960
it’s better to treat others
as you want to be treated.

807
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,090
That’s a big lesson.

808
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,690
There’s a lot you still need to learn.

809
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,280
Lay the road on clear days,

810
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,010
don’t step in mud on rainy days.

811
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,820
I've learned a lot.

812
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,670
Wen Wen.

813
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,110
I'm very worried about you.

814
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,230
We’re both caught in the fire,

815
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,660
but people have to take responsibility.

816
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,320
Come back,

817
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,620
and we'll solve this together.

818
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,550
Wen Wen.

819
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,000
You're finally home.

820
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,980
I was worried sick.

821
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,880
You must have suffered a lot these days.

822
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,990
Don't worry.

823
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,760
Today, I

824
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,530
will definitely help you get revenge.

825
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,150
It's been so many days
since this happened.

826
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,570
Why hasn't there been
any movement from Mu Jianhui?

827
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,200
It's not good that there's no movement?

828
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,710
Recently, my heart

829
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,400
has been pounding every day.

830
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,680
I'm afraid Jianhui found out

831
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,840
and got even with us.

832
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,720
You didn't buy fake medicine, did you?

833
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,400
That can't be.

834
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:32,850
Who is it?

835
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,190
Coming.

836
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,380
Coming.

837
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,640
Who is it?

838
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,960
You rascal.

839
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,630
What's wrong?

840
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,360
Stand still.

841
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
Where do you think you’re running?

842
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,400
No, no, no.

843
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,590
I'll beat you to death today!

844
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,350
Stop hitting me. What are you doing?

845
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,310
Run!

846
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,280
-What’s wrong with you?
-What are you doing?

847
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,010
Stand still.

848
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,940
Don't move!

849
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,070
Jianhui, stop hitting him.

850
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,400
Why are you hitting me
without saying anything?

851
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,320
You know damn well what you've done.

852
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
I did this for you and my sister.

853
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,550
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done
such a disgusting thing.

854
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,810
For me and your sister?

855
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Look, my sister can't have children now.

856
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,150
The Mu family can’t be left
without descendants.

857
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,070
How will you and my sister
live the rest of your lives without kids?

858
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,870
Liu Shusheng.

859
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,100
Is this the first day I met you?

860
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,190
I know exactly what kind of
person you are.

861
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,510
The Gunner's business is booming.

862
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,920
He's taken over several big tombs.

863
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,110
You were jealous.

864
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,150
You were holding in your anger.

865
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,070
Coming up with such a despicable scheme.

866
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,270
Stirring up trouble.

867
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,150
You wanted to profit from it.

868
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,190
Heaven knows my heart!

869
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,450
I really don't have such bad intentions.

870
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,280
Look.

871
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,280
You asked me to watch over our company.

872
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,070
I've been staying there obediently.

873
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,800
I don't go anywhere else.

874
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
I'm there watching over it every day.

875
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,000
See how obedient I am?

876
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,050
Don't do that!

877
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,280
Y-You... Don't get excited.

878
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,510
Right.

879
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,070
Let me report to you

880
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,110
about the company’s recent situation.

881
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,840
Is that okay?

882
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,340
Our company...

883
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,690
Now, the project is progressing
very smoothly.

884
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,740
The workers are doing a great job.

885
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,800
I specifically instructed
the engineering department.

886
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,030
I said, for this project,

887
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,890
we absolutely can't cut corners.

888
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,450
We must ensure the safety of the project.

889
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,540
There's one more thing.

890
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,190
A company

891
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,320
came by recently

892
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,200
looking to build a hotel.

893
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,810
What was its name again?

894
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,480
Your slap just

895
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,630
made me forget everything.

896
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,590
Mingda Hotel.

897
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,000
Right, right, right.

898
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,160
How did you know?

899
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,330
You didn't send them, did you?

900
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,910
How many projects have you built

901
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,170
in the last six months?

902
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,160
In the past six months...

903
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,480
Three? Maybe four?

904
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,790
How many did you sign?

905
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,760
I signed...

906
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,800
Four or five?

907
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,150
You signed fifteen.

908
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,420
But you only actually built two.

909
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,110
As for the rest...

910
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,180
You'll never see them in Qinchuan
in your lifetime.

911
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,110
So

912
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,550
our construction company
is just for money laundering?

913
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,110
Shut up!

914
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,730
Do you know how much money
is in your account?

915
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:17,570
Well...

916
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,480
The accountant has always
been managing the accounts.

917
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,280
I haven't asked about it.

918
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,810
Forty-five million seven hundred thousand.

919
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,960
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

920
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,690
Who knew you were such a person?

921
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,820
Your head is full of mush.

922
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,440
I was wrong.

923
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,990
If you're not satisfied,

924
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,110
come on, slap me twice more.

925
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,730
It doesn't matter if I'm satisfied or not.

926
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,860
What about Wen Wen?

927
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,260
She's an unmarried woman.

928
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Gunner doesn't know about this yet.

929
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,150
If he finds out,

930
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,550
you won't even have a whole corpse left.

931
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,950
Liu Shusheng,

932
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,910
for the trouble you've caused,

933
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,240
go apologize to Wen Wen.

934
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,560
If she forgives you,
we can work something out.

935
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,290
If she doesn't forgive you,

936
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,970
none of us can go on living.

937
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,070
Wen Wen.

938
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,000
Wen Wen.

939
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,110
I know I was wrong.

940
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,360
I should never have

941
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,360
done such a conscienceless thing.

942
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,420
Please forgive me.

943
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,620
You've ruined my entire life.

944
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,790
Wen Wen, I know you're angry.

945
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,720
How can you feel better now?

946
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,230
Do whatever you want.

947
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,320
As long as it makes you
feel a little better,

948
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,880
you can do whatever you want.
