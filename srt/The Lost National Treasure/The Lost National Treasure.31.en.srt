[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,740
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,960
Captain Pang.

4
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,820
How's it going?

5
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,640
Captain Luo.

6
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,920
According to the results
from our radon detector,

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,850
there's no tomb.

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,850
There's no tomb?

9
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,400
Thank you for your hard work.

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Not at all. It's our duty.

11
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:06,990
Captain Luo.

12
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,560
Really?

13
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
We've finished the third
round of exploration.

14
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,670
We haven't found any cave entrance

15
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,730
or any structures.

16
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,110
Logically speaking,

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,160
even without those auxiliary
facilities for the mausoleum,

18
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,960
shouldn't there be some
traces of human activity?

19
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,950
But our probing shovels

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,400
have almost turned the
Phoenix Mountain into a sieve.

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,320
We still haven't found a single trace

22
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
of human intervention.

23
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:28,980
Look.

24
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,880
Can we draw a conclusion?

25
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,950
No.

26
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,829
Proving something and disproving something

27
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,170
both require rigorous evidence.

28
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,100
That's also what Mr. Zan taught us.

29
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
Ms. Luo.

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,550
With what you said,

31
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,200
now we still can't confidently say that

32
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,210
the Zi Mausoleum is not
on the Phoenix Mountain.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,550
Then... Then what's the point of

34
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,610
our three surveys?

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,010
We've conducted the surveys so thoroughly,

36
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,320
but it seems that we have no findings.

37
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,450
Having no findings is actually
a significant finding.

38
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,780
With our three surveys,

39
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,550
we've at least ruled out the possibility
of Zi Mausoleum being a cliff cave tomb.

40
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,880
However, we still haven't found

41
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,690
enough evidence

42
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,320
to completely refute Luo Tianxiang's

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,250
explanation in the
Classified Records of Chang'an.

44
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:16,770
Hello?

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,570
Luo Qing.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,480
I've found the stone slabs.

47
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:22,880
Really?

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,300
Where are they?

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,300
We've arrived.

50
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:35,880
Hurry!

51
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,090
Slow down!

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,600
Hurry! Here! Here!

53
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,370
Okay.

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,920
Do you want us to hurry up or slow down?

55
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,850
The stone slabs.

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,730
Alright.

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,690
Look.

58
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,700
This... This place is full of stone slabs.

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,970
There are some in the water, too.

60
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,250
Yes.

61
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,570
There are so many.

62
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,440
It matches.

63
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,010
What matches?

64
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,570
Luo Tianxiang wrote in the
Classified Records of Chang'an

65
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,600
that the Zi River burst open
the outer gate of Zi Mausoleum,

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,720
bringing over 500 stone slabs out there.

67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,250
Look. There are so many of them.

68
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,580
Kun probably means that

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,650
these stone slabs were
washed out by the Zi River.

70
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,990
And look, guys.

71
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,279
These stone slabs

72
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,050
are in different irregular shapes.

73
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,610
They don't seem to be man-made.

74
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,810
I agree with Mr. Guo.

75
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,020
Look.

76
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,690
River sand

77
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,640
and stones stuck together
to form this stone slab.

78
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,250
It looks like it was formed
from river impact.

79
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,910
Look, guys.

80
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,630
Some of these stone slabs are very solid,

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,640
like this one.

82
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,020
But some of them...

83
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,760
You can clearly see how loose it is.

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,440
It can be crumbled into sand.

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,500
So this definitely wasn't man-made.

86
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,840
But the outer gate of Zi Mausoleum

87
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,050
must be very regular

88
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,810
and must have traces of
human craftsmanship.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,080
The Stone Slab Valley

90
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,310
was all naturally formed.

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,610
It's not the outer gate of

92
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,060
the Zi Mausoleum at all.

93
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,880
Mr. Fang, you're confusing me.

94
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,660
You just said this matches
Luo Tianxiang's records.

95
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,960
But how come you're saying that it's not

96
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,690
the outer gate of Zi Mausoleum?

97
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,830
Did he see it with his own eyes?

98
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,960
Has he ever been here?

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,580
Well, as far as we know,

100
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,130
he probably has never been here.

101
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,010
So it was...

102
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,970
just hearsay, wasn't it?

103
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,080
I got it.

104
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,800
It's just like our blogs,

105
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,340
often reposting other people's content.

106
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,180
That comparison...

107
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,540
is good.

108
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,280
And look, guys.

109
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,810
This entire Stone Slab Valley is
very close to Dou Mausoleum.

110
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,610
It means that

111
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,010
if the Zi River floods

112
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,810
and washes all the stone slabs
down from the valley,

113
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,960
the people downstream might
naturally assume that

114
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,400
they're from the Zi Mausoleum.

115
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,460
That's possible.

116
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,050
So how do we prove that Luo Tianxiang

117
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,780
didn't see it with his own eyes?

118
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,490
When did...

119
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,700
Luo Tianxiang record that the stone slabs

120
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,660
were washed out?

121
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,450
In the autumn of
the Xinmao Year of Zhiyuan.

122
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,220
Luo Tianxiang was from the Yuan Dynasty.

123
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,010
Zhiyuan was the era name of
Emperor Shizu of Yuan.

124
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,640
Xinmao was the 28th year of Zhiyuan.

125
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,440
So with my calculation, it should be

126
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,080
AD 1291.

127
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:26,950
Guo.

128
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,010
Take a look at this.

129
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,690
It's from the History of Yuan.

130
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,200
In the autumn of 1291,

131
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,770
the climate was unusual.

132
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
There were many floods in the north.

133
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,810
I speculate the local village officials
reported the disaster situation

134
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,870
to their superiors

135
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,010
and also mentioned this incident.

136
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,920
That's why they used the local
dialect term "bring out" and so on.

137
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,130
If we analyze it this way,

138
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,320
Mr. Luo

139
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,090
probably didn't visit the site in person.

140
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,300
Instead, he read some local documents

141
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,610
and saw this record.

142
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,270
Then he copied it verbatim

143
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,400
and used it as

144
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,840
the important evidence that Zi Mausoleum
was on the Phoenix Mountain.

145
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,640
By the Ming and Qing Dynasties,

146
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,260
it was even harder to find
the location of Zi Mausoleum.

147
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,140
So everyone just continued to use

148
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,680
Luo Tianxiang's record.

149
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,410
So...

150
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,640
That makes perfect sense now, doesn't it?

151
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,280
The officials sent by the emperor
to worship at Zi Mausoleum

152
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,170
wouldn't verify the facts, either.

153
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,010
Even our epigraphist, Bi Yuan,

154
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,010
was also misled.

155
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,250
He erected a stone tablet at the foot
of Phoenix Mountain.

156
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,250
This mistake was perpetuated
dynasty after dynasty.

157
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,230
It makes sense.

158
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,940
It makes sense now.

159
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,960
We've already completed
the third exploration.

160
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,130
We didn't find anything.

161
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,790
Now with Fang Kun's evidence,

162
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,170
we can completely overturn the theory that

163
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,570
the Zi Mausoleum is on Phoenix Mountain.

164
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:43,970
Right?

165
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,190
Mr. Qin.

166
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,320
Recently, the Mingde Museum

167
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,960
has been embroiled in a controversy
over counterfeit artifacts.

168
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,420
Have you heard about that?

169
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,370
Of course I have heard about it.

170
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,370
I've been paying close
attention to the trend

171
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,640
of Qinchuan's collection circle.

172
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,690
Some experts have pointed out that

173
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,760
the exhibits in the Mingde Museum

174
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,170
have reached a ridiculous
level of counterfeiting.

175
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,760
Among them, there's a Song Dynasty ceramic

176
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,010
that has been criticized
for greatly exceeding

177
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,640
the lower limits of
Song Dynasty's aesthetics.

178
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,400
Why do you think such counterfeits

179
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,730
could appear so brazenly in the museum?

180
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:16,520
As for this matter,

181
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,930
you should ask the museum's
management staff.

182
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,330
They put those artifacts

183
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,880
on the museum shelves.

184
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,050
Do they not understand artifact appraisal,

185
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,180
or do they not know what a museum is for?

186
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,590
Dear board members...

187
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,210
Mingde Museum

188
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,159
is facing a reputational crisis this time.

189
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,850
As the director,

190
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,440
I can't absolve myself of the blame.

191
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,130
I now announce to you all that

192
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,680
I have decided

193
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,480
to resign from my position as director.

194
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,400
All the work

195
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,400
will be carried out

196
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,140
by the board of directors.

197
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,450
Zhao!

198
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,470
Youlin!

199
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,660
You...

200
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,330
What's going on?

201
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,340
Guang.

202
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,580
Did I wake you up?

203
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,450
No, bro.

204
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,430
You must be hungry.

205
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,180
Come on. Eat something.

206
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,140
It's still warm.

207
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,130
Guang.

208
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,850
Today,

209
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,650
let's have another drink together.

210
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,390
You can drink water instead of alcohol.

211
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,340
If I'm drunk, I'll just sleep here.

212
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,800
Do you think it's okay?

213
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,020
Of course it's okay.

214
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,160
Is there something to celebrate today?

215
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,490
Why do you want to drink?

216
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,790
I've taken revenge for you.

217
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,300
Isn't that something we should celebrate?

218
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,340
Xiao is half dead.

219
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,090
Whether he can survive or not
depends on his luck now.

220
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,150
As for Zhao Youlin,

221
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,130
he's already resigned from
his position as the director

222
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,130
of Mingde Museum.

223
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,130
Is what you did

224
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,610
a bit too ruthless?

225
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,330
From the moment I decided to
steal the goods from Yin Village,

226
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,260
all of this was destined to happen.

227
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,090
Two tigers cannot share the same mountain.

228
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,130
To stand in the spotlight openly,

229
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,090
Zhao Youlin and I were
bound to have a showdown.

230
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,680
You said what I did was too ruthless.

231
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,860
Actually, it wasn't ruthless.

232
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,850
Zhao Youlin

233
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
has only ruined his own reputation.

234
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,970
At worst, he'll lay low for a few years.

235
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,010
When the situation isn't intense anymore,

236
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,450
he can

237
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,990
still continue to make money.

238
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,520
If I had really wanted to
destroy him completely,

239
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,180
he wouldn't be able to
stay in Qinchuan anymore.

240
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,190
The big ship behind him
would have sunk, too.

241
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,090
I've left him a way out,

242
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,410
and I've also left him a bow.

243
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,920
That bow

244
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,680
is under his bed.

245
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,300
No matter how much he hates me,

246
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,340
he won't dare to make trouble.

247
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
Because he's afraid.

248
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,190
He's afraid of that bow under his bed,

249
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,920
not knowing when a hidden
arrow might be shot

250
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,720
to stop him from making trouble.

251
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,590
[The Tomb of My Beloved
Husband, Mr. Zan Maochang]

252
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,010
Zan Maochang.

253
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,260
The kids are here to see you.

254
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,270
Let me tell you some good news.

255
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,490
After three surveys, the kids

256
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,460
have confirmed that there are no
ancient tombs on the Phoenix Mountain.

257
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,940
It was a complete misinterpretation that

258
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,730
the Zi Mausoleum was on
the Phoenix Mountain.

259
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,920
Mr. Zan.

260
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,980
You told us...

261
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,370
to never

262
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,400
make assumptions

263
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,450
and never

264
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,740
jump to conclusions.

265
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,870
We haven't forgotten all the things

266
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:29,900
that you told us.

267
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,460
We remember them all.

268
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,280
Next,

269
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
they're about to

270
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,410
start excavating the looted areas.

271
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,990
The institute is very supportive

272
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,660
and has even approved funds for it.

273
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,080
Zan Maochang,

274
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,460
let's cheer them on

275
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,160
together.

276
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,260
Let's wish them

277
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,850
a smooth process.

278
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,680
Okay?

279
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,400
Why are there so many people there?

280
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,530
Are they going to cause trouble again?

281
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,370
That can't be.

282
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,060
Didn't we discuss this before?

283
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,210
Let's take a look.

284
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,400
Let's take a look.

285
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,800
Right.

286
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Step aside.

287
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,250
Step aside.

288
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,610
Am I good or is my grandpa good?

289
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,880
Am I good or is my grandpa good?

290
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,010
That's just my fate.

291
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,420
The Chief should act like a Chief.

292
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,690
He's here.

293
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,660
He's here. Kun is here.

294
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:35,610
Uncle.

295
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,490
Kun.

296
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,090
W-What's going on here?

297
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,120
Aren't you about to start the excavation?

298
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,780
Before the excavation,

299
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,010
I need to inform

300
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,650
our ancestors first.

301
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,330
Youliang has done well this time.

302
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,010
He prepared all these things.

303
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,560
Well, this is a surprise.

304
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,330
Using a cloth wrapper as a towel.

305
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,550
He's being very generous.

306
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

307
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,260
Is this appropriate?

308
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,160
What's not appropriate about it?

309
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,640
No matter who are buried down there,

310
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,970
they're all ancestors of our Yin Village.

311
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,260
Since the discovery

312
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,680
of the black pottery figurine looting pit,

313
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,160
it has been

314
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
several years by now.

315
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,730
You've all grown from greenhands

316
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,330
into experienced experts.

317
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,680
At first, the people in our village

318
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,370
couldn't get along with
your archaeological team.

319
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,640
There were constant conflicts.

320
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,610
But now,

321
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,550
we've all stuck together.

322
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,490
We're like a family now.

323
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:26,500
However,

324
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:27,980
to be honest,

325
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,130
I still don't understand

326
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,710
what this archaeology

327
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,160
is all about.

328
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,280
The archaeological team

329
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,090
has lived at your place for so long.

330
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,730
But how come you haven't gotten

331
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,330
even a bit of their scholarly air?

332
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:38,970
What nonsense are you talking about?

333
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,250
It's none of your business.
So you understand?

334
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:40,650
Say it.

335
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,010
I...

336
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:41,850
Say it.

337
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,370
I... I'll let Kun say it.

338
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,250
I can't explain it clearly, either.

339
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,310
Kun can explain it.

340
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,510
Be careful.

341
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,380
Probe into the Earth
to reconstruct history.

342
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,090
Oh, my goodness.

343
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:53,450
What?

344
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,130
That's even more incomprehensible.

345
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,530
He's finished speaking?

346
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:56,980
Alright.

347
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,450
No matter what it is,

348
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,250
now I know that

349
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,880
your archaeological team

350
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,540
is doing something important

351
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,810
and something good.

352
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,560
So,

353
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,280
on behalf of all the villagers

354
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,340
in our Yin Village,

355
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,260
I'll fully support you all.

356
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:09,730
Okay?

357
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,210
Okay!

358
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,330
Here's the thing.

359
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,730
Let me also express my stance

360
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,610
on behalf of our archaeological team.

361
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,920
To finish the archaeological excavation,

362
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,330
we're in great need of manpower.

363
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,850
As long as you're willing to join us,

364
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,730
you're welcome anytime.

365
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,160
We absolutely won't
let you work for nothing.

366
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
Good!

367
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,850
Meatball spicy soup.

368
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,640
Come on!

369
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,730
Please sit down.

370
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,530
We've been investigating for so long,

371
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,160
but we still haven't found
any trace of King Hua.

372
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,960
In my opinion,

373
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,330
there must be something
wrong with this portrait.

374
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,190
Different people have different
impressions of King Hua.

375
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,920
Then how can we investigate it?

376
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,860
I didn't expect that

377
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,980
Xingfu Village would be so impressive.

378
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,240
Look. This one village has over 100 inns.

379
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,680
This is the largest
urban village in Qinchuan.

380
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,920
It'll be troublesome if we investigate it.

381
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,780
Officer Zhang.

382
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,020
I've finally found you, a busy man.

383
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,130
How's it going with my medical cost?

384
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,210
But you have to give me a useful clue.

385
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,390
He's a southerner.

386
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,170
A southerner?

387
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,130
There are so many southerners around.

388
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,370
How am I supposed to investigate that?

389
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:19,900
Besides,

390
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,370
it's been such a long time.

391
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,730
That person has probably left Qinchuan.

392
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,490
How am I supposed to handle this?

393
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,800
I let him stay here for free.

394
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,050
When he got beaten up,
I took him to the hospital.

395
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,250
I just can't bear
the medical cost for him.

396
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,370
Otherwise, I'll suffer big losses.

397
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,900
So what do you think I can do?

398
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,210
I told you gyus to install that
identity registration system.

399
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,220
You didn't install it.

400
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,250
That guest's name was all fake.

401
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,380
How am I supposed to handle this?

402
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,490
Sir.

403
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,310
Take a look at this.

404
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,310
Is it this person?

405
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,260
It looks a bit like him.

406
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,800
It's this guy. It's him.

407
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,180
When did he run away?

408
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,730
In March.

409
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,770
That was not long after
the accident occurred in Yin Village.

410
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,720
Hello, Captain Qi.

411
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:10,540
We got a clue.

412
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,730
Captain Qi, Captain Yang.

413
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,079
This is

414
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,810
the photo of that beaten traveler,

415
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,540
and we got it from the hospital.

416
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,450
It looks a bit similar to him.

417
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,170
That's right.

418
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,770
This person is very strange.

419
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,560
He got beaten up but he didn't
dare to report it to the police.

420
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,730
Nor did he go to the hospital.

421
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,260
He almost died in the hotel.

422
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,650
The hotel owner found him
and sent him to the hospital.

423
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,180
However,

424
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,560
he ran away as soon as
he got to the hospital.

425
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,760
That's a bit strange.

426
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,840
Liang said after they unloaded the goods,

427
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,760
King Hua didn't arrive on time.

428
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,290
He must have been beaten up.

429
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,790
We can't rule out that possibility.

430
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,080
What else did the hotel owner say?

431
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,730
He said he didn't have
much contact with that man

432
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,150
and couldn't tell what accent he had.

433
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,040
He also didn't know

434
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,400
which part of the south he was from.

435
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,930
But he mentioned one thing.

436
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,660
He often brought a
prostitute back at night.

437
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,980
Was it the same prostitute?

438
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,070
Sometimes he brought others,

439
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,270
but there was one he brought most often.

440
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,730
Check the surrounding KTV bars

441
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,970
and nightclubs.

442
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,020
Captain Qi,

443
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,080
you don't know how big that area is.

444
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,810
I don't care.

445
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,360
I only care about results.

446
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,170
Do I have to think about everything?

447
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,360
Figure out a solution yourself.

448
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,730
Du, use your brain.

449
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,490
Go ask the hotel owner

450
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,340
if he collected any lighters.

451
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,170
Those lighters usually have

452
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,600
club names and phone
numbers printed on them.

453
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,210
You can just investigate based on that.

454
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,070
Yongfu is still the smartest one.

455
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,450
Yongfu, you're quite experienced.

456
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,450
Captain Yang, don't say that.

457
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,490
Yongfu.

458
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,970
Let's go to the detention center.

459
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,280
Let's go.

460
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,810
Alright.

461
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,960
Do you recognize him?

462
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,790
Isn't that King Hua?

463
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,840
Open your eyes

464
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,940
and look carefully.

465
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,140
Don't talk nonsense.

466
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,520
It's definitely him.

467
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,330
I'm sure.

468
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,690
After all these years, King Hua
has finally shown up.

469
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:12,980
Go ahead.

470
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,130
Okay.

471
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,060
Okay.

472
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,700
I got it.

473
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,220
Captain Qi.

474
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,170
Du has found

475
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,970
the woman connected to King Hua.

476
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,380
She has been brought back to the station.

477
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,360
Your name.

478
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,490
Lulu.

479
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,350
Your real name.

480
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,280
Li Yanhua.

481
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,030
Take a look at this.

482
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,740
Do you recognize this person?

483
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,520
What crime did he commit?

484
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,790
I'm asking if you recognize him.

485
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,320
Why are you talking so much?

486
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,290
Yes, I do.

487
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,880
Then give me a brief
description of this person.

488
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,930
What's his full name? Where's he from?

489
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,490
Jim.

490
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,080
What?

491
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,180
What Jim?

492
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,400
I'm asking you for his real name.

493
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,710
I really don't know his real name.

494
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,080
I only know he has a Guyue accent.

495
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,850
Is the crime he committed

496
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,060
related to antiques?

497
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,010
What do you mean?

498
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,470
I heard him talk about that
on the phone once.

499
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,560
He seems to be an antique dealer.

500
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,130
Go ahead.

501
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,650
That's all I know.

502
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,810
How much could I really know?

503
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,850
Try to recall a bit more.

504
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,360
What are his hobbies?

505
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Playing mahjong,

506
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,410
spending money, shopping
or things like that?

507
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,170
He's very stingy.

508
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,560
There were a few times
when we woke up late.

509
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,160
He took me out for breakfast.

510
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,150
He always took me to have clay pot soup
at the restaurant near the inn.

511
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,540
I've never seen anyone from Guyue

512
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,280
who loves clay pot soup so much.

513
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,040
Wait.

514
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,450
Are you talking about

515
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,490
the clay pot soup from Jiangyou?

516
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,450
Yes.

517
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,600
Well, this time,

518
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,080
we finally got a clue about King Hua.

519
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,570
Right?

520
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,840
We've confirmed his appearance,

521
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,120
but we haven't figured out other details.

522
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,360
We still need cooperation
from the Guyue police.

523
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,730
No.

524
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,710
It's the Jiangyou police.

525
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,860
What do you mean?

526
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:28,940
That guy

527
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
is more cunning than we thought.

528
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,450
I suspect that

529
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,800
he pretended to have a Guyue accent.

530
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,250
It's easy to pretend to have an accent.

531
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,840
But it's hard to fake his
preferences for food.

532
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,100
He loves clay pot soup,

533
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,460
so he's probably from Jiangyou.

534
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,450
Yongfu.

535
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Send the surveillance
screenshots from the hospital

536
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,410
to the Jiangyou police.

537
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,600
Ask them to assist in the investigation.

538
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,040
Okay. I'll send them later.

539
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,560
Du.

540
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,870
Come with me to the prison.

541
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,890
We're going to see an old friend.

542
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,890
Which old friend?

543
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,520
You'll know when you see him.

544
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,800
Captain Qi, you're so smart.

545
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,520
You always have so many ideas.

546
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,780
Even with someone as tough as Yan Xiaowu,

547
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
you managed to make a breakthrough.

548
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,510
Let me tell you.

549
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,750
He's been voluntarily
participating in labor work recently.

550
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,450
He especially loves growing tomatoes.

551
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,980
The tomatoes he has planted

552
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,730
are looked after more carefully
than those in his own garden.

553
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,210
The fruits that have been yielded

554
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,210
are big and juicy.

555
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,690
Let's go, Captain Qi.

556
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,420
I've brought him here for you.

557
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,450
He'll arrive soon.
I'll get back to work now.

558
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:42,980
Alright.

559
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,280
Alright. Go ahead with your work.

560
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,810
Alright.

561
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,340
Captain Qi, you're here.

562
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,380
Xiaowu, your complexion looks good.

563
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,560
It's even better than mine.

564
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,690
Not at all.

565
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,230
I'm here to ask for your help today.

566
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,210
Take a look.

567
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,910
Which one of them is King Hua?

568
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,210
King Hua?

569
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,490
What's wrong?

570
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,030
Are you afraid of him being
arrested or hoping for it?

571
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,840
Of course I hope he'll be arrested.

572
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,100
Do you even need to ask?

573
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,780
Is that so?

574
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,320
No.

575
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:49,560
No.

576
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,970
It might be

577
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,270
this one.

578
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,970
Are you sure?

579
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,840
What's wrong?

580
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,410
Why is it so difficult to
identify someone?

581
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,930
It's been such a long time.

582
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,390
I can't remember clearly.

583
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,360
Is it because you can't remember clearly

584
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,040
or you can't recognize him at all?

585
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,010
What do you mean?

586
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,730
I said I can't remember clearly.

587
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,330
You know exactly what I mean.

588
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,120
Back then, who sold

589
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,010
the black pottery figurines to King Hua?

590
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,280
I've already told you.

591
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,250
It was me.

592
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,890
If someone else had sold them,
would I be in prison now?

593
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,690
You... You're just so stubborn.

594
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,120
Xiaowu.

595
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,120
I've heard you'll be released soon.

596
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,120
Yes.

597
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,500
Good. Good. That's great.

598
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,140
That's so great.

599
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,740
I've always felt that
for someone like you,

600
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,520
although

601
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,040
you've wasted some of your youth,

602
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,760
as long as

603
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,840
you want it, no matter when it is,

604
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,400
you can definitely make an achievement.

605
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,590
Captain Qi.

606
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,250
Don't try to compliment me.

607
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,840
I'm quite clear about

608
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,520
what kind of person I am.

609
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,790
It's good that you're clear about it.

610
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,790
Keep that in mind.

611
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,690
Just always be clear

612
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,530
about that in your mind.

613
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,010
What's perjury?

614
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,440
You've learned about it in prison, huh?

615
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,670
Captain Qi.

616
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,410
I'm telling the truth.

617
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,390
It's been such a long time.

618
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,390
I can't remember clearly.

619
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,640
It's alright.

620
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,580
It's normal not to remember clearly.

621
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,470
Think about it slowly.

622
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,320
You'll remember eventually.

623
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,280
I'm fine.

624
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,610
I just came by to see you.

625
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,630
I heard you had been
behaving well in prison.

626
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,690
I'm happy for you.

627
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,750
I have to reform myself through labor.

628
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,210
Bao...

629
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,240
loves tomatoes the most.

630
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,760
I think he loves the ones
you grew even more.

631
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,410
Go pick some.

632
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,240
I'll take them to him.

633
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:32,730
Okay.

634
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:40,650
Bao.

635
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,650
Sir, what's the matter?

636
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,250
Come here.

637
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,770
A man asked me to give them to you.

638
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:45,820
Okay.

639
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,920
Thank you.

640
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,500
[Your dad planted them
for you personally.]

641
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,850
[Qinchuan No.2 Junior High School]

642
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:00,830
Captain Qi.

643
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,230
Why do you care so much about
someone like Yan Xiaowu?

644
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,620
You'll understand
when you become a father.

645
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,090
Everyone,

646
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,490
I want to emphasize this again.

647
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,590
Whether you're a technician
or one of our cadres,

648
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,110
you must strictly maintain
detailed excavation records.

649
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,040
Wang Wei, Zifei,

650
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,040
please tell them again about the tasks

651
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,210
I assigned yesterday.

652
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,700
I'm responsible for written records,

653
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,220
including the site diary,

654
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,560
the trench diary, excavation record forms

655
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,250
and the overall records
of ancient remains,

656
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,410
as well as their serial numbers

657
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,470
and the archiving work of other data.

658
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,320
I'm in charge of visual documentation,

659
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,480
focusing on recording various
archaeological phenomena

660
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
and the excavation process.

661
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,080
Have you two been involved
in artifact extraction before?

662
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,600
No.

663
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,210
Well, this is a great opportunity.

664
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,490
Learn well from Mr. Lu.

665
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,840
He's an expert in this field.

666
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,370
Alright.

667
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,080
I only knew Mr. Lu was good
at digging with a shovel.

668
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,230
I didn't expect him to be also
skilled at artifact extraction.

669
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,270
Well, Mr. Lu is a

670
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,120
top elite among the archaeological
technicians in Qinzhou Province.

671
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,840
Do you know what other nickname he has?

672
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,440
What is it?

673
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,770
Academician Lu.

674
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,720
What Academician Lu?

675
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,650
I'm flattered.

676
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,690
Without the excavation
plans from you cadres,

677
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,840
we wouldn't know which part
we should work on.

678
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,760
During the previous excavation
at Yang Mausoleum,

679
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,970
whenever special ancient remains appeared,

680
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,280
we still had to rely on you cadres.

681
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,410
Don't be so modest.

682
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,730
I'm not complimenting you

683
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,840
for no reason.

684
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,850
This time,

685
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,360
you need to train Jiang He and Mao well.

686
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,040
The excavation plan is crucial.

687
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,360
You guys need to shoulder
half the responsibility.

688
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,760
Okay.

689
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,210
Okay.

690
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,010
Academician Lu, you need to
train me well, too.

691
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,650
I also want to shoulder
half the responsibility.

692
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,180
Xiaoman.

693
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,710
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

694
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,930
It's difficult enough to just master

695
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,460
the probing shovel skills.

696
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,380
Remember this.

697
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,170
It's better to excel in one field

698
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,830
than to be a jack of all trades.

699
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,150
Let's get to work then.

700
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,600
Okay!

701
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,250
Stay safe.

702
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,890
Alright.

703
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,040
Why are you sitting here?

704
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,640
What are you thinking about?

705
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,230
I'm thinking about

706
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,450
what could be improved
in our previous plan

707
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,540
and what unexpected situations
might arise in the future.

708
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,840
When I was working on
the Lv Family Tomb before,

709
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,900
I was just like you.

710
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,360
Every day, I would replay it in my mind

711
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,600
again and again.

712
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,210
I really wanted

713
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,990
every single artifact

714
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,760
to be extracted intact.

715
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,890
When I just sat down here,

716
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,490
I suddenly thought of some words.

717
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,080
Just tell me.

718
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,780
At the excavation site,

719
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,040
sitting by the excavation pit,

720
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,680
I feel as if history had
become transparent.

721
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,970
It's as if you could see

722
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,170
how these pottery figurines were made,

723
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,520
how they were buried

724
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,320
and how they were covered by soil.

725
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,420
Just like the Yellow River,

726
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,560
it has been flowing from

727
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,270
the Bayan Har Mountains to us gradually.

728
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,300
The flow of civilization.

729
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,390
The flow of civilization.

730
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,090
There are so many people.

731
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,690
Alright.

732
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,810
What are you thinking about?

733
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,360
Don't always sit here
now that you've just recovered.

734
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,890
Let me help you up for a walk.

735
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,640
Stop treating me like a patient.

736
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,890
I'm quite agile now. Look.

737
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,690
Be careful.

738
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,470
I've entrusted you with
the important task of drawing.

739
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,650
Han Mausoleum Archaeological Team,

740
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,450
Draftsman No. 003, Fang Kun.

741
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,030
I promise to punctually complete the task
assigned by Captain Luo.

742
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,800
Du!

743
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,450
Yongfu!

744
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,610
Yongfu!

745
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,320
Where are my boys?

746
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,400
What? You don't know?

747
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,480
What am I supposed to know?

748
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,930
Your old classmate, Wu... Wu Zhenchuan.

749
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,730
Wu Zhenchuan?

750
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,510
He transferred your boys away.

751
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,030
He said he was in Qinchuan

752
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,100
to handle a case.

753
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,450
He wanted Yongfu
and the others to help him.

754
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,910
He transferred them away?

755
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,330
He implied that he had informed you.

756
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,630
He didn't inform me at all.

757
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,140
No?

758
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,440
What case is it?

759
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,510
A brawl case. Yeah.

760
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,650
The suspect is called Haozi.

761
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,490
He's so bold.

762
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,970
How dare he transfer my
people without permission?

763
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,970
Just ask about it.

764
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,000
Captain Qi.

765
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,860
I'm working on a case
outside with Chief Wu.

766
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,990
Chief Wu asked for help.
Whose orders are you following?

767
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,960
He thinks he can just
transfer people as he likes?

768
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,370
What's wrong with you?

769
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,940
I'll get even with you guys
when you come back.

770
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,150
Send me the location.

771
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,740
This is outrageous!

772
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,530
Aren't you old classmates?

773
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,790
Chief Wu.

774
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,270
It must be that car that just passed by.

775
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,340
The car is facing us.

776
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,340
But that person is wearing sunglasses,
so we can't see his face clearly.

777
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,910
Yongfu, Du, go inside with me.

778
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,900
Liu Gang and Jia should stay outside.

779
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,630
Just in case.

780
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,800
Action!

781
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,260
Haozi.

782
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:30,820
What?

783
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,370
We're policemen.

784
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,590
Stop right there!

785
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,030
Jia, chase him from the back door.

786
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,050
Qi Dacang.

787
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,840
Why are you here to interfere?

788
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,010
How dare you say that?

789
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,710
It's not like my suspect is running away.

790
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,670
Wait a moment.

791
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,700
Haozi.

792
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,780
What crime did you commit this time?

793
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,310
I didn't do anything wrong.

794
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,540
I don't know what's going on.

795
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,780
You brawled with others.

796
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,820
Liu Gang, take him away.

797
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,050
Go!

798
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,960
Captain Qi.

799
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,370
I swear that I didn't brawl with others.

800
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,140
With my small figure, how could I brawl?

801
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,380
With one kick, I'd be like a broken egg.

802
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,780
If you hadn't committed a crime,
they would't try to arrest you.

803
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,900
Just tell me the truth.

804
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,500
Qi Dacang.

805
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,780
What are you doing?

806
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,380
Setting up a court on the street?
Take him away.

807
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,510
What does this mean?

808
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,140
Is there anything you can't let me know?

809
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,050
Qi, my dear friend,

810
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,350
please uphold justice for me this time.

811
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,740
I'm the one who got beaten up.

812
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,010
If I hadn't run fast enough,

813
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,780
those Hedong people would
have beaten me to death.

814
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,700
What Hedong people?

815
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,160
Hedong?

816
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,010
-Stop talking.
-What happened?

817
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,570
Talk about it after we
go back to the police station.

818
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:16,940
Take him away.

819
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,210
Wait! Wait!

820
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,190
Jia.

821
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,610
Put him in our car.

822
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,030
Yes!

823
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,900
What are you doing?

824
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,300
I have my reasons for saying this.

825
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,690
Come here.

826
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,580
Do you have a warrant?

827
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,900
You're too bold.

828
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,570
How dare you arrest him without a warrant?

829
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,650
Do you believe that I'll
report you to your superior?

830
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,850
Yes, I have a warrant.

831
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,090
Why are you being like this?

832
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,580
[Summoning Warrant of Qingyuan County
Public Security Bureau of Qinchuan City]

833
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,160
Explain this to him.

834
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,130
What's the difference between a summoning
warrant and an arrest warrant?

835
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,220
Shall... Shall I really explain it?

836
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,820
Of course.

837
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,380
Yes!

838
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,890
The two documents have different
levels of enforcement.

839
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,230
A summoning warrant is
equivalent to a notification.

840
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,820
It doesn't have the same
level of enforcement.

841
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,020
-But...
-Yes. I know it better than you.

842
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,650
What are you trying to do?

843
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,380
Cut the crap.

844
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,780
I'll take him to my place.

845
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,340
Take him away.

846
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:13,720
Yes!

847
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,230
What about you two? Are you
going to keep making mistakes?

848
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,430
Come back to our team.

849
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,310
Let me tell you.

850
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,360
This doesn't conform to proper procedures.

851
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,230
You're not handling this case seriously.

852
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,700
You have to come with me, too.

853
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,160
Come on.

854
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,610
I shouldn't have used
your people. Let me tell you.

855
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,180
How come I have such a classmate? Gosh.

856
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,730
Come on.

857
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,510
Come on. Eat.

858
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:41,980
Liu Gang.

859
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:42,630
Eat.

860
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,820
I bought the food with my own money.

861
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,610
Don't be afraid.

862
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,670
Just eat.

863
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
I didn't... didn't put poison in it.

864
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,340
Gosh.

865
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,380
Eat.

866
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,200
Come on.

867
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,510
Just eat. It's free after all.

868
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,410
That's right.

869
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,840
Come on.

870
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,300
It's a bit too salty.

871
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,860
Let me tell you.

872
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,740
Our people are working on
the arrest warrant.

873
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,050
Once it's done, I'll take him away.

874
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,370
Don't rush.

875
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,380
Look carefully.

876
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,560
The food

877
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,820
has already been eaten.

878
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,460
That makes things easier.

879
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,690
Have you ever heard a saying?

880
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,640
A famous saying.

881
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,680
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

882
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,900
It's too late.

883
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,150
Tell me honestly.

884
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,490
What's wrong with Haozi?

885
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,520
I've told you he brawled
with others, haven't I?

886
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,470
Who are you trying to fool?

887
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,560
What about the Hedong people?

888
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,610
The Hedong people were the ones
whom he brawled with.

889
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,620
By the time I arrived at the scene,
they had already fled.

890
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,420
Only some spelunking and
tomb-raiding tools were left at the scene.

891
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,870
Your attitude is good.

892
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,810
Continue with your confession.

893
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,030
Before we came, Chief Wu told us

894
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,360
not to leak any information to Captain Qi.

895
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,590
You guys have handled
many cultural relic cases.

896
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,450
You might snatch our clues again.

897
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,610
I'm wary of you.

898
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,290
That's because you always
take away my clues.

899
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,610
Let me tell you.

900
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,640
This is a trap.

901
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,650
The food isn't even good.

902
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,960
Since we're being honest,

903
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,050
I'll explain the situation to you briefly.

904
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,450
Right?

905
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,450
That's right.

906
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,110
We suspect that

907
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,250
this brawl happened

908
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,250
between tomb raiders who
scrambled for a looting pit.

909
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,020
Based on the tire tracks at the scene,

910
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,420
we got surveillance videos
of the highway exits

911
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,090
and identified a suspicious vehicle

912
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,460
which had frequently traveled
between Qingyuan County and Qinchuan.

913
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,060
Moreover,

914
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,690
he exited the highway
late at night every time.

915
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,820
This is consistent with the behavior
patterns of tomb raiders.

916
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,300
Additionally,

917
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,500
the time of his last highway exit

918
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,610
matches the time of the brawl.

919
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,020
We looked into the vehicle owner.

920
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,460
The owner's name is Zhang Minghao.

921
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,720
His nickname is Haozi.

922
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,940
I've told you everything.

923
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,200
I'll take him away after I finish eating.

924
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,510
That's more like it.

925
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,690
However,

926
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,190
those are not all the details.

927
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,670
Tell me more about the Hedong people.

928
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,360
Here we go again. How come
you're still not done yet?

929
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,860
Has he robbed any tombs?

930
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,890
No, he hasn't.

931
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,820
No?

932
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,020
He tried to snatch the looting pit.

933
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,480
Why didn't he rob the tomb?

934
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,410
It must be because he knew
the police were alerted.

935
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,390
Then he didn't dare to rob the tomb.

936
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,730
Is it possible that

937
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,420
before the Hedong people

938
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,120
had the chance to do it,

939
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,990
they were arrested?

940
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,020
That's impossible.

941
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,220
We haven't found the Hedong people yet.

942
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,180
What do you mean?

943
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,090
The Hedong people are in your place?

944
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,220
I wouldn't say that.

945
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,490
But we do have a detainee from Hedong.

946
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,300
He's also injured.

947
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,390
Only after we interrogate
Haozi can we figure it out.

948
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,090
Qi Dacang, oh, Qi Dacang.

949
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,720
I knew you were holding something back.

950
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,860
Think about the overall picture.

951
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,900
What do you mean by
taking away your clues?

952
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,250
This is for our mutual benefit.

953
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,450
What mutual benefit?

954
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,740
It's been a a long time since we last
worked on a case together, huh?

955
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,340
Later,

956
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,050
let's cooperate.

957
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Qi, my dear buddy.

958
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,420
I'm not your buddy.

959
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,120
Captain Qi.

960
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,300
I'm innocent. I'm a victim
of false accusation.

961
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,300
You're innocent?

962
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,940
Back then,

963
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,130
what did I tell you when I
sent you to prison?

964
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,020
You robbed a tomb again?

965
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,400
I really didn't rob any tombs.

966
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,170
There were probing rods
and Luoyang shovels

967
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,090
in the fields of Chengguan Village,
Qingyuan County.

968
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,420
What were they used for?

969
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,150
For farming?

970
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:12,980
These past few times,

971
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,340
why did you drive to Qingyuan County
in the middle of the night?

972
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,270
For a night tour?

973
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,460
I admit that I went to Qingyuan.

974
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,970
But I didn't rob any tombs.

975
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,240
I always remember that you told me

976
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,100
not to go back to my old ways.

977
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,250
This time I just worked as
a driver and a lookout.

978
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,610
A driver and a lookout?

979
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,010
You're not a tomb raider?

980
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,170
Are you really foolish

981
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,100
or playing dumb?

982
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:41,820
Haozi,

983
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,760
not knowing the law doesn't
mean that you can break the law.

984
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,710
We're giving you a chance now.

985
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,340
Have a proper attitude,

986
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,300
confess voluntarily

987
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,630
and plead for leniency.

988
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,820
If you try to deny it and play tricks,

989
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,500
then you'll be sentenced with no leniency.
