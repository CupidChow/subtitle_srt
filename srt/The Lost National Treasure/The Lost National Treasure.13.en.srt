[Episode 13]

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,630
When that guy came to see me last time,

4
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,590
he just wanted that batch
of ceramics.

5
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,979
But he didn't know where the pit was,

6
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,180
so he tried to get information out of me.

7
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,210
That guy is quite cunning.

8
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,340
So, are we going to dig this pit or not?

9
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,030
Of course we're going to dig it.

10
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,830
And we're going to dig it deeply.

11
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,460
Digging the pit isn't really a problem.

12
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,259
But right now, we're still facing

13
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,370
a tricky issue.

14
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,060
Xing Zhaohu has quit, hasn't he?

15
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,260
We're really short-handed now.

00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,350
Sheng.

17
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,070
A couple of days ago,

18
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,540
I had a drink with some friends
from the underworld.

19
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,740
They said some guys from Hedong
had come to our territory.

20
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,490
How about I ask them to join us?

21
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,290
Your big head is quite useful.

22
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,510
Contact them now.

23
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,500
Buddies, stay here for a few days first.

24
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:35,160
I'll come find you in a few days
when I've made arrangements.

25
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,910
I heard you blasted a pit a few days ago.

26
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:39,840
What?

27
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,640
It didn't work out?

28
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,820
Stop mentioning that frustrating matter.

29
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,350
We didn't choose the right spot
and couldn't blast it open.

30
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,579
We're all counting on you now.

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,270
Don't worry.

32
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,470
This time, it's absolutely no problem.

[Archeology Site. No Entry.]

34
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,450
Ms. Luo! Kun!

35
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,760
The leaders from the Cultural
Heritage Bureau are here.

36
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,190
-Have you ever...
-Over here!

37
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,070
come to this place before?

38
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,510
Yes, we have.

39
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,570
Please be careful.

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,670
So you've been here several times?

41
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,670
When did you come?

42
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,260
We've been around here
in this period of time.

43
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,190
Hello, leaders!

44
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,860
Mr. You! Director Zhang!

45
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,390
Luo Qing!

46
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,050
-It's been a long time since we last met.
-Hello.

47
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,790
These are some
rammed-earth wall structures

48
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,320
we've already cleared out.

49
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,190
We've measured its area

50
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,260
and height.

51
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,860
We've also taken notes of

52
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,230
its cultural layer height

53
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,670
and the degree of erosion.

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,730
Please take a look.

55
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,190
As you can see,

56
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,450
the soil layers are clearly stratified.

57
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,740
The first layer is
the cultivated soil layer.

58
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,980
The second layer is
the accumulation layer.

59
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,950
And then further down,

60
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,630
it's the Han Dynasty cultural layer.

61
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,140
The soil texture is rather hard

62
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,350
and is grayish-brown.

63
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,440
It's mixed with many
Han Dynasty tile fragments.

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,700
So our preliminary assessment is that

65
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,910
it might be part of a mausoleum site.

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,910
A mausoleum site?

67
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,290
Yes. It's very likely to be
a rammed earth wall

68
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,700
or something like a gate tower.

69
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,190
But as it's so heavily weathered,

70
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,460
we still can't determine
what it is exactly.

71
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,650
This indeed matches

72
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,660
the characteristics of a mausoleum site.

73
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,860
We can't rule out

74
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,080
the possibility of gate tower remains.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
Could it be the Empress Dou's mausoleum?

76
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,930
The Dou Mausoleum is over there.

77
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,240
Based on this positional relationship,

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,210
we can now be certain that

79
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,760
it's definitely not the remains
of the Dou Mausoleum.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,290
It's not the Dou Mausoleum?

81
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,360
If it's not the Dou Mausoleum, then whose

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,290
mausoleum is it?

83
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,760
I've called this meeting today

84
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,380
because there's a tricky situation.

85
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,200
Our informant has reported that

86
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,050
a batch of Yaozhou ceramics
appeared in the black market.

87
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,510
A batch?

88
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,240
Yes.

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,490
According to the tip-off,
there's a large quantity.

90
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,760
But we have limited clues at the moment,

91
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,960
and we don't have any photos.

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,930
We can only rely on our
experience to make judgments.

93
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,530
Song Dynasty ceramics are rare.

94
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,290
If so many of them suddenly appeared,

95
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,560
is it possible that
they're from a kiln site?

96
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,050
Contact our fellows in the Huang Plain

97
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,200
to see if any kiln site goods have
been transferred out of there.

98
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,560
Okay.

99
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,810
Captain Yang.

100
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,760
Do you think this batch of goods

101
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,610
might have come from a tomb?

102
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,940
If they're from a tomb,

103
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,500
it's possible that a high-ranking
tomb has been looted.

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,530
But without concrete evidence,
it's hard to say for sure.

105
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,410
Indeed.

106
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,680
No matter what the current situation is,

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
we can only start by
investigating the market

108
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
to probe into the situation

109
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,050
and gather some clues.

110
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,250
Yes. That's what I mean.

111
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,440
But we need to act quickly.

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,570
We must act quickly.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,160
We can't let this batch of

114
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,890
Song Dynasty ceramics be
transferred out of Qinchuan.

115
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,480
It's really strange.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I've asked several dealers.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,960
They all said our goods are genuine.

118
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,680
But they were all so stingy.

119
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,370
The highest offer is only
one million yuan.

120
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,270
One million yuan?

121
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,590
Don't be so surprised.

122
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,090
They're not even as generous as

123
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,890
that old scoundrel, Mu Jianhui.

124
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,850
Bro.

125
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,610
If you ask me,

126
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,880
with these goods in our hands,

127
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,760
the longer we wait,
the more trouble we'll have.

128
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,350
Five million yuan isn't a small amount.

129
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,880
How about

130
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,560
we just sell them to Mu Jianhui?

131
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,050
Why?

132
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,330
Why should he get all the benefits?

133
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,290
Don't always be so short-sighted.

134
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,380
You have to play the long game
to catch the big fish.

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,760
If we can sell these goods
at a double price,

136
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,780
we'll be set for life.

137
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm just so worried.

138
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,890
Stop nagging.

139
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,500
Let me tell you.

140
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,600
Tonight,

141
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,970
a big boss is coming to see the goods.

142
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,100
There are two more lining up tomorrow.

143
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,710
With the Song Dynasty ceramics
being so popular now,

144
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,170
do you think we'll have difficulty
selling these good items?

145
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,700
Just rest assured.

146
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,970
Don't worry.

147
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,520
Just wait to collect the money with me.

148
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,570
Based on my work of collecting walnuts

149
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,690
in the field in the past few days,

150
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,510
I've drawn this topographic map.

151
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,040
I can be fairly certain that

152
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,220
this orchard is where the Lv
Family buried the people.

153
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,500
How did you determine that?

154
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,210
Look.

155
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,100
This is the cultural relic conservator's
patrol route that you drew.

156
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
It basically circles around this area.

157
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,240
What's inside this circle?

158
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,000
There's a wide ditch here.

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,530
It must be a very wide ditch.

160
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,050
Do you know what it's used for?

161
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,620
I don't know.

162
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,680
It's used to demarcate the cemetery.

163
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,530
It can not only protect the cemetery

164
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,730
but also drain water.

165
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,900
I've asked that villager.

166
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,040
When the brick kiln used to
extract soil from the ditch,

167
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,100
they also dug up some pottery shards.

168
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,600
Good.

169
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
That's great.

170
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,280
Bro.

171
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,280
I've been observing

172
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,970
these cultural relic conservators
for the past couple of days.

173
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,590
Their regular schedule is like this.

174
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,420
From 6 AM to 8 AM in the morning,

175
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,250
from 2 PM to 4 PM in the afternoon

176
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,290
and from 11 PM to 1 AM at midnight,

177
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,960
they patrol during
these three time periods.

178
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,990
So,

179
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,330
we can only work

180
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,900
from 1 AM to 6 AM each day.

181
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,480
Right.

182
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,400
Excluding half an hour
at the beginning and in the end,

183
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,659
it's about four hours.

184
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,970
That's enough.

185
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,610
Then I'll prepare the tools tomorrow.

186
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,659
What should we do first tomorrow night?

187
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,170
Let's explore it first tomorrow night.

188
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,100
Let's find the tomb chamber first.

189
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,770
Hello, sir.

190
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,990
What are you looking for?
Feel free to look around.

191
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,760
Alright.

192
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
What are you looking for?

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,510
Hello, sir.

194
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,320
I've noticed that in your shop,

195
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,920
everything is from the Ming
and Qing Dynasties.

196
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,250
Don't you have any Song Dynasty ceramics?

197
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,190
You're looking for Song Dynasty ceramics?

198
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,400
Nowadays, there are more Ming and
Qing items, and more buyers want them.

199
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,770
They're beautiful and magnificent.

200
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,120
Right.

201
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,250
Song Dynasty ceramics are a bit plain.

202
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,910
Not many people look for them,
so I haven't stocked much.

203
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,370
You haven't stocked much?

204
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,960
That means you do have some.

205
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,920
You just want the Song Dynasty ceramics?

206
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,050
I just want the Song Dynasty ceramics.

207
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,030
Alright. Come over here and take a look.

208
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,539
What do you think of this one?

209
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,809
This is my favorite piece.

210
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,740
It's now used for burning incense.

211
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,720
This Yaozhou ceramic of
yours is really beautiful.

212
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,150
How much is it?

213
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,630
You really like it?

214
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,559
I really like it.

215
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,140
Well, since it's your first time here,

216
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,760
I won't try to make money from you.

217
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,420
Come back often in the future.

218
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,050
Take it.

219
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,980
What does this mean?

220
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,290
I don't know much about these goods.

221
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,690
H-How would I know how much it costs?

222
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,810
You recognized it as a Yaozhou ceramic
at a glance, but you don't know them well?

223
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,270
It was just a random guess.

224
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,750
But I'm just not sure

225
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,690
whether this item is real or fake.

226
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,750
What's real or fake about artifacts?

227
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
Artifacts?

228
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,770
Other shop owners

229
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,510
all try to describe fake items
as genuine items.

230
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,570
Sir, you're good.

231
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,030
You're an honest man.

232
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,050
Bro.

233
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,090
Did...

234
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,990
Did you set the
appointment for 2 o'clock?

235
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,780
2 o'clock, 2 o'clock.

236
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,400
You've asked me three times.

237
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,060
It's already 2:30.

238
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,620
Why hasn't he come yet?

239
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,670
Why... Why don't you give him a call?

240
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,930
Why are you panicking?

241
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,180
If we can't sell it to this buyer,
there's still the next one.

242
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,040
There are many people who want it.

243
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:50,840
Bro.

244
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,800
The Relics Inspection Team came here.

245
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,480
Why did they come here?

246
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,680
To get information out of me.

247
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,880
They looked for Song Dynasty ceramics.

248
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,480
How did you know they were
from the Inspection Team?

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,530
They came in without looking at
items like jade ware, gold or gems.

250
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,030
The first thing they asked about
was Song Dynasty ceramics.

251
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,840
I could tell at first glance whether

252
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,050
they were here to buy something.

253
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,250
That's very strange.

254
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,210
Hadn't they secretly investigated Song
Dynasty ceramics in the South Market?

255
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,050
Why did they come again?

256
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,650
It's fine.

257
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,540
Just keep a close eye on the shop.

258
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,870
We won't be implicated.

259
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,740
Alright.

260
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,600
Okay.

261
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
What's wrong?

262
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,090
Xing Zhaohu didn't disappoint me indeed.

263
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,610
His goods will be ours soon.

264
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,960
Are we still going to dig it or not?

265
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Yes, of course.

266
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,980
You'd be a fool not to
make money when you can.

267
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,160
Have you prepared the stuff?

268
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,360
Yes, I have. Let's go get it at midnight.

269
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,820
Bro, what time is it now?

270
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,240
Why hasn't he come yet?

271
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,460
Just... Just give him a call.

272
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,390
Why should I call him?

273
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,540
You're just too stubborn.

274
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,720
What's so hard about calling him?

275
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,620
It's already dark. We've waited
all day, and he's not here yet.

276
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,770
He's definitely not coming.

277
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,830
What's the point of all this trouble?

278
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,110
Hu!

279
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,720
Hu!

280
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,610
Hu!

281
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,710
Come on, Guang.

282
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,390
Have a sip to warm yourself up.

283
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,190
We still have work to do tonight.

284
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,230
I'm afraid I can't drink anymore.

285
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,160
If I drink more, it'll be even
harder for me to find it.

286
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Don't worry.

287
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,700
I'll make a call first.

288
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,840
To whom?

289
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,320
Xing Zhaohu.

290
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,820
Didn't you say you needed 10 days?

291
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,890
In these few days, you must have

292
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,350
asked around for buyers
in the South Market.

293
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,240
That's none of your business.

294
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,370
I haven't sold the goods to you anyway.

295
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

296
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,920
The Inspection Team came to my shop today.

297
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,240
They were asking about that batch
of your Yaozhou ceramics.

298
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,330
What details were they asking about?

299
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,450
Don't panic first.

300
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,170
I guess they also don't
know the specifics.

301
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,380
They were just trying to get information.

302
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,690
But I need to warn you.

303
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,450
It's best not to go to
the South Market these days.

304
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,360
Be careful with everything.

305
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,720
Alright. I've said what I needed to say.

306
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,510
I'll hang up now.

307
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,050
Wait!

308
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,590
How's it going with
that five million yuan?

309
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,540
Hu, I haven't gathered it all yet.

310
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,460
Can you wait two more days for me?

311
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,140
I knew you wouldn't be reliable.

312
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,320
Let me tell you. I'm not
waiting for you anymore.

313
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,960
There are people lining up behind me.

314
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,970
I'll sell the goods as I please.

315
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,000
Alright, buddy.

316
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,850
As long as someone offers a higher price,

317
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,620
you can sell your goods.

318
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,080
I won't stand in your way
of making a fortune.

319
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,430
These scoundrels.

320
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,190
No wonder that guy stood me up.

321
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,540
Dongsheng!

322
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,950
What's wrong, Fugui?

323
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Come here.

324
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,320
What's wrong?

325
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,660
Have you finished cleaning up the fields?

326
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,460
It'll be done in about half a day.

327
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,840
It won't affect the night patrol.

328
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,950
The Management Office called me.

329
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,050
They said those thieves

330
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,750
were targeting Song Dynasty ceramics.

331
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,390
They want us to strengthen patrols

332
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,800
in areas with Song Dynasty tombs.

333
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,050
I've told Hongfu

334
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,430
to entrust the fields to his wife.

335
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,420
He'll patrol during the day.

336
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,750
At night, we'll patrol for two more hours.

337
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,420
The key is the second half of the night.

338
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,150
What do you think?

339
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,350
There's not much work
in the fields now anyway.

340
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,280
I think it's okay.

341
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,970
That's settled then.

342
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,280
Alright.

343
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,960
Get back to work now.

344
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,290
Hurry up and get it done.

345
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,240
Ride safely, Fugui.

346
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,770
Alright.

347
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,610
We received some tip-offs a few days ago.

348
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,660
A batch of Yaozhou ceramic were
transferred to the black market.

349
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,120
We have three hypotheses.

350
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,350
Firstly, they might be from kiln sites.

351
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,180
Secondly, they might be
high-quality counterfeits.

352
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,110
Thirdly, they might be
looted goods from tombs.

353
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Shang Lifeng, report on the
situation of the South Market.

354
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:37,630
Okay.

355
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,270
After our investigation this time,

356
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,630
we can basically rule out the possibility
of high-quality counterfeits.

357
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,540
Because high-quality counterfeits

358
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,900
are made with high production costs.

359
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,540
It's unlikely for them

360
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,630
to flood the market
in large quantities at once.

361
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,060
An informant happened to

362
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,150
provide me with an important clue.

363
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,780
There are some photos
of this batch of goods.

364
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,580
Captain Yang.

365
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,600
Captain Qi.

366
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,870
Then I went to the Provincial
Archaeological Research Institute

367
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,990
and consulted with the experts.

368
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,870
The experts have confirmed that
these are Yaozhou ceramics.

369
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,800
And the quality is extremely high.

370
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,530
This celadon cup stand is made

371
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,780
with a very rare crafting technique.

372
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,110
Among the artifacts we've unearthed so far,

373
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,300
we haven't found anything like this.

374
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,700
In terms of this quality,

375
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,830
they're probably not from kiln sites.

376
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,060
Then in the worst scenario,

377
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,350
they're from ancient tombs.

378
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,980
That's what I think, too.

379
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,540
So how do you want me to cooperate?

380
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,080
Give me some manpower.

381
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,900
The police can assist
our Relics Inspection Team

382
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,150
with the joint patrols.

383
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,110
Let's find the looting pit
as soon as possible

384
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,840
to prevent secondary looting.

385
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,470
Alright.

386
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,270
Also, please go to Shuiqu with Ding Yan

387
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,990
to see what's going on there.

388
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,190
I'll take some people

389
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,540
to Leyang.

390
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,060
Bro.

391
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,580
Are you alright?

392
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:40,920
I'm fine.

393
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,140
Look at the map you've drawn.

394
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,340
The scope of the cemetery,

395
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,840
its specifications and orientation

396
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,830
are all very clear at a glance.

397
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,980
Even the patrol times of
the cultural relic conservators

398
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,780
are written here clearly for me.

399
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,730
You've even found the spot
to start digging.

400
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,990
Sheng.

401
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,520
You've already looted it,

402
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,940
while I'm just starting to explore.

403
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,800
I haven't even chosen the
spot to start digging yet.

404
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,130
Mu Jianhui.

405
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,670
How many years have we known each other?

406
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,630
How many times have you fooled me?

407
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,030
How can I still trust you?

408
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,440
If I had really found the tomb,

409
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,580
why would I only prepare one shovel?

410
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Then just tell me.

411
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,210
What's drawn on this map?

412
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,430
It's just a schematic diagram.

413
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,990
It's a rough draft

414
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,100
for my convenience in
marking tomb locations.

415
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,350
Mu Jianhui.

416
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,790
I'm a man who follows

417
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,420
the code of honor in his dealings.

418
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,260
The location of this tomb

419
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,010
was tricked out of me by you.

420
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,920
Without me, you wouldn't have found it.

421
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,520
So it's not stealing if I
take it back now, is it?

422
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,550
You've always schemed against me.

423
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,220
Though you kept scheming,

424
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,430
you didn't expect that

425
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,030
I could find where you two
are staying, did you?

426
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:10,910
Sheng.

427
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,880
Since I've fallen into your hands,

428
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,319
I won't talk nonsense with you anymore.

429
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,380
I really haven't explored it
thoroughly yet.

430
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,310
If you dig it now,

431
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,960
it would be a waste of effort.

432
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,480
This Lv Family Tomb is very large.

433
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,099
The cultural relic conservators
patrol it frequently, too.

434
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,230
And you can't dig it all up by yourself.

435
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,440
How about this?

436
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,950
Let's collaborate.

437
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,690
I'll locate the chambers,

438
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,710
and we'll dig it together.

439
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,710
What do you think?

440
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,800
Let's collaborate?

441
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
What you said is so funny.

442
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,040
What are you thinking?

443
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
You want me to collaborate with you?

444
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,080
Sheng.

445
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,420
I found it.

446
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,730
Wait a moment.

447
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,820
Tell our Expert Mu if you've found it.

448
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,670
Come on. Listen to this.

449
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,570
Old scoundrel.

450
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,600
Thanks.

451
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,370
Even a blind squirrel finds
a nut once in a while!

452
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,840
I guess you're just lucky.

453
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,380
Expert Mu said we're lucky.

454
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,540
Go on.

455
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,680
Okay, Sheng.

456
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,400
Come on.

457
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,160
Keep an eye on it closely at night.

458
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,910
Alright.

459
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,360
What's going on?

460
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,320
Why is there nothing here?

461
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,480
This is not okay.

462
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,610
I need to make a call.

463
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
Don't use that trick on me.

464
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,300
If anyone needs to go up,
we're going up together.

465
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,100
That's right.

466
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,770
There must be a van.

467
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,860
That's right.

468
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,150
This van looks unfamiliar.

469
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,940
It must be the van of Fucai
from our village.

470
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,200
I remember that Fucai's
license plate number has a 3 in it.

471
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,780
Write down the license plate number.

472
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,110
Okay.

473
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,360
Three people.

474
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,980
No, no, no.

475
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,470
Up!

476
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,280
Four people.

477
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,240
Four people.

478
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,110
Alright.

479
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,030
What are you doing?

480
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,600
What are you doing?

481
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,230
Let's go! Hurry up!

482
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,750
Someone's coming.

483
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,540
What are you doing?

484
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,230
Go up at once!

485
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,620
Let go!

486
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,340
It's too late.

487
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,820
Stop!

488
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,470
Stop!

489
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,950
What are you doing here?

490
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,280
Stop!

491
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,230
Where are you going?

492
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,060
There's still one more here.

493
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,340
Block this pit. Don't let him escape.

494
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't move!

495
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,100
Make a call. Call the leaders. Hurry up!

496
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,430
Okay.

497
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,820
Big Head! My buddy, Sibao,
hasn't come up yet.

498
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,950
We can't save him now.
Get in the van at once.

499
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,280
No! I have to go find him!

500
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,140
Those two men are still guarding that pit.

501
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,470
If you go back, won't you
be caught by them?

502
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,190
I don't think they're from
the Cultural Heritage Bureau.

503
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,780
They don't seem to be policemen, either.

504
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,760
They seem to be cultural relic
conservators from the village.

505
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Don't worry. We can just bribe them.

506
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,540
How many of them are there?

507
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,820
I couldn't see clearly,
but there seems to be...

508
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,480
two people.

509
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,100
We have four people here, so we
shouldn't be afraid of them.

510
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,230
Let go! Come with me!

511
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:17,950
Wait!

512
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,330
Don't move!

513
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,820
What are you doing?

514
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,880
What are you doing?

515
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,710
Sir,

516
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,160
listen to me.

517
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,620
I know you're a
cultural relic conservator.

518
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,060
As long as you let our buddy go,

519
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,190
I can give you money.

520
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,160
Is that okay?

521
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,030
Yes, yes, yes.

522
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,230
I-I-I have 500 yuan here.

523
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,470
L-Let him go. I-I will give you the money.

524
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:41,990
Hongfu!

525
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,060
Fucai! Tianyou!

526
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,620
There are more people!

527
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,640
We've found some
tomb raiders! Come quickly!

528
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:45,920
Run!

529
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,580
Stop!

530
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,550
Don't run!

531
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,270
Stop!

532
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,040
Don't move!

533
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,870
It's you! Stop right there!

534
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,220
You didn't bring Hu here
this time, did you?

535
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,440
Where did you find the grave diggers?

536
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,990
It's a trade secret.

537
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,300
It's none of your business.

538
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,830
I'm just worried about you.

539
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,390
Both Hu and Shan aren't
working for you anymore.

540
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,340
Is Big Head, the only one
left here, really reliable?

541
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,400
The goods are worth millions of yuan.

542
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,760
What if Big Head betrays you for money

543
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,690
and also does what Hu has done?

544
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,860
If I were you, I'd be more cautious.

545
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,380
At least, you should've found
some grave diggers by yourself.

546
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,140
If Big Head is the one who hired them,

547
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,540
when they work together,

548
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,030
they might take the goods out of there

549
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,710
and then run away with all the items.

550
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,040
Mind your own business.

551
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,580
Sorry.

552
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,910
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

553
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,710
What's wrong?

554
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,280
So Big Head is really the one
who hired the grave diggers?

555
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,240
Sorry...

556
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,190
See?

557
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,380
You can't get through to his number, huh?

558
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,140
Something must have gone wrong.

559
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,340
How could you trust Big Head so easily?

560
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,380
Can you shut up?

561
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,470
Don't try to panic me.

562
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,230
You keep nagging.

563
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,030
You've been talking endlessly.

564
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,440
Who's that?

565
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,420
Sheng, it's me.

566
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,190
Why are you back so late?

567
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,740
Sheng.

568
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,860
Something bad happened.

569
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,670
What happened?

570
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,340
We dug up an empty tomb.
There was not even a coffin inside.

571
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,140
An empty tomb?

572
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,060
Did you steal the goods?

573
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,190
I wouldn't dare, Sheng.

574
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,650
There's another problem.

575
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,140
What is it?

576
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,710
That Hedong man has detained
the cultural relic conservators.

577
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,380
Is he crazy?

578
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,190
Why has he detained them?

579
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,790
No, Sheng.

580
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,100
The cultural relic conservators have
detained that Hedong man.

581
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,300
Then why did you come back here?

582
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,950
I was afraid you'd accuse me
of being disloyal.

583
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,520
I came back to report it to you.

584
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,560
Why do you have to report it to me?

585
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,420
Escape at once.

586
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,630
Keep your mouth shut.

587
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,820
If you dare to tell others about it,

588
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,620
I'll kill you.

589
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,860
So?

590
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,280
I was right, huh?

591
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,850
Now you should believe me, right?

592
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,230
Sheng! Sheng!

593
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,890
Untie it for me!

594
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:18,910
Okay.

595
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,690
Okay.

596
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:20,820
I got it.

597
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,550
Okay.

598
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,320
Yongfu.

599
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,310
Turn around. Let's go to Mi County.

600
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,130
Why are we going there?

601
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,840
I got a call from our fellows
in Mi County.

602
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,140
They said two cultural relic protection
volunteers in Lvjia Village

603
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,540
had caught a tomb raider.

604
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,720
Let's go.

605
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,190
Bro.

606
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,430
Are we just going to keep waiting here?

607
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,170
No rush.

608
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,510
Let's eat first.

609
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,920
It's too conspicuous to leave now.

610
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,270
The police are searching for
the culprits everywhere.

611
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,210
The darkest place is under the lamppost.

612
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,750
My head is still buzzing
due to that strike of the shovel.

613
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,480
Are you okay?

614
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,200
I'm fine.

615
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,780
Just now, I really wanted to make Liu...

616
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,540
Liu is just an idiot.

617
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,100
With just one shovel,

618
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,060
he ruined the plan

619
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,430
which we had been waiting for so long

620
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,230
to carry out.

621
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,550
You're wrong.

622
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,120
Not only should you not try to hurt him,

623
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,670
but you should also thank him properly.

624
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,100
Why?

625
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,860
He took the hit for us.

626
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,030
If he hadn't interfered,

627
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,310
you and I would have been arrested.

628
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,790
You're right.

629
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,050
Cheers, Guang.

630
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Let's drink it up.

631
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,140
This glass

632
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,400
is for a toast.

633
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,790
Let's celebrate for our good luck.

634
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,430
We are indeed lucky.

635
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,530
We've managed to get away several times.

636
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,610
Heaven doesn't want us to
continue looting graves.

637
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,420
Let's take a different path.

638
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,520
You still want to try your luck
with Zhao Youlin?

639
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,430
Then we can only count on
Xing Zhaohu's goods.

640
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,830
Right.

641
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,230
No one dares to buy his goods now.

642
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,870
Let's take this chance to
bargain with him.

643
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,110
Why do we have to bargain?

644
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,720
Have you ever watched "Animal World?"

645
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,060
I've watched one episode before.

646
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,460
It was about a leopard
hunting an antelope.

647
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,310
That leopard

648
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,660
kept watching the antelope.

649
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,210
It waited for a long time
without attacking.

650
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,030
Until the third day,

651
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,740
the leopard suddenly

652
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,560
killed it with one bite.

653
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,410
What's the most important
thing in hunting?

654
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,580
Timing.

655
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,060
To find the best timing,

656
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,570
you need to have enough patience.

657
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,360
I got it.

658
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,060
Xing Zhaohu is that antelope.

659
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,570
That's right.

660
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,310
Let him wait.

661
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,990
Let him wait till he's willing
to sell at a low price.

662
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,850
Then let's defeat him in one move.

663
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,790
We're just like that leopard.

Lvjia Village, Shili Town, Mi County]

665
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,330
[Central Clinic of
Lvjia Village, Shili Town]

666
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,640
You're here.

667
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,950
This is Captain Qi Dacang from our city's

668
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,540
Public Security Bureau,
who specializes in cultural relic cases.

669
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,030
These are the cultural relic protection
volunteers from our Lvjia Village.

670
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,560
Lv Fugui.

671
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,340
Hello.

672
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,340
Li Dongsheng.

673
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,060
Hello.

674
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,590
They're the ones who caught the suspect.

675
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:52,990
Good.

676
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,800
While we were patrolling,

677
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,230
we saw a van.

678
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,660
I think they drove the van there.

679
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,400
I wrote down the license plate number.

680
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,530
Take a look.

681
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,230
Where is he?

682
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,710
He's locked up in the next room.

683
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,370
Two young men from
our village are watching him.

684
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,630
I think in this case, some local people

685
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,980
colluded with men from another city.

686
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,870
There are two tasks for you.

687
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,210
Firstly, bring him back to
our office for interrogation.

688
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,070
If he doesn't tell the truth,

689
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,330
send a joint investigation notice
to the neighboring counties

690
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,990
and cities, as well as Hedong.

691
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,620
Figure out this man's identity and check
if he has any criminal records.

692
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,860
As for Chunhua, who had a drink
with Yan Shoucun that day,

693
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,270
bring her here to identify the suspect.

694
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,870
Secondly,

695
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,570
find out who owns the van.

696
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,260
Alright. I'll go now.

697
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,760
Captain Qi, what about us?

698
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,750
I was just about to ask you guys

699
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,550
to check the looting pit with me.

700
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,790
Captain Yang.

701
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,450
What's wrong?

702
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,750
I think that guy

703
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,580
looks very familiar.

704
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,320
Have you encountered him in a case before?

705
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,980
Probably.

706
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,760
Alright.

707
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,860
Thanks.

708
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,350
You're welcome.

709
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,630
How is it?

710
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,300
Well, how is it?

711
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,100
It's very strange.

712
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,140
It's an empty tomb.

713
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,820
An empty tomb?

714
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,620
An empty tomb.

715
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,340
This pit

716
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,140
is about three to four meters deep.

717
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,380
In terms of its structure, it's a
vertical-shaft earth-pit tomb.

718
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,910
This type of tomb

719
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,140
is generally used by ordinary people.

720
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,230
But there aren't any coffins or remains

721
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,400
in this empty tomb.

722
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
That's peculiar.

723
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,780
Which dynasty is it from?

724
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,190
I think it's a Song Dynasty tomb.

725
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,910
Let's take a look around further

726
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,950
to see if we can find any new clues.

727
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,110
It's here!

728
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,270
Here!

729
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,730
What's wrong?

730
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,900
What's wrong?

731
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,770
There's another looting pit?

732
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,380
Look.

733
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,100
In terms of the color of the soil,

734
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,060
it seems it was looted not so long ago.

735
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,950
It's not new.

736
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,030
It probably wasn't looted yesterday.

737
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,030
We patrol every day without
missing a single day.

738
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,140
But we haven't seen any tomb raiders.

739
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,090
Calm down.

740
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,850
These scoundrels are just like that.

741
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,160
It's hard to guard against them.

742
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,690
Ding Yan.

743
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,000
Take photos.

744
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,740
It's here.

745
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,170
Bring the rack and the rope over here.

746
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,470
I'll go down and take a look.

747
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,950
Alright.

748
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,480
Let's go.

749
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,950
Put it here first.

750
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,830
Let's go.

751
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,290
Alright.

752
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,040
Be careful.

753
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,920
Slow down.

754
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,680
Alright, alright.

755
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,560
Alright.

756
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,270
Are you okay?

757
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:03,730
Come on.

758
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,560
The bag.

759
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,670
I'm fine.

760
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,460
Don't move. Don't move.

761
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,120
Don't move.

762
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,430
Look here.

763
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,750
These footprints

764
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,060
are new.

765
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,230
It must have been looted recently.

766
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,830
I think so.

767
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:34,820
Look.

768
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,650
Can you tell which kiln this is from?

769
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,670
Let me take a look.

770
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,910
The glazing color is greenish-yellow.

771
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
It seems to be a Yaozhou ceramic

772
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,220
from the early Song Dynasty.

773
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,950
Let's collect evidence
from the scene first.

774
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,480
Alright.

775
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,450
Come on.

776
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,690
Captain Qi.

777
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,170
Captain Qi.

778
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,960
Captain Qi.

779
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,469
Did he tell the truth?

780
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,739
I asked him, but he said nothing.

781
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,830
He's playing dumb there.

782
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,429
Has Chunhua come to identify the suspect?

783
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,159
Yes, she has.

784
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,100
She said this wasn't the person
who had looked for her.

785
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,580
How's the situation in Hedong?

786
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,909
The joint investigation notice
has been sent out.

787
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,030
It probably won't be that quick.

788
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,310
By the way, I've also
checked the license plate.

789
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,170
It's fake. I can't find the owner.

790
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,400
[Feng Sibao]

791
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,310
Captain Qi.

792
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,250
Captain Yang, have a seat.

793
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,740
I... I'll just be standing.

794
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,100
I...

795
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,420
Feng Sibao.

796
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,540
Right?

797
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,670
Do you recognize me?

798
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,270
What's wrong?

799
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,060
It's been over a decade since we last met.

800
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,590
Have you taken mutism drugs

801
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,360
and become mute?

802
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,450
Sibao.

803
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:36,910
This guy...

804
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,060
How about I go to

805
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,660
Wenxi County in Hedong

806
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,990
and bring your father,
mother and wife here

807
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,870
so that they can talk to you personally?

808
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,990
Maybe that'll cure your mutism.

809
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,030
It took me a while to remember this.

810
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,980
You're Captain Yang, right?

811
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,910
That's right.

812
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,180
You have such a good memory.

813
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,220
You still remember me after so long.

814
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,620
Of course I remember you.

815
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,690
It's been over a decade since we last met.

816
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,170
You're still in the same line of work?

817
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,740
No, I changed my career long ago.

818
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,590
You changed your career?

819
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,380
You don't rob towers anymore?

820
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:10,860
No.

821
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,120
Now your job is robbing graves?

822
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,860
Alright, Captain Qi.

823
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,850
He's an old acquaintance.

824
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,310
We've finished catching up on each other.

825
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,870
You can get down to business now.

826
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,500
I'm leaving, Captain Yang.

827
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,230
I'm leaving.

828
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:28,740
Take care.

829
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,270
Alright.

830
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,780
Now can you tell us the truth?

831
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,680
Come on.

832
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,920
Take a look at this photo first.

833
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,800
I think you guys dug this pit yesterday.

834
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,810
Let me tell you.

835
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,050
We have both witnesses

836
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,080
and physical

837
00:36:59,310 --> 00:36:59,910
evidence.

838
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,260
Captain Qi.

839
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,540
What's the point of
interrogating him here?

840
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,470
Why don't we just let the court
decide the sentence to him?

841
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,870
What's the point of this?

842
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,830
You're right.

843
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,830
I'm innocent.

844
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,000
That was just an empty tomb.

845
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,970
We didn't dig up anything.

846
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,390
So you don't pretend to be mute anymore?

847
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,950
I'm just a gravedigger.

848
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,840
It has nothing to do with me.

849
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,720
We didn't dig up anything.

850
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,950
This doesn't count as robbing graves, huh?

851
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,550
Don't try to bargain with me!

852
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,840
Do you recognize this?

853
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,060
This is from yesterday's orchard.

854
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,870
Did you guys dig it or not?

855
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,180
No.

856
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,180
This definitely wasn't dug by us.

857
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,870
Yesterday, it was our first time going there.

858
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,400
Feng Sibao, let me tell you.

859
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,470
With every word you're saying now,

860
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,740
you'll be held legally responsible.
Do you know that?

861
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,620
I know the law. I've been
in jail several times.

862
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:57,990
What?

863
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,990
You're proud of that?

864
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,250
I wouldn't dare to lie.

865
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,960
This tomb was definitely not dug by us.

866
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,950
We only did this one job
after coming to Qinchuan.

867
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,390
I was even arrested by you.

868
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,390
Tell us about your accomplices now.

869
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,910
Which of them are from Hedong?

870
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,110
Which of them are locals from Qinchuan?

871
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,540
There are four people
from Hedong, including me.

872
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,070
The other three men
are my distant relatives.

873
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,260
I only know the third eldest fellow.

874
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,580
His nickname is Sanma.

875
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,100
There's only one local man from Qinchuan.

876
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,500
He's the one who found us.

877
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,060
I don't know

878
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,440
what his name is.

879
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,950
I've never spoken to him.

880
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,060
Where were you staying?

881
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,520
At the Xianglong Inn
in Nankang New Village.

882
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,180
It was arranged by that guy from Qinchuan.

883
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,780
Were there any other places?

884
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,310
Where did you stay before
the Qinchuan guy came?

885
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,240
At the Hongyun Inn in Jili Village.

886
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,180
If the Qinchuan guy hadn't come,

887
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,240
we would have left.

888
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,320
Where would you go?

889
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,080
The other three men always
talked behind my back.

890
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,140
Once,

891
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,830
Sanma got drunk

892
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,510
and said he has a brother-in-law

893
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,580
who sells fertilizers in Qingyuan County.

894
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,660
He's also in this line of work secretly.

895
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,030
Maybe they would go see him.

896
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,030
Where is it exactly?

897
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,620
Why would they tell me?

898
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,320
I just overheard them mentioning it.

899
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,760
It's called something like...

900
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,180
Jia Village.

901
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,660
In conclusion,

902
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,280
Feng Sibao's statement

903
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,080
is highly credible.

904
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,440
It's very likely that they only
robbed this one empty tomb.

905
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,680
Let's go over the sequence of events.

906
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,110
If the robbed tomb belonged
to Sixth Rank Civil Official,

907
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,170
someone might have heard about it
and wanted to make money from it.

908
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,030
He asked these men from Hedong to dig it.

909
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,230
But they ended up digging an empty tomb.

910
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,600
What you said makes sense.

911
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,880
The Cultural Heritage
Bureau just called us.

912
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,430
That ceramic fragment
you sent for examination

913
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,560
has been verified as

914
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Yaozhou ceramic.

915
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,260
However,

916
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,310
whether it's from the tomb of
Sixth Rank Civil Official

917
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,990
still can't be determined yet.

918
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,470
Because

919
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,320
there's a lack of more specific evidence.

920
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,640
As for the other three men from Hedong,

921
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
they've probably

922
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,060
gone to Qingyuan County.

923
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,920
How about I go there?

924
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,060
Just go there.

925
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,580
You two should go with him.

926
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,110
Alright.

927
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,470
Well,

928
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,310
could you

929
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,510
notify them first?

930
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,790
Isn't Wu Zhenchuan, the Deputy Chief
of Qingyuan County Public Security Bureau,

931
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,740
your classmate?

932
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,950
Do I still need to notify him?

933
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,700
He has been promoted.

934
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,790
If you don't pull rank on him a bit,

935
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,550
can your apprentice work smoothly there?

936
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,310
You're such a rascal.

937
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:56,290
[Qingyuan County]

938
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,560
Dacang.

939
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,390
You must be tired from your journey.

940
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,670
Chief Wu.

941
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,950
What are you doing? Gosh.

942
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,310
A salute isn't necessary between us.

943
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,620
I'm meeting with the chief now.

944
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

945
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,140
Yongfu, Du.

946
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,870
Fellows from Qinchuan, you're welcome
to give us guidance in work.

947
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,430
Welcome.

948
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,620
What guidance?

949
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,060
I have no solutions, so I'm
begging for your help.

950
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,140
What are you talking about?

951
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,470
There's no need to beg.
It's not like that at all.

952
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,000
Don't worry. We'll fully
cooperate with you.

953
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,220
Let's go to my office first.

954
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,430
I've already brewed some tea for you.

955
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,910
You're becoming more and more handsome.

956
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,840
I'm getting old.

957
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,310
Look at my gray hair.

958
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,060
My dear classmate, we haven't
seen each other for many years.

959
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,190
Come on. Have a seat.

960
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,220
Come on. Have some tea.

961
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,620
No need. No need for that.

962
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,160
I'm overwhelmed by your hospitality.

963
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,470
It's been so many years,
but you haven't changed at all.

964
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,660
Let's not talk about other things.

965
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,030
Let's get down to business.

966
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,090
Have you read the fax about this case?

967
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,090
Yes, I have.

968
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,790
If you've read it, let's take action.

969
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,580
Why are you in such a hurry? Well...

970
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,740
He's as impatient as he was
back in the police academy.

971
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,200
Let's have some tea first.

972
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,510
This tea is very good.

973
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,790
Let's get down to business.

974
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,870
About that fertilizer shop you mentioned,

975
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,880
I've asked someone to investigate it.

976
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,410
I'll let you know as soon as
we get the results.

977
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,140
Well, have you found that Jia Village?

978
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,340
In our county,

979
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,740
there are too many villages.

980
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,200
There's Zhoujia Village,

981
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
Lijia Village, Zhangjia Village,

982
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,950
Wangjia Village, Liujia Village

983
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,510
and Qiaojia Village.

984
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,790
There are just too many villages.

985
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,980
Each village has several fertilizer shops.

986
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,350
You'll have to investigate
them one by one, huh?

987
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,350
It will take time.

988
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,990
Here's the thing.

989
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,060
You've traveled a long way
and must be very tired.

990
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,510
I've booked rooms in a guesthouse.

991
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,440
Have a good rest.

992
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,120
Don't worry.

993
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,910
I'll notify you as soon as
we get any clues.

994
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,970
How come it smells so good?

995
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,990
It's expensive.

996
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,140
It's so kind of you to let me
taste such expensive tea.
