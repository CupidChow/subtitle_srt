[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,860
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,810
Three Fingers has been found.

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
You've found him?

5
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,530
[Baigou Village, Shangtong County]

6
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,240
Divorced?

7
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:54,870
Yeah.

8
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,509
When?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,860
We got divorced

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,160
the year my face got blown up.

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,350
Or what was I supposed to do?

12
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,410
To wait for him to blow me up next time?

13
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,120
What was he planning to blow up

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,180
using explosives?

15
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,470
I don't know either.

16
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,520
With his guts,

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,730
what could he possibly blow up?

18
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,320
It was all because of the bad guy
who led him astray.

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Who is the bad guy?

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,290
You know, the one

21
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,470
with the long face

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,150
and curly hair

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,490
didn't talk much

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,570
and had a gloomy aura about him.

25
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,700
Oh, right.

26
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,560
Liu Qiang even met with him
a few days before the incident.

27
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,430
Then when he came back,

28
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,800
he was messing with fertilizer
in the house.

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
Who knew
he was actually making explosives?

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
If I had known,

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,750
I would have risked my life

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,150
to stop him from doing it.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,290
Do you know what that man's name is?

34
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,200
I don't know.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,210
I had never seen him before.

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,930
Could you tell where he was
from by his accent?

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
From his accent,

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,440
he didn't sound like a local,

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,310
but he isn't from outside the province
either.

40
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,640
He must be from Qinzhou.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,590
Did Liu Qiang mention how he knew him?

42
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,630
It must have been from before,

43
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,870
when they were messing with explosives
at the mine, I guess.

44
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,530
At the mine?

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,970
Which mine?

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,960
There's a place called Yongcheng
in the neighboring province.

47
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,590
On a mountain called Wulao Mountain,

48
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,050
there's a phosphate mine.

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,430
A lot of people from around here

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,490
used to work there blasting the mine.

51
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,190
Has Liu Qiang contacted you recently?

52
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,250
Not for a long time.

53
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,240
He blew up my face like this,

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,240
and he's never given me a penny

55
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,170
or even checked on me once.

56
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,630
Oh, right.

57
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,680
Why don't you ask

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,940
his father and mother?

59
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,150
Even if he wants to cut off contact,

60
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,680
he still has to stay in touch
with his parents.

61
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,490
We'll ask them later.

62
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:42,920
Okay.

63
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,950
Alright, I got it.

64
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,150
Yongfu said he's checked it out.

65
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,400
Those numbers
provided by Liu Qiang's parents

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,060
are temporary phone numbers.

67
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,310
Forget it.

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
Even if we have the police station send
our men to keep an eye on it,

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,900
I doubt it'll work.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,800
I think so too.

71
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,870
Yongfu also said,

72
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,400
he only comes back
once every two or three years

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
and calls home once a month.

74
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,030
Their house is in shambles.

75
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,690
The roof is about to collapse.

76
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,560
People like him
have a nouveau riche mentality.

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,150
When they make some money,

78
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,030
they can't wait to blow it all.

79
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,320
They just leave their parents behind.

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,190
So where are we going now?

81
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,240
Wulao Mountain, Yongcheng.

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
Let's go to the mine and ask around.

83
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,960
The person Liu Qiang's ex-wife mentioned

84
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,240
should be the one who recruited Liu Qiang.

85
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,890
We might be able
to dig up something from him.

86
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,269
Okay.

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,160
What's wrong?

88
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:24,730
Qiang,

89
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,800
I heard from Lin

90
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,310
that two men went to Baigou Village today.

91
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,680
They were looking for your wife.

92
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,770
Seems like they're cops.

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,970
Don't show yourself.

94
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,240
Stingy Wu, what's wrong with you?

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,720
Don't you know
the cases have been consolidated?

96
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,940
Report any situation to me,
your leader, promptly.

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,990
Cut the crap.

98
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,159
Can't you say something nice
when you call me?

99
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,560
These past two days, Liu Gang and I

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,360
have delved into caves non-stop.

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
We took turns driving

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,480
and sleeping.

103
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,360
We've been both exhausted.

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
You don't even
show a bit of consideration.

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,000
And here you are, demanding explanations.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,380
What kind of leader are you?

107
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,870
I'm asking you to report,

108
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,000
not to complain.

109
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,260
Tell me,

110
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,040
how's the investigation
on that person going?

111
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,740
The phosphate mine
has long been closed down.

112
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,400
We've asked around quite a bit

113
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,520
and finally found out about
Liu Qiang's former foreman.

114
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,320
He might know about that person.

115
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,090
What do you mean by "might"?

116
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,640
Are you an inexperienced schoolboy?

117
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,360
Give me definite information.

118
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,650
The man has already retired.

119
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,800
He lives in Qinchuan.

120
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
We're on our way back now.

121
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,120
Mr. Zhu!

122
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,210
We have something to ask you.

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,200
What is it?

124
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,560
Come on, have a seat.

125
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
You look in great shape.

126
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,560
Thanks to doing exercise.

127
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,830
I'm from the Public Security Bureau.

128
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,760
I'd like to inquire about someone.

129
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,690
Inquire about someone?

130
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,560
Who?

131
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,600
Ten years ago,

132
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,310
did you work at the phosphate mine
on Wulao Mountain

133
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,040
as a foreman?

134
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,250
I was from the technical department.

135
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,310
Do you know someone named Liu Qiang?

136
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,950
Liu Qiang?

137
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,830
You mean Qiang?

138
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,640
He's also from Qinchuan.

139
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,410
We're from the same hometown.

140
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,560
Did he have someone

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,220
quite close to him at the mine?

142
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,560
I don't know about that.

143
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,410
Anyway, this kid

144
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,870
couldn't handle the hard work.

145
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,070
He didn't stay for long before leaving.

146
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,320
Think about it again.

147
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,870
Was he close to someone

148
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,570
from the blasting team?

149
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,000
The blasting team?

150
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,880
I remember now.

151
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,830
During that time,

152
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,040
everyone at the mine was talking about it.

153
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,600
They said Qiang

154
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,000
went back to mix explosives
and blew up his house.

155
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,890
He even did a few years in prison
for that.

156
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,310
They said back then,

157
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,310
he was called away by a blaster.

158
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,470
What's this blaster's name?

159
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't know his name. All I know is that

160
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,110
he was a loner,

161
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,730
who didn't talk much

162
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,050
and avoided crowds.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,560
But you see, this young man

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,270
was quite skilled at blasting.

165
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,000
What did this person look like?

166
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,680
What did he look like?

167
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
He had a long face.

168
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,560
He was tall and thin,

169
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,320
with curly hair.

170
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,250
He was about 20 years old at the time.

171
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,130
What accent did he have?

172
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,150
It seemed to be a Qinchuan accent.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,630
So, this Liu Qiang

174
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,480
is not a blaster.

175
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,409
He's just an ordinary
construction technician.

176
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,870
The person his ex-wife told Zhu Guoqing

177
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,240
is a blaster.

178
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
He should be

179
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,650
Gunner we're looking for.

180
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,920
I just interrogated Liang again.

181
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,800
He also said

182
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,950
that this Gunner is a tall, thin guy,

183
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,090
who looks to be in his thirties.

184
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,560
If we go back about 10 years,

185
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,240
he should be in his twenties,
just as Zhu Guoqing mentioned.

186
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,160
I also agree with what Chief Wu said.

187
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,560
Look,

188
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,820
what Liang,

189
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120
Liu Qiang's ex-wife,

190
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,160
and Zhu Guoqing said

191
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,910
has something in common.

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,400
Quiet,

193
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,760
ruthless,

194
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,070
tall and thin,

195
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,170
with curly hair,

196
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,000
right age,

197
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,310
and most importantly,

198
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,310
blasting experience.

199
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,360
Alright.

200
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,160
Since we all agree,

201
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,450
we'll split into two teams.

202
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,320
One team will search for Liu Qiang,

203
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,480
and the other will dig for information
on Gunner.

204
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,750
However, we know very little

205
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,510
about Gunner.

206
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,270
If there's really no other way,

207
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,030
we'll have to use the hard way again.

208
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,240
Be prepared.

209
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,960
Qi Dacang,

210
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,630
you're hinting at something.

211
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,300
What do you mean by "the hard way"?

212
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,890
I have my own way
of doing things the hard way.

213
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,210
I'll keep digging for clues about Gunner.

214
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,120
I don't believe

215
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,550
we can't get the information we want

216
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,600
after we question all the old workers
from his time at the mine,

217
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,150
one by one.

218
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,960
Listen to him. What an admirable spirit!

219
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,090
Learn from Chief Wu!

220
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,750
Good!

221
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,440
Good!

222
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,200
Alright.

223
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,500
Everyone, stop.

226
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,340
Where's the patient?

227
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,340
Left, just discharged not long ago.

228
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,360
Discharged?

229
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
Hey, Jianhui.

230
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,240
Guang,

231
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,430
where are you?

232
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,840
Why are you running around
at a time like this?

233
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,300
I'm not.

234
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
I'm on my way

235
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,750
to the old town in Jiaocheng
to find Wen Wen.

236
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,080
Wen Wen is in Jiaocheng?

237
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,860
Wait for me.

238
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,270
I'm coming right away.

[Jiaocheng]

240
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,570
Excuse me, may I ask something?

241
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,520
Have you seen this woman?

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Haven't seen her.

243
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,250
What do you want?

244
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,360
Have you seen this woman?

245
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,570
She looks familiar.

246
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,440
Yan,

247
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,010
come here for a second.

248
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Is she the one selling yogurt
at the corner over there?

249
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,510
Looks like it.

250
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,940
Which corner?

251
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,280
The one selling yogurt at that corner.

252
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,350
Thank you.

How are you?

257
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,440
I'm fine.

258
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,880
Let's go.

259
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,740
Don't touch me.

260
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,910
Just don't touch me now.

261
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,490
Let's find a hotel to stay first.

262
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,250
Someone just told me

263
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,630
Wen Wen is in that yogurt shop ahead.

264
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,790
I want to go see her.

265
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,680
You want to see her like this?

266
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,690
I just want to take a look.

267
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,880
Listen to me.

Let's find a hotel to stay first.

269

I'll go look for her for you later.

No.

271
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,080
I need to find out

272
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,240
why she left me and the kid.

273
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,610
She's already left.

274
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,960
Is there any point in asking now?

275
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,490
There is.

276
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,760
I don't have many loved ones in my life.

277
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,110
You're one of them.

278
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,630
So is Wen Wen.

279
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,560
If I don't get the answer,

280
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,490
I'll never have peace of mind
in this life.

281
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,970
You really want to know the answer
that badly?

282
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,920
Jianhui, what do you mean?

283
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,030
I've already arranged someone in Hong Kong

284
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,760
to hire a Filipino maid for you.

285
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,030
She has experience in caring for patients
with ostomy bags.

286
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,870
She'll ensure that your life from now on

287
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,130
will be no different from anyone else's.

288
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,910
Filipino maid?

289
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,720
To Hong Kong?

290
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,050
To Hong Kong.

291
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,320
I've already arranged everything

292
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,720
for Liu Qiang and Qing Ye.

293
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,600
They'll go to Yusai.

294
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,910
Your new identity and documents

295
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,240
have all been prepared.

296
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,710
The money in this card

297
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,840
is enough for you to spend several years
in Hong Kong.

298
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,300
When it's used up,
I'll transfer more to you.

299
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,250
Jianhui,

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,600
thank you.

301
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,310
I know you're the one
who treats me the best.

302
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,750
Hong Kong

303
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,390
is just a place I saw

304
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,670
on TV when I was little.

305
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
It's not a place for someone like me.

306
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,870
Even a beggar can ascend the throne.

307
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,840
What can stop you from going there?

308
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,610
Look at those people who seem all glitzy
on the surface.

309
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,200
They might be living in a shabby house.

310
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,840
Jianhui, you still haven't told me

311
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
what's really going on with Wen Wen.

312
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,870
If you don't tell me,
I'm not going anywhere.

313
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,670
I definitely need to see Wen Wen.

314
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,670
I didn't want to say this.

315
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,770
But since it's come to this,

316
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,640
I have no choice but to tell you.

317
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,320
I've let you down.

318
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,280
Liu Shusheng,

319
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,750
in order to drive a wedge between us,

320
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,720
drugged me and Wen Wen.

321
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,720
We

322
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,450
made a terrible mistake

323
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,790
without consciousness.

324
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,360
We were both afraid
you couldn't accept it,

325
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,220
so neither of us dared to tell you.

326
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,840
I thought

327
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,070
once you two got married,

328
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,780
this matter would be over.

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,860
Unexpectedly,

330
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,570
Wen Wen

331
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,020
couldn't get over this hurdle

332
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,340
and still left.

333
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,000
Guang,

334
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
now that you know,

335
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,510
whatever you want to do to me,

336
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,040
I won't say a word against it.

337
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,360
Guang.

338
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,850
Where are you going?

339
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,050
I'm going to find Liu Shusheng.

340
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,390
Guang, listen to me.

341
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,050
Move aside.

342
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,960
You can't go.

343
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,790
Jianhui, you...

344
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,320
-Just because of a scumbag...
-Jianhui, move aside.

345
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,630
You can't risk your life.

346
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,290
Move aside!

347
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:47,870
I'm begging you.

348
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,390
Move aside!

349
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm begging you!

350
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,870
You can't go!

351
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,750
You really can't go!

352
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,260
If you go, something bad will happen!

353
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,390
Guang!

354
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,480
I'm the one who deserves to die.

355
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,960
I've betrayed you.

356
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,200
If someone has to die,

357
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,190
kill me first.

358
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,840
Jianhui.

359
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,840
Whose child is Liang?

360
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,160
Mine.

361
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,550
Shulan.

362
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,800
You're back.

363
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,200
Why didn't you tell me?

364
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,660
I could have picked you up.

365
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,240
How long are you planning
to keep this from me?

366
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,280
What have I been hiding from you?

367
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,640
Shusheng and Feng,

368
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
where did they go?

369
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,730
I can't reach them by phone.

370
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,960
I went to their house to look for them.

371
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,820
The neighbors said
they haven't been back for days.

372
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,200
Shusheng's company has a bit of trouble.

373
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,850
I told them to lie low for a while.

374
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,900
You promised me before

375
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,640
that you wouldn't let him do dirty work.

376
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,270
Shulan,

377
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,680
Where are they now?

379
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,520
Don't worry.

380
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,590
They're safe now.

381
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,340
What do you mean by "safe"?

382
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Are the police looking for them too?

383
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,920
Can they ever come back?

384
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,510
Shulan,

385
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,400
from now on,

386
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,770
let's call the baby Liang.

387
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,310
Okay.

388
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,350
[Anze County, Jiangyou Province]

389
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,930
It's really

390
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,200
cold.

391
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,680
Transportation is the main artery
of economic development.

392
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,440
Strengthening
rural transportation infrastructure

393
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,830
is key to achieving rural prosperity.

394
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,160
Recently, Mr. Wang Jiahao,
our province's renowned entrepreneur,

395
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,110
has raised two million yuan on his own

396
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,000
to build a road

397
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,030
from Longmen Village
to the county town in Anze County.

398
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,830
Isn't that

399
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,050
the old bumpy road to Longmen Village?

400
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,300
In the past,

401
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,440
cars couldn't even get in there.

402
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,180
People had to rely on their two feet.

403
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,270
This Wang Jiahao is quite considerate.

404
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,480
It'll be much more convenient
to visit the countryside now.

405
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:00,790
Yes.

406
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,930
It was an inconvenient trip
with safety hazards.

407
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,830
After Mr. Wang Jiahao
learned about this situation,

408
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,270
he negotiated with the township government
multiple times and reached a consensus

409
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,070
to fund

410
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,920
the full asphalt paving of the road.

411
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,070
This action

412
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,670
also fully demonstrates Mr. Wang Jiahao's

413
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,110
deep affection for his hometown.

414
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,240
What about that joint investigation notice
from the other day?

415
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,160
Which one?

416
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
The one sent by the Qinchuan police.

417
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,770
Check if it's in that stack of documents.

418
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,830
After this period of time,

419
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,720
we've investigated
Liu Qiang's social connections.

420
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,160
We found that

421
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,070
there's someone called Fa

422
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,210
who's quite close to Liu Qiang.

423
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,280
However, Fa is just a nickname.

424
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,520
We need to investigate further
for more details.

425
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,350
My

426
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,560
informant

427
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,270
also provided some information,

428
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,330
saying that Gunner

429
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,340
has robbed graves more than once.

430
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,610
But that person

431
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,440
operates

432
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,030
very cautiously.

433
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,680
Almost no one has seen him.

434
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,140
What about Three Fingers?

435
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,830
The same as before.

436
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,960
Almost no one knows about Three Fingers.

437
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,690
I guess

438
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,750
he operates in the same way as Gunner.

439
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,680
They wear gloves when committing crimes

440
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
to hide their characteristics,

441
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,140
so no one has noticed them.

442
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,510
Jia, any news from Chief Wu's side?

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,730
They haven't contacted us yet.

444
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,110
I guess he got nothing either.

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,270
How are things going in Jiangyou?

446
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,030
The joint investigation notice
has been sent to every police station,

447
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,700
but it's basically been radio silence,

448
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,300
without any response at all.

449
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,510
What's going on here?

450
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,720
It feels like we are

451
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,870
this close to the suspects.

00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,790
all the leads have dried up?

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,860

456
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,400

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,150

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,440
Our colleagues
at the Anze County Public Security Bureau

464
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,640
came across in a local news story

465
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,510
about someone donating money
out of kindness to repair a road.

466
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,920
The person looked familiar.

467
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,830
Upon comparing the information,

468
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,350
it turned out to be King Hua
from our joint investigation notice.

469
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,150
That's great!

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
Tell Wu Zhenchuan at the same time!

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,900
Come in and have a seat.

479
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,290
have been living here?

480
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,040
Why didn't you rent a better place?

481
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,790
I don't have extra money.

Don't bother.

486
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,960
How could a little kid like you
know how to cook?

487
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,820
I'll take you out to eat in a bit.

488

We'll go to a restaurant.

489
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,030
Dad, eating out is very expensive.

490
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,690
Since you're back,
why don't you try my cooking?

491
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,480
Ever since the kid knew
you were going to come back,

492
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,540
he's especially learned
to cook your favorite dishes.

493
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,640
He cares for me.

could have such an outstanding child?

I'm sorry you and Liang have to stay
on the mountain for a while longer.

509
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,730
It's business matters.

Why didn't you spend it?

516

I didn't dare to spend it.

517
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,970
What's there to be afraid of?

518
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,790
It's so much money.

519
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,880
I don't know where it came from.

520
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,480
-Where it came from...
-I'm afraid...

521
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,160
I earned...

522
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
I earned it, you know.

523
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,440
I exchanged 10 years in prison for it.

524
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,780
This is what we deserve.

525

Honey.

526
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,310
We need money

527
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,310
to support our lives.

528
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,030
In the future, our son

529
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,470
will go to high school

530
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,590
and then college.

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,540
He'll get married.

532
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,160
Which of these doesn't require money?

533
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,550
We have to

534
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,550
spend this money.

535
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,400
Honey.

536
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,030
I've sworn

537
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,760
I won't let you live a hard life anymore.

538
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,440
I want you to have a good life with me.

539
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,250
With these words of yours,

540
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,720
it's worth the 10 years

541
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,480
I've waited for you.

542
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,140
I'm not afraid of hardship.

543
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,750
I just want to be steady with you

544
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,680
and take good care of our business.

545
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,790
Even though we are

546
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,010
poor and live in a small house,

547
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,480
I'm not afraid.

548
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,080
We can still support our child
to finish school.

549
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,880
But this money,

550
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,710
we absolutely can't spend it.

551
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,160
Dad.

552
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,320
Try it. How's the food I made?

553
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,160
Okay.

554
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:27,830
Eat.

555
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,490
Okay.

556
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,440
Okay, that's enough.

557
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,750
Okay.

558
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,680
Delicious.

Look, what's this?

560
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,110
I bought you a new phone.

561
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,240
It'll be convenient to contact each other
if anything comes up in the future.

562
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,870
A phone?

563
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,060
Take a look.

564
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,310
Why doesn't the phone have buttons?

565
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,720
Dad,

566
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,680
phones don't use buttons anymore.

567
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,030
They all use touchscreens now.

568
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,890
Touchscreens?

569
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,540
How do I make calls?

570
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,960
Come here, kid.

571
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,840
Install some applications for your dad.

572
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,270
Okay.

573
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,240
This is a phone book.

574
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,040
You can make a call by tapping it.

575
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Then you tap this.

576
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,210
Scroll down.

577
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,000
Camera.

578
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,640
It's for taking photos.

579
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,690
It can even take pictures.

580
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,400
Let's take one.

581
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,530
Come on. Let's do it.

582
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,930
Mom, look here.

583
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,370
-Let me see.
-Who is it?

584
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,280
Who is it?

585
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,750
Look at yourself.

586
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,250
Yan Xiaowu.

587
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,870
There's something we need you
to come to the station for

588
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,000
to cooperate with the investigation.

589
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,010
What's the matter now?

590
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,110
We'll talk about it at the station.

591
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,830
It's nothing.

592
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,930
Don't worry.

593
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,350
I'll be back soon.

594
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,430
Take this.

595
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,200
Bao.

596
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,250
Have dinner with your mom.

597
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,120
Let's go.

598
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:23,880
Dad.

599
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,200
Mr. Mu.

600
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,580
Captain Qi.

601
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,070
Here on business?

602
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,030
Are you heading out?

603
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,360
Well, it's like this.

604
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,790
We've encountered a tricky case.

605
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,590
We need the help of an expert like you.

606
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
What kind of case?

607
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,760
Let's discuss it in detail at the station,
shall we?

608
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,880
What's the nature of it?

609
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,810
Tell me clearly.

610
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,400
So my wife won't worry.

611
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,960
Take a look at this,

612
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,000
and you'll understand.

613
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,880
A summons?

614
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,070
The detention time for a summons
won't exceed 24 hours.

615
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,270
Shulan, don't worry.

616
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,400
I'll be back soon.

617
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,400
We have a car.

618
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,280
Alright.

619
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:29,850
Please.

620
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,850
Let's go.

621
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,110
I bought that book of yours.

622
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,280
It's well-written.

623
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,760
How can I let you pay?

624
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,350
-Of course.
-I can give you one for free.

625
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,070
I'll reimburse you for whatever you spent.

626
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,590
Xiaowu.

627
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,950
When did you get out?

628
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,400
You didn't even contact me.

629
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,570
Just got out.

630
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,520
Haven't seen you in 10 years.

631
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,760
I really missed you.

632
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,310
You've got white hair too.

633
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,790
We've both grown old.

634
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,050
Old acquaintances.

635
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Then we have a lot to talk about.

636
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,410
Let's go inside.

637
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,870
Take our time.

638
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,300
We'll catch up.

639
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll go in first.

640
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,450
Let's go.

641
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,350
I didn't expect

642
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,780
that you were so close to Yan Xiaowu.

643
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,940
Captain Qi,

644
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,100
do you have any friends?

645
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,640
Of course I do,

646
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,050
but not many.

647
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,700
We're the same.

648
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,190
Making friends needs real honesty.

649
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,000
Watering a tree should
start from its roots.

650
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,510
Whether someone is a true friend

651
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,770
can only be seen when you're down and out.

652
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,290
Come to think of it,

653
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,320
for most of my life,

654
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,150
I was down on my luck.

655
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,280
But I've been fortunate enough

656
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,940
to marry a kind-hearted woman

657
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,600
and make a few true buddies.

658
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,030
Yan Xiaowu is one of them.

659
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,480
I remember

660
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,590
when I asked you in prison before,

661
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,510
you said you didn't have much to do
with Mu Jianhui.

662
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,550
But just now outside,

663
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,230
you two didn't look like strangers.

664
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,480
Anyone can say nice things.

665
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,830
If we were really that close,

666
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,970
I was in prison for 10 years,

667
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,060
yet he didn't even come to see me.

668
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,370
It's not that he didn't want to visit you.

669
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,360
He was deliberately avoiding suspicion.

670
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,330
Yan Xiaowu,

671
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,790
let me tell you the truth.

672
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,300
We've understood the situation.

673
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,320
Wang Jiahao,

674
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,550
the one you call King Hua,

675
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,200
has confessed everything.

676
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,230
Back then,

677
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,440
the person who sold

678
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,930
the black pottery figurine to him

679
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,480
wasn't you at all.

680
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
It was Mu Jianhui.

681
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,480
Right?

682
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,840
You see, this Mu Jianhui

683
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,440
didn't hide his friendship with you

684
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,190
at all, did he?

685
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,670
Mu Jianhui

686
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,030
indeed

687
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,610
helped me a lot.

688
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,800
I heard that

689
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,650
when Yan Xiaowu was young,

690
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,550
he

691
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,460
stole his mother's dowry

692
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,590
to spend on his buddy.

693
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,400
That buddy wouldn't happen to be you,
would it?

694
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,890
This kind of plot only happens in movies.

695
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,330
How could it possibly happen to me?

696
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,660
Xiaowu was competitive when he was young.

697
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,150
He was the ringleader of the kids.

698
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,920
What he did was just his way
of trying to be the ringleader

699
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,440
by winning over

700
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,170
those little kids, that's all.

701
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,160
Didn't you guys find out?

702
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,800
He was actually the one
who bullied me the most back then.

703
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,280
What?

704
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,130
Bullied you?

705
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,840
Back then, except for Shulan,

706
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,440
who in the factory didn't bully me?

707
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,880
That's weird.

708
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,290
Then how did you two become friends again?

709
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,230
It's a long story.

710
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,760
That year, Yan Xiaowu's mother
got heart disease.

711
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,920
To raise money for the surgery,

712
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,550
he begged everyone in the factory.

713
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,470
He almost kowtowed to everyone.

714
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,760
Those who used to be

715
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,400
so close to him,

716
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,590
treated him as their big brother,

717
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,360
and ate and drank with him every day,

718
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,020
as close as if they shared
the same pair of pants,

719
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,150
all disappeared overnight.

720
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,150
That day,

721
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,590
I bought my mom her favorite egg cake.

722
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,000
After that,

723
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,840
I went to the bathroom

724
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,930
and cried my heart out.

725
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,000
I was about to take her home

726
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,750
to wait for her death.

727
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,360
Who knew

728
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,030
a nurse came to tell me

729
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,230
someone had paid the surgery fee for me.

730
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,070
It couldn't have been Mu Jianhui,
could it?

731
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,670
He brought me

732
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,190
all his money.

733
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,110
The surgery fee

734
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,930
was just enough.

735
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,430
Well,

736
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,280
why would you give everything

737
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,800
to help someone

738
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,880
who bullied you the most?

739
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,690
Maybe I'm just good
at putting myself in others' shoes.

740
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,110
Even though my own life wasn't great,

741
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,530
I still couldn't bear
to see others suffer.

742
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,280
Anyway, I was all alone,

743
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,510
and I didn't have many expenses.

744
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,840
Money was the least useful thing to me.

745
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,780
Well...

746
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,320
You're so virtuous.

747
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,440
Were you born

748
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,030
to be kind

749
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,710
and compassionate,

750
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,280
or did you learn

751
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,400
from Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism,

752
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,950
or something like them later?

753
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,080
I don't know either.

754
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
This is really rare.

755
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,510
But

756
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,800
why do I feel

757
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,380
there might be other possibilities?

758
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,450
Tell me what you think.

759
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,280
For example,

760
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,760
you think

761
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,220
controlling human nature

762
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,930
is fun.

763
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,230
Do you?

764
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,200
Captain Qi,

765
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,570
why do you think that way?

766
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,180
Well,

767
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,720
it's just a feeling.

768
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,440
Because I can't understand it.

769
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,920
Not holding a grudge

770
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,960
is already great.

771
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,640
But you repaid evil with kindness
and gave away everything you had.

772
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
I think

773
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,630
it must be that you

774
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,170
understand Yan Xiaowu,

775
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,320
so you can

776
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,070
control his mind.

777
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,650
I don't know what method

778
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,480
you used.

779
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,030
But anyway,

780
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,360
you made him willingly

781
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,880
take the blame

782
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,030
and go to jail for you.

783
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,350
Am I right?

784
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,650
Are you kidding me?

785
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,480
How would I know

786
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,250
what law Yan Xiaowu violated?

787
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,920
King Hua has confessed.

788
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,800
King Hua?

789
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,920
What King Hua?

790
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,180
King Hua has been arrested.

791
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,710
He's confessed everything.

792
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,710
Ten years ago,

793
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,030
the one who sold him the black
pottery figurine wasn't Yan Xiaowu

794
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,550
but you.
