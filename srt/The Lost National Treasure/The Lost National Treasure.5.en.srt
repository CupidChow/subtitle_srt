[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,680
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:54,930
Sir.

4
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,560
How dare you steal right under my nose?
What are you up to?

5
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,280
Dacang and the others are here, aren't they?

6
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,080
They'll definitely back you up.

7
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,430
But first, have them
identify the tomb-raiding site.

8
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,960
Let's go.

9
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,120
Make him identify
the tomb-raiding site first.

10
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,650
Let's go.

11
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,960
You thief.

12
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,460
Come on, move aside.

13
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,810
Let's go.

14
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,280
Let's go.

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,420
Is this the cornfield?

16
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,250
Where is it?

17
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,560
It should be around here, I guess.

18
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,620
"You guess"? Think carefully.

19
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,870
Officer,

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,960
I came here at night.

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,710
Give me a moment.

22
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,870
Right.

23
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,720
There's a mound over there.

24
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
Is it here?

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,380
It's not far from where Heisa was buried.

26
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,050
Officer,

27
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,500
take a look.

28
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,030
It should be here.

29
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,110
Captain Qi.

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,710
Should be?

31
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,440
What's here?

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,079
Take a look.

33
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,160
-Shovel.
-Coming.

34
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,860
There's something.

35
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,230
It's hard.

36
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,810
Something wooden.

37
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:52,970
Be careful.

38
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,020
Come on.

39
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,240
Watch your step.

40
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,260
Ready? One, two, three!

41
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,290
Be careful.

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,020
Be careful.

43
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,570
Come on,

44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,810
pull harder!

45
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,790
Alright, give it a good pull.

46
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,720
There really is a looting pit here.

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,380
Be careful.

48
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,870
It's deep.

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,420
We'll need the blower.

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,600
Sir, did you bring it?

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,870
Yes. Let's go.

52
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,390
Get those two to come with me to fetch it.

53
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,360
Du, you two.

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,070
Hurry up.

55
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,800
Step back.

56
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,159
Uncle Shoucun, don't move.

57
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,850
The police are here.

58
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,750
Are you sure?

59
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,610
Uncle Shoucun.

60
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,760
How far is this from the Dou Mausoleum?

61
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,070
About a kilometer.

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,950
What's wrong?

63
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,610
Captain Qi.

64
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,190
Is something off?

65
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,920
Take a photo.

66
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,430
Based on standard practice,

67
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,740
the area where pottery figurines are buried

68
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,430
should be only about 500 to 600 meters
from the Dou Mausoleum.

69
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,960
Why is this spot so far away?

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,450
And it's much deeper than
the usual outer burial pit.

71
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,830
What are you suggesting?

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,430
Hard to say.

73
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,250
How about I go down and
check it out in a bit?

74
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,480
No way.

75
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,400
It's fine.

76
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,090
You're just an intern.

77
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,160
You don't have the experience.
That won't do.

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
I haven't done it myself,

79
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,950
but I know how it's done.

80
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,360
Absolutely not. I told you...

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,830
Mr. Zan.

82
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,830
-What are you doing?
-Captain Qi, it's me.

83
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,950
Let me through, Captain Qi.

84
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,600
Let him in.

85
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,810
Absolutely not.

86
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,350
Fang Kun, what are you doing?

87
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,270
Thank you for your hard work.

88
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,930
Professor.

89
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,730
Captain Qi.

90
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,510
Where's the looting pit?

91
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,950
It's just been identified.

92
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,630
Director Zhang.

93
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,890
Thank you, Captain Qi.

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,480
Thank you.

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,610
Who told you to come?

96
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,630
Professor Zan.

97
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,120
Coming.

98
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,320
It's right here.

99
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,920
Be careful.

100
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,950
It's really deep.

101
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,920
We don't know how deep it is yet.

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,600
We don't even know what's down there.

103
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,830
Yet you want to go down?

104
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,760
Don't blame him.

105
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,000
I was the one who called Fang Kun here.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,070
Luckily, he's been on-site

107
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,430
these past few days.

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,270
He helped me find some key clues.

109
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
Otherwise, I'd be completely in the dark.

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,000
You're fortunate to have
such a capable student.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's right.

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
You've got no business here.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,880
Go back and write a self-criticism report.

114
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,310
What are you still standing around for?

115
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:26,560
Go.

116
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,330
Alright.

117
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,110
Wang Taiping,

118
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,100
how deep was the excavation here?

119
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,270
There's no way to measure it precisely.

120
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,040
Anyway, it's extremely deep.

121
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,780
Captain Qi,

122
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,760
This pit is way too deep.

123
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,020
We should call the fire department
for assistance.

124
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,110
Lower it down.

125
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,190
Be careful. Lower it down.

126
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,450
Be careful. Lower it slowly. Keep going.

127
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,310
Lower it down.

128
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,070
Be careful.

129
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,290
Lower it slowly.

130
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,070
Lower it down.

131
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,430
Lower it down.

132
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,090
Keep going.

133
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,820
Keep going.

134
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,550
Lower it down.

135
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,380
Lower it down. Keep going.

136
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
Hold on a second.

137
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,310
Pull me up.

138
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,320
How does it look?

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,510
The tomb passage is completely flooded.

140
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,310
Flooded?

141
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,930
Groundwater must have seeped in.

142
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,190
This is bad.

143
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,630
If it's flooded,

144
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,720
we won't be able to access the entrance.

145
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,190
Here are the soil samples
you asked for, Professor.

146
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,650
Well, Professor Zan, here's the situation.

147
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,330
We're in a bit of a bind.

148
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,590
They only have three days left.

149
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,040
Can you see if there's any way
to use these soil samples

150
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,770
and the materials we currently have

151
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,090
to come up with a temporary solution?

152
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,600
Alright,

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,580
I'll start by testing the soil samples
for carbon-14 dating.

154
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,020
Alright.

155
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,870
Captain Qi.

156
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,670
Captain Yang.

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,930
Here's the plan:

158
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,720
I'll work with the students

159
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,820
to sort and translate the case files first,

160
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,550
then compile everything
and submit it together.

161
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,909
Mu.

162
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Big Head, Shan Wa.

163
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,570
You need something?

164
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,970
Sheng's looking for you.

165
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,890
For appraisal?

166
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,960
You'll find out when you get there.

167
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,170
Alright, get in the car.

168
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,270
Take mine.

169
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I'll bring you back when we're done.

170
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,770
Ride in your car?

171
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,180
Big Head.

172
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
This isn't the way to Sheng's place.

173
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,600
Well, Sheng never said
we were going to his place.

174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,330
It's all wilderness up ahead.
Where are we going?

175
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,820
Relax, we're almost there.

176
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,380
Have one.

177
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,630
No thanks.

178
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,430
Sir, I was wrong. Please stop hitting me!

179
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,570
Stop hitting me!

180
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,120
Sir!

181
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,050
Who stole my goods?

182
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,080
I was wrong, sir!

183
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,400
I was wrong.

184
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,720
I was wrong.

185
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,620
-I'll kowtow to you, sir.
-If I don't teach you a lesson,

186
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,440
you'd really think you could outlast me.

187
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,670
-I wouldn't.
-Come on.

188
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,150
I was wrong.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,870
Which hand did you use to steal my goods?

190
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,600
Brother-in-law, you're here.

191
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,390
Come.

192
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,600
Is that Xiaowu?

193
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,270
Didn't expect that, huh?

194
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,390
Sheng, what's going on?

195
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,120
Called you here to watch a show.

196
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,630
Watch closely.

197
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,870
If you want to keep
those thieving hands of yours,

198
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,200
there might be a way out.

199
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,000
Tell me who took you

200
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,720
to steal the goods,

201
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,360
and I'll let you go
but chop off his hands instead.

202
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
No matter what,

203
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,910
I need to take two thieving hands.

204
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,210
If not yours,

205
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,240
then his.

206
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,150
Zhaohu, hurry up.

207
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,320
I've got a card game scheduled.

208
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Shan Wa, Big Head.

209
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,600
Sir, I was wrong.

210
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,780
I was wrong, Sheng!

211
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,550
I was wrong!

212
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,120
I have a child.

213
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,820
I have... I have a child.

214
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,030
I was wrong. Please spare my life!

215
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,050
Come on, hurry up.

216
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,550
I have a child!

217
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,410
Here, press it.

218
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,150
-I was wrong!
-Hu.

219
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,080
Sheng.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,860
The show's almost over, isn't it?

221
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,960
You've already figured out

222
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
that I stole the goods, haven't you?

223
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,480
I'll take responsibility for my own actions.

224
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,080
I admit it.

225
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,500
He was just someone I hired to do the job.

226
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,230
Let him go.

227
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,970
So it really was you.

228
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,800
Always bowing your head to others,

229
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,440
always looking so pathetic.

230
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,510
But you're just pretending.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh, my dear brother-in-law.

232
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,630
How many jobs have I
found for you over the years?

233
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,550
How much extra money have I helped you earn?

234
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,080
Nothing you eat or drink
isn't provided by me.

235
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Even the car you drive belongs to me.

236
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,590
Without me, you'd be jobless.

237
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,250
We can't just go around
without a conscience, can we?

238
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,390
And my sister—the factory's famous beauty—

239
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,170
she was living comfortably in our home

240
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,020
until she fell for your lies,

241
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,120
insisting on following you
and living off scraps.

242
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,910
Such a good woman,

243
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,440
and you've made her
look like a fragile, sickly girl.

244
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,390
What did my family ever owe you

245
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,840
to deserve a betrayal like this?

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,510
You're really terrible.

247
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,760
Before, you pretended to

248
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,000
plead for us

249
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,270
and nearly made me the scapegoat.

250
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
Liu Shusheng,

251
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,850
I've done the deed.

252
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,130
Kill me or cut me up, it's your call.

253
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,160
Make it quick. No need for words.

254
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,280
Gunner, remind him of the rules.

255
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,630
Anyone who betrays the team
gets buried alive.

256
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,930
By the rules, you should be
buried alive for this.

257
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
But we're family, after all.

258
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,620
For my sister's sake,
I'll show mercy this time.

259
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,200
Bury him for me,

260
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,120
and I'll spare your life.

261
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,890
Bury him!

262
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,960
Brother!

263
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
-Help me!
-Get up!

264
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,150
Help me!

265
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Brother, help me!

266
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,840
I was wrong! I won't go in!

267
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,870
I won't go in!

268
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,080
I don't want to die! I was wrong!

269
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,960
I was wrong!

270
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,010
I was wrong! I won't go in!

271
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,580
I won't go in!

272
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,360
Liu!

273
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,180
Liu!

274
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,020
Mu, help me!

275
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,150
Help me!

276
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
Liu!

277
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,150
I'll haunt you even as a ghost!

278
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,320
Liu!

279
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,540
Liu!

280
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,680
Brother!

281
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,480
Brother!

282
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,510
Brother!

283
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,630
Brother!

284
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,550
It's just death.

285
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,130
I, Mu Jianhui, don't betray my brothers.

286
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,800
Brother.

287
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,070
Why did you come down too?

288
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,730
You're my brother.

289
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,240
If we're to die, then we die together.

290
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,590
Bury them.

291
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,790
Liu!

292
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,120
Liu!

293
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,040
I'll haunt you even as a ghost!

294
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,630
Shusheng.

295
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,200
Shusheng.

296
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,820
Wake up, quick.

297
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,670
What's going on?

298
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,800
Your sister is here.

299
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,040
Tell her I'm not home.

300
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,330
She saw your car

301
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,150
and refused to leave.

302
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,150
What can I do?

303
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,340
Get up now.

304
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,030
Hurry up.

305
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
Why are you here so early?

306
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,870
Where's my husband?

307
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,130
How would I know?

308
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,500
He didn't come home all night last night.

309
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,240
His phone is still unreachable.

310
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,930
I knew it. When a man doesn't come home,

311
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,660
either he's run off on his own,

312
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,520
or he's run off with someone else.

313
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,670
If he were that kind of person,

314
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,290
I wouldn't be here looking for him.

315
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,120
Then let's just wait
and see if he comes back.

316
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,430
I'm back, aren't I?

317
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,840
Brother-in-law, you...

318
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,420
Shulan,

319
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,180
why are you here?

320
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,560
Where have you been?

321
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,980
How did you get yourself in this state?

322
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,840
Don't pat me. I'm covered in dirt.

323
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,950
It's alright.

324
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,500
I was negotiating a big deal last night.

325
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,750
Don't worry.

326
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,860
I'm going to wash my face now.

327
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,710
Feng, help my sister upstairs for a bit.

328
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,250
Sister.

329
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,270
Let's go upstairs and rest for a while.

330
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,750
Come on.

331
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,530
Just ignore him.

332
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:22,880
This way.

333
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,570
There's a staircase here, be careful.

334
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,690
Where did Yan Xiaowu go?

335
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,450
He can go wherever he wants.

336
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,330
That's none of my business.

337
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,280
Fu Xiaoli, don't give me that attitude.

338
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,720
Your husband committed a crime.

339
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,810
If you knew and didn't report it,
that's aiding and abetting.

340
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,290
I'm about to divorce him anyway.

341
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,610
You think I'm stupid enough
to cover for him?

342
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,339
Whether he's dead or alive
is none of my business.

343
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:08,940
Come in.

344
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,540
Yan Xiaowu turned himself in.

345
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,050
How did you get out?

346
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,580
Your man rescued us.

347
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,640
Gunner.

348
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,150
Who told you to rescue us?

349
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,500
I decided to rescue you on my own.

350
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,030
Why?

351
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,420
I don't know either.

352
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,550
Maybe because you're a good person.

353
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,200
Another traitor.

354
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
You can never keep people loyal.

355
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,880
Is it your problem or others'?

356
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,280
Mu Jianhui, cut the crap.

357
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,440
If I could kill you once,

358
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,610
I can do it again.

359
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,470
If you find the journey
to the underworld lonely,

360
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll have Gunner keep you company.

361
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,170
I don't think you have the guts.

362
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,680
If you knew where Yan Xiaowu is now,

363
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,520
would you still be laughing?

364
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:46,570
What?

365
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,750
Should I burn some paper money
and shed a few tears for him?

366
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,950
He turned himself in.

367
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,750
I told him everything you've done
all these years.

368
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,350
If you make a move,

369
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,820
he'll spill everything to the police.

370
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,580
Where were you on the ninth day
of the first lunar month this year?

371
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,680
I went to Bailu Plain with Wang Taiping.

372
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,270
We watched the Shehuo performance.

373
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,510
When it got dark,

374
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,510
we went to Yin Village

375
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,510
to loot the grave.

376
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,820
Whose grave were you looting?

377
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,030
I don't know.

378
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,890
You don't know?

379
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,810
If you didn't know,

380
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,440
how did you know
where the tomb raiding was happening?

381
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
I heard about it on the black market.

382
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,270
How many people were there?

383
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,240
Did you see clearly?

384
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,840
Around four or five, I think.

385
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,260
It was too dark.

386
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,600
I couldn't see clearly.

387
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,250
Tell me, what was the inside
of the tomb like?

388
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,240
It was quite

389
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,410
spacious inside.

390
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,130
There wasn't much,

391
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
just some black pottery figurines.

392
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,940
How many?

393
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Over two hundred.

394
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,190
So, what did you do with
those black pottery figurines?

395
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,770
I sold a hundred of them to King Hua.

396
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,250
He gave me 10,000 yuan.

397
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,440
You sold a hundred to King Hua

398
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
and only got 10,000 yuan?

399
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,300
What's wrong with that?

400
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,440
Did I get ripped off?

401
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,030
What are you thinking about?

402
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,440
You should be reflecting on what you did,

403
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,230
not worrying about
whether you made a good deal or not.

404
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,640
Yes.

405
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,840
You're right. I was wrong.

406
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,860
Did you sell them to him directly?

407
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,350
How did you get to know him?

408
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,750
I didn't know him before.

409
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,090
I just spread the word on the black market
that I had a batch of goods,

410
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,480
and he came looking for me.

411
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,440
King Hua, right?

412
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,160
Yes.

413
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,080
Do you know his name,
phone number, or address?

414
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,160
No, I don't.

415
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,240
He's the one who found me.

416
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,090
As long as you agree to my two conditions,

417
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,480
Yan Xiaowu won't get you involved,

418
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
not even a little.

419
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,450
Tell me, what are the conditions?

420
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,860
I want that batch of bronze
you dug up last time.

421
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,880
Are you blackmailing me?

422
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,370
All these years, for the goods
I've appraised for you,

423
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,160
you always treated me like a beggar,

424
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,620
throwing me just 200 yuan.

425
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,000
Now I'm just claiming
what's rightfully mine.

426
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
If I hadn't shown you the ropes,

427
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,070
you would have starved to death long ago.

428
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,720
Everyone takes what they need.

429
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,380
Don't act all high and mighty.

430
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,250
Are you giving it to me or not?

431
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,210
Fine.

432
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,500
Second condition:

433
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,550
I want the Gunner.

434
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,010
He's just a lackey anyway.

435
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,400
If you don't take him with you,
I'll kill him myself and feast on his flesh.

436
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,030
How did you know

437
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,580
someone would be
raiding the tomb near Yin Village?

438
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,250
Because I don't know
how to blast tombs open.

439
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,480
I can only loot them after they're opened.

440
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,960
So I had to rely on the hard way—

441
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,480
asking around, moving from place to place,

442
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,760
and hoping for some luck.

443
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,200
Whatever I came across was what I got.

444
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,680
If I found nothing,
I'd go home empty-handed.

445
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,810
Those few days, I just happened to
come across this tomb.

446
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,720
Just happened to? That's some lucky break.

447
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,310
Half of it is luck,

448
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,160
and half is hard work.

449
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,410
I've been searching for a year or two,

450
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,010
and this is the only one I've come across.

451
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,030
Officer,

452
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,680
I'm a first-time offender.

453
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,350
I only made 10,000 yuan.

454
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,450
I've already turned myself in.

455
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,070
Could you go easy on me?

456
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,590
Yan Xiaowu,

457
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,630
leniency comes from full confession.

458
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,960
Tell me everything.

459
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,400
You've been talking for a while,
but it doesn't sound like a real confession.

460
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,930
Where did the pit come from?

461
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
You're not telling the truth.

462
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,020
You're not telling the truth
about King Hua either.

463
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,350
I... I'm telling the truth.

464
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,350
How could I not be telling the truth?

465
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,920
I've already turned myself in.

466
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,750
There's no reason for me to lie.

467
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,880
Are there any other accomplices?

468
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,920
No, just Wang Taiping.

469
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,390
Let's go.

470
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,190
Sis.

471
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,180
Don't ever say my money is dirty again.

472
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,650
Walk in the middle.

473
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,070
Shulan, come here.

474
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,490
Come up.

475
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,070
Come on.

476
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,540
It's all my fault.

477
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,470
Don't talk nonsense.

478
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,350
We're going to buy a house in a few days.

479
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,140
In Chaoyang district.

480
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,220
What's with the wounds and dirt on you?

481
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,270
These wounds...

482
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,210
After Wang Taiping got arrested,

483
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,830
I was really anxious.

484
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,680
I didn't dare go home.

485
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,840
I was hiding all over the place.

486
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,790
Even spent a night hiding out in Nanshan.

487
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,110
It was dark. I couldn't see the path,
and I stumbled.

488
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,310
That's how I ended up looking like this.

489
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,280
You said you gave part of the goods
to King Hua.

490
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,400
What about the other
black pottery figurines?

491
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,630
I hid them in a village on the outskirts.

492
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,460
What are you doing?

493
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,310
I've got some pebbles in my shoe.

494
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,840
Just getting rid of them.

495
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,730
Let's go.

496
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,330
Where is it?

497
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,110
There's a ladder here.

498
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,030
Go up from there.

499
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,550
Let's go.

500
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,780
Be careful.

501
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,210
Captain Qi, we found it.

502
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,050
The police can only close the case
if you're behind bars.

503
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,670
You'll have to bear with it for two years.

504
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
But I promise you,

505
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,720
this prison time won't be for nothing.

506
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,630
Don't worry about your wife and child.

507
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,770
They'll have every comfort they deserve—

508
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,900
even more than most,

509
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,030
never less.

510
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,300
Chief Zhao,

511
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,610
it wasn't easy.

512
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,780
Congratulations.

513
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,480
You finally closed the case
before the deadline.

514
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,070
Yes,

515
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,320
thankfully.

516
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,030
If the suspect hadn't turned himself in,

517
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,350
it would've been a real problem.

518
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,200
Solving cases really is a lot
like our archaeological work.

519
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Besides professional skills,

520
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,070
you need a bit of luck too.

521
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,920
Exactly.

522
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,640
By the way,
how's the translation coming along

523
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,700
for the cultural relics department?

524
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,480
Professor Zan is working overtime on it.

525
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,410
It should be finished on schedule.

526
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,820
Professor.

527
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,030
Look.

528
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,100
There's still a fragrance.

529
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,170
It's milder than sandalwood.

530
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,730
You can only smell it if you sniff at it.

531
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,480
Why are you here?

532
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,550
The case is already closed.

533
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,510
Why the long face?

534
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,660
Who are you trying to
impress with that look?

535
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,470
Something about Yan Xiaowu's confession

536
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,510
feels off.

537
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,520
What do you mean?

538
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,640
The dust and injuries on him

539
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,770
looked suspicious.

540
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,000
Also,

541
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,980
when he took me to
identify the black pottery figurines...

542
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,550
I don't think he was the one who hid them.

543
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,940
But we don't have time
to dwell on the details right now.

544
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,310
We managed to catch two looters

545
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,680
but got nothing useful out of them.

546
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Still no leads on the tomb raiders.

547
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,920
King Hua,

548
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,850
no leads either.

549
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,930
Dacang, here's the situation:

550
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,920
Although we haven't caught the tomb raiders

551
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,200
or King Hua,

552
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,480
we've recovered most of

553
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,490
the black pottery figurines.

554
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,770
Let's set this case aside for now.

555
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,160
Go home, get some rest.

556
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,880
We need clear heads moving forward.

557
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,000
You haven't been home in a month, have you?

558
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,460
You do have a wife
waiting at home, remember?

559
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,170
I probably would've forgotten

560
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,050
if you hadn't reminded me.

561
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,610
Uncle Shoucun.

562
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,780
Uncle Shoucun.

563
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,240
Kun, why are you back again?

564
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,920
I came to ask for your help.

565
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,130
What is it?

566
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,270
Help me measure the distance
from the looting pit to the Dou Mausoleum.

567
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,280
What?

568
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,340
[Looting Pit] [800 meters] [Dou Mausoleum]

569
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,750
Kun,

570
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,150
this is the center of the Dou Mausoleum.

571
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,340
We should take our measurements
up to this point.

572
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,990
Right.

573
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,880
Have you figured it out yet?

574
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,870
How far did you measure?

575
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,960
You're spot on.

576
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,410
It's almost a kilometer.

577
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,920
You see, I usually

578
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,310
patrol around here. I know the area well.

579
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,730
Why are you measuring the distance

580
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,590
from the looting pit to this spot?

581
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,530
Uncle Shoucun, here's the thing.

582
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,180
This imperial tomb is
kind of like a bowl of saozi noodles.

583
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,270
The main tomb

584
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,780
is like the noodles,

585
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,780
There are many outer burial pits
around the main tomb.

586
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,310
These outer pits are
where the burial goods are placed.

587
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,510
So usually, when we find a looting pit near the Dou Mausoleum,

588
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,790
we reasonably assume

589
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,550
one of the outer pits has been robbed.

590
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,550
But typically,

591
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,110
the distance between
an outer burial pit and the main tomb

592
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,510
is no more than 400 to 500 meters.

593
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,850
Based on our measurements,

594
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,510
this looting pit is clearly
much farther away

595
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,970
from the main tomb, right?

596
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,710
So what you're saying is,

597
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,920
if I'm eating noodles at
Qi Youliang's house,

598
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,320
it doesn't make any sense

599
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,750
for the diced meat
to end up in my own house.

600
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,210
Am I right?

601
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,160
You're really smart!

602
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,270
Who says you're silly all the time?

603
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,000
Who says I'm silly?

604
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,260
They're the silly one!

605
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,860
Right, Heizui?

606
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Let's take a photo

607
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,500
to record this.

608
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,460
There's so much stuff in your bag.

609
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,860
Uncle Youliang.

610
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:58,970
Xiaoman.

611
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,920
Fang Kun.

612
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,830
-What are you doing here?
-Where's...

613
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,890
-Where's your dad?

614
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,440
He's at home.

615
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,770
He is?

616
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,720
Dad.

617
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,620
Fang Kun is here to see you.

618
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,680
Uncle Youliang.

619
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,210
Who is it?

620
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,440
Fang Kun.

621
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,960
Didn't that old man kick you out?

622
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,370
Why are you back again?

623
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,790
You rascal—

624
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,790
no teeth left,

625
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,590
but still chewing on hard beans.

626
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,640
Come in.

627
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,790
What hard beans have I eaten?

628
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,310
I brought you some braised beef

629
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,030
and two bottles of liquor

630
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,360
to drink with you today.

631
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,180
Drink what?

632
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,410
I'm afraid that no-name liquor of yours

633
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,720
will just give me heartburn.

634
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,790
What do you mean?

635
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,110
This is good stuff.

636
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,820
Not long ago, I ate
and stayed at your place.

637
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,670
It must have caused you a lot of trouble.

638
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,470
I came by specially to thank you.

639
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,700
No need to be so polite.

640
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,880
Actually, I came today to ask you something.

641
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,720
I was looking at this photo
and the location in it.

642
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,520
Doesn't it look a lot like
where our looting pit is?

643
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,510
This one.

644
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,600
Yeah, it does look kind of similar.

645
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,270
That photo was taken decades ago.

646
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,210
An official from the county came by,

647
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,950
and said they were taking photos
for the county records or something.

648
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,110
I was working in the fields

649
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,580
with my grandpa at the time.

650
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,330
He told me to take a picture,

651
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,130
so I said sure.

652
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,850
That photo's got to be

653
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,110
over fifty years old by now.

654
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,600
When I look at it closely,

655
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,320
it's not that similar anymore.

656
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,620
Look at the slope behind.

657
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,240
It's gone now where the looting pit is.

658
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,030
What do you mean there's no slope?

659
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,920
That was the feng shui mound.

660
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,830
I remember it clearly.

661
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,560
It's been over a hundred years.

662
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,440
I see.

663
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,910
Then why was that slope flattened?

664
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,790
Back then,

665
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,560
the fields were all uneven,

666
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,870
and wheat wouldn't grow.

667
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,200
I borrowed soil from everywhere,

668
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,860
even from the imperial tombs.

669
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,890
That slope must have been flattened
when we took the soil.

670
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,830
Are you sure?

671
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,490
I was still young back then,

672
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,420
so I only remember things vaguely.

673
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,170
The village elders
would definitely remember.

674
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,620
That feng shui mound area...

675
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,550
I remember there used to be a slope there.

676
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,300
It was leveled later
when they filled in the land.

677
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,110
What's the price?

678
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,810
One hundred and fifty.

679
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,710
Uncle,

680
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,730
are you kidding me?

681
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,409
Liu Shusheng only asked for a hundred.

682
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,710
Why are you charging one hundred and fifty?

683
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,440
It's definitely worth a hundred.

684
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,880
The extra fifty is for my brother.

685
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,030
I had him take the blame for you

686
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,550
and handle the issue
with the black pottery figurines,

687
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,520
so you can return to Qinchuan
and continue your business.

688
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,850
Is fifty too expensive?

689
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,840
Not expensive at all.

690
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,460
I was just kidding.

691
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:13,840
Uncle,

692
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,640
you handled this matter beautifully.

693
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,400
Really.

694
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,720
Not only did you help me out of trouble,

695
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,320
but you also dealt with Liu Shusheng.

696
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,370
That's really impressive.

697
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,550
Uncle,

698
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,230
I owe you a favor.

699
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,960
I'll remember this.

700
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,020
What favor? Don't mention it.

701
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,920
I just want to be your friend.

702
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,400
We are friends.

703
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,870
Doing business isn't a problem,

704
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,560
but you should know that

705
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,760
most of my goods before

706
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,630
came from Liu Shusheng.

707
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,480
You have too few goods now.

708
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,750
So,

709
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,280
I still need to continue
cooperating with him.

710
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,550
Without my appraisal,

711
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,040
do you dare to take

712
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,540
the goods he collects?

713
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,710
Of course I know that,

714
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,840
but he has plenty of items
from excavation sites.

715
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,650
Don't worry.

716
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,110
You'll have as much
as you want in the future.

717
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,930
You're great at appraisal,

718
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,710
but excavation is a different game.

719
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,890
Every trade has its own tricks.

720
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,280
You get it?

721
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,700
How about this?

722
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,440
In ten days,

723
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,750
wait for the next batch of goods, okay?

724
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,320
Brother.

725
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,950
Has Liu Shusheng given you
any trouble these days?

726
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,510
No.

727
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,860
He's keeping his word, at least.

728
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,590
Here, take this.

729
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,360
What is it?

730
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,800
Brother, why are you giving me
so much money?

731
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,720
Take this hundred thousand first.

732
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,180
Get the explosives ready.

733
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,070
Buy shovels, probes, and blowers.

734
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,900
Once the time is right,

735
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,230
we'll act immediately.

736
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,070
We're not like Liu Shusheng's ragtag group.

737
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,980
We need to approach
tomb raiding and excavation

738
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,840
as a professional operation.

739
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,690
You'll be in charge of personnel
and technology.

740
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,820
I'll steer the ship.

741
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:26,880
Guang,

742
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,560
do you have capable people on your team?

743
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,840
Yes,

744
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,410
I know a few from the mine.
They're very skilled.

745
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Call them up and get them organized.

746
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,070
Got it.

747
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,550
Brother, have you found a big tomb?

748
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,320
Not yet.

749
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,280
Wait for my message.

750
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,630
The books are five yuan each.
Take as many as you like.

751
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,160
Don't touch anything else.

752
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,590
Master, this room is quite extraordinary.

753
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,590
You look a bit unfamiliar.

754
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,100
That's true. I haven't been here before.

755
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,780
Just starting out in the business?

756
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,710
I've actually been in the business
for quite a while.

757
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,510
Before,

758
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,590
I mainly helped with appraisals.

759
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,630
Recently, I got some extra cash,

760
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,070
and I want to make a big move.

761
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,070
I hope you can give me some guidance.

762
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,610
You think this is like
teaching a beginner how to play mahjong?

763
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,300
You want to go big on your first try?

764
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,300
I'm afraid I can't guide you.

765
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,130
This business runs deep
and is full of risks.

766
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,050
Enter at your own risk.

767
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,500
You'd better turn back.

768
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,350
Master, you're being too modest.

769
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,450
Before the New Year,

770
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,180
you casually mentioned
Yin Village on the plain,

771
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,500
and someone just struck a big haul there.

772
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,030
How do you know about it?

773
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,490
Don't be nervous, Master.

774
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,890
I've admired you for a long time, Master.

775
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,170
If I weren't short on cash,

776
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,400
I would have come to
pay my respects earlier.

777
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,800
I heard that your ancestors
looted the tomb of Yuan Tiangang,

778
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,760
the Tang dynasty feng shui master.

779
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,930
That really speaks to
your family's deep expertise.

780
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,030
Don't flatter me.

781
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,800
Back then,

782
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,170
it was my grandpa and uncle

783
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,590
who dug up Yuan Tiangang's tomb.

784
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,670
But my uncle didn't make it out alive.

785
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,530
Do you know why?

786
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,550
Why?

787
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,960
There was a sword suspended
from the ceiling of Yuan Tiangang's tomb.

788
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,510
After my uncle took out
all the burial treasures

789
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,360
from the tomb,

790
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,580
he wasn't satisfied.

791
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,600
He wanted to take the
suspended sword as well.

792
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,270
He used a knife to
cut the rope holding the sword,

793
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,230
which triggered the mechanism in the tomb.

794
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,840
The steel spikes sprang up,

795
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,180
turning my uncle into a sieve.

796
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,590
Since then,

797
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,800
my grandpa set two rules:

798
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,190
First,

799
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,880
descendants can only locate tombs

800
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,800
but not dig them.

801
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,340
Second,

802
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,110
those who seek tombs can't be greedy.

803
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,490
I can only say there's a tomb here,

804
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,930
but whether it's big or small,

805
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,110
deep or shallow,

806
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,730
and whether you can dig up a big haul

807
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,190
depends on your luck.

808
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,630
I understand.

809
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,440
Do you know my rates?

810
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,800
One hundred thousand per tomb.

811
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,710
Master Guanshan,

812
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,780
I'll take all three tombs.

813
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,850
Greed knows no bounds.

814
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,410
I brought the money, three hundred thousand.

815
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,250
It's in the car.

816
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,850
Young man, this is your first time,

817
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,010
and you're betting big.

818
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,210
I'm betting on my luck

819
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,030
and on your skills.

820
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,530
Hello?

821
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,160
Chief Wang.

822
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,400
Go ahead.

823
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,180
Okay.

824
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,480
Alright.

825
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:24,990
I understand.

826
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:34,870
Professor.

827
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,410
Today is the last day.

828
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,080
There shouldn't be
any new problems over there, right?

829
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,170
We just received the news.

830
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,270
They've agreed to return

831
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,190
those six black pottery figurines to us.

832
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,840
Really?

833
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,920
That's great!

834
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,800
Is it true?

835
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,860
That's wonderful!

836
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,300
Really?
