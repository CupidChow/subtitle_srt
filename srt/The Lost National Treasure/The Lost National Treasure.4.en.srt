[Episode 4]

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,710
See?

4
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,039
No wonder

5
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,020
people say things from old shops

6
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,370
really have something unique about them.

7
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,740
I haven't even opened the package yet,

8
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,600
but smell this.

9
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
The aroma is already coming
right through the bag.

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,430
His mother used to say

11
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,830
she couldn't live without this chicken
since she was a child.

12
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,020
If she was away for two days,

13
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,300
she'd start foaming at the mouth.

14
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,030
It smells so good.

15
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,700
A broth that's been perfected
over a century really is something else.

16
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,420
What a pity.

17
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,520
He won't confess. How can we enjoy it then?

18
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,360
Let's just wait and see.

19
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,510
How could I forget the very person
right in front of me?

20
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,170
Captain Qi,

21
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,840
there's a gravedigger named Gou Sheng.

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,280
I worked with him once before.

23
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
Earlier this year, I asked him
to score something big with me,

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,820
but he said he was busy.

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,440
He said he was working with
someone else out on the plains.

26
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,100
Captain Qi.

27
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,329
Normally, Gou Sheng just picks up
odd jobs here and there.

[Qingshuikou Village]

29
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,260
Lately, it's been the busy farming season,
so he's been home the whole time.

30
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,980
Who does he usually hang out with?

31
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,800
According to the village officials,

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,500
Gou Sheng is slick and street-smart.

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,700
So he's got a pretty complicated
network of connections.

34
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,750
Captain Qi, this is Gou Sheng's house.

35
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,910
Who's there?

36
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,790
District population census.

37
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:30,710
Coming.

38
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,390
What's going on? What's the matter?

39
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,290
We're from the Public Security Bureau.

40
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,350
What are you doing?

41
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,470
What's this about?

42
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,970
What are you up to?

43
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,800
Where's Gou Sheng?

44
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,540
Call him out.

45
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,650
He's not here.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,680
He went out for work.

47
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,210
Where to?

48
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,190
Down south.

49
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,400
Where in the south?

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,730
Captain.

51
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,740
No one's inside.

52
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,760
Captain Qi, he's not here either.

53
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,940
What's going on? What happened?

54
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,650
I was just washing some clothes
for the kid earlier,

55
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,950
and I spilled a bit of water.

56
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,280
I don't see any clothes.

57
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,490
Why didn't you hang them up?

58
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,270
What, I washed women's clothes

59
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,490
and I need to show them to you too?

60
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,630
Here.

61
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,730
Take a look at this first.

62
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,760
Should I do it

63
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,760
or you'll do it?

64
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,990
Gou Sheng really didn't do anything wrong.

65
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,770
Wow.

66
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,100
This hole's so small,

67
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
yet you still squeezed through?

68
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,360
He's a tomb raider.

69
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,140
A real pro.

70
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,570
I-I really didn't do anything wrong.

71
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,710
Come with us.

72
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,070
We'll talk it over back at the station.

73
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,470
Can you even handle this?

74
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,940
We archaeologists

75
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,320
don't suffer less

76
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,510
than you farmers.

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,940
Don't underestimate me.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
What are you two up to?

79
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,050
Chen!

80
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,130
Hey, don't you even recognize me anymore?

81
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,250
Are you going blind or what?

82
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,450
You bastard.

83
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,800
Instead of patrolling your own turf,

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,200
what are you doing snooping around my area?

85
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,370
Looking for a looting pit.

86
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,830
Looking for a looting pit?

87
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,470
So you're saying
someone's robbed Zi Mausoleum?

88
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm telling you,

89
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,570
you'd better not talk nonsense

90
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,630
without evidence.

91
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,650
Or I'll report you to Mr. Tang.

92
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,930
No. I wouldn't dare.

93
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,670
This is Chen,
our cultural relic conservator.

94
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,600
Nice to meet you.

95
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,260
And what do you do?

96
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,420
I... I'm studying archaeology.

97
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,470
I came with Uncle Shoucun

98
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,890
to check if there are any looting pits here.

99
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,159
Nope. No looting pits.

100
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,970
I've been patrolling Phoenix Mountain
for 15 or 16 years,

101
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,770
never seen a single tomb raider.

102
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,040
Plus, not long ago,

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,350
our area was just named

104
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,430
one of the fifth batch
of national priority protected sites.

105
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,160
The patrols are very frequent.

106
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,890
I can swear on my life.

107
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,130
There's absolutely no way
there's a looting pit.

108
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,660
Sounds like Chen's telling the truth.

109
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,620
What do you mean by "sounds like the truth?"

110
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,820
I live just in the neighboring village.

111
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,940
Since 1956,

112
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,960
when this place was named

113
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,180
one of the first batch
of provincial priority protected sites,

114
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,370
there's never

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,520
been a single theft.

116
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,810
And you call yourself an archaeologist?

117
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,960
Don't you even know

118
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,810
they still haven't located

119
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,650
the actual tomb entrance of Zi Mausoleum?

120
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,510
But there are historical records,

121
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,250
it was looted during the Western Jin
by starving refugees from Chang'an.

122
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,480
See? It was looted before.

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,040
That may have happened back
in the Western Jin.

124
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,800
But I can vouch that recently,

125
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,240
there haven't been any looting pits.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,420
Comrades,

127
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,250
I'm innocent.

128
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,520
I really didn't do anything wrong.

129
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,130
Then why were you hiding in a well?

130
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,690
Well, I heard

131
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,550
you arrested a bunch of people,

132
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,920
and I got scared.

133
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,770
Can't I... hide for a bit?

134
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,130
But someone reported

135
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,900
you pulled a heist up on the plains.
True or not?

136
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,870
No.

137
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,690
Who's the bastard spouting that nonsense

138
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,890
and framing me?

139
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,510
You've seen what my house is like, right?

140
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,640
A leaky roof and broken walls.

141
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,890
If I'd really done those things,

142
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,720
you think I'd still

143
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,550
be living like this?

144
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,540
Alright.

145
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,680
Then let me bring in the witness,

146
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,080
so you can confront each other face to face.

147
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,420
I swear I'm telling the truth.

148
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,170
I really didn't take part in
that thing on the plains.

149
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,700
Don't shout. Speak calmly.

150
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,840
It was before the New Year.

151
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,450
A gravedigger I knew

152
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,010
asked me to join him
for a big score out on the plains.

153
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,159
He said there was a huge pit,

154
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,890
and we could make a lot of money.

155
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,870
But I didn't go.

156
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,990
What's his name?

157
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,780
I don't know.

158
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,620
In our line of work,

159
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,060
no one uses real names.

160
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,180
I only know he has a big mole on his face.

161
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Everyone just calls him "Big Mole."

162
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,550
Where's he from? How did he contact you?

163
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,100
I don't know where he's from.

164
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,560
We always contacted through public phones.

165
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,380
I did ask him.

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,330
I was cautious.

167
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,860
I asked where we were going.

168
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,040
But he didn't tell me exactly.

169
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,300
So I ended up not going.

170
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Why didn't you go?

171
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,430
Because my mom didn't want me to.

172
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,380
Cut the crap!

173
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,590
Your parents have been dead for years.

174
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,090
I asked at her grave.

175
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,020
My mom

176
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,020
used to be a well-known
spirit medium around here.

177
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,220
She's very accurate.

178
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,260
Mom,

179
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
I brought you some paper offerings.

180
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,740
Don't be too frugal.

181
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,110
Also, there's something I want to ask you.

182
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,330
After the New Year,
I've got a big job lined up.

183
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,140
Mom,

184
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,220
please keep me safe

185
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,800
and sound.

186
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,610
Mom,

187
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,860
I understand now.

188
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,710
I can't take on the job.

189
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,640
Why? Not enough money?

190
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,070
No.

191
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,350
I just don't want to do it anymore.

192
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,940
The New Year is coming.

193
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,540
If I mess with that kind of stuff
and get cursed,

194
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,140
the whole year will go wrong.

195
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,940
Am I right?

196
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,860
You're so useless.

197
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,210
Officer,

198
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,200
something must've happened up on the plains.

199
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Would this count as a contribution?

200
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,540
A contribution?

201
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,400
If anyone deserves the credit,
it's your mom.

202
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,330
That's why

203
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,360
everyone around here says,

204
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,470
my mom is very accurate.

205
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,220
Which day did Big Mole
ask you to do the job?

206
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,390
The ninth day of the first lunar month.

207
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,960
The ninth day of the first lunar month

208
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,160
is when our village celebrates Shehuo.

209
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,010
You think they made their move
near Yin Village?

210
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,940
They chose that day on purpose.

211
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,570
The firecrackers, the crowd,

212
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,690
the noise from gongs and drums

213
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,550
could mask the sound of the blast.

214
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,520
Have the artist

215
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,190
get Gou Sheng
to sketch a portrait of Big Mole.

216
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,880
Brother.

217
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,190
You're looking for Fang Kun, aren't you?

218
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,320
I'm looking for you.

219
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,540
What's up?

220
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,620
Tell me again what happened

221
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,820
on the day Heisa went missing.

222
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,230
Heisa was lost, right?

223
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,580
So I went to look for it.

224
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,890
-Then I heard a dog barking in the field.
-Heisa!

225
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,010
It sounded a lot like Heisa.

226
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,340
So I went to check it out.

227
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,910
Then I ran into two people.

228
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,420
I asked them.

229
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,070
Have you seen a dog?

230
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,180
We just saw one
heading towards the main road.

231
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,790
What did those two look like?

232
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,970
It's been too long.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,930
It was dark, and I

234
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,730
can't remember right now.

235
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,950
Are you blind? You're not that old.

236
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,970
It was too dark.

237
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,480
It's alright, girl. Come here.

238
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,500
Take a look at this.

239
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,350
Is it this person?

240
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,020
Why are you shining
your flashlight at me? Stop it!

241
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,770
Go away, now!

242
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
I can't say for sure about anything else,

243
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,490
but I remember this mole.

244
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,110
It seems like it's this person.

245
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,900
Is it true?

246
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,170
I only remember this mole.

247
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,100
Take me to that place to have a look.

248
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,660
That day, I ran into them

249
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,380
right here.

250
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,400
Over there?

251
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:17,900
Yes.

252
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,010
It was right here.

253
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,610
It must have been you
who did something to him.

254
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,940
I didn't touch him.

255
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,540
You all saw it, right?

256
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,170
I didn't touch him.

257
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,970
You won't let me dig on your land,
so what could I do?

258
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,430
Captain Qi.

259
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,120
Captain Qi.

260
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,600
Look at this piece of land.

261
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,220
Nothing grows on this patch of land.

262
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,800
It's very likely to be a looting pit.

263
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
What looting pit?

264
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,640
What's going on here?

265
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,100
He fell on his own,
and now he's trying to extort me.

266
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,500
Who's extorting you?
There are so many people watching here.

267
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,370
Qingguo.

268
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,850
Stop shouting.

269
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,450
Cang?

270
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,160
Dacang,

271
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,790
this guy wanted to dig on my land.

272
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,780
He even hit me.

273
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,310
-I'm in so much pain.
-I…

274
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,690
Have you eaten?

275
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,050
I haven't eaten yet.

276
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,070
I couldn't even protect my land.
What's the point of eating?

277
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,100
I might as well starve to death.

278
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,500
I don't want to live anymore.

279
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,830
These fried dough twists from Dananmen

280
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,000
are packed with Sichuan pepper leaves.
They're delicious.

281
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,320
I need to do the digging
for my investigation.

282
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,820
What do you think we can do
to make this work?

283
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,030
Look at this land.

284
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,110
If you really discover a looting pit,

285
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,850
how am I supposed to farm?

286
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,120
Our farming will be delayed.

287
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,210
See if this works for you.

288
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,580
Just

289
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,230
half an hour.

290
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,350
I'll do the digging.

291
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,010
If there's nothing,
I'll fill it back up for you.

292
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,170
Good as new.

293
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,650
But if there really is a looting pit,

294
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,340
I'll make up for any losses
caused by the delay.

295
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,940
I promise.

296
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,230
I can't leave without resolving this,

297
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,230
can I?

298
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,050
Alright, then.

299
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,940
So you'll do the digging, right?

300
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,390
Brother, we're doing this as a favor to you.

301
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,560
You'd better keep your word.

302
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,140
I will.

303
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,730
You're so reasonable.

304
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,060
Come on.

305
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,780
Have some.

306
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,540
Qingguo, get up.

307
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,420
Get up.

308
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,280
We'll let you dig for half an hour.

309
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,570
Hurry up.

310
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,340
Where's any sign of a looting pit
around here?

311
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,650
This person is just daydreaming here,

312
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,530
insisting there's a looting pit.

313
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,010
What's this thing?

314
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,380
This...

315
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,690
What did they dig up?

316
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,670
Brother!

317
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,450
Don't move yet.

318
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:11,930
It looks like a dog.

319
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,990
It looks like a dog.

320
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,350
Heisa.

321
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,540
It's my Heisa.

322
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,530
How did a dog end up in my field?

323
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,130
My Heisa!

324
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,210
Let me go!

325
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,980
Brother, let me go!

326
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,160
This is the dog bell I made.

327
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,300
Who killed it?

328
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,320
We suspect that

329
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,850
the looting pit is in Yin Village.

330
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,240
So, please notify the villagers

331
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,350
to help us search for the looting pit.

332
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,540
You're really getting ahead of yourself.

333
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,300
What are you thinking about?

334
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,430
Digging holes in my field is one thing.

335
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,140
What else do you want?

336
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,020
You want the whole village
to help you find the looting pit?

337
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,330
So you're saying we should
give up eating, drinking,

338
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,260
and farming too?

339
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,330
No.

340
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,870
Well then, I'll go look first.

341
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
I'll let you know if I find anything, okay?

342
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,470
Don't go.

343
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,420
Many villagers

344
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,900
are blaming you,

345
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,780
saying you ruined their crops

346
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,070
and stole their grain.

347
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,710
I've only got one voice,

348
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,230
but the whole village is talking.

349
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,670
How am I supposed to
explain myself to everyone?

350
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,090
Alright.

351
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,630
He's right.

352
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,940
The villagers do have some resistance.

353
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
We can't force it.

354
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,480
Why don't you go back first?

355
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm not leaving. I can't go.

356
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,580
I have to find the looting pit.

357
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,570
Look, I promise you,

358
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,850
I won't interfere with their farming, okay?

359
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,360
Listen, if you cause any trouble,

360
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
I won't be able to clean up your mess.

361
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,020
You... You see if this works.

362
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
See if this works.

363
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,640
We're not saying they can't farm.

364
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,230
Keep farming as usual.

365
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,900
Just pay more attention

366
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,069
when they're out there.

367
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,290
Are there any depressions?

368
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,859
Where aren't the crops growing?

369
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,920
Just report it promptly. That's all.

370
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:10,780
Right?

371
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,060
There's one more thing.

372
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,900
Could you give me a list of everyone

373
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,839
who took part in
the Shehuo festival that day?

374
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,350
What am I?

375
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,800
Am I a computer?

376
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,420
-No.
-There were over 2,000 people that day.

377
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,250
How can I remember all of them?

378
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,310
It's not like that.

379
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,140
I don't mean every single person.

380
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,870
Just the names of the villages.

381
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,600
Right?

382
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,720
-Come on.
-Go away.

383
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,850
I can't remember.

384
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,930
Did you swallow a machine gun or something?

385
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,730
College student!

386
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,910
That looting pit is in
our Yin Village, right?

387
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,010
It's very likely.

388
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,250
Sir, what are you doing?

389
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,820
I'm Yan Shoucun.

390
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,490
What exactly am I guarding here?

391
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,650
I patrol every day

392
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,880
but haven't found a single looting pit.

393
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,630
Sir, don't worry.

394
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,530
It's just a possibility for now.

395
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,820
Here's what you do: Go back and draw a map.

396
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,680
Mark out all the land in our village

397
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,660
and who owns each plot.

398
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,450
Draw it all out.

399
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,320
We'll search slowly.

400
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,250
Does that sound good?

401
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:20,580
Okay.

402
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,320
I'll go do it now.

403
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,170
Alright, I'll go draw it.

404
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:23,950
Good, take it easy.

405
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,820
No rush.

406
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,770
Hello, what's up?

407
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,530
You really don't plan to come back?

408
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,530
The matter isn't settled yet, is it?

409
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,320
Wait.

410
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,370
How come you have time today?

411
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,860
Mr. Zan is very busy.

412
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,220
No duty for me today.

413
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,970
That's perfect.

414
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,300
Come to the plateau
and bring me some things.

415
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,970
This is the list of all the villages

416
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,820
taking part in Shehuo that day.

417
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,850
[List of Members Participating in Shehuo]

418
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,970
I want to investigate all these villages.

419
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,860
I'll bring people over

420
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,770
to investigate with you.

421
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,100
Okay.

422
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,330
This is the portrait of Big Mole.

423
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,530
I don't have any impression of this person.

424
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,180
Yeah.

425
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,000
I've asked many tomb raiders.

426
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,180
They also say they don't know him.

427
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,650
He's probably not a veteran.

428
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,210
And also,

429
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,590
Gou Sheng only dealt with him once.

430
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,450
Whether the sketch is accurate
is also debatable.

431
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:22,850
Right.

432
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,290
That's the point.

433
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,840
I'll hand out the sketches

434
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,800
highlighting the big mole

435
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,940
and go through everyone on the list.

436
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,740
That's right.

437
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,710
Herding sheep, sir?

438
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,380
Yes.

439
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,420
Go.

440
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,580
Sir,

441
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,870
I'd like to ask you something.

442
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,410
Go ahead.

443
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,350
Take a look at this.

444
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,770
Do you recognize this person?

445
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:46,990
I don't.

446
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,440
Never seen him before.

447
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,250
Is there anyone in your village
with a mole on their face?

448
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:51,710
Here.

449
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,240
Look over here.

450
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,700
What's wrong?

451
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,900
Is having a mole on my face a crime now?

452
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:57,690
Chief.

453
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,050
Chief.

454
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,620
Chief.

455
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,890
You were looking for me?

456
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,530
Did you go watch the Shehuo in Yin Village?

457
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,130
Yes, I did.

458
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,590
Who did you go with?

459
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,220
My dad, my mom,

460
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,160
and my wife.

461
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:19,070
[Hongqi Village]

462
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,190
She's the one knitting over there.

463
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,820
The chief said her son
has a mole on his face.

464
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,950
Madam, are you busy?

465
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,150
Your son is Qi Xiao, right?

466
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,770
Yes, he is.

467
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,500
Is he at home?

468
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,080
Who are you? Why are you looking for him?

469
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,140
We're his friends.

470
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,970
Looking for him
to have a meal and play cards.

471
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,180
He went out to work.

472
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,250
When did he leave?

473
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,750
He left right after the New Year.

474
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,090
You look familiar.

475
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,970
Weren't you the one

476
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,970
who played drums at the Shehuo festival?

477
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,770
That's right.

478
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,770
We've met before.

479
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Did he go that day?

480
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,130
He did.

481
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,420
When will he be back?

482
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,820
No idea.

483
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,100
Alright.

484
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,590
Welcome. What took you so long?

485
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,860
Ms. Luo is here too?

486
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,750
I can't carry all these things by myself.

487
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,480
Ms. Luo is kindly helping out.

488
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,970
What's all this stuff for?

489
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,900
Never mind that. Come on, this way.

490
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,490
Here, give them to me.

491
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,350
I'll take them.

492
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,510
I didn't realize Ms. Luo was so nice.

493
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,470
I didn't

494
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,210
come specifically to
bring you food and drinks.

495
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,690
I've been eager to hear about
any new discoveries

496
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,900
you've made in Bailu Plain.

497
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,700
You know what, we actually have.

498
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,660
We've pretty much pinpointed that

499
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,700
the looting pit is somewhere
around Yin Village.

500
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,930
The Zi Mausoleum on Phoenix Mountain

501
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,460
is several kilometers away from Yin Village.

502
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,740
Du Mausoleum is even further.

503
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,600
The closest one

504
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,370
is the Dou Mausoleum,
which is 1,500 meters away.

505
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,500
How could it be here?

506
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,530
So,

507
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,970
don't you think this matter

508
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,100
is getting more and more interesting?

509
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,380
What's so interesting?

510
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,530
We'll head back
once we've delivered the items to you.

511
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,290
Alright.

512
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,280
Wait.

513
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,140
What are your plans?

514
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,080
What plans?

515
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,700
Just keep searching.

516
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:10,720
Kun,

517
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,900
is it worth all this trouble
just to prove a point?

518
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,210
Guo, we've been classmates
for several years.

519
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,010
How come you don't understand me at all?

520
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,210
What?

521
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,010
You're wrong.

522
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,690
Before, I was doing it out of spite,

523
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,210
but that's not the case now.

524
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,470
What are those black pottery figurines?

525
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,050
They are high-grade burial artifacts.

526
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,490
If they really came from Yin Village,

527
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,050
how are we supposed to explain this?

528
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,140
It was that line from the "Book of Jin,"

529
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,970
"Looted the Zi and Du Mausoleums
and obtained many treasures,"

530
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,900
that led me here.

531
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,650
The more I walk this path,

532
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,690
the more questions I find in my mind.

533
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,530
The old saying was true after all.

534
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,050
"Knowledge from books always seems shallow.

535
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,290
To truly understand,
one must experience it firsthand."

536
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,890
Before, I might have thought

537
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,820
whether I was right or wrong,

538
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,610
whether Mr. Zan was right or wrong.

539
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,530
But now I feel none of that matters.

540
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,420
Even if I'm wrong,
what's the worst that could happen?

541
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,290
I'm an adult.

542
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,690
I can bear the consequences of my mistakes.

543
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,940
But if I give up now,

544
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,400
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

545
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,690
So now I just want to know

546
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,450
where exactly the looting pit is located.

547
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,450
It's that simple.

548
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:03,980
Let's go.

549
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,770
He does have a point.

550
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,530
Then I'll stay and search with you.

551
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,420
What?

552
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,740
Are you serious?

553
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,540
Are you sure?

554
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,420
I'm sure.

555
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
You want to stay?

556
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,560
Then you...

558
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:31,730
Madam,

559
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,250
are you guys chatting?

560
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,450
What brings you here?

561
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:35,730

562
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,870
I came to

563
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
apologize to you.

564
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,180
I can't accept this.

565

What are you doing?

566
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,860
I was wrong that day.

567
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,930
Captain Qi has already scolded me.

568
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,860
Take it, please.

569
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,290
If you had this attitude that day,

570
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,350
wouldn't everything have been fine?

571
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,890
Where did this dog come from?

572
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,690
Are you here to ask me about
the looting pit?

573
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,690
Hurry up and chase this dog away!

574
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,150
Do you have any leads, sis?

575
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,620
-I don't.
-Fang Kun.

Come quickly and save me!

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,540
Where did this dog come from?

578
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,900
Well, you see.

579
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Have you noticed some fields

580
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,500
-where the crops just won't grow?
-Fang Kun!

581
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,530
Your girlfriend is calling you.

582
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,780
It's fine. Let her figure it out herself.

583
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,490
Any relatives or friends who might have
encountered something like that?

584
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,530
Your girlfriend is afraid of dogs.

585
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,520
She's even jumped onto the wall.

586
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,980
-That's not my...
-Fang Kun.

587
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,550
Fang Kun, come quickly!

588
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
It's about to bite my backpack away!

589
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,260
Fang Kun!

590
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,770
Can't you hear me?

591
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,210
You heartless thing, watching me suffer!

593
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,490
Why are you angry?

594
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,280
Did you enjoy watching me
make a fool of myself?

595
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Am I that despicable in your eyes?

596
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,610
You're not exactly despicable,

597
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,090
but taking pleasure in others' weaknesses

598
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,490
isn't very noble either.

599
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,110
So you admit that
being afraid of dogs is your weakness.

600
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,840
Why don't you just overcome it?

601
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,280
I was with you this time,

602
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,210
so I could help you chase it away.

603
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,250
What if next time I'm not around

604
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,690
and you're all alone?

605
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,450

Hey, buddy.

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,550
Let me ask you something.

609
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,010
Have you seen this person?

610
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,470
Police. Just gathering information.

611
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,350
Looks familiar.

612
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,250
Maybe at the market...

613
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,710
No.

614
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,690
I can't remember.

615
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,410
Buddy,

616
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,580
let me ask you one more thing.

617
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,290
On the ninth day of the first lunar month,

618
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,750
did you go to Yin Village
to watch the Shehuo?

619
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,310
No.

620
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,770
What's your name?

621
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,430
Yan Xiaowu.

622
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,100
Yan Xiaowu?

623
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,050
I heard someone from your village
say you went there.

624
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,320
I really didn't go.

625
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,630
Alright then.

626
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,490
If you remember anything,

627
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,130
report it to your village committee.

628
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,950

Did the police come to your village?

632
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,550
No, they didn't.

633
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,050
The police came to our village today.

634
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,060
They're investigating those who went to
Yin Village on the day of the Shehuo.

635
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,720
Especially

636
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,490
those with a big mole.

637

They aren't looking for me, are they?

638
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,700
You idiot,

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,700
who else could it be but you?

640
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,740
I think

641
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,780
you should go out and hide for a while.

642
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,910
Come back when things have blown over.

643
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,760
A little bit forward.

644
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,620
No, I'm afraid it will bite me.

645
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,690
Don't be afraid. It won't bite.

646
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,730
It's very well-behaved.
Heizui is very docile.

647
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,390
No worries.

648
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,340
Yes, forward.

649
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,450
How much further?

650
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,690
It's still quite far.
You can move a bit closer. It's fine.

Heizui is very well-behaved.

653
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,140
Did I touch it?

654
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,390
A little bit more.

655
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:34,940

664
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,180
how much further?

665
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,020
Just a bit more forward and you'll be there.

666
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,270
You're giving up already?

667
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,690
Let me practice with you.

668
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
I was practicing just fine on my own.

Just gently place your hand on it.

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,340
Hold it tightly.

679
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,620
quite well-behaved.

680
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,740
How obedient.

681
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,280
Isn't it?

00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,590
It really is.

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,250
Do they like each other?

685
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,580
It's good enough that I can pet it.
I won't hold it.

686
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,480
So at least now

687
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,410
I'm able to pet it.

00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,250
I have never mocked you.

Heisa's pup?

695
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,340
You asked Uncle Shoucun to bring it back?

696
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,000
I asked him to bring it back,
so I could practice.

697
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,110
I didn't want you to laugh at me.

698
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,360
Come on.

699
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,300
This dog is so obedient.

00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:23,740
Look.

701
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,350
Pet it again.

702
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:29,960
Heizui,

703
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,950
don't bite me, okay?

704
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,910
Go ahead and pet it. It's fine.

705
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,140
It's so well-behaved.

706
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,600
See, I'm not bothering it,

707
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,810
and it won't bite you either.

708
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,750
I really have to thank you.

709
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,220
You're right.

710
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,340
Encountering dogs during field archaeology
is pretty common.

711
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,040
I can't always count on others

712
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,020
to chase them away for me.

713
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,350
Uncle Shoucun said

714
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,020
Heizui's father was killed by tomb raiders.

715
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,740
So it will avenge its father.

716
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,140
Heizui,

717
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,390
tomorrow I plan to take you
to find the looting pit.

718
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,400
It's me.

719
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,380
Didn't I tell you not to call my phone
unless it's really necessary?

720
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:34,910
Brother,

721
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,290
we're in trouble.

00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,190

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,140
The police are looking for Wang Taiping.

724
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,490
What?

725
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,100
How could the police find him?

726
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,830
I don't know.

727
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,990
I just know the police are in every village,

728
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,410
looking for a man
with a big mole on his face.

729
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,530
At this point,

730
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,930
who else could they be looking for
if not him?

731
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,650
Luckily, I ran into them first.

732
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,770
I warned Taiping in advance
and told him to run.

733
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,230
Otherwise, he would have been caught by now.

734
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,020
Are you out of your mind?

735
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,710
Who told you to tell him to run?

736
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,530
If not,

737
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,180
should he just wait to be arrested?

738
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,910
Can you use your brain for once?

739
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,650
The police only know about
the mole on his face,

740
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,570
which means their information is limited.

741
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,140
There are so many people with moles.

742
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,970
How would they know which one is him?

743
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,170
Telling him to run now

744
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,690
is like putting a sign
that says "I'm hiding something."

745
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,150
Then...

746
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,990
Brother, what should we do?

747
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,610
Quickly tell him to get back.

748
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:23,570
Okay.

749
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,900
Tell him to stay calm.

750
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,210
Even if he's called in for questioning,
he doesn't need to be afraid.

751
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,010
The police don't know anything.

752
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,820
Got it.

753
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,860
Don't use your phone to contact him.

754
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,250
Okay.

755
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,810
Have the visit reports been compiled yet?

756
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,540
Yes, we have.

757
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,630
On the ninth day of the first lunar month,

758
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,530
there were eight villages
participating in the Shehuo.

759
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,860
After visiting all of them,

760
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,250
we found that 23 people

761
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,620
have moles on their faces.

762
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,680
They are all locals.

763
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,030
After questioning,

764
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,010
20 of them

765
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,100
said they were with

766
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,250
their fellow villagers that day.

767
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,250
They didn't leave midway

768
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,450
and had no time to commit the crime.

769
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,450
The remaining three couldn't be contacted.

770
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,110
They should all be out of town.

771
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,540
Alright.

772
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,220
Our next task will concentrate

773
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,290
on these three individuals.

774
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,550
We need to investigate them thoroughly.

775
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,580
I cried out,

776
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,530
"Wang Taiping,

777
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,450
my husband!"

778
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,530
I bore him sons

779
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,180
and daughters.

780
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,460
Stop looking. Step aside!

781
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,020
Hurry,

782
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,480
move aside!

783
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,940
Shut up!

784
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,730
You heartless man,

785
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,860
where have you been?

786
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,450
You don't work in the fields during the day,

787
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,180
and you don't come home at night.

788
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,580
Hurry.

789
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,010
Where have you been?

790
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,380
Come on, move aside.

791
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,210
In front of everyone...

792
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,140
Can't you talk things through properly

793
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,210
instead of fighting here?

794
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,100
Mind your own business.

795
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,490
Stop it!

796
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,290
Let go!

797
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,660
We're on duty.

798
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,730
Everyone, disperse.

799
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,620
What have you done?

800
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,210
Disperse!

801
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:00,940
The police are here.

802
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,690
Hurry! Go back!

803
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,410
Stop watching. Everyone, go home.

804
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:05,900
Hurry!

805
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,010
What's your name?

806
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,010
I'm Wang Taiping.

807
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,210
Nervous?

808
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,100
What do I have to be nervous about, officer?

809
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,290
On the ninth day of the first lunar month,

810
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,690
did you go to Yin Village?

811
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,860
The ninth day of the first lunar month?

812
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,010
It was during Shehuo, you fool.
Did you forget?

813
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,540
Oh right,

814
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,070
we were taking part in Shehuo.

815
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,450
I went to Yin Village
to check out the festivities.

816
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,510
Who did you go with?

817
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,920
Quite a few people from the village went.

818
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,860
Did you watch the Shehuo all day?

819
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,060
When did you get back?

820
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,840
I came back around lunchtime.

821
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:41,750
Really?

822
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,630
I don't know.

823
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,630
I went to my mother's place.

824
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,730
Yes, she went back to her family's home.

825
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,860
Officer, why...

826
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,520
Why are you asking about this?

827
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,600
Investigating a case.

828
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,030
What kind of case?

829
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,890
Are you at home every day?

830
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,610
I stay at home every day.

831
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,600
Once married, always connected.

832
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,489
Couples should be civil to each other.

833
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,639
If you have something to say, say it nicely.

834
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,310
You can go back now.

835
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,780
Okay.

836
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,260
Do you know Gou Sheng?

837
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,989
Let's find a spot to talk for a while.

838
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,050
What are you doing?

839
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,310
What's going on?

840
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,130
He just got back.

841
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,739
-We're on duty.
-Wang Taiping!

842
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,400
Whose wife did you sleep with?

843
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,380
You pervert!

844
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,600
You're not sparing the living,
nor the clay figurines.

845
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,820
Shut your foul mouth!

846
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,989
You shut up too!

847
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,659
What clay figurine?

848
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,520
Come, take a closer look.

849
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,860
Is it the same as the clay figurine

850
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,719
you saw before?

851
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:52,900
I...

852
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,219
I... I forgot.

853
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,340
Didn't you say what you saw was a

854
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,200
black nude female clay figurine?

855
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,780
It... It's been too long.

856
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,400
I forgot about it. Didn't remember clearly.

857
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,600
It looks quite different from this one.

858
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,740
How is it different?

859
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,190
That one was an African,

860
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,700
with large eye sockets and double eyelids.

861
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,090
Impossible.

862
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,870
She confessed everything.

863
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,010
The pottery figurine in your house
during the New Year

864
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,860
is exactly the same as
the black pottery figurine.

865
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,740
That woman isn't blind.

866
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,910
How could she see them as the same?

867
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,780
What's different?

868
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,190
The clay figurine I bought has arms.

869
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,570
Besides the arms?

870
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,420
What's different about the head and body?

871
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,140
Mine has a student haircut.

872
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,730
A heart-shaped face.

873
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,290
Round eyes.

874
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,330
Cherry lips.

875
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,920
It looks quite different from this one.

876
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,070
How is it different?

877
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,750
That one was an African,

878
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,150
with large eye sockets and double eyelids.

879
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,970
Her hair is curly.

880
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,700
Officer,

881
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,880
don't listen to her nonsense.

882
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,090
It's been so long.

883
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,490
She only glanced at it back then.

884
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,820
How could she remember it
more clearly than I do?

885
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,130
You're quite stubborn, huh?

886
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,330
You're ignorant of the law, aren't you?

887
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,900
Do you know what crime

888
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,030
you've committed?

889
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,800
Looting of national heritage tombs.

890
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,350
If you don't reveal the others involved,

891
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,490
we'll treat you as the main culprit.

892
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,820
If you want to take the blame

893
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,900
for others' crimes,

894
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:47,970
I'd say

895
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,850
three lifetimes still wouldn't be
enough for you.

896
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,540
Think it through carefully.

897
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,860
Just be honest.

898
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,180
What exactly did you do in Yin Village?

899
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,880
I went into the pit.

900
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,310
Who else?

901
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:26,630
Yan Xiaowu.

902
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,160
What are you...

903
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,220
Is Yan Xiaowu here?

904
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,020
He's not here.

905
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,090
Come here.

906
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,410
Look carefully.

907
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,640
[Arrest Warrant]

908
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,990
Where did he go?

909
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,860
I don't know.

910
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,260
It was Yan Xiaowu who got me involved.

911
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,930
The New Year was coming soon.

912
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,860
I still had a lot of debts to pay off.

913
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,610
It looked like I wouldn't be able
to celebrate the New Year.

914
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,870
I was worried about it.

915
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,110
Then Yan Xiaowu came to me.

916
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,300
He said there was a quick way to make money.

917
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,270
When I heard it was grave robbing,

918
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,470
I said, "No."

919
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,340
I said I couldn't do it no matter what.

920
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,650
Yan Xiaowu said we didn't need to
dig the grave.

921
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,230
We were just going to loot the grave.

922
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,010
That day,

923
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,260
those bad guys

924
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,060
had just finished digging the grave

925
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
and were about to take out the goods.

926
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,660
Yan Xiaowu and I pretended
to be cultural relic conservators.

927
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,490
Stop right there!

928
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,820
We shouted and scared those bad guys away.

929
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:30,970
Then,

930
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,460
Yan Xiaowu went down into the grave
to take the items.

931
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,190
I didn't go down into the grave.

932
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,270
According to what you're saying,

933
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,210
the tomb raiders were
another group of people.

934
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,570
Who

935
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,420
were they?

936
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,820
How many were there?

937
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,600
There were four people.

938
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,450
I don't know

939
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,050
who did it.

940
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,760
Yan Xiaowu didn't tell me either.

941
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,590
He arranged everything.

942
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,580
After he set everything up,

943
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,820
he just came to get me for the looting.

944
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,870
I don't know anything else.

945
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,420
So, what did you steal?

946
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,610
Not much,

947
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:13,490
just

948
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,970
about one or two hundred clay figurines.

949
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
How many exactly?

950
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,610
I didn't count them exactly.

951
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,490
There were a lot.

952
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,830
Don't think those clay figurines
are worth much.

953
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,430
They're not valuable at all.

954
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:29,970
My share

955
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,180
was only 2,500 yuan.

956
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,890
Wang Taiping,

957
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,340
for just 2,500 yuan,

958
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,180
do you know how much damage

959
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,670
you've caused to the country?

960
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,130
Some cultural relics
have already been smuggled abroad.

961
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,230
The loss you've caused the country

962
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,940
is far more than a million times 2,500 yuan.

963
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,050
What did you say?

964
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,050
They're worth that much?

965
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,180
And that's just what we can calculate.

966
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,050
Many things

967
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,470
are simply incalculable.

968
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,220
Are you sure?

969
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,370
Wang Taiping and Yan Xiaowu

970
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,420
are the ones who looted the grave?

971
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm sure.

972
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,090
The moment Wang Taiping was arrested,

973
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,300
I heard about it.

974
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,640
I've inquired about it.

975
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,260
On the ninth day of the first lunar month,

976
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,010
that guy and Yan Xiaowu

977
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,690
went to watch the Shehuo together.

978
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,890
What's their connection to Mu Jianhui?

979
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,080
Yan Xiaowu and Mu Jianhui
worked at the same watch factory.

980
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,380
Who else could it be if not him?

981
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,780
Sheng,

982
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,400
that's your brother-in-law.

983
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,390
It... It's your call.

984
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,370
That's right.

985
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,510
First, go find that Yan Xiaowu.

986
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,220
Right.

987
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,410
I'm the one who wants to find him
the most right now.

988
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,050
Sheng.

989
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,350
What are we going to do?

990
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,130
Eat.

991
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,480
Eat until you're full.

992
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,940
Brother, how's it outside? Can I escape?

993
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,610
There's no way you can escape now.

994
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,050
It is the key moment to close in on us.

995
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,090
You know the saying, "Hide in plain sight?"

996
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,620
The most dangerous place
is often the safest.

997
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,380
Stay put here for a while.

998
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,810
Wait until the police get tired
and let their guard down.

999
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,050
Then I'll find a way to get you out of here.

1000
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:10,580
Brother,

1001
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm going crazy being cooped up here.

1002
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,950
You won't abandon me, will you?

1003
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,940
We're in the same boat.

1004
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,340
If you get caught,

1005
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,200
do you think I'll have any way out?

1006
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,250
You can still run,

1007
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,780
but I can't even escape.

1008
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,640
My wife can't live without me.

1009
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,850
When it comes to food and drink,

1010
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,880
don't shortchange yourself.

1011
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,510
When you run out, I'll figure something out.

1012
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,090
Hey, Captain Qi.

1013
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,300
We've caught the tomb raiders.

1014
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,500
The looting pit is in Yin Village.

1015
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,010
I'm bringing the suspect
to identify the looting pit now.

1016
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:56,680
Alright.

1017
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:57,300
Alright.

1018
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,420
The looting pit has been found.

1019
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,250
It's in Yin Village.

1020
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,300
Let's go, quickly.

1021
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,780
-Let's go.
-Let's go.
