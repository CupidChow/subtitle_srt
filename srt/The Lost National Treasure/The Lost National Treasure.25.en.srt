[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,560
It's such a big hole, bro.

4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
This isn't a tomb-raiding hole.

5
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,820
This explosive...

6
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,120
The explosion was so powerful and so loud.

7
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,800
Fortunately, no one heard it.

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Bro, you always have the best ideas.

9
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,070
Shall we give it a try?

10
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,500
With such a big noise,

11
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,920
wouldn't the whole village be alerted?

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,960
Shut up!

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,060
Let's find a solution at once.

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,180
Hello, bro.

15
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,829
Guang.

16
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,640
I don't think

17
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,640
they'll be able to get
the treasure in Yin Village.

18
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,010
What happened?

19
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,710
King Hua and his several

20
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,310
on-site commanders are making explosives.

21
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,970
But it's far inferior to mine.

22
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,960
If they really dare to detonate it,

23
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,690
the entire village can hear it.

24
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,960
Then why don't you help them?

25
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:42,870
Bro,

26
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,910
what exactly

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,430
are you planning?

28
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,720
"By giving roses to others,
the fragrance stays in your hands."

29
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,840
Helping them is helping ourselves.

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,560
Come on, bro!

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,810
Come on, buddies!

32
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,370
Raise your glasses.

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Come on.

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,520
Come on. Drink it.

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,280
Just drink it.

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,880
Fill it up.

37
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,420
Come on.

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:01,710
You...

39
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,170
Enjoy the food and drinks.

40
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,080
That's too little. Come on. Fill it up.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,560
Go on.

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,170
Come on.

43
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,840
Come on. Drink it up.

44
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,280
Wait a moment. The meat
will be ready soon.

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,310
Enjoy the food and drinks.

46
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,710
Alright.

47
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,280
Thank you, Long.

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,080
Thanks, Long.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,290
Thank you, Long.

50
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,430
Right away. Calm down.

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,630
Look at these people.

52
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,470
They're working so slowly
and are dawdling,

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,150
causing a delay of our project schedule.

54
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,400
You have the resources
and don't use them well.

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
How can you work like this while getting
salaries from the government?

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
As a grown man,

57
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,880
why are you acting like a woman?

58
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,360
Look at these sissies.

59
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,910
They're even worse than women.

60
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,640
They're even worse than women.

61
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,310
What? Are you not convinced?

62
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,310
Why are you looking at me?

63
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,079
If you keep staring,
I'll gouge your eyes out.

64
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,030
So what if I'm looking at you?

65
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,290
What's wrong with you?

66
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:44,930
So what if I'm looking at you?

67
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,150
What?

68
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,520
I'd like to see what you're going to do.

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,980
What? I'd like to see
what you're going to do.

70
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,590
What? What?

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,079
How dare you still eat here?

72
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,870
Stop eating!

73
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Just stop eating!

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
What was going on?

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,680
What happened?

76
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,430
If I hadn't interceded with them so humbly

77
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,630
and so submissively

78
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,420
to get a letter of
understanding from them,

79
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,550
all of you would've been put into jail.

80
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,870
Guo Shilin.

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
What was going on?

82
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,409
As the captain, you took
the lead in the fight?

83
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,140
This is giving me a headache every day.

84
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,910
There's much pressure from the higher-ups,

85
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,000
and my subordinates always cause trouble.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,530
Guo fought aginast others.

87
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,200
Fang isn't coming back.

88
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,700
It's really hard for me.

89
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,160
It was not Mr. Guo's fault.

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,220
They went too far in bullying others.

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,480
Who said that?

92
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,190
I said that.

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,900
Say that again.

94
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,720
It really wasn't Mr. Guo's fault.

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,050
You're still saying it?

96
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,080
Look at the state of you all now.

97
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,070
Director Zhang.

98
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,560
They're reporting about
the Lv Family Tomb on TV.

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,480
Turn on the TV.

100
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,400
The National Cultural Heritage
Administration has announced that

101
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,330
the Lv Family Tomb in Mi County

102
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,100
[Top Ten Archaeological Discoveries:
Lv Family Tomb]

103
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,190
is one of the top ten archaeological
discoveries of the year in our country.

104
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,870
Ms. Luo from the Provincial
Archaeological Research Institute

105
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,680
is the team leader for this excavation.

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,750
Let's follow her to the excavation site

107
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,600
to experience the joys and sorrows

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,390
of the prominent Lv family
from the Northern Song Dynasty.

109
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,990
I'll quit.

110
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,480
Let's go back and have a drink.

111
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,410
It's all gone. Everything's gone.

112
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,120
The house is completely empty.

113
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,900
Why do I feel that
you're saying this to me?

114
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,370
Make a call if you need to.

115
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,430
W-What's going on?

116
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,960
Who is it?

117
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,000
Who's there?

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,530
Who is it?

119
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,510
Who's over there?

120
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,040
Who is it?

121
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,770
Speak!

122
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,530
It's me.

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,480
Kong.

124
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,730
Who's that?

125
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,730
It... It seems to be Lame Kong.

126
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,270
Why did they send this old guy

127
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,000
over here?

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
This guy is slow and always needs a rest.

129
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,680
There are no other helpers.

130
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,920
A useless man like me

131
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,350
has to severs as a helper.

132
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,930
Let's go.

133
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,480
I'll patrol with you guys.

134
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,650
Kong, what's wrong with your legs?

135
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,159
My knees are injured from

136
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,159
walking too much.

137
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,670
If I work for a few more years,

138
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
I guess I won't be able to walk at all.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,540
Don't worry about me.

140
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,750
I'll walk slowly behind you.

141
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,950
Just go on with your patrol.

142
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,260
We'll do our own patrol.

143
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,560
Without us chatting with you,

144
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,690
won't you get bored?

145
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,630
Look at your silly face.

146
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,630
A few years ago, when I
patrolled Du Mausoleum,

147
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,340
I managed to get through
the night all by myself, didn't I?

148
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,040
I heard that when you
guarded Du Mausoleum,

149
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,270
you burned incense for
the emperors every day.

150
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,040
Your legs would start shaking
as soon as you got there.

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,750
Who hasn't had

152
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,080
a moment of trembling
at the sound of a cat?

153
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,580
When you see Chunhua,

154
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,580
wouldn't you also start trembling?

155
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,470
Why can't you get over
this thing with Chunhua?

156
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,640
I just...

157
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's go.

158
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,620
Walk slowly. I need to answer the phone.

159
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,590
Guo, what's up?

160
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,820
Hey, buddy.

161
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,330
What are you doing?

162
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,300
What am I doing?

163
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,170
I'm on patrol. What else can I do?
What's the matter?

164
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,560
What?

165
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,870
Can't I just chat with you
without any reason?

166
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,670
Just tell me. What's the matter?

167
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,390
You know I don't have a job.

168
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,950
Stop running up my phone bill.

169
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,480
Yes, yes, yes.

170
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,740
You're the only one without a job.

171
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,360
You're amazing and great.

172
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,400
Speak properly.

173
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
Watch your tongue.

174
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,810
How much have you drunk?

175
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,870
Today, I did

176
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,430
something awesome.

177
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,500
I've long been annoyed with those guys

178
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,400
at the construction site.

179
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,920
They always provoked us.

180
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,080
I really couldn't put up with it today,

181
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,670
so I hit those guys.

182
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,100
You hit them?

183
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,270
You should have come, too.

184
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,270
We could have beaten them up together.

185
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,600
That would be wonderful.

186
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Where are you now?

187
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,440
I'm...

188
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,110
just in...

189
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,880
that hot pot restaurant behind the school.

190
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,409
Alright. I'm coming over now.

191
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,890
Uncle Shoucun.

192
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,480
What?

193
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,120
I'm going out for a while.

194
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,250
Where are you going?

195
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,970
I'm going to find Chunhua.

196
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,080
You're going to see Qing, aren't you?

197
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,070
I have something to do.

198
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,200
Keep the door unlocked for me tonight.

199
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,010
Here. Take this stick.

200
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,840
Safety comes first.

201
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,500
No problem.

202
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,440
Alright.

203
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,330
I got it. Don't worry.

204
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,240
Wen Wen.

205
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,150
I need to go out to deal with something.

206
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,030
I won't be back for a couple of days.

207
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,410
What's so urgent that
you have to go at night?

208
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,870
Don't ask about it.

209
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,220
Just have a good rest and sleep well.

210
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,050
Take good care of the baby for me.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,390
I'll give birth to the baby soon.

212
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,730
But you're still going out?

213
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,330
Didn't the doctor say it'd be
at the end of the month?

214
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,420
What the doctor said
isn't totally precise.

215
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,080
You think it'll just happen
on the day he mentioned?

216
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,340
At the end of the month.

217
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,940
I forgot something.

218
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,850
I almost forgot something important.

219
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,420
At the end of the month.

220
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,620
I can't delay buying a gift for our baby.

221
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,330
Don't worry, I'll be back
as soon as I finish my work.

222
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,390
If there's any urgent matter,

223
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,450
just call my buddy.

224
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,030
Is this his baby or yours?

225
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,870
Where's that private room?

226
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,930
Go straight ahead and then
turn right to get to the room.

227
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
He also asked you to come?

228
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:07,920
How is it?

229
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,850
You're here.

230
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,000
Come on. Sit down.

231
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,570
I've got everything ready.

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,390
I'm just waiting for you two.

233
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:18,850
Come on.

234
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,910
Today, we're..

235
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,870
not leaving

236
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,810
until we're drunk.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,460
Cheers.

238
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:32,960
Sir!

239
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:34,960
Sir!

240
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,640
Hello.

241
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,970
Two plates of meat.

242
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,830
A case of beer.

243
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,600
Kun.

244
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,550
You'll pay the bill.

245
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,720
What am I supposed to pay the bill with?

246
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
I've resigned and don't
have a salary anymore.

247
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Captain Luo will pay the bill.

248
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,330
It's fine for me to pay the bill.

249
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,550
You happen to have a lot of anger to vent.

250
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,670
We'll drink with you today.

251
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,510
Let's drink as much as we want.

252
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,040
Alright.

253
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,730
Cheers.

254
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,270
Cheers.

255
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,040
Ms. Luo is really different now.

256
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,720
She doesn't even clink glasses
with us while having a drink.

257
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,960
What do you mean?

258
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,320
How am I different from you guys?

259
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120
What do I mean?

260
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,040
Your project is really impressive now.

261
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,790
One of the top ten archaeological
discoveries in our country.

262
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,850
The two of us are...

263
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,340
When was it selected
as one of the top ten?

264
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,060
Didn't you watch TV today?

265
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,870
I was busy.

266
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,630
Yes, yes, yes. You're quite busy.

267
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,600
You're busy every day being a

268
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,800
cultural relic protection volunteer.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,130
What about Luo Qing?

270
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,130
Now Ms. Luo is

271
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,750
a national young archaeologist.

272
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,160
You're not even worthy of
carrying her shoes.

273
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,180
She's awesome.

274
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,630
Besides,

275
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,720
Ms. Luo...

276
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,120
Back then, you actually

277
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,200
stayed in Qinchuan for Fang Kun.

278
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,120
Alright. Don't drink too much.

279
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,960
Let me finish.

280
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,940
Fang Kun was good,

281
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,670
but he left.

282
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,050
And then...

283
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,270
Now he always follows you around.

284
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,390
Buddy.

285
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,770
Do you regret it?

286
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,950
Alright.

287
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,370
You're both noble.

288
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,730
You're both great.

289
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,560
Unlike me.

290
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm just a vulgar man.

291
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:55,910
I

292
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,220
just want to...

293
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,180
get a professional title.

294
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,770
I just want to...

295
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,160
work on big projects.

296
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,160
I don't want to always

297
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,960
deal with those infrastructure projects.

298
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,830
Nor do I want to see people
scowling at me every day.

299
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,160
I just want...

300
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,930
I just want a raise in my salary.

301
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,650
I just want to...

302
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,030
buy some clothes for my wife.

303
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,440
Why is it so hard?

304
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,780
What about you?

305
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,400
Are you still going to
stay in Yin Village?

306
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,580
What kind of question is that?

307
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,600
I'll leave when the job is done.

308
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,510
What if it's never finished?

309
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,200
Well...

310
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,360
Then I'll just stay in Yin Village's
grand tomb forever.

311
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,880
Scar.

312
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,610
Is this person you found reliable?

313
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,400
I heard he's quite awesome.

314
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,130
You heard that?

315
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,300
Why did you bring him here
if it's just hearsay?

316
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,780
Bro.

317
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,060
If you don't believe it, just take a look.

318
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,260
Just see if his stuff is accurate or not.

319
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,920
I just smelled it,
and the scent wasn't right.

320
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,200
Bro.

321
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,600
His goods

322
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,360
are in a different level
from our crappy stuff.

323
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,050
What do you mean by crappy stuff?

324
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,850
Do you know how to talk properly?

325
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,820
If you don't believe it,
check your little notebook.

326
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,620
Just see if it's accurate or not.

327
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,210
It doesn't match accurately with
the records in my notebook.

328
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,270
It's not accurate?

329
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,120
If you don't believe it,
just check it out.

330
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,470
Let's check it out?

331
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,530
Let's check it out.

332
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,410
It's about the same as how I installed it.

333
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,630
Idiots.

334
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,600
Accurate!

335
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,770
Impressive!

336
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,660
Money.

337
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,790
Buddy.

338
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,319
Where are the goods?

339
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,390
In the car.

340
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,329
How many?

341
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,819
50 kilograms.

342
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,970
What a good bite!

343
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,430
Bite him!

344
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,430
Heizui, bite him!

345
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,040
Bite him!

346
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,550
What a good and ruthless bite!

347
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,950
The dog bit a tomb raider.

348
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,320
Get lost!

349
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,340
Yan Shou...

350
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,090
This stupid dog!

351
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,330
Bite him!

352
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,560
Get lost!

353
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,210
Bite him!

354
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,790
Get lost!

355
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,350
Yan Shoucun, you old fool!

356
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,440
Ask your dog to stay away from me!

357
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,640
Get lost!

358
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,570
What a good bite.

359
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,350
Let go!

360
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,160
Heizui!

361
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,090
Bite him harder!

362
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,750
Hei...

363
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,950
You're awake.

364
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,410
Uncle, what are you doing?

365
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,400
Heizui!

366
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,110
Heizui!

367
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,510
I don't dare to let this guy
enter the village.

368
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:02,880
Let go!

369
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,640
This is a tomb raider.

370
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,040
Let go!

371
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,320
Let go!

372
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,270
This dog is bullying me
with his master's power!

373
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,330
Sit down! Alright!

374
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,010
Sit down!

375
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,310
Sit!

376
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,280
Sit down!

377
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,920
Uncle, what are you doing?

378
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,400
He has been punished in prison.

379
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,680
Why do you still treat him
as a tomb raider?

380
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,010
Fang, stop pretending to be a good person!

381
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,350
Now that I've ended up like this today,

382
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,010
you've played a big part in it!

383
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,570
First, you sent me to jail.

384
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,720
Then you made my wife

385
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,320
follow you around every day.

386
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,800
What's your real intention?

387
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,400
-What are you up to?
-Li Chunlai.

388
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,790
What?

389
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,110
No matter what you want to
say about me, I don't care.

390
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,750
Don't get Xiaoman and her
family involved in this.

391
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,590
So what if I mention her?

392
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,160
You had a hard time in prison.

393
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
Do you think they lived
an easy life outside?

394
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,540
Stop lecturing me!

395
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,980
I've had enough of being lectured!

396
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,580
Come here.

397
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,050
Sit.

398
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Fang.

399
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,540
I'll get even with you gradually.

400
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,590
I am not to be trifled with.

401
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,750
You evil-hearted bastard.

402
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,880
You old fool!

403
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,270
Heizui, bite him! Go!

404
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,240
Bite him! Bite him hard!

405
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,550
Get lost!

406
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,750
Uncle, ask Heizui to come back at once.

407
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,310
If something happens and it bites him...

408
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,720
Heizui.

409
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,520
Yes. Alright.

410
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,070
Alright.

411
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,700
Heizui!

412
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,240
Heizui!

413
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,300
Come on! Come back!

414
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,720
15.

415
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,310
16.

416
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,160
17.

417
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,030
18, 8.

418
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,550
19.

419
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,110
30.

420
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,800
Are you going to give it to me or not?

421
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,550
Lai.

422
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,880
You're back.

423
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,780
Xiaoman.

424
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,210
-I'm back.
-You…

425
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,010
W-Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back?

426
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,410
I haven't even prepared
the fire basin yet.

427
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:36,830
Mom.

428
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,790
Don't prepare that useless stuff.

429
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,390
If he wants to change,
there are plenty of ways.

430
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,150
If he doesn't want to change,

431
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,130
crossing the fire basin
10,000 times won't help.

432
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,530
Xiaoman.

433
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,720
I'm back.

434
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,680
I've thought it through in prison.

435
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,880
I know it was my fault.

436
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,250
Please forgive me.

437
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,480
Your fine words

438
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,800
could fill up a whole basket.

439
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,240
But the things you've done
are dirtier one after another.

440
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,240
Here.

441
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,270
Go. Just go.

442
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,580
-Okay.
-Go inside and talk to her.

443
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,160
-Okay.
-Hurry up!

444
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,250
Xiaoman.

445
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm sorry.

446
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,820
Don't be angry with me anymore.

447
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,400
I used to be a rascal.

448
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,780
I was immature.

449
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Now I understand.

450
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,790
From now on, I'll definitely
treat you well

451
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,440
and take care of the family.

452
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,240
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

453
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,960
I know

454
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,750
you love being in the archaeological team.

455
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,690
As long as you think it's good,

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,880
then just work hard on it.

457
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
I'll support you.

458
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,180
Xiaoman.

459
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,270
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,380
Please forgive me.

461
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,110
Lai.

462
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,810
Stand still first.

463
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,400
Okay.

464
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,870
Lai.

465
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,630
There's no future for us.

466
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,760
What do you mean?

467
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,870
What do you mean?

468
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,490
Just sign it.

469
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,840
[Divorce Agreement]

470
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,240
Dad!

471
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,550
Dad, I'm back!

472
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,550
Dad, please forgive me!

473
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,010
I won't dare to do it again!

474
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,550
I know it was my fault.

475
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,940
I've thought it through in prison.

476
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,920
Please forgive me.

477
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,450
What are you wailing about?

478
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,170
Dad, I've thought it through.

479
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,310
I'll do the housework from now on.

480
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,920
I'll do the fieldwork.

481
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,580
I'll take care of Heng from now on.

482
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,960
But Xiaoman insists on divorcing me.

483
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,530
Heng is still young.

484
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,180
He can't be without a father.

485
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,720
Now you remember Heng?

486
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,980
Why didn't you think of him before?

487
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,030
I don't have any expectations for you now.

488
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,960
I just hope you can be a good person.

489
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,720
When I die, you can shatter the bowls
and bear the banner for me.

490
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,240
Lai.

491
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,200
Your marriage with Xiaoman

492
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,860
is the business of you and her.

493
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,910
As for the path ahead,

494
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,550
you still have to walk it yourself.

495
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,260
Dad, please show me the way.

496
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,960
I really have nowhere to go now.

497
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,570
If you're a real man,

498
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,470
just stand against the wind even if
it freezes you to death.

499
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,070
Never bow even if you
might starve to death.

500
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,800
Live like a decent human being.

501
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,440
Dad!

502
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,950
Dad!

503
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,680
Captain Qi.

504
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,340
Have a seat.

505
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,420
-Captain Qi.
-We're waiting for you.

506
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,950
Thank you.

507
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,750
Let me make you a cup of tea.

508
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,380
These past couple of days,

509
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,830
I've been in too many meetings.

510
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,160
My voice is a bit hoarse.

511
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,340
Let's just

512
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,880
focus on the important points later.

513
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,010
What meeting was it?

514
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,720
The investment promotion meeting?

515
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,590
Ma has been very busy these days.

516
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,210
Well...

517
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,970
In Yin Village,

518
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,920
huge crowds

519
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,750
of people came continuously.

520
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,510
He was so happy that he was
bubbling over with excitement.

521
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,550
Captain Qi.

522
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,510
[Cultural Relic Conservator Training Class from
Baliu Cultural Relics Management Office]

523
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,690
Stop mocking me.

524
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,960
You three are full of passion.

525
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,690
That's true.

526
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,780
But I can't be half-hearted, either.

527
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,200
It's just that

528
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,370
you three are solely focused
on relic preservation,

529
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,510
while I have to do two tasks
at the same time.

530
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,270
I have to deal with relic preservation

531
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,720
and promote the economy.

532
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,440
To manage both sides,

533
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,030
in the end, I'm the one bearing

534
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,510
all the pressure in the middle.

535
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,440
I'm so troubled.

536
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,330
What?

537
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,360
Are we starting off so seriously already?

538
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,970
Let me clarify this first.

539
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,640
Today, we'll just discuss it.

540
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,100
The main purpose is to
come up with a strategy

541
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,000
so that Yin Village's relic preservation

542
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,880
can come into practice.

543
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,720
As for this grand tomb in Yin Village,

544
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,550
without upgrading its preservation status,

545
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,950
even if I want to apply for

546
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,920
more manpower and
resources from the leaders,

547
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,040
there would be no proper justification.

548
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,500
In my opinion, this matter

549
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,090
can't be rushed.

550
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,480
We'll just wait for
the tomb raiders to come?

551
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,180
I'm just talking about the actual reality.

552
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,180
What I'm saying is also the reality.

553
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Over these years,

554
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,400
Captain Yang and I

555
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,550
have encountered more tomb raiders

556
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,610
than the number of buns you've eaten.

557
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,720
What would the tomb raiders think?

558
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,320
The Yin Village's grand tomb

559
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,830
is not a nationally protected site.

560
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,400
It's not included in a protected area.

561
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,240
Even if I dig it with a shovel,

562
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,110
how many years will I be sentenced to?

563
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,750
They said,

564
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,880
"I go in as iron,

565
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,310
and come out as steel."

566
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,030
"Keep working on it."

567
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,430
Right.

568
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,930
We can't delay.

569
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,750
It may look calm on the surface now,

570
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
but the tomb raiders are like ducks,

571
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,130
paddling furiously underneath.

572
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,610
Feed some Black Gouqi Berries to Heizui.

573
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,200
I don't dare to let it eat them.

574
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,510
It might have a diarrhea.

575
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,000
Let's go.

576
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,200
Then you can eat them.

577
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,550
What's the point of me eating them?

578
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,880
You'll get big strength from eating them.

579
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,280
You can eat them.

580
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,880
Let's go.

581
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,490
Let's go.

582
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,210
Why is this door open today?

583
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,040
This is Qi Youliang's shack.

584
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,550
What's Youliang doing in the fields?

585
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,410
There's nothing in these fields.

586
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,340
Heizui.

587
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,080
Go inside and take a look.

588
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,970
Heizui!

589
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,640
-How dare you disturb my dream!
-Come here.

590
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:04,920
Come here!

591
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,590
Believe it or not...

592
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,960
Believe it or not, I'll break your legs!

593
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,920
Don't you dare give it a try?

594
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,030
Don't you dare hurt my Heizui?

595
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,110
You old fool!

596
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,270
Just see if I dare or not!

597
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,800
Heizui.

598
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,720
Let's go!

599
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,910
Don't... Don't try to curse me again!

600
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,960
I'll just curse you!

601
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,000
I... I'm going to make a call.

602
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,880
I'll call Yang Qingshi.

603
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,270
Why are you calling Yang Qingshi?

604
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,740
There's a tomb raider in this field.

605
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,270
Call him!

606
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,320
Call him now!

607
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm just worried about where to sleep.

608
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,830
You old fool.

609
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,790
You're acting as if
you had real authority.

610
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,160
When you were bad,
they said you were good.

611
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,550
When you were good,
they said you were bad.

612
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,720
You've said it all.

613
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,780
Alright, Chunlai!

614
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,880
This is a misunderstanding.

615
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,270
We're leaving.

616
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,600
There's no misunderstanding between us.

617
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,480
Let me tell you.

618
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,680
Xiaoman and I are not divorced yet.

619
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,580
I own half of this garden, too.

620
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,790
If anyone dares to step
into my garden again,

621
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,830
I'll break your legs, believe it or not!

622
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,560
I'll hit you!

623
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,510
Let's go!

624
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,510
Let's go!

625
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,240
We're leaving.

626
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,070
Come on. L-L-Let's go.

627
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,400
Let's not provoke him.

628
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,160
Let's not provoke that fool.

629
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,690
Let's go.

630
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,300
Director Tang.

631
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
What do you think?

632
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,660
I don't have any thoughts.

633
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,200
We only have these few people.

634
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,800
Once you decide, we'll do it.

635
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,620
Captain Qi,

636
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,900
have you eaten yet?

637
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,640
No.

638
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,400
We still have a little food here.

639
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,830
Well, I'll get some for you.

640
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,310
Okay.

641
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,550
Ma.

642
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,820
I'm solving the problem,
not targeting anyone.

643
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Normally speaking,

644
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,550
police shouldn't get involved too deeply

645
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,370
before a case happens.

646
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,160
But as for me,

647
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,830
I'm from Yin Village.

648
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,730
Yin Village is my hometown.

649
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,970
It's my ancestral home.

650
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,260
If something happens,

651
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,540
how can I...

652
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,400
How can I face the villagers?

653
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,550
Secondly,

654
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,160
over these years,

655
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,540
for the sake of relic preservation,

656
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,680
Captain Yang has put in a lot of effort.

657
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,830
He set up the joint strike office

658
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,080
and coordinated the work

659
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,720
with so many government departments.

660
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,030
That's immeasurably meritorious.

661
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,730
I can't mess this up.

662
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,140
Captain Qi.

663
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,850
I understand everything you've said.

664
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,240
We all just want to do the work well.

665
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,690
How about this?

666
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,550
If you have any opinions or issues,

667
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
feel free to tell me.

668
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,480
I'll report them to
the higher-ups for you all.

669
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,000
Ma.

670
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,520
There are no outsiders here.

671
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,900
Drop the official tone.

672
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,200
We're here to get things done.

673
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,170
If you can do it, do it for us.

674
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,000
If you can't, I won't blame you.

675
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,010
How is it? Not bad, huh?

676
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,030
Not bad.

677
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,400
Section Chief Ma.

678
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
What's wrong with your eyes?

679
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,800
Why are you looking askance?

680
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,430
Alright, Director Tang.

681
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,720
Stop satirizing me.

682
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,240
While having a meal,

683
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,440
you're still complaining about being poor?

684
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,590
How am I complaining about being poor?

685
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,640
I am really poor.

686
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,150
You...

687
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,100
Director Tang.

688
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Here's the thing.

689
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,240
Give me your fuel vouchers
that haven't been reimbursed.

690
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,770
I'll go find Mr. You to
reimburse them for you.

691
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,390
If there's anything else
you need, let me know.

692
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,920
No matter what issue Mr. You can't solve,

693
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,030
I'll solve it for you.

694
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,480
Okay.

695
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,440
Captain Yang is just so straightforward.

696
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,880
Let me tell you my attitude, too.

697
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,140
There are no CCTV cameras in Yin Village.

698
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,400
Install CCTV cameras first.

699
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,530
I just got my salary.

700
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,800
Alright.

701
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,920
That's it.

702
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,720
When I go back today,

703
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,270
I'll report it to the district government.

704
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,950
I'll solve the issue of
camera installation first.

705
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,350
Do you think that's okay?

706
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,400
I'll keep my promise.

707
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,310
No matter when they reimburse the cost,

708
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,310
I'll buy all the CCTV cameras for us.

709
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,920
What do you three think?

710
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,830
Is that okay?

711
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,090
It's like plucking a hair
from an iron horse.

712
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,240
It's not easy.

713
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,430
Listen to yourself.

714
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm also a man with blood and flesh.

715
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,960
I've been interacting with
Yin Village for so many years.

716
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,510
I...

717
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,460
have feelings, too.

718
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:21,680
♪ There's a war horse tied to
the Phoenix Tree ♪

719
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,070
♪ The saddle is leaning on a redbud tree ♪

720
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,440
What kind of day is this?

721
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,290
Yan Shoucun still dares to come?

722
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,470
He has come to the fields.

723
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,190
This is definitely variegated earth.

724
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,740
We've finally found the spot this time.

725
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,700
This is it.

726
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,120
Spare me, sir! Spare me...

727
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,410
Isn't this Li Chunlai?

728
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,830
When were you released from prison?

729
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,200
Hei?

730
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,750
I...

731
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,510
Bro.

732
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,480
He has been released from prison, too.

733
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,790
H-He once helped me.

734
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,980
How about we let him go?

735
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,570
We can let him go.

736
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,530
Gouge his eyeballs out.

737
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,590
Cut off his tongue.

738
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,120
Get up.

739
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,960
Bro!

740
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,600
For my sake, don't hurt him.

741
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,350
Besides, if you make a big noise,

742
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,150
it'll hinder our real business.

743
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,910
Money.

744
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,490
I don't want money, bro.

745
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,270
Are you stupid?

746
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,950
This isn't money. It's a lock.

747
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,880
Get lost!

748
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:57,660
Lock.

749
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,930
Stop right there.

750
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
Bro!

751
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,350
Take it.

752
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:15,900
Get lost!

753
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,070
Each person has his own ruler.
The Door God rules the Kitchen God.

754
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,450
You...

755
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,400
It's right for you to

756
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,480
talk to your Master Liu.

757
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,570
Master Liu.

758
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,460
Cheers.

759
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,310
I watched Youliang

760
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,760
grow up from his babyhood.

761
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,480
He's just like a smelly and hard

762
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,750
stone in the toilet.

763
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,360
Well,

764
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,570
he's quite stubborn and
insists on his own principles.

765
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,410
To deal with his condition,

766
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,650
we need to use the right medicine.

767
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,130
What medicine?

768
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,370
Let me give you a tip.

769
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,110
Chunlai.

770
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,660
What are you doing?

771
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,360
Where are you going?

772
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
Are you going to play mahjong again?

773
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,050
Who are you?

774
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,320
Do I know you?

775
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,800
What's the matter?

776
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,930
Lai, let me tell you.

777
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,550
Listen.

778
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,990
It's fine for you to
hold a grudge against me.

779
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,960
But don't forget that

780
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,840
you're a man with a home,
a wife and a child.

781
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,550
You're not a degenerate gambler
that no one cares about.

782
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,610
Do you understand?

783
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,360
I have a home,

784
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,030
a wife and a child?

785
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,190
Have you ever seen someone with
a home sleeping in the fields?

786
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,960
Have you ever seen someone
with a wife and a child

787
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,360
wandering around the streets at midnight?

788
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,480
Even Heizui has a place to stay.

789
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,410
I'm not even as good as a dog.

790
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,890
Li Chunlai!

791
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,960
If you go in today,
your life will be ruined.

792
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,020
Do you understand?

793
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,510
Lai.

794
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,490
What took you so long to come here
after you were released?

795
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,850
He must have gone to earn
money for gambling.

796
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,510
He probably sold ancient
bricks and tiles again

797
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,650
and made a fortune.

798
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,200
Focus on playing mahjong.

799
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,740
Don't ask for a beating.

800
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,650
Come on.

801
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,400
One Dot.

802
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,140
Come on. Get dressed.

803
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,030
Let's go watch the opera.

804
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,390
I'm not going.

805
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,960
If you want to go, you can go.

806
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,260
What's wrong with you?

807
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,280
In previous years, when the opera
hadn't even started yet.

808
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,200
you'd teach this person how to play erhu

809
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,800
and tutor another person
in playing the suona.

810
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,760
What's wrong?

811
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,120
What's going on this year?

812
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,650
Why are you staying at home?

813
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm leaving then.

814
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,720
Lai was only sentenced
to a few months in prison.

815
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,720
But you've sentenced yourself
to life imprisonment.

816
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,360
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

817
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,190
Very good!

818
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,390
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

819
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,190
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

820
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,070
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

821
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,550
Very good!

822
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,560
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

823
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,920
Did Master Liu play it well?

824
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,190
Yes!

825
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,630
How about another piece of music?

826
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,320
Sure!

827
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,380
Alright. Let Master Liu take a break.

828
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,510
During the break,

829
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,240
I'll tell everyone a story
about our Yin Village.

830
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,630
I guess this story...

831
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,760
The villagers here

832
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,820
probably haven't heard of it before.

833
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,340
There are still things about Yin Village
that I don't know?

834
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,540
Master Liu.

835
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,820
In Yin Village,

836
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,870
although you're the eldest man,

837
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,630
the story I'm about to tell

838
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,540
happened during the Northern Song Dynasty.

839
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,070
That was before your birth.

840
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,890
Well...

841
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,500
Go ahead and tell us then.

842
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,480
-If it's about our Yin Village...
-My father...

843
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,510
How would our Yin villagers not know it?

844
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,230
My father didn't come?

845
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,000
-No, he didn't.
-But you, an outsider, know it?

846
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,480
He's not coming.

847
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,540
Alright. Let me tell you all about it.

848
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,070
During the Northern Song Dynasty,

849
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,670
there was a great general
from our Yin Village.

850
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,470
This general

851
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,990
trained soldiers and horses here
and was awe-inspiring in the country.

852
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,920
Has anyone heard of this story before?

853
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,400
No!

854
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,480
I really haven't heard of that before.

855
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
Tell us about it!

856
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,510
Hurry up and tell us!

857
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,480
This general's

858
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,630
surname was Qi.

859
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,280
Among the villagers here today,

860
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,000
those with the surname Qi,
please raise your hands.

861
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
Let me see how many there are.

862
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,580
Qi is a common surname in our Yin Village.

863
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,780
That's right.

864
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,480
I've also heard that this general
had a nickname.

865
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,840
He was called Face-Tattooed General.

866
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
What? Face-Dough General?

867
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,030
Was he made of dough?

868
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,480
Master Liu, you really know how to joke.

869
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,280
There were

870
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,320
characters carved on his face,

871
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,550
so he was called Face-Tattooed General.

872
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,150
Wait.

873
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,240
How come I heard that

874
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,300
in ancient times, only when
people committed crimes,

875
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,190
they would have characters
carved on their faces?

876
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,180
Master Liu is indeed knowledgeable.

877
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,050
That's right. This general
did commit a crime.

878
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,710
He even went to prison for his crime.

879
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,030
Just think about it.

880
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,270
If an ordinary person committed
a crime and went to prison,

881
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,230
with characters carved on his face

882
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,880
that could never be erased
for the rest of his life,

883
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,810
that person would basically
be beyond redemption.

884
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,610
That's right.

885
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,960
It's like being nailed to the pillory.

886
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,720
He could never make a comeback.

887
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,000
That's right.

888
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,840
But as the old saying goes,

889
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,400
"Wheat seedlings aren't afraid
of being pressed by snow."

890
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,150
"Rapeseeds aren't afraid of
the strike from frost."

891
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,080
Yes. "Rapeseeds aren't afraid of
the strike from frost."

892
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
This General Qi

893
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,670
not only didn't give up
on himself because of that,

894
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,070
but he also practiced horsemanship
and archery tirelessly.

895
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:03,610
Good!

896
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:08,150
Good!

897
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,840
-The enemy invaded our country many times.
-Look!

898
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,570
But he faced death fearlessly.

899
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,290
With a bronze mask,

900
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,960
he took the lead in the attack

901
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,110
and went through enemy lines as if
they were unguarded places.

902
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,170
His body was hit by arrows many times.

903
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,430
But he showed no fear.

904
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,510
Later,

905
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,400
when the enemies heard General Qi's name,

906
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,190
they

907
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,280
would be panic-stricken.

908
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,230
At that time, the emperor said,

909
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,800
"Do you want to remove
the characters from your face?"

910
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,730
But he pointed to his face and said,

911
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,070
"The reason why I've achieved
these things today

912
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,840
is because of these characters."

913
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,480
"I want to keep these characters

914
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,810
to remind myself and inspire the troops."

915
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,920
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

916
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,510
Well said!

917
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,320
Bravo!

918
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,120
The surname Qi

919
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,940
has originated from the surname Jiang.

920
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,400
The Jiang of Jiang Ziya.

921
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,880
Since the reign of King Zhou,

922
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,930
our Yin Village has had
ancestors with the surname Qi.

923
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,760
Over thousands of years, the lineage
hasn't been broken for generations.

924
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,890
What was the reason?

925
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,610
The reason was being

926
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,110
tough, cold, unyielding and stubborn.

927
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,260
When General Qi was stationed here,

928
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,590
outsiders absolutely didn't
dare to invade our territory.

929
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,480
But nowadays,

930
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,830
how many tomb raiders have tried to
rob our Yin Village's grand tomb?

931
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,850
As descendants of the tomb's owner

932
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,800
and descendants of General Qi,

933
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,800
should our Yin villagers

934
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,960
just sit by and do nothing?

935
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,430
No, we shouldn't!

936
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,710
If those thieves come,

937
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,960
will they be able to do that?

938
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,820
No, they won't!

939
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,110
Is what Kun said right?

940
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,360
Yes, it is!

941
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,710
Was it well said?

942
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,760
Yes, it was!

943
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,670
Bravo!
