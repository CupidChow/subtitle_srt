3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,240
I'm the leader of the archaeological team.

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,310
I decide who the team needs

5
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,759
or not.

6
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,350
I'm officially notifying you on behalf of

7
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,509
the archaeology team—

8
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,710
You have to come back.

9
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,490
The team needs you.

10
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,479

You can leave him to us.

21
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,210
-Alright
-We're leaving.

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,300

Spicy garlic lamb blood.

You're weak, aren't you?

36
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,840
Just a couple of hits

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,450
got you in a wheelchair.

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,490
Get lost.

39
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,800
Shut your mouth if you can't talk nicely.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,630
Let that car hit you and see how you feel.

41
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,150
-Yeah.
-I'm doing fine.

42
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,150
The mutton soup is ready.

43
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,120
Drink a few bowls,

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,180
and you'll be fine.

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,000
Once our relics protection
team is established,

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,150
we'll definitely avenge you.

47
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,150
What team are you talking about now?

48
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,170
We don't even patrol anymore.

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,800
Now we have a monitoring room.

50
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,520
Come on.

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,120
Lift it up a bit.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,850
Lift it up. Three, two, one, go.

53
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,750
Careful.

54
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,950
Coming. The mutton soup is here.

55
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,360
Come on, I'm using the computer.

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,960
Do you even know how?

57
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,470
You don't know anything, and still—

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,000
Get me a bowl of mutton soup.

59
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,940
I've been stewing it all morning.

60
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
Start eating, come on.

61
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,840
You serve the soup to everyone.

62
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,120
I'll eat a bun.

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,680
Have a bun.

64
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,150
Come on.

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,420
This is so good.

66
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,240
So good.

67
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,570
I'd like another bowl.

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,020
Here, mutton soup.

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,820
Come on, drink it quickly.

70
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,040
It'll get cold soon.

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,130
Here.

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,960
It's yours.

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,690
You drink it.

74
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,590
I won't.

75
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,520
Have a seat.

76
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,150
Sit down.

77
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,310
Just sit.

78
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,480
You... Help yourself.

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,360
Luo Qing said

80
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,510
the sounding stone

81
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,560
and these

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
chime bells

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,470
should have come from

84
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,950
this pit.

85
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,330
And this matches the lotus candlestick.

86
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,620
The gilt lotus leaf we found in the pit

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,120
must have been dropped

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,520
when they were taking it.

89
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,030
Right.

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,750
This is

91
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,270
an official seal.

92
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,950
We think so.

93
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,800
Did the tomb raider

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,480
say

95
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,170
there's any

96
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,120
inscriptions?

97
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,800
Yes.

98
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,830
That's why I'm here.

99
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,770
The tomb raider couldn't recognize them.

100
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,740
I've heard

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,020
bronze artifacts are more valuable
the more inscriptions they have.

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,020
I was thinking,

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,200
if you could use this to

104
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,470
determine whose tomb it is,

105
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,630
it might be even more
valuable than solving this case.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,740
Professional.

107
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,510
I'm not that good.

108
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,110
Just learning from you guys.

109
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,800
I've discussed it with Guo.

110
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,600
This is an official seal
based on its style.

111
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,430
If it was found in the outer burial pit,

112
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,490
it must be some sort of official seal.

113
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,240
There's more food.

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,070
Eat up.

115
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,810
If you like spicy food, add some chili.

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Sit down.

117
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,750
Eat quickly.

118
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,800
It's basically this type of

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,159
combination.

120
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,360
Alright.

121
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,750
Can I take it back

122
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,680
and let the tomb raider identify it?

123
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,120
Okay.

124
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
I'll get back to you after that.

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,690
Alright.

126
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,040
Can it be retrieved?

127
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Hard to say.

128
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,130
It's been too long.

129
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,460
We can't rule out that
it's passed through customs.

130
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,270
If it's gone overseas,

131
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
finding it would be

132
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,630
like looking for a needle in a haystack.

133
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,460
Captain Qi,

134
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,240
how can we find it
with just these few drawings?

135
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,190
In a while,

136
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,430
Qinchuan is going to launch

137
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,800
a platform for publishing information
on stolen Chinese cultural relics,

138
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,270
by the Ministry of Public Security
and the National Cultural Heritage Administration,

139
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,270
commissioned to the provincial department.

140
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,800
I heard it has info on
all stolen cultural relics

141
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,800
since the founding of
the People's Republic of China.

142
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,510
So, if it's really the case,

143
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,190
then people worldwide can report it

144
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,880
as soon as they see it.

145
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,310
So I was thinking,

146
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,210
we could upload these patterns

147
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,320
and give it a try.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,330
Okay.

149
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
Many hands make...

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,580
light work.

151
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,280
Which one?

152
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,480
The one above.

153
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,400
This one?

154
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,630
Exactly the same?

155
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,410
I only glanced at it a few times.

156
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,550
I can't remember it clearly.

157
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
But this one looks the most similar.

158
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,480
Guo.

159
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,600
You're

160
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,630
packing up

161
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,360
to go where?

162
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,240
Going home.

163
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,910
Haven't been back in a while.

164
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,510
My wife's going to show me
the three-piece set.

165
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,200
What's the three-piece set?

166
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,510
"Hello."

167
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,050
"Excuse me."

168
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,080
"Sorry for the trouble."

169
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,790
It's more distant than when we first met.

170
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,910
If I don't go back now,

171
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,910
we'll become the most familiar strangers.

172
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,720
But you're getting there too.

173
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,620
Don't envy me.

174
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,080
But

175
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,910
if you're leaving,

176
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,720
what about me?

177
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,630
I even...

178
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,680
I've prepared everything for you.

179
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,910
Besides, there's still Luo Qing, right?

180
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,360
That girl

181
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,160
has expressed herself clearly.

182
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,670
You should hurry up and get this fire

183
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,670
burning quickly.

184
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,390
I'll leave this place to you.

185
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,270
The rest

186
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,240
is up to you.

187
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,230
Good luck.

188
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,080
Fang.

189
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,770
The weather is really nice today.

190
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,550
It's very nice.

191
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,090
Well...

192
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:51,910
Fang,

193
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,730
I'll leave you here.

194
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:56,910
Okay.

195
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,270
You can enjoy some sunshine.

196
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:00,750
Alright.

197
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,600
I have something to do.

198
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:01,960
Okay.

199
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,510
Thank you.

200
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,370
Alright.

201
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,050
You're quite capable.

202
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,620
You managed to move here all by yourself.

203
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,760
Where are you going?

204
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,360
Going home.

205
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,720
You have the determination
to move back home,

206
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,250
but not the resolve to stay?

207
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,810
I don't want

208
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,580
to be a burden.

209
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,060
The archaeological team
doesn't keep idle people.

210
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,600
Even if you're a burden,

211
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,060
you're still a useful one.

212
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,400
Right now, you're good for something.

213
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,390
Tell me.

214
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,150
Do you remember

215
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,200
where did the claim that
Zi Mausoleum is on Phoenix Mountain

216
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,460
originally come from?

217
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,360
From Luo Tianxiang's

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,510
Classified Records of Chang'an.

219
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:13,870
Yes.

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,870
Zi Mausoleum is 20 km east
of Jingzhao Tonghua Gate,

221
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,270
at the foot of Phoenix Mountain
north of Bailu Plain.

222
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,000
There's a paragraph to follow.

223
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,960
In the autumn of the Xinmao year,

224
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
the Zishui River burst open
the outer gate of Zi Mausoleum,

225
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,090
washing out more than 500 stone slabs.

226
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,060
What are you trying to say?

227
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,840
If we take it literally,

228
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,600
this "outer gate"

229
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,270
should refer to the outer gate
of Zi Mausoleum's tomb passage.

230
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,320
In other words, during the Zhiyuan era,

231
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,390
the Zishui River burst open
this tomb passage's outer gate.

232
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,360
I don't know what
"washing out stone slabs" means,

233
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,960
but I guess this is

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,150
Luo Tianxiang's basis

235
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,320
for determining that Zi Mausoleum
is on Phoenix Mountain.

236
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,200
And it's described in great detail.

237
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,270
But if we can't explain it properly,

238
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,320
this statement can't stand,

239
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,250
and no one will believe it.

240
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,030
The institute thinks the same way.

241
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,840
So they sent
a geophysical prospecting company

242
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,360
to use technological means

243
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,240
to obtain potential information about

244
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,080
remains, artifacts, and relics
on Phoenix Mountain.

245
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,550
After the second exploration,
they'll move on to the third.

246
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,790
Can any high-tech method
compare to a shovel?

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,750
Indeed.

248
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,250
The final results are all the same.

249
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,120
But to overturn

250
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,510
a thousand years of recorded history

251
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,600
is not so easy.

252
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,720
So the most important thing right now

253
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,270
is to figure out
the Classified Records of Chang'an.

254
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,270
Only then can we convince everyone.

255
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,030
What can I do?

256
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,860
All my people are up on Phoenix Mountain.

257
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,690
I can't spare anyone to do this.

258
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,650
So I have to rely on you.

259
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,120
What can I do in this condition?

260
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,510
You're Fang Kun.

261
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're asking me?

262
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,850
Didn't you used to have plenty of ideas?

263
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,840
Like when you stopped Ma Chaoyue
from filling the looting pit.

264
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,360
Where did that spirit go?

265
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,040
Alright.

266
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,840
I can see that.

267
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,960
You have a bunch of excuses.

268
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,000
Then I have no choice.

269
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,720
I can't force you with a knife.

270
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,080
Right?

271
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,010
So we'll just keep
postponing this project.

272
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,280
I have no idea how long it'll be delayed.

273
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,910
When I go to see Mr. Zan later,

274
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll bring him a message,

275
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,770
saying "Your prized disciple, Fang Kun,

276
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,860
has already left our archaeological team

277
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,400
due to his temporary leg problem.

278
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,960
And he's left the mess from years ago

279
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,120
to poor me and Guo Shilin.

280
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,200
I've put aside the Lv Family Tomb

281
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,870
to come here and help.

282
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,730
He can't blame me for that."

283
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,600
You're coercing me.

284
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,170
Yes, I am.

285
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,260
Not just using Mr. Zan,

286
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,790
but also using Guo and me to coerce you.

287
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,630
Because if it weren't for you,

288
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,750
Guo and I would have never

289
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,080
gotten involved with the Yin Village case.

290
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,240
It has nothing to do with us.

291
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:53,910
But you?

292
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,530
You've dragged us both into this.

293
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,270
And now you want to walk away?

294
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,790
No way.

295
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,030
What you said that day,

296
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,200
were you serious?

297
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,320
Which day?

298
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,600
I need you to be my boyfriend.

299
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,390
Me to your boyfriend.

300
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,000
Was that serious?

301
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
What do you think?

302
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,870
I'll stay!

303
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,720
Where are you going?

304
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,400
Go back by yourself!

305
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,790
Guang.

306
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,750
Kun.

307
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,970
Don't move.

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,530
Lie down.

309
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,830
I made you some millet porridge

310
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,880
with veggies

311
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,370
and stewed the meat until it's tender.

312
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,400
Drink up.

313
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,790
Kun,

314
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,350
I want to take this off.

315
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,350
You can't.

316
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,510
When can I take it off?

317
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,960
Whenever

318
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,170
the doctor says.

319
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,600
It's so uncomfortable.

320
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,630
Oh, right.

321
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,780
Let me show you.

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,330
Here.

323
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,250
Look.

324
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,840
The baby's doing great.

325
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,330
Seems like he's gotten chubbier.

326
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,850
He sure has put on some weight.

327
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,510
My arms get tired holding him.

328
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,270
Why is the screen black?

329
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,600
You just stay here and rest easy.

330
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,740
Shulan will take care of the baby.

331
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,530
If you want to find Wen Wen,

332
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,830
have the guys help you out.

333
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,110
Don't worry about anything.

334
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,110
I feel relieved with you and Shulan

335
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,600
taking care of the baby.

336
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,750
Kun,

337
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,400
I've been thinking

338
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,030
that you should give the baby a name.

339
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,110
Have you thought of one?

340
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,720
I shouldn't name him.

341
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,030
You're the father, so it's up to you.

342
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,960
Once you've decided,

343
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
I can tell Shulan.

344
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,040
She's been calling the baby
"good boy" every day.

345
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,350
My name doesn't sound good.

346
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,270
Li Yuanguang—

347
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,100
meaning the light is fading further away.

348
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,680
I hope my kid

349
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,350
will grow up brightly.

350
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,560
Then call him "Liangtang."

351
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,900
Doesn't sound like a name.

352
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,810
How about Liangliang?

353
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,690
Liangliang.

354
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,740
Living a bright and upright life.

355
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,690
That works.

356
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,210
Sounds good.

357
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,860
If anything happens to me,

358
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,400
Liangliang

359
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,150
will be your and Shulan's child.

360
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,480
Guang, how can you say that?

361
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,710
Do you really think I have no guts at all?

362
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,920
Do you know who beat you?

363
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,590
I remember the voice.

364
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,230
Someone from Hedong.

365
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,680
He came to seek revenge on me.

366
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,070
You're wrong.

367
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,220
This wasn't about you.

368
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,740
It was about me.

369
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,770
You took the beating for me.

370
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,510
Why?

371
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,160
How could a Hedong guy possibly find you?

372
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,750
Zhao Youlin.

373
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,550
Just wait.

374
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,160
This isn't over.

375
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,970
That guy is really heartless.

376
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,750
I heard the Hedong guy was arrested.

377
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,110
Don't get into trouble because of me.

378
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,310
What is Zhao Youlin?

379
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,070
A wall standing in our way.

380
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,600
Now we only have two choices.

381
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,170
Either we turn back and admit defeat,

382
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,200
letting him step on us forever,

383
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,030
or we charge forward and knock him down.

384
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,900
What do you think we should do?

385
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,750
Captain Qi,

386
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,790
are you setting up an ambush?

387
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,920
Still haven't found the Liang gang's

388
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,720
gravedigger.

389
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,020
It's frustrating.

390
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,380
Captain Qi,

391
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,750
don't you think

392
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,240
that what Liang told us

393
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,440
about the person who sold him
explosives is a bit suspicious?

394
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,840
I'm thinking of someone.

395
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,060
The Gunner.

396
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,560
Right.

397
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,290
It's a pity this Gunner is so mysterious.

398
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,950
He hasn't surfaced for all these years.

399
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,550
This time he has.

400
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,720
We analyzed the explosives used

401
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,030
in the Yin Village tomb,

402
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,890
and found that

403
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,000
the mix is nearly identical to

404
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,460
the one used by Uncle Gang

405
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,410
in recent years.

406
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,510
You mean the thieves
are from Uncle Gang,

407
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,960
and the Gunner...

408
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,400
is too?

409
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,640
Perhaps.

410
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,550
Do you think this Uncle

411
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
is Mu Jianhui?

412
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,960
I wouldn't say that.

413
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,400
Right.

414
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,720
We don't have any evidence now.

415
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,240
It's hard to expose Uncle Gang.

416
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,880
Unless...

417
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,400
Unless King Hua gets caught.

418
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:15,800
Right.

419
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,350
Just wait for the right time.

420
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,350
When King Hua gets exposed,

421
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,750
and Liang's arrested,

422
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
where can Uncle hide?

423
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,430
Well, we know so little

424
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,160
about King Hua.

425
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,920
It's been nearly 10 years
since the black pottery figurine case.

426
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,850
Like we've been fighting a shadow.

427
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,740
Oh, right.

428
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,960
I've redrawn the portrait based on Liang's

429
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,310
description of King Hua,

430
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,640
and double-checked their

431
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
communication records.

432
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,680
I've locked several public phone booths,

433
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,210
all around Xingfu Village.

434
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,200
It seems that

435
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,200
King Hua is most

436
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,000
likely around Xingfu Village.

437
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,000
Xingfu Village.

438
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,350
A place where all sorts mingle.

439
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,200
A perfect hiding spot.

440
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,440
Remember back then,

441
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,720
when we were chasing King Hua
in the black pottery figurine case?

442
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,550
Yes.

443
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,730
He loved hiding in small inns.

444
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,120
Pity that he got away.

445
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,530
If he's hiding here, how do we find him?

446
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,940
Use the old method.

447
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,860
The old method?

448
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,200
Wide net?

449
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,440
Blanket search?

450
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,010
No one gets left out.

451
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,240
But you know how many
buildings are in this village

452
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,000
and how many people live here?

453
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,830
How do we investigate?

454
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,960
Just wander around?

455
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,270
Sometimes

456
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,590
the dumbest method is the best one.

457
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,710
Got any better ideas?

458
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,680
Any strategies?

459
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,090
You're impressive.

460
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,230
I found the book you want.

461
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,720
Is it cold at night?

462
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,920
Let me...

463
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,120
Add this blanket for you,

464
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,470
so you don't get cold.

465
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,640
Why don't you ask me why

466
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,160
I want this book?

467
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,030
If you want to tell me,

468
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,320
you'd have said it already.

469
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,050
Do I even need to ask?

470
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,200
How come I never noticed before

471
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,200
that we're so in sync?

472
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,310
Before,

473
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,530
you were like a wild goose—

474
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,660
Whenever I say something,

475
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,880
you'd snap at me.

476
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,790
You should thank me.

477
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,070
If I hadn't always

478
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,350
gone against you,

479
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,950
you'd have caused more troubles.

480
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,820
You kept it especially for me?

481
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,640
Of course.

482
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,990
What if I hadn't come?

483
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,240
See, we're in sync indeed.

484
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,720
Why are you laughing?

485
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,460
I'm laughing at how you've
changed after the incident,

486
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,260
like you're a different person.

487
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
It's good that you speak slower now,

488
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,570
so you can't snap at me.

489
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,960
From now on, I won't snap at you.

490
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,480
Captain Pang,

491
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,160
nowadays, high-tech methods

492
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,200
are increasingly used in

493
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,000
archaeological applications.

494
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,440
We hope you can use

495
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,790
geophysical and geochemical

496
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,480
exploration technologies

497
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,050
to help us analyze the soil structure.

498
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,110
This will also serve as a verification

499
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,070
of our previous
archaeological exploration work.

500
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,600
Alright.

501
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,750
Thank you for your hard work.

502
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,750
Don't mention it.

503
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,440
Hey, young man, what are you doing?

504
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,110
You're moving several meters at a time.

505
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,570
I heard that a few days ago,

506
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,750
you almost moved out of the village.

507
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,250
That's quite impressive.

508
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,770
Heizui, look at him.

509
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,370
Where are you going?

510
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,160
I've received an order.

511
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,160
Your girl Qing went all the way
to the site to find me,

512
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,500
asking me to bring you along

513
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,430
to look for some stone slab.

514
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,680
Are you looking for stone slabs?

515
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,880
You're so lucky.

516
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,200
That young lady is pretty, careful,

517
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,970
sincere and genuine to you.

518
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,590
I approve of your marriage.

519
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,040
Let's go.

520
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,080
Captain Luo.

521
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,680
Today,

522
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,810
we've brought all our best equipment.

523
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,030
We've seen
ground-penetrating radar before,

524
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,000
as we've used it
quite often in archaeology.

525
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
Yes, it's also known as

526
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,160
the "Eye of Geophysical Prospecting."

527
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,360
It can detect underground structures,

528
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,510
such as rocks and soil,

529
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,320
as well as man-made materials
like gravel and concrete bricks.

530
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,830
Besides the ground-penetrating radar,

531
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,240
we've also brought

532
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,640
high-density electrical resistivity meters
and radon detectors this time.

533
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,840
What? What detector?

534
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,090
Radon detector.

535
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,520
It mainly can

536
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,010
detect whether there's radon in the gas

537
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,770
and how many becquerels per cubic meter.

538
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,410
This radon

539
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,000
is a common element

540
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,960
in our natural world.

541
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,200
For example, granite,
which is common in tomb construction,

542
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,920
bricks, and sand

543
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,030
are all major sources of radon.

544
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,310
By analyzing this, we can infer whether

545
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,720
there's evidence of a tomb
being artificially constructed here.

546
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,030
Fellow villager,

547
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,360
have you seen any
stone slabs around here?

548
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,270
-No.
-No.

549
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,720
No.

550
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,920
Is...

551
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,350
there...

552
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,350
-any...
-What? I can't hear you.

553
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,030
No.

554
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,200
Any...

555
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,440
Go now.

556
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,790
How do I use this?

557
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,430
Move back.

558
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,410
Let's go.

559
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,990
Captain Yang, what's up?

560
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,890
You're here.

561
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,310
Didn't Liang mention that

562
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,770
he stole a pair of
gilt bronze candlesticks?

563
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,680
Yes.

564
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,540
Take a look at this.

565
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,150
Where did this come from?

566
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,030
Someone anonymously reported
to the Cultural Relics Bureau,

567
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,790
saying

568
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,720
these gilded bronze candlesticks
are stolen items.

569
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,830
They're about to be auctioned

570
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,830
at Qinchuan Jinyang Auction House.

571
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,640
Got any info about the informant?

572
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,110
The informant was very careful.

573
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,270
Not only was it anonymous,

574
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,790
but he also cut off
all possibilities of finding him.

575
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,450
It's clearly well-prepared.

576
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,040
Right.

577
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,440
Do you think these candlesticks

578
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,240
match the ones Liang described?

579
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,640
Do you recognize it?

580
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,560
Yes.

581
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,070
I got these from Yin Village.

582
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,540
Take a closer look.

583
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,680
That's right.

584
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
I'm from the Public Security Bureau.

585
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,510
This is my ID.

586
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,570
I'm here to ask you some questions.

587
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,160
Alright, have a seat.

588
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,370
What's the matter?

589
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,470
Take a look at this photo.

590
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,030
Is this pair of bronze candlesticks

591
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,160
to be auctioned at your auction house?

592
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,510
Yes, that's right.

593
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,680
This involves a case,

594
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,550
so we need your cooperation.

595
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,640
We'd like to know

596
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,350
the information about the consignor.

597
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,830
That might not be appropriate.

598
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,880
You see,

599
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,720
our auction house operates legally.

600
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,160
These auction items

601
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,660
are all publicly displayed
and previewed before the auction.

602
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,590
And we've also

603
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,110
reported to the relevant
cultural relics departments.

604
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,910
If there were really any issues,

605
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,160
the application wouldn't
have been approved.

606
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,760
Moreover,

607
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,350
this gilt bronze candlestick is

608
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,200
a cultural relic returned from overseas.

609
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,590
Its provenance is well-documented.

610
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,450
The consignor

611
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,370
has provided all the
necessary customs paperwork.

612
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,160
Mr. Jiang,

613
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,830
you've reported it
to the cultural relics department?

614
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,240
Yes.

615
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,790
I'm from the Cultural Relics Bureau,

616
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,920
and they're police.

617
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,440
You have to understand.

618
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,270
We wouldn't be here

619
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,280
without solid evidence.

620
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,510
Even if he has legitimate
customs paperwork,

621
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,240
does that prove the relics' legitimacy?

622
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,270
Right?

623
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,970
If you don't cooperate,

624
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,350
and it leads to national treasures loss,

625
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,910
you'll be held responsible.

626
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,480
The consignor's name is Xiao Guoqiang.

627
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,750
This is all the information he provided.

628
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,510
Can we borrow these documents?

629
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:57,680
Sure.

630
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,930
Thanks for your cooperation.

631
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,110
Don't be nervous.

632
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,520
Mr. Jiang,

633
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,140
and don't spread the word.

634
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,400
Just proceed with the auction as usual.

635
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,550
Where can we view
the auction site surveillance?

636
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,550
You can't let me come here for nothing.

637
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,550
Mr. Meng, what are you talking about?

638
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,050
The auction is all about determination.

639
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,270
If you're determined to win,

640
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,130
who could possibly outbid you?

641
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,860
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

642
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,550
This Xiao Guoqiang

643
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,880
has cooperated with our
auction house many times.

644
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,940
Usually, he doesn't come to the site.

645
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,530
He only comes after

646
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,120
the auction to finalize the transaction.

647
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:04,830

Mr. Mu.

686
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,000
Long time no see.

687
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,590
You're putting on airs now.

688
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,800
I had to come personally to invite you.

689
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,450
Mr. Zhao, you've misunderstood.

690
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,550

that caught my attention.

but the side bells make another note.

694
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,710
A bell with two tones—

695
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,070
that's the beauty of the chimes.

696
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,340
The tuning's acceptable.

698
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,030

and eventually
bought by a domestic collector

711

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,110
3.5 million yuan.

749
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,480
Last call.

750
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,550
Sold!

751
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
Congratulations to bidder No. 166.

752
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,380
Congratulations.

753
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,920
Okay.

754
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,760
Mr. Zhao, could you
recognize what I'm playing?

755
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,000
If I could recognize it,

756
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,800
I'd be teaching at
the Qinchuan Music Academy.

757
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,010
Are you teasing me?

758
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,360
This piece is a famous
chime bell composition.

759
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,490
It's called "Qu Yuan Asks for a Ferry."

760
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,280
The state of Chu was in danger.

761
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,440
Qu Yuan was filled with
grief and indignation.

762
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,970
He went to the riverbank to ask
the fisherman where the ferry is.

763
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,070
The fisherman told him,

764
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,800
"When the waters of the river are clear,
I can wash my hat tassel;

765
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,000
When the waters of the river are muddy,
I can wash my feet."

766
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,230
What does it mean?

767
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,320
When the water is clear,
use it to wash your hat;

768
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,550
When it's muddy, use it to wash your feet.

769
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,050
Don't take things too seriously.

770
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
But Qu Yuan's purpose in life

771
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,590
was to uphold dignity,

772
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,980
personal integrity, and the nation.

773
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,430
When the nation was lost,

774
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,030
what was the point of living?

775
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,230
So, he threw himself into the river—

776
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,280
for integrity, for dignity,

777
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,540
and for the nation.

778
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,240
Are you comparing yourself

779
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,070
to Qu Yuan now?

780
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,800
No,

781
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,280
I'm not as pessimistic as he was.

782
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,150
Death is the weakest way out.

783
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,880
A real man endures shame and humiliation.

784
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,300
If you're knocked down
by a punch, it's fine—

785
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,590
just dust yourself off

786
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,450
and fight back.

787
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,510
Well said.

788
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,630
Fight back.

789
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:56,510
Hello.

790
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,000
hello.

791
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,030
We're from
the Qinchuan City Public Security Bureau.

792
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,030
We'd like to inquire about someone.

793
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Could you check if

794
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,020
this person has stayed at your hotel?

795
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

796
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,670
all items in this auction

797
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,400
have now been successfully bid on.

798
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,000
Thank you all for attending.

799
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,440
I'd also like to remind you

800
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,150
that all successful bidders

801
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,150
can wait in our reception room.

802
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:24,950
Captain Qi,

803
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,430
he isn't at the hotel.

804
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,220
Keep watching.

805
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,250
Thank you all again.

806
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,140
Please exit in an orderly manner.

807
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,480
Mr. Jiang,

808
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,440
give Xiao Guoqiang a call.

809
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,280
Tell him the auction is over,

810
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,910
and see if he's on his way.

811
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,150
Okay.

812
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:56,880
Hello?

813
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,710
Mr. Jiang,

814
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,230
what's up?

815
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,210
Xiao, have you left yet?

816
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,620
It's all finished here.

817
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,160
I've left. How did it go?

818
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,440
Very well. 3.5 million yuan.

819
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,220
Come over and finalize the transaction.

820
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,320
Sure.

821
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,290
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

822
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:17,900
Okay.

823
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,440
Mr. Jiang.

824
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,340
Ms. Wen.

825
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,590
Mr. Meng.

826
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,510
Mr. Jiang is a star
in Qinchuan's auction scene.

827
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,240
He usually doesn't
personally meet clients.

828
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,530
So what's special about today?

829
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,230
Ms. Wen, you're really flattering me.

830
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,550
The gilt bronze lotus candlestick

831
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,550
is the star lot of our auction this time.

832
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,320
I'm just curious

833
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,710
who's the collector to bid on it?

834
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,560
I'd like to see it in person.

835
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,760
Ms. Wen, I heard Mr. Meng
is your friend, is that right?

836
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,360
-Yes.
-Then you must be a real expert.

837
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,070
I'm flattered.
