[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,890
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,509
This business trip is quite nice.

4
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,259
Usually, four of us share a small room.

5
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,620
When have we ever

6
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,460
stayed in a suite with a conference room?

7
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,660
When we used to work with partner units,

8
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,340
we never had such treatment.

9
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,020
It's absolutely wonderful.

10
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,900
Chief Wu has been running around,

11
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,740
even bringing us fruits to eat.

12
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,780
He's so generous.

13
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,170
We've benefited
from Captain Qi's influence.

14
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,180
He's generous?

15
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,810
Do you know what his nickname was
back in the police academy?

16
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,140
What?

17
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,410
Stingy Wu.

18
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,960
The penny-pincher.

19
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,340
I've known him for 20 years.

20
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,540
I've never seen him like this.

21
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,970
He's only treated me to a meal once,

22
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,410
and I paid a heavy price for it.

23
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,210
How stingy was he?

24
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,320
We'll chat about it another time.

25
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,530
How many are around the fertilizer shop?

26
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:33,960
Six.

27
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,890
Send six more.

28
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,410
Twelve people, divided into three groups.

29
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,540
I'll lead one group.

30
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,590
Go get ready.

31
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,530
We'll meet downstairs shortly.

32
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:41,780
Okay.

33
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,110
Okay.

34
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,340
Liu Gang.

35
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,660
Come here.

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,520
Chief Wu, what's the task?

37
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,930
Buy some good wine and food
and take them to the guesthouse.

38
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,860
Take good care of my old classmate.

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,370
Understood.

40
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,400
I guarantee they'll sleep soundly
till morning.

41
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,160
Be careful.

42
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,670
My classmate is very sharp.

43
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,800
Don't let him catch on.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,730
Don't worry.
I'll make sure to complete the mission.

45
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,860
What kind of good wine and food can I buy
with just 100 yuan?

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,930
What do you know?

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,070
This is called
getting big results with little money.

48
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,530
Come on.

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,690
Alright.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,340
Captain Qi.

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,260
Captain Qi, are you there?

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,630
Du.

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,350
Hey, what's up?

54
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,230
Chief Wu.

55
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,000
There's no one in the room.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,390
What?

57
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,750
They must have gone out.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,380
Never mind that for now.

59
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,750
I'm staking out them now.

60
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,200
Okay.

61
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,870
Team One, Team Two, attention.

62
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,730
Target spotted, target spotted.

63
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,000
Hold your positions.
Let's verify the number of people.

64
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,110
Counted. There are four.

65
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,640
Go!

66
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,960
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

67
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,840
Sanma, run!

68
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,280
Run!

69
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,970
Don't move!

70
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,110
Stop right there! Don't move!

71
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,770
Don't move!

72
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Behave yourself!

73
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,210
What are you doing?

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Put that down!

75
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,190
I'm telling you, you can't escape.

76
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,950
Stop!

77
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,180
I've tracked you for months.
How can I let you get away?

78
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,270
Take him away.

79
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,670
Get up.

80
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,540
Don't move. Behave yourself.

81
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,760
What are you two doing here?

82
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,290
Chief Wu.

83
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,270
Qi Dacang.

84
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,630
He's mine.

85
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,840
Quickly, take him away.

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,390
How did you find your way here?

87
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,070
I was staying in a large suite,

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,950
eating your fruits, drinking your tea,

89
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,800
and sleeping soundly.

90
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,230
Yet you were on night duty for me.

91
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,310
I couldn't bear it.

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,230
What nonsense are you talking about?

93
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,920
Let me tell you.

94
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,250
You can't take him away.

95
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,940
The Hedong gang committed crimes
in Qingyuan County.

96
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,140
I've tracked them

97
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,610
for several months.

98
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,820
Yet you came here to take him away.

99
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,610
What are you thinking?

100
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,340
I gave you the lead
about the fertilizer factory.

101
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,450
Is that right?

102
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,530
Could you have found them
without this lead?

103
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,170
No, I couldn't.

104
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:54,700
Exactly.

105
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,580
You've led me down the garden path.

106
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,730
Your superior called my master.

107
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,820
It's settled.

108
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,170
I'll take him back.

109
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,340
Send a few of your men

110
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,410
to escort us back to Qinchuan.

111
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,090
What?

112
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,730
I even have to send people
to escort you back to Qinchuan?

113
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,290
If you don't believe me, make a call.

114
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,550
What are you thinking?

115
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,260
That's it. Thanks.

116
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,300
About the bicycle incident,

117
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm being generous and letting it go.

118
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,780
Why are you bringing up the bicycle again?

119
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,770
So annoying.

120
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,580
It's a pity about that large suite.

121
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,300
I just left without even touching the bed.

122
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,270
You can go back. Go back right now.

123
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,110
Things he can offer

124
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,210
are also what our team can offer.

125
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,780
Right, right, right.

126
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,360
You're absolutely right.

127
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,050
Du.

128
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,909
I've figured it out.

129
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,720
Following Captain Qi,

130
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,730
we're leading a life of non-stop work.

131
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,590
Let me tell you.

132
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,330
If you follow

133
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,230
Stingy Wu,

134
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,610
you'll know

135
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,140
what "Have your cake and eat it too"

136
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,700
really means.

137
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,160
Captain Qi.

138
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,260
What was the situation
between you and Chief Wu back then?

139
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
The bicycle you two mentioned just now,

140
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,830
what was that all about?

141
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,020
Back when we were at the police academy,

142
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,410
our relationship was like that
of Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu.

143
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,170
It was always either me or him
in first place.

144
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,909
He couldn't accept it.

145
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,140
The academy held a cross country race,

146
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,940
with a bicycle as the prize.

147
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:41,740
Back then,

148
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,100
this penny-pincher suddenly invited me
for barbecue and beer one night.

149
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,980
I didn't think much of it.

150
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,810
I drank too much.

151
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,140
When I woke up the next day,

152
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,140
the race was over.

153
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,810
That's a dirty trick.

154
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,340
How could he do such a thing?

155
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,930
So he won the bicycle in the end?

156
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,690
Of course.

157
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,290
So,

158
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,220
how could I not get my revenge?

159
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,750
Exactly.

160
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,380
A gentleman's revenge can wait ten years.

161
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,740
Today is so satisfying.

162
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,530
And, by the way,

163
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,110
I don't consider myself

164
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,050
to have lost out too much.

165
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,980
Actually, there was another situation
at that time.

166
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,410
We were both pursuing the same girl.

167
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,530
I was originally going to
step aside for him,

168
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,330
but after the bicycle incident,

169
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,780
I became determined

170
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,570
and ended up marrying her.

171
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,980
Good for you.

172
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,120
I've got to learn from you on this.

173
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,440
May I come in?

174
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,170
Come in.

175
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,480
You got the suspect back?

176
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,440
Of course.

177
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,320
No need.

178
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,760
They smell delicious.

179
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,560
You're quite capable.

180
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,350
You didn't go easy
on your old classmate at all.

181
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:02,840
Who

182
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,870
do you think taught me?

183
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,730
Stop talking nonsense.

184
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,320
When Sun Wukong left the mountain,

185
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,230
what did Patriarch Subhuti tell him?

186
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,360
Have you forgetten?

187
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,410
Don't worry.

188
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,990
If I get into trouble,

189

you'll be the first one I rat out.

190
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,560
Go

191
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,960
and change out of these dirty clothes.

192
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,290
Put on something clean.

193
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,870
What for?

194

Nothing at all.

227
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,030
It's just an empty tomb.

228
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,670
Is it this one?

229
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:49,980
No.

230
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,900
Definitely not.

231
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,640
Look again.

232
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,270
Look carefully at this.

233
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,170
Yes.

234
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,120
Yes.

235

It's this one.

236
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,330
Is this the spot you scouted?

237
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,580
We're just gravediggers.

238
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,880
They called us,

239
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,580
so we came.

I don't know his father's name.

00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,500
I only know he's from Qinchuan,

244
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,580
called Big Head.

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,710
Is Big Head

246
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,520

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Anyway, he called us over.

248

We're not really sure

249
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,190
if there's anyone behind him.

250
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:38,880
Well,

in Qinchuan?

No more.

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
Just this one.

257
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,350
Bad luck.

258
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,600
What did you say?

259
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Bad luck?

260
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,310
According to you,
if you had found something,

261
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,570
it would be considered good luck, right?

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,040
No, that's not what I meant.

263
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,400
I...

264
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,310
I know I was wrong.

265
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,240
It's because of our bad luck

266
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,370
that it didn't turn into a big mistake.

267
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,040
Do you really know you're wrong?

268
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,180
Then just tell me everything.

269
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,090
Don't play tricks.

270
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,190
If you don't confess,
your accomplices will.

271
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,950
Feng Sibao has a very good attitude.

272
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,670
He's said everything he should.

273
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,730
You have no way out.

274
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,890
I'll tell you everything.

275
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,520
We robbed another tomb a while ago.

276
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,240
It was a lot of effort,
but it didn't blow open.

277
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,120
So we left.

279
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,190
T-The tomb wasn't successfully robbed.

280
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,120
So it can't be tomb robbery, can it?

281
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Cut the crap. Tell me the location.

282
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,490
Yin Village.

283
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,350
You must have

284
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,700
scouted the spot beforehand,

285
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,360
had the hair salon owner in town

286
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,040
get the cultural relic conservator drunk,

287
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,010
and drugged their dog, right?

288
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,800
How do you know?

289
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,480
How's your money gathering going?

290
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,310
Bro,

291
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,050
it's my fault that I'm not capable.

292
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,640
I spoke too soon.

293
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,540
Barely scraped together a million or so.

294
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,240
I really want

295
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,950
this batch of goods.

296
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,120
But it's hard to keep guests
without wine in the pot.

297
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,380
The spirit is willing,
but the fortune is weak.

298
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,110
I guess I can't take your goods.

299
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,040
Have you found a buyer yet?

300
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,760
I should have known you're a scumbag.

301
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,670
Don't you dare act like

302
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,800
we're buddies here.

303
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,350
Was I wrong to say
you're all sweet talk and rotten inside?

304
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,010
You blew hot air all this time.

305
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,730
In the end,
you've made a monkey out of me.

306
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,950
Come on, bro.

307
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,900
You haven't found a buyer yet?

308
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,850
It's truly my fault.

309
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,530
If you're angry, take it out on me.
I won't say a word.

310
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,710
But things are really troublesome now.

311
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,570
Have you heard?

312
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,310
Sheng brought people

313
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,710
to dig up the tomb
where you got your goods.

314
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,120
But one of them
was caught by cultural relic conservators.

315
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,050
What did you say?

316
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,000
You didn't know?

317
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,230
Then you'd better be extra careful.

318
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,420
The Relics Inspection Team
is eyeing your goods.

319
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,620
Now the police are following the trail.

320
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,530
If they trace it back to you...

321
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,680
Jianhui.

322
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,670
At this critical moment,

323
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,770
will Xing Zhaohu

324
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,080
agree to sell them for a million or so?

325
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,140
Let's just get ready to buy the goods.

326
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,250
He might agree,

327
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,260
but I don't.

328
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,510
He hasn't been driven to a dead end yet.

329
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,200
When he realizes

330
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,990
that if he doesn't sell,

331
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,390
neither he nor the goods

332
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,030
can leave Qinchuan,

333
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,320
he'll come back begging me.

334
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,550
At that time,

335
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,750
we can name any price we want.

336
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
What if he gets anxious
and sells to the Liu guy?

337
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,600
Liu Shusheng

338
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,960
is now barely able to save himself.

339
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,810
Even if he wants to sell,

340
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,970
he'd have to be able to
contact Liu Shusheng first.

341
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,420

the number you have dialed is unavailable.

346

Hello,

347
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,450
the number you have dialed...

348
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,570
You stubborn mule.

349
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,060
Why?

350
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,740
Qinchuan is so big,

351
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,290
yet it can't accommodate a mule like you,
huh?

352
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,030
He's leaving.

353
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,180
Why are you saying these things
to upset him?

354
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,510
If you stay away for years again

355
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,390
like last time,

356
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,550
I won't consider you my buddy anymore.

357
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,150
Alright.

358
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:54,940
Stop talking.

359
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,200
Or others will think
you have a crush on me.

360
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,800
Screw you.

361
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,060
A crush on you?

362
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,280
By the time you come back,
your hair may be down to your waist.

363
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,160
Go back, go back.

364
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,660
Go back.

365
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,599
Okay, okay, fine.

366
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,500
Go back, go back.

367
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,619
Don't worry, Kun.

368
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,910
I'm still here.

369
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,079
Take care.

370
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,619
I'm leaving.

371
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,500
Have a safe journey.

372
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,359
Stubborn mule.

373
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,110
Be careful on the road.

374
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,530
Has the identity of the one
called Big Head been confirmed?

375
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,950
We've questioned some of the detainees.

376
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,760
They all said they had never
heard of such a person.

377
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,610
We've also questioned
those with criminal records.

378
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,640
None of them provided

379
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,240
a single valuable lead to me.

380
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,770
As far as we can see now,

381
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,560
this Big Head

382
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,650
hasn't entered our radar yet.

383
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,400
In the past couple of days,

384
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,760
we've conducted cross-examinations
of the four people from Hedong.

385
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,230
We've basically confirmed that

386
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,890
they're the ones
who robbed the empty tomb.

387
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,230
The tomb robbery case in Yin Village
has also been solved.

388
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,230
It's their doing.

389
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,820
Still no news on the Song Dynasty
ceramics batch in the South Market.

390
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,580
We can't rule out the possibility
that the suspects

391
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,910
got wind of it
and are afraid to make a move.

392
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,090
I've checked the duty roster

393
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,720
of the cultural relic conservators
in Lvjia Village.

394
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,780
They're basically on duty year-round
without breaks.

395
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,030
I'm just wondering

396
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,570
how those tomb raiders

397
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,300
managed to dig up graves
right under their noses.

398
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,510
Are you suggesting

399
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,370
that the tomb raiders have a connection
with the cultural relic conservators?

400
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,770
I wouldn't dare say that.

401
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,020
The conservators in Lvjia Village

402
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,050
have a really positive attitude

403
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,010
and are quite responsible.

404
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,860
They even recorded the license plates
of all unfamiliar vehicles passing by.

405
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,520
Yes.

406
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,360
I have the same assessment of Lv Fugui.

407
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,840
His ancestors are buried

408
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,100
in the Lv family tombs.

409
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,290
Now that they've been robbed,

410
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,180
he even fell ill because of it.

411
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,230
How could someone like him possibly
be involved in the tomb robbery?

412
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,230
But is there a possibility

413
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,430
that the tomb raiders

414
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,540
are very familiar with

415
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,790
the patrol times of the conservators?

416
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,820
They might have avoided the conservators.

417
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
I've asked about
the patrol times of the conservators.

418
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,790
They patrol at the peak times
for tomb robbery,

419
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,930
but there are gaps in between.

420
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,170
They must have exploited those gaps.

421
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,540
Du.

422
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:02,860
Yes.

423
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,790
You should keep a close eye on

424
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,790
the lead on Big Head.
We can't let our guard down.

425
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,100
Yes.

426
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,060
We'll continue to keep an eye
on the black market

427
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,100
to monitor the movement
of that batch of ceramics.

428
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,990
I'll make a trip to Lvjia Village
when I have time.

429
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,030
I've brought you some money.

430
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,530
Just let me know if you need anything.

431
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,320
Come on, have some alcohol.

432
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,430
Fugui.

433
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,930
Captain Qi.

434
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,950
Take me away.

435
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,950
Let me go to prison.

436
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,750
What do you mean? You didn't do anything.

437
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,010
Why would I arrest you?

438
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,950
When my father was alive,

439
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,540
he told me countless times

440
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,550
to take good care

441
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,540
of our ancestors' tombs.

442
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,990
I failed to do so.

443
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,870
Now I feel too ashamed

444
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,960
to face my ancestors

445
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,230
or return to the village.

446
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,290
Take me away so I can atone for my sins.

447
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,060
You really scared me.

448
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,430
I thought you had participated
in the tomb robbery.

449
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,380
Nonsense.

450
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,510
Haven't you seen that I patrol every day?

451
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,190
You're crying to your ancestors

452
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,590
and turning yourself in to me.

453
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,120
What am I supposed to think?

454
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,230
Hey.

455
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,390
Don't waste time on this nonsense.

456
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,530
If you want to live up to
your ancestors' expectations,

457
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,130
our priority now
is to catch the tomb raiders.

458
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,650
That's why I'm here.

459
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,300
Let me ask you something.

460
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,470
Before the incident took place,

461
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,600
during that period,

462
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,320
did you see any strangers?

463
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,650
There were quite a few strangers.

464
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,470
This is

465
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,510
the season for harvesting walnuts.

466
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,300
Many people came to collect wild products.

467
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,190
Did you hear

468
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,640
any sounds of setting off a firecracker?

469
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,670
No.

470
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,670
Do you set off firecrackers
during funerals?

471
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,300
Well,

472
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,100
people here set off firecrackers
for both weddings and funerals.

473
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,630
Exactly.

474
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,010
So, think about it,

475
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,640
is it possible that

476
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,630
while your family
was setting off firecrackers,

477
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,040
the tomb raiders were hiding here,
setting off explosives?

478
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,520
That's impossible, right?

479
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,080
Why not?

480
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,270
Although I haven't patrolled
these past days,

481
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,600
Hongfu and Dongsheng have been on patrol.

482
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,120
If they had seen anything unusual,
they would have told me.

483
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,990
Also,

484
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,470
my cousin

485
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,510
came to guard the tomb those days too.

486
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,230
If there were any tomb raiders,
he would definitely know.

487
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,340
What's your cousin's name?
Which village is he from?

488
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,340
Wang Taiping.

489
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,800
He's from Wangjiawa Village.

490
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,480
Wang Taiping, nicknamed Big Mole,
of the black pottery figurine case?

491
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,540
He's your cousin?

492
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,670
Captain Qi, let me tell you,

493
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,710
he made mistakes before,

494
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,670
but at the mourning hall of my father,

495
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,770
he swore to be a good man.

496
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,230
I don't believe he could do such a thing.

497
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,820
I didn't say he did it.

498
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,720
I think in this matter,

499
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,300
we should verify the facts clearly

500
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
to avoid him being wrongly accused.

501
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,410
Could you

502
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,470
go to Wangjiawa Village

503
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,180
and ask him

504
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,860
if he saw any strangers during those days?

505
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
Let's rule it out.

506
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,710
Here.

507
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,270
What's wrong with you?

508
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,340
Always touching and looking at
that precious thing of yours.

509
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Can you magically make money appear
just by touching it?

510
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,670
Maybe I've been too lenient recently,
and you're getting uncomfortable.

511
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,950
All you talk about is money, money, money.

512
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,190
I can't expect anything good from you.

513
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,270
Is Taiping at home?

514
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,190
Fugui, why are you here?

515
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,030
Cousin.

516
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,900
Is your pneumonia getting better?

517
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,030
It's almost better.

518
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,310
Sister-in-law.

519
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,830
Take this money.

520
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,430
Buy a chicken for Taiping

521
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,920
to help him recover.

522
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,940
This is so embarrassing.

523
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,520
I'll make you some tea.

524
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,310
Have a seat.

525
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,510
So,

526
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,440
is it really Big Mole who did it?

527
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,140
He's currently the prime suspect.

528
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,670
Good for him.

529
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,340
Wasn't this guy just released?

530
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,670
Why was he itching to cause trouble again?

531
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,820
I asked Lv Fugui to leak some information
to Big Mole.

532
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
If there's really a gang behind him,

533
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,130
they should make contact.

534
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,540
Are you involved in this?

535
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,760
No,

536
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,760
I'm definitely not involved.

537
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,630
That's good.

538
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,660
How could I go back to my old ways?

539
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,580
Besides,

540
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,690
those are my ancestors.

541
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,780
I couldn't possibly stoop so low

542
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,840
as to dig up my own ancestors' graves.

543
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,230
Did you see any suspicious people

544
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,130
when you were guarding the tomb?

545
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,090
No, nothing.

546
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,490
I didn't even see a rabbit.

547
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:02,890
Cousin,

548
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,680
did the police question you?

549
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,780
Did they mention me?

550
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,930
Yes. You have a criminal record.

551
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,020
They know you.

552
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,710
What did you tell them?

553
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
I told the truth and said what I knew.

554
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,370
What's wrong?

555
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,180
Nothing, nothing.

556
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,850
It's good that you told the truth.

557
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,620
I'm sorry,

558
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,460
the number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

559
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,790
Please try again later.

560
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,420
0.5 yuan.

561
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,960
What 0.5 yuan?

562
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,640
It didn't even connect,
and you still want money?

563
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,770
You old miser.

564
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,110
Go check who he called.

565
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,060
I'll follow him.

566
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,440
How's it going?

567
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,570
Xing Zhaohu and Shan
haven't been to the junkyard again.

568
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
Do you think these two have

569
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,790
sold the goods and run off with the money?

570
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,520
Impossible.

571
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,810
No one would dare to take

572
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,320
this batch of goods now.

573
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,580
What about King Hua?

574
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,180
He? He doesn't have the guts.

575
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,840
He wants to have his cake and eat it too.

576
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,710
Unless...

577
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,150
Unless what?

578
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,240
Unless Xing Zhaohu has connected
with Zhao Youlin.

579
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,260
But that's unlikely too.

580
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,940
Zhao Youlin is as cunning as Cao Cao.

581
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,540
He's naturally suspicious.

582
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,430
He won't rashly get involved
with someone he doesn't know well.

583
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,790
What should we do?

584
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,730
Attention,

585
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,740
Groups two and three proceed as planned.

586
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,120
Group one, stand by.

587
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,970
What are you doing here?

588
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,630
Where's Hu?

589
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,300
Why are you looking for Hu?

590
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,390
Something big has happened.

591
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,780
The police
have discovered the looting pit.

592
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,480
Has the batch of goods been sold?

593
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,180
Get lost. Stop asking questions.

594
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,110
I'm troubled enough as it is.

595
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,170
But you still need to give me my money.

596
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,690
Get lost. I'm busy right now.

597
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,620
You can't leave.

598
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,190
My money...

599
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,060
You promised to pay me.

600
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,740
You're asking me for money?

601
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,830
I don't even know who to ask for money.

602
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,830
If you don't give me my money,

603
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,700
I'll report you to the police,
believe it or not.

604
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,220
If you don't let me have peace,

605
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,280
don't expect to have any yourselves.

606
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,870
Acting all tough now, aren't you?

607
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,070
Putting on airs, huh?

608
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,350
Challenging me, are you? Challenging me?

609
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,460
How dare you hit me!

610
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,670
Shan, you...

611
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,780
Who? Who are you?

612
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,430
Wang Taiping!

613
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,740
Behave yourself!

614
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,670
Look carefully!

615
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,310
Easy, easy.

616
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,260
Big Mole.

617
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,090
Do you still recognize me?

618
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,430
Officer.

619
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,750
Why is it you again?

620
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,910
Officer.

621
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,570
I really know I was wrong, truly.

622
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,260
I was wrong, I was wrong, really.

623
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,550
Now you know you were wrong.

624
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,670
Speak up, come on.

625
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,530
It's all because of this big mole.

626
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,390
It's because of this big mole

627
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,980
that you recognized me back then.

628
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,640
I served a few years in prison.

629
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,750
After getting out,
I wanted to live a good life.

630
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,130
I wanted to start over.

631
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,950
Who knew

632
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,220
I'd run into Xing Zhaohu again?

633
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,080
Who is Xing Zhaohu?

634
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,250
He's the one

635
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,670
who dug up the pit on Bailu Plain,

636
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,030
which was later stolen and robbed

637
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,920
by Yan Xiaowu.

638
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,150
You mean the black pottery figurine case
from back then?

639
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,280
Yes, yes, that's it.

640
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,780
Did Yan Xiaowu

641
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,330
know Xing Zhaohu at that time?

642
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,800
He probably didn't.

643
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,460
I never heard Yan Xiaowu talk about him.

644
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,850
I guess

645
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,150
Yan Xiaowu didn't know either

646
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,350
that he was robbing Xing Zhaohu's pit.

647
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,580
How did Xing Zhaohu find you?

648
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,179
I was looking for work a few days ago.

649
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,790
Unfortunately, I ran into Xing Zhaohu.

650
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,870
It's because of this big mole

651
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,060
that he recognized me.

652
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,580
He almost beat me to death.

653
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,940
To save my life,

654
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,389
I had no choice but to say

655
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:30,080
there's a grand tomb in Lvjia Village.

656
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,000
Take a look.

657
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,320
Is it this tomb?

658
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,659
Yes, that's it.

659
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,389
Are you sure?

660
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,190
Who were involved in the tomb robbery?

661
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:45,909
Me,

662
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,840
a gravedigger called Wu Long,

663
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,540
and also

664
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,540
Shan, who was just arrested with me.

665
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,469
And Xing Zhaohu.

666
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,659
I was just keeping watch.

667
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,790
I-I didn't dig.

668
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,490
What did you rob from the tomb?

669
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,100
I was too far away to see clearly.

670
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,480
They wouldn't let me look either.

671
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Have you been in contact these days?

672
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,930
I just called Xing Zhaohu

673
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,150
last night.

674
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,700
But his phone was turned off.

675
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,150
Then why did you go to the junkyard?

676
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,350
That junkyard is run by Xing Zhaohu.

677
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,230
I was afraid you'd find me.

678
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,720
I wanted to ask him for some money
to hide for a while.

679
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,510
But Xing Zhaohu didn't show up.

680
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,210
Instead,

681
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,300
Shan came.

682
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,750
Do you know Big Head?

683
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:34,810
I don't.

684
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,680
Where is Wu Long now?

685
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,750
Wu Long

686
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,360
is sometimes at the junkyard,

687
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,280
and sometimes,

688
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,720
he works as a laborer
at a construction site in Tianjia Bay.

689
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,050
Wu Long!

690
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:56,950
Stop!

691
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,450
Stop!

692
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,180
Stop!

693
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,680
Stop!

694
00:35:59,310 --> 00:35:59,970
Run!

695
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,980
Run if you can!

696
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,610
Go, go, go!

697
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,670
Shan,

698
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,230
what's your real name?

699
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,390
It's just Shan.

700
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,270
You're still not being honest
even after you're here.

701
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,320
Tell me your full name clearly.

702
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,920
Everything I said is true.

703
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,180
It's the name my parents gave me.

704
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,810
Shan.

705
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,080
Your surname is Guo.

706
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,190
Your full name is Guo Fengshan.

707
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,430
Wu Long is your cousin.

708
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,120
Do you know why we arrested you?

709
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,540
Exactly.
I was about to ask you the same thing.

710
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,620
For no reason at all,

711
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,020
why did you bring me here?

712
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,180
If you hadn't been feeling guilty,

713
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,500
why did you run when you saw us?

714
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:34,830
I...

715
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,770
I...

716
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,510
I-I-I'll say it for you.

717
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,200
You robbed the Lv Family Tomb

718
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,000
in the peach orchard in Lvjia Village,
didn't you?

719
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,130
This.

720
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,880
And this.

721
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Did you do these?

722
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,850
No.

723
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,350
You don't want to cooperate.

724
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,740
Well then,

725
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,780
I have another place.

726
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,250
Let's talk somewhere else, shall we?

727
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,630
T-That won't be necessary.

728
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,350
I...

729
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,230
Well, I'll tell you then.

730
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,310
These two...

731
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,460
This one isn't.

732
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,120
This one is.

733
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,030
They weren't both robbed by us.

734
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,890
Who are all these "us"
you're talking about?

735
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,680
Who are they?

736
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:23,710
Me.

737
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,460
Wang Taiping.

738
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,520
Wu Long.

739
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,940
You're quite loyal, aren't you?

740
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,430
Let me give you a reminder.

741
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,230
Do you know Xing Zhaohu?

742
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,740
Where is Xing Zhaohu?

743
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,160
This... This...

744
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,440
I-I really don't know.

745
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,020
Officer, everything I've said is true.

746
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,870
What did you loot from the tomb?

747
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,930
T-There are bronze artifacts.

748
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,130
And some bronze mirrors,

749
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,330
but I have no idea what era they're from.

750
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,430
Also,

751
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,200
50 or 60 pieces of

752
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,240
porcelain.

753
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,070
Take a look.

754
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,070
Are these from the tomb?

755
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,260
Yes.

756
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,800
Did you see it clearly?

757
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,240
I saw it clearly.

758
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,230
What did you do at the junkyard?

759
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,430
Xing Zhaohu

760
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,970
called me

761
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,040
and told me to go to the junkyard

762
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,710
to retrieve the artifacts.

763
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,880
You guys, go.

764
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,680
See if there are any other artifacts
over there.

765
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,990
Alright, I understand.

766
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,320
There are no porcelain pieces
in the junkyard at all.

767
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,480
What happened?

768
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,790
I don't know about that.

769
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,620
As you saw before,

770
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,980
I didn't even enter the junkyard

771
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,300
before you caught me.

772
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,960
What exactly did Xing Zhaohu say?

773
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,460
He said we had been spotted by the police.

774
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,700
No one dares to buy the goods.

775
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,890
He hid a batch of goods in the junkyard

776
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,910
and asked me to retrieve them.

777
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,570
That's all.

778
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,870
Whether it's bronze or porcelain,

779
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,870
he didn't tell me.

780
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,860
When was the last time you met?

781
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,710
It was just a few days ago.

782
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,790
Be specific.

783
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,390
It should have been a Sunday.

784
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,450
Where did you meet?

785
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,560
Under the overpass
in the southern suburbs.

786
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,460
Someone wanted to see the porcelain.

787
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,390
That person didn't show up.

788
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,850
Xing Zhaohu was very angry

789
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,260
and left by himself.

790
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,390
We haven't seen each other since then.

791
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,650
Didn't Xing Zhaohu say

792
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,430
how to meet afterwards?

793
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,550
No, he didn't.

794
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,110
He told me to wait for a call
at the hotel.

795
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,790
How did you get to know Wang Taiping?

796
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,800
He was looking for work
at the construction site

797
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,660
and met Wu Long.

798
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,430
Wu Long brought him to the junkyard.

799
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,670
You didn't know him before?

800
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,270
I didn't know him.

801
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,460
Shan.

802
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,980
None of the questions I asked you
were random.

803
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,000
If you hold back anything from me,

804
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,320
you're leaving yourself no room.

805
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,390
I really don't know him.

806
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,530
I'll give you one last chance.

807
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,250
Black pottery figurines.

808
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,530
Do I need to say more?

809
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,650
Since you already know everything,

810
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,710
what else can I say?

811
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:06,980
You...

812
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,130
Are you trying to play dumb with me,
aren't you?

813
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,980
Well...

814
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:19,090
That year, I scouted a spot
on Bailu Plain.

815
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,300
The pit was dug out.

816
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,650
Yan Xiaowu and Wang Taiping

817
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,190
pretended to be
cultural relic conservators to scare me.

818
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,190
After we ran away,

819
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,900
they took my pit.

820
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,110
Who were all of you?

821
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,100
Me.

822
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,620
Xing Zhaohu.

823
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,080
And two other guys.

824
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,060
One of them

825
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,620
was in charge of explosives.

826
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,310
Another dup up the pit with me.

827
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,120
Their names.

828
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,750
I don't know.

829
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,720
Y-You should ask Xing Zhaohu about that.

830
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,320
Because he's the one who found them.

831
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,350
I've never spoken to them before.

832
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,610
Who knows their names?

833
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,160
You don't know Big Head?

834
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,070
I don't know him.

835
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:03,660
I...

836
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,120
I really don't know him.

837
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,140
Let's start with the black pottery
figurine case from years ago.

838
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,680
Back then, Xing Zhaohu,

839
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,610
with Shan and three others,

840
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,250
dug up a pit in Yin Village.

841
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,540
Wang Taiping and Yan Xiaowu
scared them away.

842
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,830
They seized the pit.

843
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,910
This can be evidenced

844
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,070
in Yan Xiaowu's testimony

845
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,230
from back then.

846
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,310
A while ago,

847
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,100
Wang Taiping was released from prison.

848
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,500
He was recognized by Xing Zhaohu.

849
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,620
After Xing Zhaohu used threats and bribes,

850
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,820
Wang Taiping led them

851
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,990
to the Lv Family Tomb.

852
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,540
They robbed the Sixth Rank Civil
Official Tomb in the Lv Family Tomb.

853
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,470
Shortly after the tomb was robbed,

854
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,370
Big Head

855
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,110
brought

856
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,220
those four men from Hedong

857
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,390
there.

858
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,080
Unexpectedly, they robbed an empty tomb.

859
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,710
So, how did Big Head

860
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,540
find his way to the Lv Family Tomb?
