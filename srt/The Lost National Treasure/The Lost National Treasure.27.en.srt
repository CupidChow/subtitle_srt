[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,710
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,200
Where did you get the goods?

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
There's been such a big case
in Bailu Plain.

5
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,880
It's all over the news.

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,180
Haven't you heard about it, Mr. Zhao?

7
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,229
You got the goods
from the tomb in Yin Village?

8
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,030
That's right.

9
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,150
Mr. Mu, I just feel like
you're being very stubborn.

10
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,510
You're like a wild horse now,

11
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,680
refusing to be reined in by me.

12
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,640
I told you.

13
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,920
Don’t dig up those goods

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,560
from the tomb in Yin Village.

15
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,039
Why did you have to go and mess with them?

16
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,949
I didn't dig them up.

17
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,750
If you didn't dig them up,
how did the goods get out?

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,590
Although I didn't dig them up myself,

19
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,910
I couldn't just let outsiders

20
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,440
take advantage of our land.

21
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,740
We finally took over Qinchuan,

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,590
and then King Hua came.

23
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,850
How could I let him?

24
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,900
So I took back all the goods
he had gotten.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,329
Mr. Zhao,

26
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,630
if it were you,

27
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,910
you definitely wouldn't
have stood for it either,

28
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,560
right?

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,310
Mr. Mu.

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,710
A tree standing out in the forest

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,640
will be blown by the wind.

32
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,370
You've heard this saying, right?

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,030
I have.

34
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,030
But I know even better.

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,470
The kind-hearted are easily bullied.

36
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,130
The gentle horse gets ridden.

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,079
If someone pees on my head,

38
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,880
I'll have to serve them with a beating.

39
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,960
But anyway,

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
these goods from Yin Village
are really top-notch.

41
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,870
Mr. Zhao, take a look.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,630
Gilt bronze, right?

43
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,870
You are indeed an expert.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,700
You made such a big deal out of this

45
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,190
just

46
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,000
for two items?

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,310
In the antique business,

48
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,840
it’s not about quantity,
it’s about quality.

49
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,220
These two items are
worth ten thousand pieces.

50
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,470
Now that you've seen the goods.

51
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,870
Mr. Zhao, you should be glad

52
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,530
they didn't fall into
outsiders' hands, right?

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,960
Mu,

54
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,600
about this matter,

55
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,840
I should thank you.

56
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,470
I told you not to
touch the goods from Yin Village

57
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,120
mainly because I didn't
want you to take risks.

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
But I didn't expect

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,870
t you to have such great skills.

60
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,440
I underestimated you.

61
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,410
However, I do want to remind you

62
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,060
not to be arrogant.

63
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,360
No good comes from being arrogant.

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,330
An arrogant dog ends up in shit.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
No matter what you're doing,

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,930
don’t get too arrogant.

67
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,380
When you’re arrogant,

68
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,290
you'll make too many enemies.

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,940
As the old saying goes,

70
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,480
"Don't dream of the birds
in the green mountains.

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,880
Take good care of the chickens
in the cage."

72
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,600
I can't agree with that.

73
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,980
If a dog bites me,
how can I not fight back?

74
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,090
The dog is in the wrong,

75
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,170
what fault is there in the person?

76
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,310
But hitting a dog requires strategy.

77
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,120
First the stick, then the bran.

78
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,770
Then the dog will obey.

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,700
How’s that?

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,070
Do you like these two?

81
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,830
Yes,

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,340
I like them.

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,250
Alright.

84
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,690
Then we have a deal.

85
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,280
Good.

86
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,910
That's it.

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,250
Okay.

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,310
I'll take my leave.

89
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,910
Very well.

90
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,070
Yuhe,

91
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,950
please see Mr. Mu out.

92
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,920
No need, I know the way.

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
After the tomb from Yin Village
was robbed,

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,360
we conducted

95
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,730
a thorough investigation

96
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,390
and discovered that

97
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,680
the Cultural Relics Management Office
in Baliu District

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,480
failed to properly organize

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,680
the protection work
for the tomb in Yin Village.

100
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,920
There was a lack of
management and protection systems.

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,050
Daily inspections were perfunctory,

102
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,360
and neighborhood defense was weak.

103
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,950
After the incident occurred,

104
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,810
although the police filed a case,

105
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,430
the stolen cultural relics remain lost,

106
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,240
causing a negative impact
and serious losses.

107
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,270
We’re now considering disciplinary actions
for the relevant personnel.

108
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,480
For the director of
the Cultural Relics Management Office

109
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,240
in Baliu District, Comrade Tang Shaohua,

110
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,300
we propose a warning within the Party

111
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,040
and a demerit on
his administrative record.

112
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,270
For the cultural relic conservator
of the Cultural Relics Management Office

113
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,930
in Baliu District who was not
on patrol at the time of the incident,

114
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,630
Comrade Kong Xiangfa,
we propose a major demerit.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,870
Can we

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
not discipline Kong?

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,600
If you must

118
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,920
discipline someone,

119
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,640
discipline me instead.

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
Regarding Comrade Kong's situation,

121
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,020
we have conducted a thorough investigation

122
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,890
and confirmed that

123
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,920
he was negligent that night.

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,440
I'd like to ask everyone,

125
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,040
why was Kong

126
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,570
negligent that night?

127
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,430
Kong said that night

128
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,500
he wasn't feeling well

129
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
so he rested for a while
at the Cultural Relics Management Office.

130
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,510
After patrolling Du Mausoleum
and Zi Mausoleum,

131
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,110
how could he not feel unwell?

132
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,240
This

133
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,390
is not an excuse for negligence.

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
Roll up your pant legs

135
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
and look at your own legs.

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,440
Then look at Kong's legs.

137
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
See how swollen his knee joints are?

138
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,950
He could barely move
on the night of the incident.

139
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,430
What’s the reason for this?

140
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,030
I don't need to tell you, do I?

141
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,510
There are only six people in total.

142
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,140
Two of them don't even
have official positions.

143
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,310
We have neither money nor manpower.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,400
Patrolling and guarding

145
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,480
ancient sites and tombs

146
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,460
are all in the fields

147
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,630
and in the wilderness.

148
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,130
For accessible paths,

149
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,680
we rely on bicycles and electric bikes.

150
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,760
For difficult terrain, we have to rely on
our own two legs.

151
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,440
Whether it’s freezing cold
or scorching heat,

152
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,100
whether it’s snowing
or raining, you have to go.

153
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,070
That's how Kong got his arthritis.

154
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,669
We have 860 cultural relic conservators
in Qinchuan,

155
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,600
responsible for
protecting over 200 square kilometers

156
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,720
of heritage sites.

157
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,820
It's our responsibility.

158
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,610
However,

159
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,250
But if we’re going to discipline Kong,

160
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,070
860 of our colleagues disagree.

161
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,440
I disagree.

162
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,120
If you insist on carrying out
this disciplinary action,

163
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,720
you might as well
discipline me along with him.

164
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,030
Guo.

165
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,150
Shilin.

166
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,050
You’re here.

167
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,480
We're here to take over your shift.

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,680
How's the situation?

169
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,550
The doctor said his vital signs
had stabilized.

170
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,870
He should be able to move
to a regular ward tomorrow.

171
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,720
Uncle Fang and the others
only left to get some sleep

172
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,150
after hearing this news
and feeling a bit relieved.

173
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,950
That's great.

174
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,270
You go back and get some sleep.

175
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,470
Luo Qing and I can handle it here.

176
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,160
It's fine, it's fine.

177
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,430
I'll stay here and keep watch.

178
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,930
You haven't slept since this happened.

179
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,000
You should go get some rest now.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,750
Yes, go back home.

181
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
I can't sleep anyway.

182
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,120
Alright.

183
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,780
Don't be too hard on yourself.

184
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
You've been working on
the tomb in Yin Village for so long,

185
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,750
and the excavation report
hasn’t been approved yet.

186
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,610
Anyone in your position
would feel uneasy about it.

187
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,120
It's understandable to

188
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,910
feel emotional and want to give up.

189
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,040
Don't overthink it.

190
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,840
Mrs. Zan,

191
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,960
do you think I

192
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,430
can still be considered an archaeologist?

193
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,180
Of course, you're an archaeologist.

194
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,580
Archaeologists are still human.

195
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,870
Humans have emotions,

196
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,150
worries,

197
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,720
and choices.

198
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,360
Let me ask you one thing.

199
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,880
Do you love archaeology?

200
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,470
Just loving it

201
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,090
isn't enough, is it?

202
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,920
The higher-ups didn't let us excavate.

203
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,950
When we encounter difficulties,
we'll find a way.

204
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,920
Even if they don't allow us to excavate,

205
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,900
they can't stop us
from studying literature.

206
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Do we really need to be in the field

207
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,270
to solve academic problems?

208
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,070
The piles of old paper

209
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
are also our battlefield

210
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,720
and arena.

211
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,490
How’s it?

212
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,180
Smells good, doesn't it?

213
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,430
What do you want?

214
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,910
Nothing.

215
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,480
Can I have a chat with you?

216
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,120
Sure.

217
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,210
Come on,

218
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,050
have a seat.

219
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,550
We've been working together
for quite a while now,

220
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,670
right?

221
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,430
Let me be honest with you.

222
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,030
Archaeological excavation
and economic development

223
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,360
are equally important.

224
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,330
I'm not slacking off here,

225
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,290
working slowly.

226
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,450
I'm being responsible to you, you know?

227
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,030
I could

228
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,470
have done it faster

229
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,300
and saved myself a lot of trouble.

230
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,360
But if any of the tombs
on the construction site

231
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,320
goes wrong,

232
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,240
let me tell you,

233
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,170
suspending the work
is the least of your worries.

234
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,030
You might even end up in prison.

235
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,080
Director Zhang,

236
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,010
from now on, do whatever
you want from now on.

237
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,550
I won't rush you anymore.

238
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,870
Don’t rush us, right?

239
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,840
It's all work.

240
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,070
And one more thing,

241
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,640
be a bit more polite
when speaking to my people in the future.

242
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,940
Did you hear me?

243
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,850
Alright.

244
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,800
Director Zhang.

245
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,000
Why are you here?

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,320
I...

247
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,000
Why is that guy nodding
and smiling at you?

248
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,930
You're here to hand in
your resignation letter, aren't you?

249
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,840
I’m leaving. You won’t miss me, right?

250
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,200
I won’t miss you.

251
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,330
You’re not my wife.

252
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,630
Then I'm leaving.

253
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,630
Come back.

254
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,150
You’ve decided to continue?

255
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,510
Yes.

256
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,170
No regrets?

257
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,900
No regrets.

258
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,820
Really?

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,600
I'd regret it
if I didn't work in this industry.

260
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,400
Wait for me a moment.

261
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,940
Please come in.

262
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,510
Director.

263
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,390
Luo Qing.

264
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
What brings you back here?

265
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,630
Come, come, have a seat.

266
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,340
Thank you.

267
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
It's fine, no need to trouble yourself.

268
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
Come, come, have some water.

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,510
You're not busy with

270
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,140
Thank you.

271
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,610
Lv Family Tomb now, right?

272
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,390
It’s okay.

273
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,300
There are experienced teachers over there.

274
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,200
So I’m at ease.

275
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,160
That's great.

276
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,120
Luo Qing, you know,

277
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,550
in our institute,

278
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,830
we're short-handed.

279
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,720
Work hard.

280
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,930
Finish it quickly.

281
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,030
In our institute,

282
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,150
there are many other projects

283
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,010
waiting for you to take charge of.

284
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,680
Director,

285
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,030
I came back to talk
to you about this matter.

286
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm preparing to make a request to you.

287
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,060
I want to leave the excavation
of the Lv Family Tomb.

288
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,510
Why?

289
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,600
The city office has conducted

290
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,790
an investigation and
exploration of the  tomb in Yin Village.

291
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,550
Whether the tomb in Yin Village
is the same as the Zi Mausoleum is still

292
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,410
inconclusive.

293
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,920
This work can't be abandoned halfway.

294
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,530
Someone must take over.

295
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,880
So I want to voluntarily
apply to transfer to Bailu Plain

296
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,670
to take over this work.

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,800
To conduct an archaeological excavation
of the tomb in Yin Village.

298
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,850
Luo Qing.

299
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,550
I know you and Fang Kun
from the Municipal Bureau

300
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,530
have a deep friendship.

301
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,120
His incident

302
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,170
must have affected you.

303
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,650
But you should know that

304
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
the Lv Family Tomb

305
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,390
is already more than halfway done.

306
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,030
We’re about to see results.

307
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,120
Let me speak frankly,

308
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,480
you have to think about your future.

309
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,870
To be honest,

310
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,150
I was indeed influenced by Fang Kun,

311
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,360
but it’s not entirely because of him.

312
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,240
I

313
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,530
personally entered
that looted outer burial pit.

314
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,710
To be honest, I felt quite upset.

315
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,320
Seeing those cultural relics
being damaged,

316
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,650
I instantly understood

317
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,800
why Fang Kun would rather resign

318
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,890
and stay in Yin Village
to patrol and guard the tomb.

319
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,270
As long as the tomb in Yin Village
remains unexcavated,

320
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,200
and the scope of
heritage protection isn’t defined,

321
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,390
we don’t know how many
tomb raiders will come.

322
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,390
The losses caused are irreparable.

323
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,340
I understand.

324
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,360
You.

325
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,390
Have you really made up your mind?

326
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,720
I've reviewed Fang Kun's excavation plan.

327
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
I think it's fine.

328
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,270
We can start with Phoenix Mountain

329
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,370
to check if the claims are true.

330
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,640
Since you've made up your mind,

331
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,080
prepare a proposal,

332
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,400
and I'll submit it to the National
Cultural Heritage Administration.

333
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,720
Okay.

334
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,329
Fellow villagers,

335
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,640
the Northern Song Dynasty
Lv Family Tomb in our Mi County

336
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,680
has been officially selected

337
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,790
as one of the top ten
new archaeological discoveries in China

338
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,030
and has been approved and announced
by the State Council as

339
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,630
part of the seventh batch of
national priority protected sites.

340
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,480
The Lv Family Tomb

341
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,750
is a precious spiritual wealth

342
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,960
left to us by our ancestors.

343
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,960
To protect, study, and utilize well

344
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,970
this valuable cultural heritage

345
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,000
is the sacred and glorious duty of
the cultural relics department.

346
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,240
Today,

347
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,590
to commemorate our ancestors,

348
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,450
the archaeological excavation,

349
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,070
and the Lv family's
outstanding contribution

350
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,790
to Chinese archaeology,
we erect this monument.

351
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,960
This is also the first time

352
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,720
we've erected a monument for
archaeological excavation work.

353
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,200
It's to alert and remind
the whole society to protect

354
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,550
and cherish the cultural heritage
left by our ancestors,

355
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,450
and to pass on the essence
of Chinese civilization.

356
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,400
Good.

357
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,880
Chief Wang.

358
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,350
Director.

359
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
Today, on behalf of
our archaeological team,

360
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,120
I have a sincere request.

361
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,240
We hope that we can help
the descendants of the Lv family

362
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,510
rebuild their family temple,

363
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,920
compile their family genealogy,

364
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,310
and allow the Lv family's
traditions and teachings

365
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,350
to continue to be
passed down and carried forward.

366
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,400
Your request is excellent.

367
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,640
The spirit of the Lv family is
not only reflected within the family.

368
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,790
The Lv's Village Covenant
has had a significant impact

369
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,920
on rural governance models
for future generations.

370
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,920
It has established a
comprehensive code of conduct

371
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,320
for improving rural customs and morality.

372
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,110
We should not only rebuild
the Lv family temple and genealogy,

373
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,370
but also build a museum

374
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
to promote and spread

375
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,830
the spirit of the Lv family.

376
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,680
Good.

377
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,680
Ms. Luo,

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,860
have you really made up your mind?

379
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,240
Remember to read the books

380
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,550
and materials I left you.

381
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,570
If you have any questions,

382
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,830
ask Ms. Xiang for help.

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,550
Alright.

384
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,830
We’ve been together for so long,

385
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,960
eating together, doing field surveys,

386
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,030
sharing joys and sorrows,

387
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,090
enduring the wind and sun for so long.

388
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,750
And now you're suddenly leaving...

389
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,200
Don't get all sentimental on me.

390
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,460
I can't stand that.

391
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,960
Yin Village is so close.

392
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,240
You’ve been there before.

393
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,040
Come by and bring
some food or drinks when you visit

394
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,250
Don't come empty-handed.

395
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,920
Also,

396
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,350
if I find out

397
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,070
that you're getting restless
or slacking off,

398
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,350
I'll come back and beat you up.

399
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,640
I won't.

400
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,730
Don’t you see who
my archaeological guide is?

401
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
It’s the best teacher
in the world, Ms. Luo.

402
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,240
Don't worry, I'll work hard.

403
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,720
I won't let you down.

404
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,120
Take care of yourself too.

405
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,780
Did you take care of
what I asked you to do?

406
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,820
I've already sent out the things.

407
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,370
Then I have no regrets.

408
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,960
I won't say goodbye to everyone later.

409
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,150
Please say goodbye to them for me.

410
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,050
Okay.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,530
Luo Qing.

412
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,830
I'll go out first then.

413
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,030
Luo Qing.

414
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,010
I don't quite understand.

415
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,840
You've dedicated yourself
to the Lv Family Tomb,

416
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,290
sacrificed your youth,

417
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,450
and put in so much hard work.

418
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,680
I-I'm not saying

419
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,590
that effort is only for reward,

420
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,310
but this recognition

421
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,360
could give you more options

422
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,920
in your future career

423
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,640
and life.

424
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,240
Whether you're

425
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,310
tired

426
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,730
and want a less demanding job,

427
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,790
or want to start a new project,

428
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,860
this will be the foundation you stand on.

429
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,720
This is an honor

430
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,790
that many archaeologists
can't achieve in a lifetime.

431
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,110
Why are you choosing

432
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,280
to give up and leave at this moment?

433
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,240
Senior,

434
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,570
I think what you're saying
makes a lot of sense,

435
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,230
and it's absolutely correct.

436
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,560
I used to think the same way.

437
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,970
But Yin Village is
really short-staffed right now,

438
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,660
someone has to step up, right?

439
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is it for Fang Kun?

440
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,370
Since you ask me this question,

441
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,930
it doesn't matter whether I answer or not.

442
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,830
Senior,

443
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,030
I really appreciate
what you said to my parents

444
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,690
when you went back to Beijing.

445
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,280
It made them less worried about me.

446
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,110
You are one of the few people
in this world,

447
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,610
besides my parents,

448
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,690
who truly care about how I'm doing

449
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,050
and whether I'm tired.

450
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,680
The path I'm going to take in the future

451
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,540
will certainly not be an easy one.

452
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,070
Whether there are flowers
and applause along the way,

453
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,510
whether there are like-minded people,

454
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,570
it doesn't matter.

455
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,760
What matters is my inner choice
and direction.

456
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,960
I'm going to follow my own path now.

457
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,790
Thank you for your care

458
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,450
and support during this time.

459
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,640
I also hope

460
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,860
that you will have smooth sailing

461
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,090
on your future path.

462
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,660
Take care of yourself.

463
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,880
Goodbye.

464
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,080
Take care.

465
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,750
She's here.

466
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,920
Ms. Luo's car is here.

467
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,680
This must be it.

468
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,270
Yes, yes.

469
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,400
Look, Ms. Luo is here.

470
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,400
Ms. Luo is here.

471
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,790
Ms. Luo, Ms. Luo.

472
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,720
Fugui,

473
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Uncle, Auntie, why are you all here?

474
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,640
Ms. Luo,

475
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,200
why did you leave without saying a word?

476
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,680
That's right.

477
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,920
We don't want to leave you.

478
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,300
They've come to see you off.

479
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,230
I should be the one
thanking everyone for these days.

480
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,200
I've caused trouble for everyone.

481
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
You're being too polite.

482
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,960
Indeed.

483
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,070
Xiaobai

484
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,030
sent the family genealogy to my house.

485
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,090
When I looked at it,

486
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,610
I really didn't expect

487
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,320
that you, a great expert,

488
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,880
would personally revise
this for us.

489
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
That's right.

490
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,210
Exactly, that's right.

491
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,570
From the Northern Song Dynasty to now,

492
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,160
from Qinchuan to Guyue,

493
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,880
the scattered Lu family

494
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,780
has finally reunited in the book.

495
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,830
Yes, it warms my heart.

496
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,430
I'm moved.

497
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,510
I don't know how to repay you.

498
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,750
So I brought some local specialties.

499
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,070
Right?

500
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,960
Here, for you.

501
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,510
Good, good.

502
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,310
Well,

503
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,930
it's like this.

504
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,110
If there's anything in the future,
just let me know.

505
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,550
No problem.

506
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,960
You know, we farmers,

507
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,160
what problems could we have?

508
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,590
Besides tending to the crops,

509
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,640
it's just taking care of the elderly and children.

510
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,070
Right?

511
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,530
Yes, yes, that's right.

512
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,680
There's one more thing.

513
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,830
After we finish building the memorial hall,

514
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,960
could you come and give a lesson to the children?

515
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,710
The idea is to make the children remember

516
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,710
who this memorial hall was built for

517
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,400
and how it was built.

518
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:26,800
Right.

519
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,550
That's right, that's right. Just like that.

520
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,210
No problem.

521
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,850
I'll definitely come.

522
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,500
Alright.

523
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,790
Okay.

524
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,160
Let's put the things on.

525
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,270
We'll just deliver it here.

526
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,400
Come, it's this way.

527
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,920
I heard Mr. Fang was injured.

528
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,000
Take it back to nourish him.

529
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,680
Put it in the car.

530
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,270
Okay, okay, okay.

531
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,470
Get in the car, come on.

532
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,830

558
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,400
To commend all the villagers

559
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,680
for their righteous act of fighting the tomb raiders,

560
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,000
in addition to this banner,

561
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,030
the Municipal Cultural Heritage Bureau has specially made a batch of

562
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,450
plaques for exemplary cultural heritage protection families

563
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,960
to be awarded to every villager who participated in the action.

564
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,680
Great!

565
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,250
[Exemplary Cultural Heritage Protection Family]

566
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,520
Slow down.

567
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Nail it firmly, okay?

568
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,790
Okay, okay, okay.

569
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,110
Thank you, thank you.

570
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,020
-Yes, yes, yes.
-It's a cultural heritage protection family...

571
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,880
Everybody should learn from this.

572
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,810
Uncle Youliang.

573
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,610
Captain Yang.

574
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,140
Xiaoman.

575
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,850
Why are you here?

576
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,400
How's your dad's injury?

577
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,050
It's mostly healed.

578
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,890
Then why didn't you go to the village committee to receive the banner?

579
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:36,600
Uncle.

580
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,430
Captain Yang.

581
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,890
Why are you here?

582
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,510
Couldn't get you to come out, so

583
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,170
I came to provide door-to-door service myself.

584
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,730
Come.

585
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:44,680
Okay.

586
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,830
Uncle, look.

587
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,760
Where should we nail this plaque

588
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
to nail away the worry in your heart?

589
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,590
I don't deserve this.

590
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,160
I haven't made any contribution.

591
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,920
How can you say you haven't contributed?

592
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,320
If you hadn't taken that shovel to the head,

593
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,440
how would the tomb raiders have been discovered?

594
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,370
Yours was a contribution of blood.

595
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,270
Come, let me see.

596
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,650
Where's a good place to nail it?

597
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,830
A bit higher.

598
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,560
Is this okay?

599
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,160
Is it alright?

600
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,760
It's fine.

601
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,380
Come on.

602
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,680
Good, nail it, good.

603
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,480
It looks beautiful.

604
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,770
Come, come, come. Nail it, let's nail it.

605
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,350
A little to the right.

606
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,960
That's it.

607
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,240
Right here?

608
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,130
Yes, that's good.

609
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,660
Okay? Come on, here you are.

610
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,770
Alright, I'll be going now.

611
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,680
Luo Qing from the archaeological team asked me to go and mobilize

612
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,920
to form a cultural heritage protection team in the village.

613
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,030
No one's responding, so I'll go and see to it myself.

614
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,830
A little more.

615
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,030
I'm leaving.

616
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,960
Come by anytime.

617
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,290
Okay.

618
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,240
Take care, Captain Yang.

619
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,770
Alright.

620
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,240
You two nail it well.

621
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,570
Okay.

622
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,510
Looks great.

623
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,870
Captain Yang,

624
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,400
how's the recruitment going?

625
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,330
When I was nailing the door plates,

626
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,850
I asked for opinions from each household.

627
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,580
Some were quite enthusiastic,

628
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,730
but there were some concerns.

629
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,160
After all, they're afraid of not being able to fight against the tomb raiders.

630
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,880
And they don't want to lose their own labor force.

631
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,640
If they're going to do it, just do it. If not, forget it.

632
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,300
I don't see anyone here who really wants to do it.

633
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,240
Otherwise, how about this:

634
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,070
when Fang Kun wakes up,

635
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,070
I'll patrol with him. We don't need them.

636
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,930
Uncle Shoucun,

637
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,270
we have such a large area,

638
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,070
how can just two people guard it?

639
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,210
I can understand their concerns.

640
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,880
The farmers are very busy every day,

641
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,150
and they won't have time if they join the cultural heritage protection team.

642
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,550
Here's the case. I've submitted an application to the higher-ups

643
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,830
to allocate a portion of our archaeological funds

644
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,650
as a reward.

645
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,590
We'll provide some subsidies for our cultural heritage protection team.

646
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,150
Let's establish this first.

647
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,420
It's perfect timing as we haven't defined the cultural heritage protection area yet.

648
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,750
Let's start dealing with it now.

649
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,010
This way, the work can proceed smoothly.

650
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,030
Your concerns are valid.

651
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,880
I'll also apply to the bureau when I get back,

652
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,400
to see if we can get some funds allocated

653
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,240
to build up our cultural heritage protection team.

654
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,680
Okay.

655
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,900
Secretary.

656
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,550
Could you please inform all the villagers about this?

657
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,750
Let's gather enough people as soon as possible.

658
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,550
It can be done.

659
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,400
However, in the past,

660
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,030
it was always the Chief who handled these things.

661
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,350
The villagers all listened to him.

662
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,010
Now he's lost his enthusiasm.

663
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,960
So this matter has become a bit troublesome.

664
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,790
No one in our village is as influential as he is.

665
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,800
That's right.

666
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,030
Uncle.

667
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,960
Uncle Youliang.

668
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,150
Youliang.

669
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,160
In our Yin Village's territory,

670
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,090
could there be shortage of people?

671
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,320
Captain.

672
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,110
How do you want to arrange this?

673
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,640
Are these

674
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,200
people enough?

675
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,540
It's enough.

676
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,590
Enough.

677
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,000
Fellow countrymen!

678
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,940
You've all seen it, right?

679
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,640
These thieves with their probing rods

680
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,770
have turned our land into a honeycomb.

681
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,880
Not only can we no longer irrigate our land,

682
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,160
but most importantly, this group

683
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,310
has almost pierced through our ancestors' coffin boards.

684
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,840
Can we allow this to happen?

685
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,920
No, we can't.

686
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,240
If we can't allow it, then let's deal with them.

687
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,110
The Chief still has strong leadership.

688
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,710
By the way,

689
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,510
there's another matter today.

690
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,880
Our cultural heritage protection team needs a captain.

691
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,920
Who do you think is suitable?

692
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,160
I think Youliang is suitable for this.

693
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,450
I disagree.

694
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,240
I've been working in cultural heritage protection the longest.

695
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
I have the most experience.

696
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,310
If we're choosing a captain, it should definitely be me.

697
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,830
Youliang is good at production,

698
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,350
but he doesn't understand cultural heritage protection.

699
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:14,950
Moreover,

700
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,590
we can't let a thief's father

701
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,330
be the captain of the cultural heritage protection team.

702
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:17,790
Right, right, right.

703
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,680
People will laugh at us.

704
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,830
You do it, you do it. I can't do it.

705
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,960
Uncle Youliang, Uncle Youliang.

706
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,510
What are you saying?

707
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:21,960
Alright, alright.

708
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,160
What's a tomb raider anyway?

709
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,790
Don't worry about it.

710
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,720
Chief, Chief, don't leave.

711
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,700
Chief, don't leave.

712
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,830
You're the most suitable to be the captain.

713
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,240
Don't you all agree?

714
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,590
Yes.

715
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,110
Cultural heritage protection is just patrolling, right?

716
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,400
Just these areas in the village,

717
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,350
who in our village

718
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,150
couldn't walk through with their eyes closed without getting lost?

719
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,880
I also think Youliang is suitable.

720
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,270
If he becomes the captain,

721
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,130
I'll accept it.

722
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,920
I accept too, I accept too.

723
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,600
That works.

724
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,330
Uncle Youliang,

725
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,430
the cultural heritage protection team

726
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,690
is counting on you now.

727
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,590
Alright then.

728
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,830
I'll do it.

729
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,750
Did you hear that?

730
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,880
Did you hear what they said?

731
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,830
Fine.

732
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:04,920
Fine.

733
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,720
Here's the case.

734
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,910
Let Fang Kun know about this.

735
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,310
When he has recovered,

736
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,200
tell him to come back quickly.

737
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,600
I've made a room for him.

738
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,240
Alright.

739
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,000
We welcome the archaeological team back anytime.

740
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,550
Okay.

741
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,430
Youliang!

742
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,270
Take care, Uncle Youliang.

743
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:21,880
Mrs. Zan,

744
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,390
how is it going?

745
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,860
He's awake?

746
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,630
Over here.

747
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,540
Uncle, Auntie,

748
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,610
Luo Qing, you're here.

749
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,110
This is...

750
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,680
He just fell asleep.

751
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,240
Sis,

752
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,920
what did the doctor say?

753
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,010
The doctor said there are aftereffects.

754
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,670
It has affected his speech and motor functions.

755
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,020
Can he recover?

756
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,280
It's hard to say.

757
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,410
He's awake.

758
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,680
Kun.

759
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,590
Kun.

760
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,420
He finally woke up.

761
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,550
You all stay here and keep him company.

762
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,230
Mom.

763
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,550
Who are

764
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,680
you?

765
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,610
What did he say?

766
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,270
He asked who I am.

767
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,240
You...

768
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,290
Stop scaring us, will you?

769
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,360
You just had a good sleep.

770
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,660
You have no idea what we've been through.

771
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,040
I mean, you...

772
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,310
You sent us away

773
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,760
and ran off to the site to play hero and catch tomb raiders.

774
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,360
Why did you have to be so cool?

775
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,570
Back then...

776
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,469
I shouldn't have left you alone at the site.

777
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,540
You really scared us to death.

778
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,510
You really almost scared us to death.

779
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,440
Do you know that?

780
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,670
Why do you have to learn everything from Zan?

781
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,110
Learn the good things, not the bad ones, okay?

782
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,960
Are you silly?

783
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,469
Don't do this again in the future.

784
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,070
Exactly.

785
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:36,760
What?

786
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,590
I'm fine.

787
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,040
What?

788
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,530
You're being tough.

789
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,590
He says he's fine.

790
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,920
Of course he can't be in trouble.

791
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,520
What would you do if something happened to him?

792
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,600
Oh, right. I have some good news for you.

793
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
The archaeological project in Yin Village has been confirmed.

794
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,220
The provincial institute will be in charge.

795
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,530
Are you happy now?

796
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,210
Do you know who's leading the team?

797
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,910
Why are you looking at me?

798
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,970
Don't you trust me to lead?

799
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,920
I've already handed over the Lv Family Tomb project.

800
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,780
Someone else will take care of it.

801
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,510
Once this project is completed,

802
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,110
you'll be eligible for a researcher position.

803
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,030
Giving up now

804
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,510
is really a shame.

805
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,030
Fang Kun,

806
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,820
Luo Qing has made such a big sacrifice.

807
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,750
You should also do your best.

808
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,630
Don't do foolish things in the future.

809
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,290
Take good care of your health.

810
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,090
Come back soon to help Luo Qing.

811
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:49,840
Understand?

812
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,800
Mrs. Zan, you've said it all.

813
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,110
What's left for him to say?

814
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,630
What's so great about being a researcher?

815
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,110
It's just a few hundred yuan more, isn't it?

816
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,590
When Fang Kun gets better,

817
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,390
he can make it up to you, can't he?

818
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,800
Who is he to me that he needs to make up for anything?

819
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,760
Right, right, right.

820
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,490
It's all yours, it's all yours.

821
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,800
Alright, stop fooling around.

822
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,730
When will your city office be ready?

823
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,140
Ready for what?

824
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,630
Didn't Director Zhang tell you?

825
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,360
Tell us what?

826
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,760
The grand tomb in Yin Village was first discovered by your team.

827
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,190
You've put in a lot of effort.

828
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,550
You and Fang Kun are the most familiar with Yin Village.

829
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,070
You've also accumulated a wealth of relevant preparations.

830
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,960
So it's been decided this time

831
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,960
that the two units will jointly form a combined archaeological team.

832
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,000
The National Cultural Heritage Administration has already approved it.

833
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,860
However, I'll be the team leader.

834
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,850
So you two will have to listen to me.

835
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,630
Are you serious?

836
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,230
This... this... this...

837
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,630
It has to be our Captain Luo, huh?

838
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,290
From now on, whatever you want to eat, it's on me.

839
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,320
Already starting with the bribery, are we?

840
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,670
And you,

841
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,990
I'm giving up my researcher position to play with you.

842
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,590
You better recover quickly.

843
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
I'll give you one more month at most.

844
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,150
Whether you're limping or mute by then,

845
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,530
you'll have to drag yourself back to the site.

846
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,260
Don't worry.

847
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,710
After a month, no matter what condition he's in,

848
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,280
I'll even

849
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,940
carry this guy to the site.

850
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,360
You have my promise.

851
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,580
[Qinchuan Relics Inspection Team]
[Qinchuan Cultural Heritage Bureau]

852
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,960
We conducted a thorough search of the abandoned power plant

853
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,360
and Qi Youliang's house,

854
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,800
within a one-kilometer radius.

855
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,710
We carried out a comprehensive screening

856
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,190
and found 32 cigarette butts,

857
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,590
six cigarette packs,

858
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,990
eight mineral water and beverage bottles,

859
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,410
and three fecal samples.

860
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,960
We sent all these pieces of evidence

861
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
to the forensic center

862
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,510
for examination.

863
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,650
It was discovered that

864
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,940
two DNA

865
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,080
belonged to the same person.

866
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,520
This individual

867
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,250
is named Liang Jianbin.

868
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Here's his photo.

869
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
His nickname is Liang.

870
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,230
He's 43 years old this year,

871
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,920
from Hedong.

872
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,720
Six years ago,

873
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,730
he was sentenced for tomb raiding.

874
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,770
He was released two years ago.

875
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,770
We also had Hei identify the photo.

876
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,880
He confirmed that

877
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,630
this Liang

878
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,630
was indeed

879
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,090
the on-site commander of his grave robbery.

880
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,560
Let's head to Hedong immediately.

881
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,800
Wen Wen.

882
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,180
The baby's crying. Can't you take care of it?

883
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,020
The baby's crying so much and you're not doing anything?

884
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,280
Don't cry, be good.

885
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,230
Don't cry.

886
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,050
Since the baby's crying, you should stop crying.

887
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,960
They say

888
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,360
crucian carp soup can help with breast milk production.

889
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,400
I'll go buy some crucian carp to make soup.

890
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,800
Will you have some?

891
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,530
I won't drink it.

892
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,760
If you don't drink it, the baby won't have anything to drink.

893
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
The baby doesn't like formula milk.

894
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,900
Hold the baby for a while.

895
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,210
What exactly do you mean?

896
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,730
Isn't this the baby you gave birth to?

897
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,510
From pregnancy until now,

898
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,240
when are you going to stop this?

899
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,190
Stop crying.

900
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is powered off.

901
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,880
Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is powered off.

902
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,110
Guang.

903
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,320
Brother.

904
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Are you going out?

905
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,110
I'm going to look for Wen Wen.

906
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,000
Where did she go?

907
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,590
I don't know.

908
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,400
Early this morning, her suitcase and clothes were all gone.

909
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,070
All gone?

910
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,280
Wen Wen has been acting strange lately.

911
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,230
I don't know what's wrong with her temper.

912
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,000
She doesn't even take care of the baby. It cries all night.

913
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,370
I don't know what's going on.

914
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,280
Where's the baby?

915
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,480
The baby is upstairs.

916
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,360
How can you leave the baby alone in the room?

917
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,800
Well...

918
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,670
The baby was asleep

919
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,070
when I came down just now.

920
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
Don't cry, don't cry.

921
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,580
Stop crying.

922
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,290
What's going on?

923
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
It has got a fever.

924
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,670
Let's get to the hospital quickly.

925
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,500
Let's go, let's go.

926
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,300
When I came downstairs just now,

927
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,800
it wasn't crying yet.

928
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,200
Guang, put the hat on the baby.

929
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:29,920
Okay.

930
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,360
Remember to give the baby medicine on time.

931
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,960
Alright, alright.

932
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,020
Thank you, doctor.

933
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,800
Luckily I came in time.

934
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,480
Otherwise, he would have had a febrile seizure.

935
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,540
Wen Wen isn't here.

936
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,110
I don't know how to handle this.

937
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,530
Go find Wen Wen and bring her back.

938
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,660
What about the baby?

939
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,030
Let your sister-in-law take care of it for a few days first.

940
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,290
You go look for Wen Wen.

941
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,320
Thank you, brother.

942
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,520
Alright, say no more.

943
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,780
Give me the prescription, I'll go get the medicine.

944
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,640
You go quickly.

945
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,230
Okay.
