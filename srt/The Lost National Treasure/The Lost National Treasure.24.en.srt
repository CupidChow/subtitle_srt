[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,729
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,770
Throughout his life, Confucius
narrated but did not compose.

4
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,479
At your age, you're already writing
books and establishing theories.

5
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,810
I need to learn from you.

6
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,950
I'm flattered.

7
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,840
There's nothing
you're afraid of me hearing, right?

8
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,710
What could I possibly
have that I'm afraid of you hearing?

9
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,020
I write books and give lectures,

10
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,020
it's not illegal.

11
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,870
That's right.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,400
Well.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,760
Much of what you say
is too profound for me.

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,020
I don't understand it.

15
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,600
However,

16
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,170
I heard a few sentences,

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,150
are you trying
to whitewash those tomb raiders?

18
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,540
That can't be, right?

19
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,720
You can't say such things carelessly.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,660
That's too big an accusation.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,140
Let's just say
it's a difference in personal views.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,400
Oh, it's academic.

23
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,430
I'm just a simple man,
I don't understand these things.

24
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,710
Anyway, it's about cultural relics, right?

25
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,840
I mean, cultural relics are like life.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,150
Real artifacts can't be faked,

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,910
and fake ones can't become real.

28
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,710
As for people,
you should walk the righteous path.

29
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,790
If you take crooked ways and detours,

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,680
in the end,

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,620
good and evil
will eventually be rewarded accordingly.

32
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,220
Am I right?

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,360
You're right.

34
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,890
There's an old saying,

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,280
if a person doesn't touch the ground,

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,079
their feet naturally won't get muddy.

37
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,480
Right.

38
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,630
Captain Qi,

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,680
come visit my little shop someday.

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,970
You know where it is.

41
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,820
You're welcome anytime.

42
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,620
I'll continue to learn from you.

43
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,060
Well, I'll be going now.

44
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,260
Goodbye, Captain Qi.

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,400
How about giving me a copy of that book?

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,060
No problem.

47
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,800
Come to the store
to pick it up when you're free.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,200
It's all been delivered?

49
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,290
Sold out today.

50
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,930
There's nothing left.

51
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,170
See you later.

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,920
Captain Yang.

53
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,450
Captain Qi, come here.

54
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,190
Mu Jianhui has published a book.

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,200
What?

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,090
What do you think he's up to?

57
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,900
"Appreciation of Black Pottery Figurines."

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,730
After the Lv Family Tomb incident,

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,710
we've been keeping an eye on him.

60
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,440
There haven't been any issues.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,310
His brother-in-law
opened a construction company.

62
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,240
It seems like
they're running a legitimate business.

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,470
We're also watching his Nameless Pavilion.

64
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,270
It just sells some handicrafts.

65
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,630
It doesn't have
any connections to the underworld.

66
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,520
Overall,

67
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,480
his business seems very clean.

68
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,630
Do you know

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,770
how many copies he printed?

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,120
How many?

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,200
Ten thousand copies?

72
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,310
A hundred thousand.

73
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,640
What?

74
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,660
He paid for it himself.

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,510
It cost him one or two million.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,829
He's loaded.

77
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,430
That's an astronomical figure.

78
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,600
It seems his way
of making money is questionable.

79
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,720
We just haven't figured it out yet.

80
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,390
Tell me,

81
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,870
investing one or two million like that,

82
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,510
he must be expecting
some kind of response.

83
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,710
What kind of response is he looking for?

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,480
He must be

85
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,850
wanting to become famous.

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,870
After dealing with him for so long,

87
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,750
what kind of person do you think he is?

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,830
Well, Mu Jianhui

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,420
doesn't drink,

90
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,810
doesn't smoke,

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,070
doesn't visit prostitutes or gamble,

92
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,730
he's very self-disciplined.

93
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,510
I think

94
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
compared to the people
from the underworld we've dealt with,

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,560
he's completely different.

96
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,220
He's extremely,
extremely self-disciplined.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,860
He doesn't even care about money,

98
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,600
doesn't care about houses,

99
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
doesn't care about cars.

100
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,270
He just loves his wife

101
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,490
and his family.

102
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,630
It's not right to say
he has no material desires though.

103
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,950
At the very least,

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,430
you see,

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,390
that guy,

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,100
he loves antiques.

107
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,860
But his love for antiques

108
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,630
is open and aboveboard.

109
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,159
And he loves them
with great sophistication.

110
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,670
His historical knowledge is very rich.

111
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,250
He's a scholar,

112
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,270
right?

113
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,650
Dacang,

114
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,310
I feel

115
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,920
you're getting close
to figuring out Mu Jianhui.

116
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,250
What have I figured out?

117
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,270
He's a great person.

118
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
I can't figure out anything.

119
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,420
Kun.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,480
Kun.

121
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,550
We're here. Almost there.

122
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,200
So many cars coming.

123
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,850
Must be visiting
relatives for the New Year.

124
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,370
The New Year's over.
Where are these relatives coming from?

125
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,320
No one is allowed in.

126
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,310
Where are you all from?
What are you doing here?

127
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,840
No entry.

128
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,030
Nobody is allowed in.

129
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,510
No entry, I said no entry!

130
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,870
Why won't you let us in?

131
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,190
I said no entry. Step back!

132
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,070
Back off!

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Step back!

134
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,760
Move back!

135
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,510
Back off, back off! What are you doing?

136
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,510
Calm down, let's talk this through.

137
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,630
What's going on? What's the situation?

138
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,680
They're saying that...

139
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,430
Our village has some emperor or something.

140
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,800
Don't know where
they heard it from. So many cars here.

141
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,160
I can't even write
down all the license plates.

142
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,070
What emperor?

143
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,040
They want to enter the village to see it.

144
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,970
No one can enter.

145
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,630
Why can't we go in?

146
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,950
Wait, bro.

147
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,920
They're saying there's an emperor.

148
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,390
Where did you hear
that there's an emperor in this village?

149
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,870
It's all over the internet.

150
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,560
They're saying
Yin Village has an emperor's tomb.

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,800
How come you're
not letting people in to see it?

152
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
It's not true. They're fooling you.

153
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,080
No, nobody is allowed in.

154
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,240
Uncle Shoucun, you stay here and guard.

155
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,920
I'll go back and check.

156
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Call me if anything happens.

157
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,680
Don't get into any fights, you hear me?

158
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,010
Okay.

159
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,130
No entry, no entry!

160
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,310
The dogs will bite you!

161
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,360
We heard the archaeological team
made a major discovery.

162
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,270
Can you give us
some details about the situation?

163
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,000
Tell us something!

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,680
Can you say something about it?

165
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,630
Please answer our questions.

166
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,600
Alright, alright, listen to me.

167
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,460
It's like this.

168
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,000
If there's any news,

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,870
we will immediately

170
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,270
announce it to everyone

171
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,300
through official media channels.

172
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,400
Aright? Thank you.

173
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,800
Let me through.

174
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,950
There are rumors online that a new large tomb
has been discovered in Yin Village.

175
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,480
What's the current
situation with the tomb?

176
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,810
Can you tell us about it?

177
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,190
Let me through.

178
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,040
Everyone is very
concerned about this issue.

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,070
What exactly is the situation now?

180
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,680
Can you tell us about it?

181
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,160
Please answer.

182
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Please answer our questions.

183
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,960
Come on, everyone, listen to me.

184
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,660
Everyone, listen to me.

185
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,190
-If there are any discoveries...
-Hurry.

186
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,430
We will definitely announce them

187
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,760
through the official channels
of the archaeological team.

188
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,220
What's wrong?

189
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,770
What's going on?

190
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,480
This...

191
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,080
These people have gone crazy.

192
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,030
What's been going on these past few days?

193
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,090
What's happening?

194
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,480
All these people suddenly showed up.

195
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,200
I'm worried bad people
might sneak in during the chaos.

196
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,910
Uncle Shoucun
is guarding at the village entrance.

197
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,630
Mr. Fang, what's really going on here?

198
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,550
Looking at the situation now,

199
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,600
I guess it's about the Yin Village matter

200
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,670
that the outside world
has found out about.

201
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,270
How could the outside world know?

202
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,510
We few certainly didn't say anything.

203
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:55,870
That's right.

204
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,510
Who knows?

205
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,790
Let's not worry about
how the outside world found out for now.

206
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,270
We should report this
to the station first.

207
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,200
Director Zhang,

208
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,080
You and Fang Kun

209
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
return to the station immediately.

210
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,580
Alright, understood.

211
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,270
What's up?

212
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,640
Director Zhang wants us
to go back to the station now.

213
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,400
[A grave emerged in Yin Village. It's hard to tell if it's true or not.]

214
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,080
Director Zhang.

215
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,870
Why did you call us back so urgently?

216
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,670
See for yourself.

217
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,390
How did this become the talk of the town?

218
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,790
You have the nerve to ask?

219
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,270
Did you attend some kind of

220
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,150
book launch?

221
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,790
There was someone named Mu

222
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,720
who talked about the Yin Village tomb.

223
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,580
There's even a video of it online.

224
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,060
That Mu person,

225
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,510
I had no idea who he was.

226
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,910
If I had known who that person was,

227
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,550
I definitely wouldn't have gone.

228
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,720
My friend told me

229
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
that person was some kind of scholar.

230
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,900
I believed it. I...

231
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,370
My fault.

232
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,010
I shouldn't have
attended that darn lecture.

233
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,850
Don't take all the blame on yourself.

234
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,550
It's clear that word
has already spread in our circles.

235
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,750
Someone must have leaked the information.

236
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,550
The power of new media these days

237
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
is really something.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,330
Even the smallest thing

239
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,290
spreads faster than a rocket.

240
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,610
In our line of work,

241
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,390
although it's not
as dangerous as Qi Dacang's,

242
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,300
you have to realize

243
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,550
how many eyes
are watching you from behind,

244
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,410
trying to drag you down, you know?

245
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,120
So now, this situation,

246
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,670
what should we do?

247
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,500
What do you think we should do?

248
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,150
How about I go back to Yin Village first?

249
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,390
A lot of outsiders have come.

250
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,120
I'm worried.

251
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
What's the point of going back?

252
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,390
Everyone knows you're the team leader.

253
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,790
You'll just create
more news by going back.

254
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,360
Let's allow this matter

255
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,690
to cool down for a while.

256
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,390
I received calls
from several seniors today.

257
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,220
They said we're

258
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,950
just seeking attention,

259
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,400
saying we're

260
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,250
putting on a show to grab eyeballs.

261
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,960
That's right.

262
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,290
Fang, you go back first.

263
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,520
Go with Lu to see what's going on.

264
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,450
Okay.

265
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,440
Royal eggs! Royal walnuts!

266
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,000
Come on!

267
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,960
The freshest royal eggs!

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,630
Royal pumpkins!

269
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,390
This is what it means

270
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,390
to live off the land

271
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,030
and water.

272
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,510
They're now living off the emperor
by being close to him.

273
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,240
Look at this.

274
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,240
So many people
have come to see the excitement.

275
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,300
Might as well seize
the opportunity to make some money.

276
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,960
Royal chili peppers!

277
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,270
Royal dates!

278
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,000
Chen!

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,510
Try some, come and try!

280
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,080
Chen!

281
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,440
Mr. Fang,

282
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:58,840
hello.

283
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,240
Mr. Lu,

284
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,280
you're here.

285
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,120
Look at this.

286
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,840
The crowds of people keep coming non-stop.

287
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,790
These past couple of days,

288
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,600
Phoenix Mountain
has become a tourist attraction.

289
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Is there any news?

290
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,510
News?

291
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
Don't even mention it.
It just makes me angry to talk about it.

292
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,890
You know,

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,510
if they're here for tourism, that's fine,

294
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,200
but we've got
a bunch of tomb explorers here.

295
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,220
A group of little brats

296
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,790
were climbing up
in the middle of the night.

297
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,050
I had to drag them down.

298
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,120
Early this morning, a few more showed up.

299
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,550
They say after exploring Phoenix Mountain,

300
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,750
they want to go to Yin Village.

301
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,360
It's making me afraid to leave.

302
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,420
I haven't even eaten since I got here.

303
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,600
Hasn't your
Cultural Relics Management Office

304
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,150
sent you two more people?

305
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,150
They did, they sent
an old man, but he couldn't handle it.

306
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,320
He watched with me for two days,

307
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,920
but got too tired.
I told him to go back and rest.

308
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,200
Looking at this situation,

309
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,120
two people aren't enough, are they?

310
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,750
Not enough.

311
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,910
Even two more wouldn't be enough.

312
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,310
Look at all these people.

313
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,360
Come on, let's stay close
to the group, follow closely.

314
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
Now we can see

315
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,080
ahead of us is Emperor Taizong of Han's
Zi Mausoleum on Phoenix Mountain.

316
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,360
But in a couple of days, it might not be.

317
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,830
Why do you say that?

318
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,270
Because as everyone knows,

319
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,000
Cao Cao has 72 suspected tombs,

320
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,550
and Emperor Taizong of Han
also has a suspected tomb.

321
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,680
It's in Yin Village.

322
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,640
So, which of these two is the real one?

323
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,360
We don't know for sure right now.

324
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,120
Look, they're here.

325
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Alright, you go ahead and get busy.

326
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,050
We'll head back.

327
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,210
Okay, okay.

328
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,120
Come on, everyone stay back a bit.

329
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Don't go forward.

330
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,100
No one is allowed in.

331
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,270
Eggs are two yuan per jin.

332
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,720
No, no, no. No entry allowed.

333
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,780
Tourists at the back, please keep up.

334
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,720
Everyone stay away from the dogs.

335
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,240
They bite.

336
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,120
The walnuts are genuinely royal.

337
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,910
No entry, no entry.

338
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,840
No one is allowed in.

339
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,150
Why aren't we allowed in?

340
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,320
Don't move forward, everyone.

341
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,440
No entry, no entry.

342
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,870
Why can't we go in?

343
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,360
There's no tourism here.

344
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,840
Tourism is not allowed.

345
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,100
There's nothing here.

346
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
No big tomb, nothing at all.

347
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,390
You old scoundrel,

348
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,670
what are you being so arrogant about?

349
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,630
These people have come from far away.

350
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,480
I welcome them.

351
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,140
We in Yin Village welcome you.

352
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,080
The dogs will bite you, they'll bite you!

353
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,610
No entry.

354
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,630
No one is allowed in.

355
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,160
No entry.

356
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,630
You got a grudge
against money or something?

357
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,690
Why don't you go die on Chunhua's bed?

358
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,270
This is Shoucun's job.

359
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,270
Speak nicely, will you?

360
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,720
What, your daughter just joined
the archaeological team a few days ago,

361
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,200
and now you're acting all high and mighty?

362
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,240
The label of "tomb raider's family"

363
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,640
is stuck on my head alone.

364
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,390
No, when I say no, it means no.

365
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,480
You must have eaten shit.

366
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,720
Such foul language.

367
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,320
Don't waste my time
making money, get out of the way.

368
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,200
The dogs will bite.

369
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Royal cherries.

370
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,550
Royal Empress Dowager's Cake.

371
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,840
Royal eggs.

372
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,440
Royal pancakes are here.

373
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,840
Authentic produce from the royal gardens.

374
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,150
These used to be supplied
to Emperor Taizong of Han.

375
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,470
Did you know that?

376
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,800
Royal eggs.

377
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,850
Royal Empress Dowager's Cake.

378
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,480
Let's stop here. We can't go any further.

379
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,960
Kun, there were too many people just now.

380
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,270
A bunch of tourists came.

381
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,470
I couldn't stop them.

382
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,240
It's alright, it's alright.

383
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,770
I'll figure something out.

384
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,550
It's fine.

385
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,670
Come, take a look.

386
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Taste the royal dried cherries.

387
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,320
Appreciate Emperor
Taizong of Han's mausoleum.

388
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,150
It's fifty yuan a bag.

389
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,080
Sister-in-law.

390
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,670
How can you talk nonsense?

391
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,320
There's no Emperor
Taizong of Han's mausoleum here.

392
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,200
Mind your own business.
I'll shout whatever I want.

393
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll sell whatever I want.

394
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,120
You'd better take
care of your own business.

395
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,550
Let me tell you, it's fifty yuan.

396
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,000
Royal eggs.

397
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,870
Exclusively for the royal family.

398
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,550
Children who eat these study better.

399
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,720
Elderly who eat these have better health.

400
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,150
Royal Eggs.
Mother.

401
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,720
-What are you doing here?
-Kun.

402
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,000
Selling eggs, what's wrong?

403
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,510
There are many tourists,
everyone's making money.

404
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,000
I'd be stupid not to make money.

405
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,120
Royal eggs!

406
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,380
Royal eggs, five yuan!

407
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,600
Royal eggs.

408
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
This isn't going to work out.

409
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,910
What should we do?

410
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,840
I'll go to the district office.

411
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,390
Can you give me a ride?

412
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,720
-What are you talking about?
-Okay.

413
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,030
Take me to the bus station.

414
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,150
I've grown up
all this time and I didn't know...

415
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,690
I grew up eating royal eggs.
Xiao Man.

416
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,690
Xiaoman, I'm going to the district.

417
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,190
Okay, okay, you go ahead.

418
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,670
Mr. Lu

419
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,470
You go, you go.

420
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,370
Be careful, there are a lot of people.

421
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,030
Okay, okay.

422
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,790
You don't know.

423
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,920
I don't know either.

424
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,600
Royal eggs!

425
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Royal eggs exclusively
supplied to the royal family.

426
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,220
Please come in.

427
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,510
Ma.

428
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,850
Mr. Fang.

429
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,150
Come, come, come.

430
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,680
Hurry in.

431
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,160
Please, have a seat.

432
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,100
Right away.

433
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,120
You seem busy.

434
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,250
Coming, coming.

435
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,370
What brings you here today?

436
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,000
No need.

437
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,720
It's fine. Try this, it's new.

438
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,080
You're suddenly being so nice to me.

439
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,410
I'm not quite used to it.

440
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,240
When have I ever not been good to you?

441
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,440
When you needed
an expert, I found you one.

442
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,630
When you needed an electric bicycle,

443
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,910
I lent you mine.

444
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,280
Even if you broke it,

445
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,360
I didn't complain at all.

446
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,440
Here. Be careful. It’s hot.
Okay.

447
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,040
Thank you.

448
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,900
You know, as your brother,

449
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,210
I've done you plenty of favors.

450
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,540
That's true.

451
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,480
So, how about

452
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,710
you do me another favor today, alright?

453
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,530
It must be about
the Yin Village tomb again?

454
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,660
So you already know?

455
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,270
That's exactly why I'm here.

456
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,720
If you're talking about that,

457
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,200
I should really thank you.

458
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,500
Back then, you stopped us
from filling in that looting pit.

459
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,560
If I had listened to you then,

460
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,240
we could have discovered
the Yin Village tomb years earlier.

461
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,900
Let's not talk about that now.

462
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,510
It's ancient history.

463
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:06,829
Alright.

464
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,490
Let's talk about the present.

465
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,589
You see, in this new media era,

466
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
information spreads so quickly.

467
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,550
In just a few days,

468
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,010
those forums and websites

469
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,400
are all talking
about the Yin Village tomb.

470
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,819
Rumors are flying everywhere.

471
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,750
Many outsiders who know nothing

472
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,349
are flocking to Yin Village in droves.

473
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,160
This is a good thing.

474
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,349
What's good about it?

475
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,960
The cultural relic conservators
can't handle it anymore.

476
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,480
You know that

477
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,540
it's just Uncle Shoucun and that dog.

478
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,400
Bro, so you mean

479
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,030
you want me to keep the tourists out?

480
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,680
You need to guide them a bit.

481
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,880
Just don't let them join the hype here.

482
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,480
Bro,

483
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,720
do you know how many job opportunities

484
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,640
this trend has brought us?

485
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,080
Car rentals,

486
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
food, accommodation, local specialties.

487
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,750
Our people

488
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,310
have truly made money from this.

489
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,210
I'll be honest with you,

490
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,640
we've even put ads on TV

491
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,970
to promote
cultural tourism in our Baliu District.

492
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,000
But the effect

493
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,080
is far less than this wave
of real and fake Zi Mausoleum hype.

494
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,400
If you ask me,

495
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,690
I should really thank you guys.

496
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,000
What do you mean?

497
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,110
You mean you want this trend

498
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,920
to continue?

499
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,590
Of course.

500
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,830
What if it attracts tomb raiders?

501
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,510
I'm an academic.

502
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,240
I don't understand economics.

503
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,510
But I absolutely won't allow

504
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,710
any archaeological project
I've worked on to be damaged.

505
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,600
Come on.

506
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,180
Have some water first.

507
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,590
Bro.

508
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,110
Take it.

509
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,160
Kun.

510
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,770
Do you know what all these are?

511
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,640
Take a look.

512
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,320
Cultural tourism project proposals, right?

513
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,000
Business plans.

514
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,270
We're also planning
to set up a development zone here.

515
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,550
These are all cultural tourism projects

516
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,210
that approached us
over the past couple of days.

517
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,620
How long has this trend been going on?

518
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,290
Just these few days,

519
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,310
and we've almost completed

520
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,480
our annual cultural
tourism investment plan.

521
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,650
Think about it,

522
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,090
what is this?

523
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,160
This is all money.

524
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,780
What's lacking in our
cultural preservation work now?

525
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,540
It's money,

526
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,320
isn't it?

527
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,300
If we have economic benefits,

528
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,200
we'll have social benefits too.

529
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,240
Are you still worried
about the cultural preservation work

530
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,570
not being implemented?

531
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,400
Bro,

532
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,960
you can put your mind at ease.

533
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,960
I'll report to our superiors soon.

534
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,830
Once we have the money,

535
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,480
our cultural preservation work
will be approved in no time.

536
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:03,980
Right?

537
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,280
You go back and wait for news first.

538
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,740
Okay?

539
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,830
I have another meeting soon.

540
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,090
I won't keep you today.

541
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,150
Don't worry.

542
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,700
Heizui.

543
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,030
What did you see?

544
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,960
What's going on?

545
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,480
Where is it?

546
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,000
What did you see?

547
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,730
Heizui.

548
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,510
Heizui, what did you see?

549
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,130
No one is there.

550
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,050
Hey, uncle, what's wrong?

551
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,160
Heizui has been barking wildly here.

552
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,030
Something seems off.

553
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,590
I'm on my way back from the district.

554
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,400
I'll tell Lu

555
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,920
to go patrol with you.

556
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,680
Okay, okay, okay.

557
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,540
I'll wait then.

558
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,890
I'll walk around with Heizui first

559
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,070
to see what's going on.

560
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,530
Come on, come on, this way.

561
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,750
Let's go.

562
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,750
Who's that? Who? Who?

563
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,680
Who?

564
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,200
The password, quick, say the password!

565
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,460
Beef and mutton paomo.

566
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,150
Spicy garlic lamb blood.

567
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,240
Kun.

568
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,920
You scared us.

569
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,370
Any situation?

570
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,990
We patrolled around,

571
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
but didn't find anything unusual.

572
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,400
I have some information.

573
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,750
The Cultural Relics Management Office
said they'd come patrol together,

574
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,480
but not a single one showed up.

575
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,610
Not one of them came?

576
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,550
They're fattening the fat

577
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,110
and squeezing the lean.

578
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,310
The Du Mausoleum and Phoenix Mountain
are like their own children,

579
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,720
while this big tomb in Yin Village
isn't their own kid.

580
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,380
Alright, uncle, don't worry.

581
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,680
It's like this,

582
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,480
I'll go to the Cultural Relics Management
Office to talk to their director

583
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,400
and see what's going on.

584
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,730
Okay.

585
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,190
Mr. Lu,

586
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,440
thank you for your hard work tonight.

587
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
Keep Uncle Shoucun company.

588
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,250
Alright.

589
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:55,920
Be careful.

590
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,590
Okay, okay.

591
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,280
Alright.

592
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,460
You be careful too.

593
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,310
Heizui.

594
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,240
Let's go, let's go.

595
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,770
Let's go.

596
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,630
Shoucun called you to find someone, right?

597
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,600
Mr. Fang.

598
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,830
As you can see,

599
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,550
I'm the only one left here.

600
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,590
I'm about to go support
the Du Mausoleum in a bit.

601
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,920
Our people

602
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,640
are like head-bobbing chickens,

603
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,400
always darting around, never idle.

604
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,720
What can we do?

605
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,160
Look, since I came in,

606
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:33,910
until now,

607
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,910
have I said anything about needing people?

608
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,920
I know it's difficult for you too.

609
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,310
Today, we originally arranged
for Chen to go to Yin Village.

610
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,440
But Phoenix Mountain was short-staffed.

611
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,920
They all went to help there.

612
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,170
Only Section Chief Wu

613
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,720
and another comrade are left
to guard the Du Mausoleum.

614
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,680
Here's the case.

615
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,160
In the next few days,

616
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,200
I'll keep holding on with

617
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,660
our archaeological team.

618
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,520
Is that okay?

619
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,200
But for this matter,

620
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,330
you need to think of a way to help me out.

621
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,640
Mr. Fang,

622
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,080
I actually have a solution.

623
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,370
But only you can make it happen.

624
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,830
Go on.

625
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,440
The grand tomb in Yin Village,

626
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,070
it's unidentified and unclaimed.

627
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,470
Naturally, we can't allocate people to it.

628
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,640
However, if you can prove

629
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
its historical and cultural value,

630
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,200
clarify the identity of the tomb owner,

631
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,600
and turn it into a cultural heritage site,

632
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,210
then cultural protection resources
will naturally be allocated.

633
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,410
Do you understand?

634
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,640
Director Zhang,

635
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,790
here's the case.

636
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
In our Yin Village,

637
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,960
the current situation
of cultural heritage protection

638
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,890
is quite severe.

639
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,790
Can we think of a way

640
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,610
to increase the funding or something,

641
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,070
like adding some security positions?

642
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,210
What do you think?

643
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,170
There's no need for that anymore.

644
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:54,880
Why?

645
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,440
Our excavation plan has been rejected.

646
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,770
What?

647
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,160
Why is that?

648
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,160
Why? Why?

649
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,070
Why so many "whys"?

650
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,550
Because the higher-ups think

651
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,400
we don't have experience
in excavating large tombs.

652
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,790
Because the recent public opinion

653
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,850
is not in our favor.

654
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,590
Because we are now

655
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,030
already facing skepticism
from the academic community.

656
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,740
They won't let us
excavate because we lack experience.

657
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,350
If we don't excavate,
we'll never gain experience.

658
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,680
Isn't this just an endless vicious cycle?

659
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,840
A life given at birth,

660
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,120
a scale nailed in place.

661
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,400
We

662
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,580
just have to accept this fate.

663
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,790
Fang.

664
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,180
Let's pull back.

665
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,800
Mr. Zhao.

666
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,310
Mr. Mu.

667
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,590
Youre' here.

668
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:18,880
I'm here.

669
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,700
Please, have a seat.

670
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,230
Alright.

671
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,000
I

672
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,240
am very seriously

673
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,160
studying your monograph.

674
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,770
You've become
quite impressive now, haven't you?

675
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,430
You've even become an author.

676
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,240
What author?

677
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,070
I just scribbled it down.

678
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,240
You've written this well.

679
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,100
Look at what you've
written here.

680
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,720
The expressive and
exaggerated artistic style

681
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,270
of Han dynasty pottery figurines
was closely linked

682
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,030
to a combination of factors,
including the political culture

683
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,510
and aesthetic consciousness of the time.

684
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,440
It embodies
unique national characteristics

685
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
and cultural connotations,

686
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,070
reflecting ancient Chinese
philosophical thoughts.

687
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,470
To be honest with you,

688
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,090
I recognize all these words,

689
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,550
but I don't understand
any of their meanings.

690
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,750
I just don't understand

691
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,010
why you intellectuals

692
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,110
can't just call a hen a hen.

693
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,440
Why insist on calling it a rooster's wife?

694
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,120
I just said I scribbled it down.

695
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,550
You see,

696
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,330
if it weren't for those friends
at the publishing house

697
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,310
exaggerating and praising,

698
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,440
I wouldn't dare to show such timidity.

699
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,790
Let's talk about the main issue.

700
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,320
Mr. Zhao,

701
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,750
I'm here today to congratulate you.

702
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,780
Congratulate?

703
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,720
What's there to congratulate?

704
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,110
You're now

705
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,960
the president
of our Qinchuan Antique Association.

706
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,990
Of course, I should congratulate you.

707
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,240
What's that all about?

708
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,440
I can't compare to you in this.

709
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,310
I, I just can't compare.

710
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,240
I don't understand any of this.

711
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,830
But let me tell you,

712
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,830
this book of yours

713
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,170
is really good.

714
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,510
I plan to get some more

715
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,400
and bring them to the association

716
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,240
to let those folks study it well.

717
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,460
If you're going to
publish another edition,

718
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,640
I'll ask Qin

719
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,640
to write a postscript for you.

720
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm flattered.

721
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,880
This is a lousy book.

722
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,730
How could I trouble Qin with it?

723
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,030
A nobody like me

724
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,480
should just mind my own business.

725
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,310
You're just being too modest.

726
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,090
But that's good.

727
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,200
Modesty

728
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,020
leads to progress,

729
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,810
right?

730
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,560
We're all ordinary people.

731
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,300
What's the use of being arrogant?

732
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,000
Nothing good comes from human arrogance.

733
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,750
A dog's arrogance is just a pile of shit.

734
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,080
For us ordinary people,

735
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,240
the most important thing
is to earn money honestly

736
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,830
and put it in our own pockets.

737
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,830
That's the truth.

738
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,120
Mr. Zhao, you're right.

739
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,590
Nothing's more real than money.

740
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,270
Recently,

741
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,910
that big tomb in Yin Village
has been quite a hype.

742
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,100
Who knows how many
troublemakers it'll attract.

743
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,000
What I mean is,

744
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,650
you shouldn't join in the commotion.

745
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,730
Your people have been
causing quite a stir there lately,

746
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,190
with all that bloodshed.

747
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,710
It's too conspicuous.

748
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,350
You're showing your hand too much.

749
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,480
A small-time player

750
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,920
should keep a low profile.

751
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,820
That's real strength.

752
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,020
Right?

753
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:15,900
Right.

754
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,150
I understand.

755
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,360
Mr. Zhao,

756
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,900
I'll take my leave now.

757
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,840
Alright.

758
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,350
I won't keep you for dinner.

759
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,720
Okay.

760
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,110
Okay.

761
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,590
See you later.

762
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,650
Alright, alright.

763
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,120
Get lost.

764
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
Let's pack up quickly.

765
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,350
A bunch of people have already left.

766
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,030
We've done everything we needed to do.

767
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,090
The rest

768
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,350
can't be solved by us.

769
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,360
Mr. Fang,

770
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,830
each to their own task.

771
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,570
As archaeologists,

772
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,320
we can't handle
cultural preservation matters.

773
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,590
Kun.

774
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,240
Master.

775
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,990
Are you really leaving?

776
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,120
Xiaoman,

777
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,750
the excavation plan has been rejected.

778
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,750
There's no point in us staying here.

779
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,780
But your technical skills
are already proficient.

780
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Although the work
in Yin Village has stopped,

781
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,510
if you still
want to continue in this field,

782
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,350
you can contact me anytime.

783
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,480
I'll help you find work at other sites.

784
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,470
Okay?

785
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:29,960
Kun.

786
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,730
Don't worry
about the big tomb in Yin Village.

787
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,880
The work at home isn't that busy.

788
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,880
I'll come to relieve
Uncle Shoucun whenever I'm free.

789
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,740
I don't believe

790
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,310
that with us here,

791
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,340
those thieves would dare to come.

792
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,930
Xiaoman,

793
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,150
you mustn't act recklessly.

794
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,720
Those thieves are armed.

795
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,240
Even grown men don't dare to get close.

796
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,590
Let alone a young girl like you.

797
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,190
Then what about Yin Village?

798
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,680
Heizui?

799
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,650
Why are you here?

800
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,250
Don't you want us to leave too?

801
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,860
Heizui,

802
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:18,950
come here.

803
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,310
What are you doing?

804
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,910
Come here.

805
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:22,970
Heizui,

806
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,980
you good-for-nothing.

807
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,310
What are you doing here?

808
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,440
How thick-skinned you are.

809
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,200
They're about to leave,

810
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,000
and you're still here.

811
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
Why are you clinging to them?

812
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,450
You know we're adopted, right?

813
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,590
Born to a stepmother.

814
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,830
Whether they care
about Yin Village or not, we don't care.

815
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,260
Let's go.

816
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,520
Let's patrol. Come on.

817
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,940
I'm not going anymore.

818
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:57,880
What?

819
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,320
I said I'm not going anymore.

820
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Did you get your head stuck in a door?

821
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,440
We're from the Archaeology Institute.

822
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,510
We're not cultural relic conservators.

823
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,270
You're giving up your job?

824
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:10,880
I quit.

825
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,110
Kun,

826
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,050
don't be hasty.

827
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,460
This...

828
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,090
This is our fate.

829
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,310
The great tomb of Yin Village is my life.

830
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,950
If the great tomb of Yin Village is gone,

831
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,300
what's the point
of doing archaeology anymore?

832
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,070
Up, up.

833
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:39,840
Good.

834
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,960
Go, up.

835
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,270
When you see a bad guy,
you gotta pounce, got it?

836
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,640
Come.

837
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,400
Up.

838
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,680
That's right.

839
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,900
Heizui, up.

840
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,130
Good.

841
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:53,510
Go.

842
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,160
Up.

843
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,030
Very good.

844
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,030
That's how you deal with bad guys.

845
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,640
Heizui.

846
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,710
Sit down.

847
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,740
Didn't your archaeological team all leave?

848
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,590
I missed you.

849
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,590
Just came to see you again.

850
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,830
Worried you might
get slack watching alone.

851
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,680
I came to help.

852
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,270
What kind of help are you offering me?

853
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,960
-Come on.
-What do you mean?

854
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,420
Heizui.

855
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,260
Come.

856
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
The Yin Village tomb
isn't just this piece of land,

857
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,800
right?

858
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,680
You can see other places too?

859
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,550
I don't care,
I just need to watch this area.

860
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,030
Your name is Yan Shoucun.

861
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,570
You're not called Yan Shoudi.

862
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,700
How can you just guard this small area?

863
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,310
Why are you changing my name?

864
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,240
You little brat.

865
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,600
Are you messing with me?

866
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,640
Alright, alright.

867
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
Anyway, I'm going to quit my job.

868
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,740
No matter what,
I'll squeeze in the shack with you.

869
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,510
I'll help you guard it together.

870
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:35,880
What?

871
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,480
You...

872
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,120
You want to live here?

873
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,400
Uncle.

874
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,840
Uncle.

875
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,680
Now, in the village,

876
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,960
only Uncle Shoucun is guarding it.

877
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,810
Anyway, I'm about to resign,

878
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,410
so now the two of us

879
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
are taking turns patrolling there.

880
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,270
But the area of the Yin Village great tomb

881
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,130
is really vast,

882
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,880
and we're short-handed.

883
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,880
Everyone listens to what you say.

884
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,720
Could you see if it's possible to organize
some cultural relic protection volunteers?

885
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,350
So we can all together

886
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,410
protect this Yin Village great tomb.

887
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,200
The matter of the great tomb or not

888
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,930
is the government's business.

889
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,450
What does it have to do with me?

890
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,750
Those buried beneath Yin Village

891
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,880
are also the ancestors
from Yin Village.

892
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,680
Isn't that so?

893
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,400
We can't just stand by and watch

894
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,680
outsiders desecrate our ancestors' graves...

895
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,880
I'm now a family member of a tomb raider.

896
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,210
The whole village knows it.

897
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,920
What face do I have left...

898
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,880
Uncle, no one considers you

899
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,680
a family member of a tomb raider.

900
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,110
The tongue is a sharp knife,

901
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,440
it kills without drawing blood.

902
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,350
Isn't it Lai who did this?

903
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,790
The villagers are all watching.

904
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,590
Our ancestors are watching too.

905
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,450
It's like I've got
a piss cloud over my head,

906
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,910
and the whole world's downwind.

907
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,360
I'll never smell good
again in this lifetime.

908
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,780
Kun,

909
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,530
this matter of yours,

910
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,469
I can't help you with it.

911
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,070
Cooking up some explosives.

912
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,600
It's about to suffocate me.

913
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,880
It won't kill you, bro.

914
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,230
You're digging stuff
out of a ghost's mouth.

915
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,600
Even ghosts couldn't kill you.

916
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,480
Ghosts couldn't kill me.

917
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,940
But the explosives might.

918
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,190
Your brother's
cooking up these explosives.

919
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,440
Not sure if the ratio is right.

920
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Let me take a look.

921
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,600
Let me take a look.
The ratio is good.

922
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,130
You're a man of great deeds.

923
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,990
What great deed am I up to?

924
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,680
Don't know if it'll explode or not.

925
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,420
Let's do it.

926
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,410
How is it?

927
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,150
"The thread in a loving mother's hand..."

928
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,630
"The thread in a loving mother's hand..."

929
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,290
"Becomes clothes
on her traveling child's back..."

930
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,360
"Becomes clothes
on her traveling child's back..."

931
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,230
This line means,

932
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,550
a mother

933
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,480
is mending clothes
for her child who's about to travel far.

934
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,030
"Before departure, she sews with care..."

935
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,230
"Before departure, she sews with care..."

936
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,190
"Fearing the child's late return."

937
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,320
Is Yan Xiaowu your father?

938
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,040
I don't have a father.

939
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,230
Guang.

940
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:24,880
Brother.

941
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,970
Did you bring all the books?

942
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:26,510
I brought them all.

943
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:26,930
Good.

944
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,230
[Children's Extracurricular Reading]

945
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,320
Let's go, move them in.

946
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,850
Brother,

947
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,750
I have something to tell you.

948
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,960
What is it?

949
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,250
Do you know who's come to Qinchuan?

950
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:36,840
Who?

951
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,010
King Hua.

952
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,100
I think he's after

953
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,760
the big tomb in Yin Village.

954
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
He's been hanging around there these days.

955
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,450
We've taken all the goods in Qinchuan.

956
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,960
He used to be a tiger,
now he's barely a scrawny stray.

957
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,400
There's a big haul this time.

958
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,580
It's understandable
that he wants a piece of the pie.

959
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,090
But I do admire him.

960
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,570
He's been pushed out of Qinchuan,

961
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,660
yet he dares to come back for food.

962
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,570
He must have some backing.

963
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,590
How so?

964
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,460
I saw him meeting with Xiao.

965
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,410
No wonder Zhao Youlin is holding me back.

966
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,370
So he went to seek out a powerful backer.

967
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The only question is, can his backer

968
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,110
keep me in check?

969
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,330
Brother,

970
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,020
I plan to beat him to it.

971
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,830
Forget it.

972
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,720
He's come from so far away.

973
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,030
We can't let him
go back empty-handed. Let him have it.

974
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,560
Brother.

975
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,280
Guang,

976
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,380
Wen Wen is about to give birth, right?

977
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,520
Soon.

978
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,230
How's her health?

979
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,540
Her health is good.

980
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,710
It's just that
her temper is getting weirder.

981
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,920
I didn't do anything.

982
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,810
She just mopes around all day.

983
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,730
Spend more time with her at this time.

984
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,590
Don't go down the pit anymore.

985
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,120
Brother,

986
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,600
I was thinking

987
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,630
of asking you for a favor.

988
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,580
What favor?

989
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,010
Name the baby for me.

990
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,110
Otherwise, we won't know
what to call it when it's born.

991
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,570
I'll think about it later.

992
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,960
Okay.

993
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,200
Who is it?

994
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,230
You two are cut from the same cloth.

995
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,890
How can you not recognize him?

996
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,670
Your kid is quite a smart one.

997
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,050
He just won
first place in the Math Olympiad.

998
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,000
Impressive.

999
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,690
Do you remember what grade he's in?

1000
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,890
He's in middle school now, right?

1001
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,600
So you know that.

1002
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,150
You, as a father,

1003
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,220
you're in here,

1004
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,650
and you've got it easy.

1005
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,480
There's a mess of trouble outside,

1006
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,910
left for his mother and him to deal with.

1007
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,570
Do you know how
the children of criminals live?

1008
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,300
They carry

1009
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,170
a mountain on their backs.

1010
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,280
Some can't bear it

1011
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,400
and follow in
their parents' criminal footsteps.

1012
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
They either steal or rob.

1013
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,450
Of course, some

1014
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,960
are self-reliant and strong.

1015
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,120
They swallow their pain and keep going.

1016
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Your kid belongs to the second type.

1017
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,650
To be honest, I'm a father too.

1018
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,280
My kid

1019
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,270
doesn't compare to yours.

1020
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,640
Let me tell you something else.

1021
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,570
The other day, I asked your kid,

1022
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,280
"Bao,

1023
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,200
do you hate your father?"

1024
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,730
Guess what he said?

1025
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,610
He didn't say anything.

1026
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
He nodded slightly at first,

1027
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,990
then shook his head vigorously.

1028
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,920
His eyes were full of tears,

1029
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,400
biting his lip hard

1030
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,460
to keep them from falling.

1031
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,190
You have such a good kid.

1032
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,290
What should you do?

1033
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,130
I don't need to tell you.

1034
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,130
Brother,

1035
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,710
why did you bring back
the remaining half bag?

1036
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,800
Chefs need to taste
their dishes, you know.

1037
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,550
Just checking if the flavor is right.

1038
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,250
Your skills

1039
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,210
are definitely not a problem.

1040
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,860
No problem.

1041
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,790
It's lined up, right?

1042
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,520
Which one goes where?

1043
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,830
It should be correct.

1044
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:19,750
Ready.

1045
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,510
What's wrong, brother?

1046
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,110
Didn't you say I was capable?

1047
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,480
What's wrong? Don't you believe me?

1048
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,660
It's not that. I just see you
always carrying that little notebook.

1049
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,840
It must be very precise.

1050
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,590
If you think it's precise,

1051
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,720
why do you need this?

1052
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,310
If we die, we die together.

1053
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,690
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.

1054
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,390
Get ready.
