[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,900
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:40,590
Wen Wen, I know you're angry.

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,810
How can you feel better now?

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,450
Do whatever you need to.

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,509
If it helps ease your pain even a little,

7
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,240
y-you can do whatever you want.

8
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,410
You...

9
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,520
You can even stab me if it helps.

10
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,820
Really.

11
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,590
Liu Shusheng,

12
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,010
you'll be a father someday.

13
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,350
If someone hurt your daughter,

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,120
could you just swallow that anger?

15
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Wen Wen, I deserve a thousand deaths.

16
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,060
Even being torn apart wouldn't be enough
to make up for what I've done.

17
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,940
But please give me a chance.

18
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,040
I'll be your slave
if that's what it takes.

19
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,650
Please forgive me.

20
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,540
I...

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,360
Get out!

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,940
Get out now!

23
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,220
If he weren't Shulan's brother,

24
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,110
I'd skin him alive myself.

25
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,800
Wen Wen,

26
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,310
it's alright if hatred doesn't fade

27
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,250
right away.

28
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,020
But don't stoop to a bastard's level.

29
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,080
At least,

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,480
Liu Shusheng and his wife

31
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,880
will never speak of it again.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,410
Let's just pretend it never happened.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,430
Okay?

34
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,960
Pretend it never happened?

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,060
Is that even possible?

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
What do you want to do?

37
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,700
It's...

38
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,810
weighing on my chest,

39
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
I can barely breathe.

40
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,310
Let me tell Guang the truth.

41
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:35,970
No way.

42
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,500
You know what kind of person Guang is.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,840
If he finds out we were set up,

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,730
he'll be ready to kill someone.

45
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,860
Wen Wen,

46
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,079
listen to me.

47
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,090
Keep this secret forever.

48
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,250
No matter how hard it gets,

49
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,079
don't let a single word slip out.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
Then how can I face Guang?

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,870
Or you can help me leave.

52
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,870
Honestly,

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,180
I know how much pain you're in.

54
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,150
If it was just between us,

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,440
I'd help you leave right now.

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,480
But Wen Wen,

57
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,110
we have to think about Guang.

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,330
What will he do if you leave?

59
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,870
With no parents,

60
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,300
he's been struggling for half his life.

61
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,840
Now that he's found you,

62
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,070
he's finally seeing hope.

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,480
If you leave,

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,650
you'll shatter his chance
at happiness forever.

65
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,110
We can't throw away

66
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,990
what we've built
just for the sake of some bastard.

67
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,920
Life is

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,750
full of obstacles,

69
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,870
but once you overcome them, it's done.

70
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,000
Life moves forward.

71
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,110
Everyone.

72
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,600
Everyone.

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,310
Today, we're holding a Cultural Relics

74
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,640
Protection Law Awareness Campaign
at the Baliu District village committee.

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,330
Let's go.

76
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,530
You're the Chief

77
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,480
and also related to those involved,

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,270
so you should be the first to attend.

79
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,000
Since it's their first offense

80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,070
and most of what they found
were just broken tiles,

81
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,560
the offense is relatively minor,

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,220
but it's still a criminal act,

83
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,270
a violation of criminal law.

84
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,600
With so many people, I can't make it.

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,270
Where are you going?

86
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,270
Just go in and hear what they have to say.

87
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,190
-We're just here to raise awareness...
-Hurry up.

88
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,940
About the Cultural Relics Protection Law.

89
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,480
I know.

90
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,960
Everyone's probably thinking,

91
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,310
"I was digging on my own land.

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,430
Why should I go to jail?"

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,070
So,

94
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,310
I've invited Captain Yang Qingshi

95
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,630
[Baliu District Cultural Relics
Protection Law Awareness Campaign]

96
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,430
from the Qinchuan Relics
Inspection Team to join us.

97
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,360
Captain Yang will answer your questions

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,790
and explain

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,950
the Cultural Relics Protection Law
to everyone.

100
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,610
Let's give him a warm welcome!

101
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,800
Hello everyone, I'm Yang Qingshi.

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,650
According to

103
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,750
the Cultural Relics Protection Law
of the People's Republic of China,

104
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,880
any cultural relics

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,250
found within the national territory—

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,630
whether

107
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,870
underground,

108
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,770
underwater,

109
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,430
or in the sea—

110
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,120
are considered

111
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,270
national

112
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,830
cultural relics

113
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,800
and are owned by the state.

114
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,860
Failing to turn in discovered relics

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
is considered

116
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,170
an illegal act.

117
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,720
Moreover, unauthorized excavation
is a criminal offense

118
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,250
and will be subject
to criminal prosecution.

119
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,100
This is unfair!

120
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,210
You're wronging me!

121
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,630
Let everyone judge for themselves.

122
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,070
We just dug up
a few broken bricks and tiles

123
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,950
from our own yard and field.

124
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,480
Right?

125
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
On what grounds

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
are you sending me to jail?

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,240
Right?

128
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,950
How am I supposed
to live alone with my child?

129
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,340
Just keep yelling.

130
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,960
Go on, keep yelling.

131
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,780
You're really shameless.

132
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,430
What's happened to our Yin Village?

133
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,030
How did we end up
with these few scoundrels?

134
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,320
This time it's my fault.

135
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,050
I'm to blame.

136
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,920
I've brought a few thieving brats
into our village.

137
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,380
I admit it; I'm shameless.

138
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,690
Yin Village has endured

139
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,000
for millennia,
unbroken through every generation.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,260
What have we relied on?

141
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,480
We've relied on every household being

142
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,810
honest, kind, resilient, and steadfast.

143
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,270
One thing we've never tolerated is deceit.

144
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,190
I used to believe

145
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,120
every village has its black sheep.

146
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
As long as they don't go too far,

147
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,180
I'll just let it slide.

148
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,360
But if anyone drags
our village's reputation

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,600
through the dirt,

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,190
disgracing our ancestors,

151
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,480
I...

152
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,990
I won't let them get away with it!

153
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,580
It's hard to mend a broken mirror.

154
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,350
It's all your fault.

155
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,840
If you hadn't recruited Lai
into the team back then,

156
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,870
he wouldn't have had such thoughts.

157
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,550
What's the point
of bringing up old issues now?

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,430
If I'm not welcome here,

159
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,960
I'll find a place where I am.

160
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,410
I know a place where we can stay.

161
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,180
Come on.

162
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,920
How is it?

163
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,610
That's truly a pastoral way of life,
living in harmony with nature.

164
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,340
Just tell me.

165
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,320
Is there anything
that doesn't meet your expectations?

166
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,850
It's just the environment.

167
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,360
There are no outsiders anyway.

168
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,909
It's just for
our archaeological team to stay.

169
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,630
The rent is even half the price.

170
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,360
Lu sure knows how to calculate.

171
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,350
Hurry up, pack your bags.

172
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,179
First come, first served.

173
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,380
Choose your own room.

174
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,150
Ms. Luo Qing,

175
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,440
are you giving the ancient tomb a massage?

176
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,510
You're so gentle.

177
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,790
Isn't the progress on M2 too slow?

178
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,390
Compared to when I first came,

179
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,320
it seems like nothing has changed.

180
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,290
Captain Qi,

181
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,810
do you see these large stones?

182
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,670
At this stage,

183
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,720
the soil layer isn't just pebbles;

184
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
it's full of these ginger-shaped stones.

185
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
They are very hard to dig through.

186
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,120
We have to use small shovels
to scrape bit by bit like this.

187
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,050
How could the progress not be slow?

188
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,670
Why is Captain Qi always in such a hurry?

189
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320
If M2 isn't excavated soon,

190
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,180
he won't be able to close his case.

191
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,390
Even a snail could do your job faster.

192
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,970
Jianhui.

193
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,760
What are you doing here?

194
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,810
I hitched a ride to visit my sister.

195
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,130
If you have something to say, just say it.

196
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,150
I... I was wrong, and that's that.

197
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,350
I have nothing to say.

198
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,150
I fell and hurt my leg myself.

199
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,750
It has nothing to do with you.

200
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,080
Jianhui,

201
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,320
rest assured.

202
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
From now on,

203
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,000
if you point south, I'll never go north.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,750
I'll follow you wholeheartedly.

205
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,670
Don't make me sick with your sappy words.

206
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,390
Let's talk about the future later.

207
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,150
If you're determined
to turn your back on money,

208
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,550
there's nothing I can do.

209
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,240
I'm not stupid.

210
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,890
Money's like a father to me.

211
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,350
How could I possibly turn my back on it?

212
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,140
Come on, give it to me.

213
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,630
Shulan.

214
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,670
Open the door.

215
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,880
We brought you a blanket.

216
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,910
It's too cold.

217
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,970
Don't catch a cold.

218
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,090
Sister.

219
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,650
Sister, open the door.

220
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,340
Sister, open the door.

221
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,670
Jianhui came from so far away.

222
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,130
Why don't you let him go in
and sit for a while?

223
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,500
Oh, my dear sister,

224
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,780
can't the two of you
talk things through calmly?

225
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,890
Why have you become so quick to anger?

226
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,030
Have you forgotten the hardships you faced

227
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,720
when you lived in the South Market?

228
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,360
Who was the one
brewing medicine for you day after day?

229
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,870
Now that your life is better,

230
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,270
you can't forget his kindness, can you?

231
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,840
Sheng.

232
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,200
Stop provoking your sister.

233
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,000
Stay out of it.

234
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,410
We can't act like this, can we?

235
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,490
Open the door, Sis.

236
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,170
Still so stubborn.

237
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,940
Well, Jianhui.

238
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,350
Go back first.

239
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,700
Go back.

240
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,910
If my sister won't open the door,

241
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,170
I'll sleep right here.

242
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,240
I don't believe

243
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,040
she'd let her own brother
freeze to death outside.

244
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,670
Jianhui,

245
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,690
don't worry.

246
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,750
I'll make sure

247
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,350
she covers herself
with this blanket tonight.

248
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Now that's how a brother should act.

249
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
I'm heading back.

250
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,910
Alright, my dear sister.

251
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,670
Guang.

252
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,040
Brother?

253
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,960
Why are you here?

254
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,610
I've been waiting for you.

255
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,240
Guang,

256
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,670
you've been gone for so many days.

257
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,630
You and the others must have suffered.

258
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,270
Not at all.

259
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,750
It's just that all our efforts
were in vain.

260
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,080
We didn't get anything.

261
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,250
Brother,

262
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,120
why don't you find another tomb

263
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,200
for us to work on?

264
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Forget it.

265
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,400
Take a break.

266
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,120
You should think carefully
about your own business.

267
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,510
Me?

268
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,270
What business of mine?

269
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,070
You know what I'm talking about.

270
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,150
You've already taken your wedding photos.

271
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,880
How much longer
are you going to make Wen Wen wait?

272
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,870
Actually,

273
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,080
I wanted to tell you earlier.

274
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,740
Marriage is a big deal.

275
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,520
They say you should
listen to your parents.

276
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,110
I don't have parents,

277
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,360
but I have you, Brother.

278
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,710
So I'll listen to you.

279
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,940
Then listen up,

280
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,050
go get your marriage certificate.

281
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,050
I even checked the almanac for you.

282
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,480
Tomorrow's a lucky day.

283
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,920
Alright,

284
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,520
tomorrow it is then.

285
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,090
Here's some money.

286
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,530
Half is for the others.

287
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,150
Don't let them come for nothing.
Give them some compensation.

288
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,090
The other half is for you and Wen Wen.

289
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,840
I don't want it.

290
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
I... I have money.

291
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,370
The money you have is yours.

292
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,880
This is my goodwill.

293
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,050
What?

294
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,130
You don't take me
as your brother seriously?

295
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,090
Take it.

296
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,180
Wen Wen.

297
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,880
You're back.

298
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,540
What are you doing?

299
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,000
I missed you so much.

300
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,080
What?

301
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,130
You must have lost weight.

302
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,830
No, I haven't.

303
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,320
I've just been missing you.

304
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,600
Is it because you're not eating well

305
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,860
at my brother's place?

306
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,480
No. Let's dig in.

307
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,770
Wait, I have something to tell you.

308
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,630
I want to tell you,

309
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,750
tomorrow,

310
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,390
let's

311
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,880
just go get our marriage certificate.

312
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,390
Why so sudden?

313
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,240
My brother said
tomorrow is an auspicious day.

314
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,960
I thought,

315
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,670
since we're going to get it
sooner or later anyway,

316
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,390
let's just

317
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,380
get our certificate tomorrow
on this lucky day.

318
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,170
Sounds good?

319
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,440
Yes.

320
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,550
Let's dig in.

321
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,300
It's getting cold.

322
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,210
I'm sorry.
I forgot to change my shoes again.

323
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,270
Professor Xiang,

324
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,160
you've been working so hard.

325
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,100
Well,

326
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,390
you've been messing with the tomb so much;

327
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,190
it's all worn down and shiny now.

328
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,600
Why don't we use some machinery?

329
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,150
I can contact the fire department.

330
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,670
Manual clearing is just too slow.

331
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,630
If we use machinery,

332
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,740
we might accidentally
damage these artifacts.

333
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,960
Can we still call that
protective excavation?

334
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,440
I'm not talking about large excavators
or anything like that,

335
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,560
just small ones.

336
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:54,930
Captain Qi,

337
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,510
we've considered all the situations
you mentioned.

338
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,000
The Lv Family Tomb

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,150
has drawn a lot of attention
from the public—

340
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,030
not just from senior experts in our field,

341
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,150
but also from many descendants
of the Lv family.

342
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,610
We need to do right by them.

343
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,550
So in our work,

344
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,360
we must be very careful.

345
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,690
I understand. I'm fully aware of all this.

346
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,150
It's not that I'm impatient.

347
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,090
I'm really anxious.

348
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,020
I'm almost going crazy with anxiety.

349
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,200
Captain Qi,

350
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,770
we know you're anxious.

351
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,360
Look at all of us, who isn't anxious?

352
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,510
Yesterday, we cleared out Tomb No. 3,

353
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,270
and it turned out to be
another empty tomb.

354
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,000
There's a bunch of mysteries
we can't solve.

355
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,200
Was it looted
or is it a multi-layered tomb?

356
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
It wasn't looted,

357
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,030
and it's not a multi-layered tomb either.

358
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,690
It's just a simple empty tomb.

359
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,580
No burial objects, no human bones,
nothing.

360
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,960
Ms. Luo, Ms. Xiang,

361
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,510
you should go take a look.

362
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,870
There's a problem over there.

363
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,960
Some descendants of the Lv family
came and said

364
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,750
we can't dig up their ancestor's tomb.

365
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,350
They want us to stop the work.

366
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,410
Why are they here again?

367
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,630
Hadn't Lv Fugui

368
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,980
already been persuaded?

369
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,480
It's not him.

370
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,910
It's not the Lv descendants
from Lvjia Village;

371
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,109
it's the Lv descendants from the south.

372
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,349
We're not overreacting.

373
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,410
This is our ancestral tomb.

374
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,440
Shouldn't you consult us before digging?

375
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,280
You can't dig it.

376
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,829
Absolutely no digging is allowed.

377
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,790
What's going on?

378
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,319
This is our ancestral tomb.

379
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:18,880
I...

380
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,819
Police!

381
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,510
Police!

382
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,680
Tell me what's happening.

383
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,640
Don't make trouble.

384
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,970
Speak slowly, one at a time.

385
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
We are descendants of the Lv family.

386
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,880
Our ancestral tomb is about to be dug up.

387
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,720
Don't we have the right to question that?

388
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,640
That's right.

389
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,470
The Lv family

390
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,240
has lived for generations

391
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
in Lvjia Village.

392
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,480
They are from the Guanzhong region.

393
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,030
You need to identify the right branch
when tracing your ancestry.

394
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,430
We really are descendants
of the Lv family.

395
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
It's just that our ancestors

396
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,040
moved to Lingnan very early on.

397
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,790
This is our family genealogy.

398
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,030
It's clearly recorded here that

399
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,480
we are descendants of Lv Jingshan.

400
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,550
Calm down.

401
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,590
Lv Jingshan, son of Lv Dafang.

402
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,270
Exactly.

403
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,560
How do you know that?

404
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,990
Hello, I'm Luo Qing.

405
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,390
I'm the main person in charge

406
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,920
of this archaeological excavation.

407
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,350
Lv Dafang was once banished
to the Lingnan area.

408
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,440
He died on the way.

409
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,550
I guess one branch of his family
stayed in Lingnan.

410
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,110
Thank you so much.

411
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,930
Finally, someone knows our origins.

412
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,240
Yeah.

413
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,720
We've been settled in Lingnan
for over a thousand years.

414
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
Right? Over a thousand years.

415
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Fugui, over here.

416
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm from the Lv family.

417
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,210
I'm from the Lv family.

418
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,800
Fugui.

419
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,670
You must be

420
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,640
relatives from Lingnan.

421
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Yes.

422
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,120
Alright, let me tell you.

423
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm a descendant of the Lv family
from Qinchuan.

424
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,300
My name is Lv Fugui.

425
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,680
Fugui.

426
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,640
Hello.

427
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
Wait, how did you find your way here?

428
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,400
Fugui, it's a long story.

429
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,060
We've been tracing our roots
for quite some time.

430
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,130
After our ancestor, Jingshan,
settled in Lingnan,

431
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,590
his descendants also compiled
a family genealogy.

432
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,850
There's a phrase in it:

433
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,440
Lv family, Weishui Hall.

434
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,770
What does that mean?

435
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,570
Hall...

436
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,080
"Hall" refers to the family lineage name.

437
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,720
In the old days, people
with the same surname often lived together

438
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
for generations,

439
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,930
so the hall name

440
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,600
became a symbol of their shared identity.

441
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,040
Weishui Hall.

442
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,790
This means

443
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,430
this branch of the family

444
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,350
is of the same lineage
as the Lv family from Weishui.

445
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,550
Yeah.

446
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,720
Thirty years ago,

447
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,240
our clan leader

448
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,850
took that phrase seriously

449
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,440
and went north to the Guanzhong region
to trace our roots.

450
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,030
But communication wasn't as smooth
back then,

451
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,550
so he couldn't find anything.

452
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,960
This time, it's because

453
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,720
the archaeological excavation
of the Lv Family Tomb made the news.

454
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,680
That's how we found Lvjia Village.

455
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,720
I see.

456
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,110
Well,

457
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,610
you can ask us any questions you have.

458
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,050
Our archaeological work this time
is legal and compliant.

459
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,350
However, we will try our best to

460
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,440
accommodate the wishes
of the Lv family descendants.

461
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,340
Thank you.

462
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,550
We're not here to cause trouble.

463
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,270
We also support

464
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,780
the national archaeological excavation
of ancestral tombs.

465
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,230
But,

466
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,680
we also want to take this opportunity
to pay respects to our ancestors,

467
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,640
especially Lv Dafang
from our branch of the family.

468
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,400
Can we see his tomb?

469
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,030
Well, here's the current situation.

470
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,470
We haven't yet identified

471
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,510
which one is Lv Dafang's tomb.

472
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,440
So it might be...

473
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:36,950
Right.

474
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,310
And according to your family genealogy,

475
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,930
isn't Lv Dafang's tomb

476
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
recorded to be in the Lingnan area?

477
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
The tomb in Lingnan

478
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,090
was built during the Ming Dynasty.

479
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,520
According to our family elders,

480
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,160
after Lv Dafang was demoted to Lingnan,

481
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,420
he died of depression.

482
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,160
His elder brother pleaded for him,

483
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,350
and the Emperor finally agreed
to let Dafang be buried in his hometown.

484
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,240
However, because of the long journey
and the heat at that time,

485
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,750
they could only leave the remains behind
and bring back his clothes.

486
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,480
So you're saying

487
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,590
that Lv Dafang's tomb in Lvjia Village

488
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,680
is actually a cenotaph?

489
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,550
Yes, that's right.

490
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,680
Is there an epitaph?

491
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,070
I'm not sure about that.

492
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,440
I only know what the family elders
have said,

493
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,110
that the funeral at that time
was very simple.

494
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,270
Mrs. Zan,

495
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,270
I know

496
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,480
who the M3 is.

497
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,030
Easy come, easy gain.

498
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,200
See? The mystery is solved, isn't it?

499
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,030
Fugui,

500
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,310
take our guests from Lingnan

501
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,630
to M3, will you?

502
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,690
No problem.

503
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,510
We'd like to take a look.

504
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,440
Wait, Mrs. Zan,

505
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,270
shouldn't we investigate further?

506
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,730
After all, we haven't
confirmed it 100% yet.

507
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,560
For us, it's just academic,

508
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,000
but for them, it's their ancestor.

509
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,980
They've come from so far away

510
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,480
just to pay respects to their ancestor.

511
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,750
They want to see

512
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,960
if we've been treating
their ancestral heritage well.

513
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,220
It's for peace of mind.

514
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,210
Captain Qi,

515
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,110
what do you think?

516
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,060
Professor Xiang, it's your call
on this matter.

517
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,070
Go ahead then.

518
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,540
Dear ancestor,

519
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,510
your descendants have come to see you.

520
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,260
Dear ancestor,

521
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,790
my brother here

522
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,890
has traveled over a thousand miles

523
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,550
to finally pay respects to his ancestor.

524
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,070
Ms. Luo,

525
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,110
Ms. Xiang,

526
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,450
I heard from Fugui

527
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,510
that you're going to help us
build a family temple.

528
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,590
On behalf of our clan members
from Lingnan,

529
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,850
I sincerely thank you.

530
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,270
This is our

531
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
family genealogy

532
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,480
and some photos
of the Lv family from Lingnan,

533
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
plus some pictures of the cemetery.

534
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,620
I'm giving all of these to you.

535
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,110
I hope they can be of help.

536
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,270
They certainly will.

537
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,550
This is invaluable to us.

538
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,300
[Guyue Lv Family's Genealogy]

539
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,400
It provides important clues

540
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,440
for our research
on the Lv family's direct lineage.

541
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,160
Thank you so much.

542
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,550
It's part of our duty.

543
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,800
Today, I'd like to formally invite
your archaeological team

544
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,300
and the relatives from Lvjia Village

545
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,100
to Lingnan

546
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,720
to attend our Lv family
ancestral worship ceremony.

547
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,050
Sure.

548
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,400
I'll definitely attend.

549
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,430
Thank you.

550
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,530
Thank you.

551
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,040
Mr. Fang.

552
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,050
Mr. Guo,

553
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,460
look.

554
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,510
Let's go help out.

555
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
She's a tough one.

556
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,290
Just don't embarrass her.

557
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,440
Uncle Youliang hasn't been around
for a while.

558
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,570
I wonder how their family is doing now.

559
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,720
Uncle Youliang is a tough man.

560
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Because of what happened with Lai,

561
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,920
his reputation has been nearly ruined.

562
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,450
We should

563
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,170
just stay out of it.

564
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,350
Let's get to work.

565
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,050
Bring some alcohol.

566
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,840
Don't drink anymore.

567
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,090
Your body hasn't fully recovered yet.

568
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,250
Let your father have a sip.

569
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,060
He can't sleep through the night now.

570
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,030
His body collapses
whether he's sitting or lying down.

571
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,160
He can't even sit up.

572
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,270
Have a couple of sips.

573
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,470
It'll help him relax.

574
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,830
Come on.

575
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,200
Xiuheng.

576
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,340
Come on.

577
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,520
Xiuheng is very well-behaved.

578
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,160
Liu from the recycling station said,

579
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,720
our iron is of good quality.

580
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,480
It's just that the quantity is small.

581
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,830
If we have larger quantities
in the future,

582
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,760
he'll buy from us at a higher price.

583
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,920
Uncle.

584
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:33,960
Auntie.

585
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,240
Uncle.

586
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,410
Xiaoman.

587
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,570
Fang Kun.

588
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,680
You...

589
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
I came to check on you all.

590
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,650
What are you doing?

591
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,560
Spending on us again?

592
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,440
He's still angry with me, isn't he?

593
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,270
No.

594
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,920
Don't overthink it.

595
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,770
He's really not mad at you.

596
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,770
What happened with Lai

597
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,770
was really painful.

598
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,310
He's mostly

599
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,150
just too ashamed to face others.

600
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,170
How's the recycling business

601
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:13,960
going?

602
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,240
It's alright.

603
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,490
You really don't plan to
come back to our archaeological team?

604
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,400
Kun,

605
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
when you say that,

606
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,560
aren't you just teasing me?

607
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,110
Even if I really were shameless,

608
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,920
I still wouldn't dare go back
to the archaeological team.

609
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,720
The thieving husband's in jail,

610
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,920
and his wife...

611
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Lai is Lai,

612
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,240
and you are you.

613
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,990
Right?

614
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,720
Don't lump yourselves together
with him anymore.

615
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,400
We in the archaeological team know exactly

616
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,350
what kind of people your family are.

617
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,750
Right?

618
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
We discussed it before coming here.

619
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,090
You can come back anytime you want.

620
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,550
The archaeological team
is close to your home.

621
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,030
It won't interfere with farming,
and it's a steady income rain or shine.

622
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,090
Most importantly,

623
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,450
you have to show the villagers

624
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,000
that you're upright and proper

625
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,740
and that you don't fear their gossip.

626
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,170
I'm leaving now.

627
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,900
Take care of yourself.

628
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,510
Mrs. Zan.

629
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,030
The preliminary cleaning of M2
has been completed.

630
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,690
Whether it's the founder's tomb

631
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,890
will soon be clear.

632
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,160
Look,

633
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,140
the skeleton has decayed.

634
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,050
What are these pieces?

635
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,790
This is rosin.

636
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,350
It's used for waterproofing
and preservation.

637
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,200
Once the cleaning here is finished,

638
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
we need to carefully
collect and preserve it.

639
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
With the triple tomb structure
and the use of rosin,

640
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,270
it really seems like the founder's work.

641
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,380
And look,

642
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,400
based on the layout
of the entire tomb chamber,

643
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,790
these two are probably the back chambers,

644
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,370
and this one is the front chamber.

645
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,750
So this coffin

646
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,480
is very likely to be our founder's.

647
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,550
Let's

648
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,110
bow to our founder.

649
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,880
Emotionally, we've disturbed him,

650
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,650
and rationally,

651
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,110
he has left us

652
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,200
a valuable legacy
for our archaeological research.

653
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,790

654
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,820
Please read it.

655
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,780

[Case File: Tomb Raiding Charges
Against Hong Datong and Feng Sibao]

the ancient tomb that
Hong Datong, Feng Sibao,

658
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,440
and others robbed is

659
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,130

Can we convict them now?

Xiaoman.

664
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,170
Uncle.

Xiaoman.

666
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,050
Turn on the TV

667
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,070
and set it

668
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,830
to Qinchuan TV.

669
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Why do you suddenly want to watch TV?

670
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,720
Well, Xiaobai

671

673
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,400
We were halfway out...

674

The recently much-discussed...

675
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,590
Then we ran back.

676
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,890
Lv Family Tomb in Mi County

677
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,000
has finally, through the efforts of the
Provincial Archaeological Research Institute,

678
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,720
made a significant discovery.

679
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,550
How did an empty tomb

680
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,240
transform into
an extremely valuable ancient tomb?

681
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,110
What mysteries lie behind this?

682
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,270
[Empty Tomb Revealed to Be
Lv Family Tomb in Mi County]

683
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,200
Let's hear the interpretation

684
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,960
from Ms. Luo Qing,
the archaeological team leader

685
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,180
of the Lv Family Tomb.

686
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,850
Ms. Luo.

687
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,000
When we first took over the tomb...

688
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,200
It's really Luo Qing.

689
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,530
It was an empty tomb.

690
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,830
The tomb passage was shallow,

691
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,340
more like a modern tomb.

692
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,190
However, the direction
of the tomb passage was still downward,

693
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,130
so we decided to
continue clearing downwards.

694
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,170
When we dug to about seven meters,

695
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,680
we discovered
the same tomb chamber structure.

696
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,090
So we had a vague feeling

697
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,510
that this was most likely

698
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,880
an intentional setup by the tomb owner.

699
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,440
It could be a kind of anti-theft measure.

700
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,200
So we persisted in digging further down.

701
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,160
We dug to ten meters...

702
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Don't be jealous.

703
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,050
It's bound to happen sooner or later.

704
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,720
We're getting close too.

705
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,590
It was difficult to dig, with
many pebbles and ginger-shaped stones.

706
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,590
Our probing shovel

707
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,790
could hardly go down.

708
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,870
But we persisted in digging deeper

709
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,680
and finally dug to

710
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,550
about 15.5 meters deep

711
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,980
when the real main chamber appeared.

712
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,480
Everyone can take a look at

713
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,110
the excavation site

714
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,880
below us now.

715
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Alright, Ms. Luo,

716
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,960
during this excavation process,

717
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,020
is there anything
particularly memorable for you?

718
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,590
The cause of our excavation
this time is very special.

719
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,960
It originated from
a destructive tomb-raiding incident.

720
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,110
So our excavation is of a salvage nature.

721
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,350
The entire Lv Family Tomb,

722
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,310
due to the shamelessness
and greed of tomb raiders,

723
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,180
suffered great damage and loss.

724
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,920
We are truly heartbroken and indignant.

725
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,240
I heard that the main culprit,
Xing Zhaohu, is still at large.

726
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,900
Captain Qi,

727
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,400
have the stolen artifacts been recovered?

728
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,270
Can you tell us

729
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:37,790
the specific details of the arrest?

730
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,250
Captain Qi, can you tell us

731
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,750
the specific details of the arrest?

732
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,830
Alright.

733
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,250
Captain Qi,

734
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,610
the main culprit, Xing Zhaohu,
indeed hasn't been caught,

735
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,400
and the alms bowl is also still missing.

736
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,950
But I believe

737
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,310
that justice will prevail,
and no one can escape the law.

738
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,890
We will surely

739
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,240
bring all criminals to justice soon

740
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,400
and recover the lost cultural relics.

741
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,930
We also hope that the public

742
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,150
will actively provide clues

743
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,050
and cooperate to help us
solve the case as soon as possible.

744
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,070
"Flowing Light, Dreamy Splendor."

745
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,980
This theme name is well chosen.

746
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,400
It's taken from

747
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,400
two characters in
"The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor."

748
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,200
It highlights

749
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,110
the fleeting moments of drinking,

750
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,360
dreaming back to the great Song Dynasty.

751
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,280
Qin is indeed cultured.

752
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,320
A good name is secondary;

753
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,740
having genuinely good things
is most important.

754
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,450
Take a look at our plate first.

755
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,340
It's a sky-blue glazed plate.

756
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,560
The glaze is thick and moist,

757
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,730
with rich and vibrant colors.

758
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,400
Everyone, look at this glaze color.

759
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,260
Doesn't it look like

760
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,540
the sky after the rain has cleared?

761
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,400
It does.

762
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,590
Yes, that's the beauty of sky-blue glaze.

763
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,200
It's like

764
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,510
the color of the sky appears

765
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,270
after the clouds disperse.

766
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,960
Mist and rosy clouds fill the air,

767
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,590
with swirling vapors and drifting haze.

768
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,310
It's truly indescribable.

769
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,070
Marvelous.

770
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,200
Qin,

771
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,350
your insight

772
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,730
is impressive.

773
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,270
We bunch of blockheads

774
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,470
just felt it was good.

775
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,000
But why?

776
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,070
We had no clue.

777
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,350
Couldn't put it into words.

778
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,590
But now that you've explained it,

779
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,590
it all makes sense.

780
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,200
You've captured the look,

781
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,960
aroma, and appeal perfectly.

782
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,350
Good.

783
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,490
It's a genuine piece, indeed.

784
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,920
Yes, we have more authentic pieces ahead.

785
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,590
Let's go.

786
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,400
Look over there.

787
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,720
Alright.

788
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,030
Look at this large plate.

789
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,750
Alright.

790
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,650
This is not bad.

791
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,240
How about this? This rim's big.

792
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,280
Look.

793
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,830
The condition is still quite good.

794
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,960
But it's not as good as
the one you mentioned earlier.

795
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,640
It doesn't have
that after-the-rain freshness.

796
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,350
Mainly because it's not old enough.

797
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,960
Not old enough.

798
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Look at its color.

799
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,890
Look at this.

800
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,680
And this one too.

801
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,920
Mr. Mu.

802
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,510
Xiao.

803
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,100
This plate is very beautiful.

804
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,070
Where did you get it from?

805
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,630
This...

806
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,440
What's so special about this plate?

807
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,770
You look at it every day.

808
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,190
Aren't you tired of it yet?

809
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,989
It's not just an ordinary plate.

810
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,670
Your standards are too high.

811
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:26,920
Qin, your insight is indeed comprehensive.

812
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,600
Mr. Mu.

813
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,250
Do you know what they're up to?

814
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,940
What does it have to do with us?

815
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,080
You could say it's unrelated

816
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,810
since the excitement belongs to others.

817
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,889
But in a way, it's related to us too.

818
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,600
After all,

819
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,760
we did contribute a bit.

820
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,000
When do you think
we'll get to join that circle?

821
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,800
What circle are you talking about?

822
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,150
As long as we can make money,
that's what matters.

823
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,800
You really live life with such clarity.

824
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,660
I always said you're a shrewd one.

825
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,850
Alright.

826
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,920
I'll go look around.

827
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,400
Okay.

828
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,360
Shusheng,

829
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,400
do you still have the porcelain

830
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,250
you were tricked into buying in Shangyi?

831
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:27,960
Jianhui,

832
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,490
you must be teasing me.

833
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,490
Why would I keep that thing?

834
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:31,960
What?

835
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,920
Are you reminding me

836
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,150
that I was scammed out of 500,000?

837
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,880
Cut the crap.

838
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,560
Where were you scammed?

839
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,840
Send me the address.

840
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,110
This photo turned out beautifully.

841
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,960
You look way better on camera than I do.

842
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,020
Look, compared to yours,
I look like a dummy in my photo.

843
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,610
Wen Wen,

844
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,990
I was thinking

845
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,680
we should find a time

846
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,760
to treat Mu to a nice meal.

847
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,110
You see, we've already
got our marriage certificate,

848
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,310
but we haven't shown any appreciation.

849
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,590
That's not necessary, is it?

850
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,850
What's not necessary?

851
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,150
You've been working for him for so long.

852
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,010
Shouldn't you treat him to a meal?

853
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,430
What's wrong?

854
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,320
Have some hot water.

855
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,870
What's going on?

856
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,130
It's nothing.

857
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,430
I just ate too much greasy food at lunch.

858
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,630
Hello?

859
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:33,960
Guang,

860
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,120
Brother.

861
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
Pack your things.

862
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,750
We're going on a trip.

863
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,710
Now?

864
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,440
Where... Where are we going?

865
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,070
Shangyi.

866
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,730
Okay.

867
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,930
I'm afraid I have to go on a trip.

868
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,640
What for?

869
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,160
It's work-related; don't pry into it.

870
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,280
You...

871
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,370
are okay, right?

872
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,310
Make sure to eat well.

873
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,480
I'll be back soon.

874
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,580
Good stuff.

875
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,640
How is it, Qin?

876
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,790
Does it meet your standards?

877
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,670
Youlin,

878
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,360
I've been looking around here for a while,

879
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,670
and I feel like
everything was just appetizers.

880
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,440
So you've been holding out
the real main course for me here.

881
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,360
Of course.

882
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,670
Those were just appetizers.

883
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,880
I've saved all the good stuff

884
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,150
for you at the end.

885
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,020
Youlin,

886
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,420
I think your artistic taste

887
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,000
has indeed improved a lot.

888
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,400
Especially this alms bowl.

889
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,240
Everyone can see it.

890
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,320
You're talented and capable.

891
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,190
I feel that

892
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,030
guarding this small museum

893
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,490
is a waste of your talents.

894
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,030
This is all I can do.

895
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,760
I can't do anything else, can I?

896
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,830
The other day,

897
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,840
in Qinchuan,

898
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,640
there was a vacancy
for the Antiques Association chair.

899
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,950
They

900
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,590
asked me, "Qin,

901
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,220
who do you think

902
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,840
could take on this position?"

903
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,870
Without hesitation,

904
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I said, "This position suits
Zhao Youlin perfectly."

905
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:15,960
Qin,

906
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,480
you're flattering me too much.

907
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,150
I... I can't do that job.

908
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,710
Are you doubting my judgment

909
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,030
or doubting yourself?

910
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,920
Who would dare to doubt your judgment?

911
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,320
You're the benchmark in our industry,

912
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,980
aren't you?

913
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,590
Well, Qin.

914
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,140
If you think I can do it,

915
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,000
I'll do my best.

916
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,380
I'll give it my all.

917
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,880
Everyone, do you think Youlin is suitable?

918
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,670
Yes.

919
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,030
Everyone thinks so too.

920
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,120
It's connected.

921
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,160
Brother,

922
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,690
see, isn't it?

923
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,510
Look,

924
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,490
I didn't lie to you, did I?

925
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,970
It's the tomb of Miao Guangyi,
a Founding General of the Northern Song.

926
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,170
This is his hometown.

927
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,000
Many Northern Song Dynasty tombs
have been discovered here before.

928
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
They're all related to Miao.

929
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,480
I've been looking for this tomb
for a long time.

930
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,280
If I weren't certain it was his tomb,

931
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,210
I wouldn't dare to give you a price.

932
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,040
Let's go inside and talk.

933
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Oh my goodness!

934
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,840
Look.

935
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,670
My goodness.

936
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,480
It's all built with bricks.

937
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,190
Look at this structure and specifications.

938
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,670
The pre-Song tombs were all
earthen pit tombs.

939
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,280
If this person wasn't of high status,

940
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,840
such treatment and specifications
would be impossible.

941
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,470
Got it?

942
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,610
What's this?

943
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,800
This is the epitaph of the ancestral
Grand Military Advisor of the Nation,

944
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,480
Chief of the Astro-

945
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,280
Chief of the Astronomical Bureau,
Master Miao.

946
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,810
No need to read the epitaph.

947
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,210
You don't get it.

948
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,630
This epitaph is equivalent to

949
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,110
our modern-day ID cards.

950
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,970
The real can't be fake,

951
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,480
and the fake can't be real.

952
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,810
Let's look at the goods.

953
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,760
How many pieces are in total?

954
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,490
Nine pieces.

955
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,280
Oh my goodness!

956
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,810
They're all Ru Kiln pieces.

957
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,630
Look.

958
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,240
There are even characters
at the bottom, see?

959
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,180
Miao Xun, courtesy name Guangyi,

960
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,360
is from Miaodian Town in Sheqi County.

961
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,670
In the first year of Guangshun,
during the Chenqiao Mutiny,

962
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,800
Zhao Kuangyin seized power
from the Later Zhou Dynasty.

963
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,960
He then declared the country name as Song.

964
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,430
You see,

965
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,440
Miao Guangyi is from
Miaodian Town, Sheqi County.

966
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,550
He's from this very place.

967
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,320
Zhao Kuangyin bestowed this to him.

968
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,550
If this isn't his tomb,
whose tomb could it be?

969
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,610
Feel relieved now?

970
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,130
The craftsmanship is indeed not bad.

971
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,150
If you hadn't overplayed your hand,

972
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,110
you might have fooled someone.

973
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,040
What do you mean?

974
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,450
Are you saying this is fake?

975
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,730
Let's not beat around the bush.

976
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,240
Do you really

977
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,440
want me to reveal where the fake is?

978
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,580
I don't think you're here
for serious business.

979
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,230
You're here to cause trouble, aren't you?

980
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,800
Listen,

981
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,630
if you're gonna pull moves like that,

982
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,000
then I'll make sure to
treat you real good.

983
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,480
Do you want to fight one against
three thousand or the other way around?

984
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,590
My men fill the entire grove.

985
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,120
You won't be leaving today.

986
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,540
What are you doing?

987
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,150
Go ahead!

988
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,320
Guang.

989
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,590
Let go.

990
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,340
Release your hand.

991
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,510
Uncle,

992
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,190
don't take it seriously.

993
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,190
My brother was just joking with you.

994
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,360
We didn't come here to fight today.

995
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,690
We came to make friends.

996
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,870
Guang,

997
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,730
take out the money.

998
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,440
Whether we become friends or enemies,
it's up to you.

999
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,380
This sky-blue glazed plate
came from your place, right?

1000
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,970
Untie them now.

1001
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,400
I apologize for the discourtesy.

1002
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,200
I understand.

1003
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,620
Second Father,

1004
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,650
I've brought them here.

1005
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,140
He came in with quite an attitude.

1006
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,720
What does he do for a living?

1007
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,710
Just like you, Second Father,

1008
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,370
we're relying on what was passed down
from previous generations.

1009
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,510
Have you seen anything you like?

1010
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,670
Thirty thousand.
