[Episode 11]

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,550
[Mingde Museum]

4
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,240
Mr. Hong.

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
What brings you here?

6
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,789
Aren't you usually

7
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,710
not interested in these exhibitions?

8
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,229
Look.

9
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,479
I received the invitation letter.

10
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,070
I'm here to show my support.

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,310
They must have sent you one too.

12
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,110
I don't have as much clout as you.

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,140
I paid my own way to join the event.

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,950
What's the point of
spending money on this?

15
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,870
I heard Zhao Youlin
has collected quite a few good pieces.

16
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,080
I want to broaden my horizons too.

17
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,310
Look at this place.

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,480
He's really a big shot, isn't he?

19
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,290
How should I put it?

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,810
This is what happens

21
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,079
when fortunes change over time.

22
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,770
Twenty years ago when I first met him,

23
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,230
he was just a construction contractor.

24
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,960
Haven't I told you this before?

25
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,280
This is what they call

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,800
hitting the jackpot.

27
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,280
Back then, he was at the construction site

28
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,360
with one shovel...

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,090
Let's not talk about this here.

30
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,470
In short,

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,880
when luck comes your way,

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,829
money chases after you, right?

33
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,280
But come to think of it,

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,710
in terms of intelligence,

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,030
if he were in the Spring and Autumn
and Warring States periods,

36
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,090
he'd compete with Su Qin and Zhang Yi.

37
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,120
The diplomats,

38
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,310
trying to form
Vertical and Horizontal Alliances.

39
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,280
There's no connection he can't make.

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,000
Let me tell you,

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
this guy's dark history

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,520
is quite interesting.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,770
Mr. Hong, Mr. Hong.

44
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,840
-Another day...
-Even I...

45
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,570
Another day,

46
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,030
I'll bring some good wine,

47
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,110
and we'll chat leisurely at your shop.

48
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,840
Sounds good.

49
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,590
Alright, alright.

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,430
Take your time looking around.

51
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,230
Yes, yes, yes.

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,400
Qin.

53
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,480
Look.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,940
How's this
tri-colored three-flowered horse?

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,250
I recognize this horse.

56
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,630
When you first came to my place,

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,820
you brought a photo of this horse.

58
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,150
Yes, yes, yes.

59
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,079
I said you had a sharp eye, didn't I?

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,130
As everyone can see,

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,650
it's a genuine three-flowered horse.

62
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,480
A crest on its forehead,

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
a green blanket on its saddle,

64
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,160
exquisite pendants,

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,890
and two wide-open eyes.

66
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,760
It's very lifelike.

67
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,800
Everyone, look.

68
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,150
It's because you mentioned it

69
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,210
that I remembered.

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,190
I spent a lot of money to

71
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,240
buy this piece at an auction in England.

72
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,100
It wasn't easy.

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,740
Youlin.

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,750
If this is

75
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,560
the star of today's exhibition,

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,560
I don't think you've made much progress
in the past two years.

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,520
Do you have any really good pieces

78
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,080
to broaden my horizons?

79
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,430
I wouldn't dare say
they'll broaden your horizons,

80
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,310
but you can really give me some guidance.

81
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,170
Yes, there are.

82
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:07,910
Here.

83
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,760
Tri-colored Heavenly King figurine.

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,519
It's really a good piece.

85
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,390
I don't know about it.

86
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,800
Look.

87
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,240
It wears gold armor,

88
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,070
with a phoenix-wing-shaped helmet
with an upturned brim on the head,

89
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,270
in a commanding pose.

90
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,710
This should be used to

91
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,800
guard the tomb of some important figure
from the Tang Dynasty.

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,870
It's for warding off evil.

93
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,920
Good eye.

94
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,159
It's really good.

95
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,870
I also

96
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,560
spent a lot of money

97
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,280
to buy it from Hong Kong.

98
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,560
Treasures like this

99
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
shouldn't flow into the overseas market.

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,480
Yes, yes, yes.

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,070
Bringing these back

102
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,390
is mainly to let future generations know

103
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,800
what the burial culture of
the Tang Dynasty was like.

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,330
Exactly.

105
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,010
There are more good things.

106
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,810
The best is yet to come, everyone.

107
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,690
Please step over here to see this.

108
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,700
How about this bronze mirror?

109
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,550
T-This is in good condition.

110
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,480
It's from the Tang Dynasty, right?

111
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,920
Yes.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,560
Youlin.

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,510
Speaking of the Han and Tang dynasties,

114
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,510
our Qinzhou is second to none.

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,160
Of course.

116
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,870
But when it comes to the Song Dynasty,

117
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,470
we can't compare to Shangyi.

118
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,560
You're the Director of the Mingde Museum.

119
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,430
When will you boost our spirits
in terms of the Song and Yuan pieces?

120
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,800
During the Song Dynasty,

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
there was the Longquan Kiln in the south

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
and Yaozhou ceramics in the north.

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,920
When will you hold
a Yaozhou ceramics exhibition?

124
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,040
Then I'd love to stay here for that.

125
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,720
Alright.

126
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,390
Qin.

127
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,950
I'll keep this in mind.

128
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,280
Good.

129
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,690
Qin, look over here.

130
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,680
Okay, okay, okay.

131
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,070
This is a great beauty
from the Tang Dynasty.

132
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,240
Right, right, right.

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,000
A plump woman.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Look how beautiful she is.

135
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,950
Right, right, right.

136
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,360
In the Tang Dynasty,
plumpness was considered beautiful.

137
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,600
Right.

138
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,510
A full figure.

139
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,740
Youlin, you've really put in effort.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,330
What?

141
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,090
What do you mean?

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,620
What are you doing?

143
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Looking for work.

144
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,120
Looking for work?

145
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,490
You just got out, right?

146
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:31,920
What?

147
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,190
What do you mean?

148
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,750
You're still pretending with me?

149
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,560
I recognized that big mole of yours

150
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,870
at a glance.

151
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,480
I was in the sixth ward.

152
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,740
Just got out last year.

153
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,159
What did you go to jail for?

154
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,510
Fight, what about you?

155
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,730
Same as you.

156
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,560
With your dumb look,
you had a fight with others?

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,960
What on earth do you want?

158
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,470
Looking for a job that makes money fast.

159
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,120
Well,

160
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,230
I'm about to get off work.

161
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,820
I'll take you to find a job.

162
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,040
Okay.

163
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,650
Shan, are you grilling the meat
or yourself?

164
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,500
The charcoal isn't working well.

165
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,380
We're here.

166
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,540
Grilling meat, Hu?

167
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,700
You're back.

168
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,040
Wait a moment.

169
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,370
Okay.

170
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,970
Use less salt.

171
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,900
I'll go tell him.

172
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,360
Hu.

173
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,730
Aren't we short-handed?

174
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,340
I found us a new guy.

175
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,770
Come here, come here, come here.

176
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,380
Sit down.

177
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,360
Hu.

178
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,010
Hello, Hu, hello.

179
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,120
Come on, buddy.

180
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,650
Alright.

181
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,540
Eat some grilled meat.

182
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,040
Okay.

183
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:36,930
What's up?

184
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,440
Have you been inside?

185
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,870
Come on, buddy.

186
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,210
Hu.

187
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,090
For what reason?

188
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,210
What else could it be?

189
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,850
Fight, of course.

190
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,770
With his dumb look,
he had a fight with others.

191
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,130
It's good.

192
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,190
You're trying to fool me?

193
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,920
-Fight?
-Hu!

194
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:04,650
Come here!

195
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,240
Hu, Hu!

196
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,970
-I'll skin you alive!
-Hu! Hu!

197
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,900
Come here! Stop!

198
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,640
-Come here!
-Hu!

199
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,770
Hu, Hu, I wouldn't dare!

200
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,450

201

207

Shan, come here.

208

Come here.

209
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,610
Does this guy look familiar?

210
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,630
Big Mole!

211
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,280
It's him!

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,970
He and Yan Xiaowu stole our pit!

213
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,600
I'd recognize Big Mole
even if he turned to ashes!

214
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,660
I've been having bad luck
year after year!

215
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,450
You and Yan Xiaowu

216
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,680
stole my good fortune!

217
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,909
Hu, Hu, calm down.

218
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,690
Calm down.

219
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,650
-Come on.
-I…

220
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll do everything you say to make it up
to you, okay?

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,480
I don't need it.

222
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,520
Hu.

223
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,850
Beating you to death
might turn my luck around!

224

Hu, Hu, Hu!

225

I know about a grand tomb!
I know about a grand tomb!

226
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,170
You're still trying to trick me here?

227
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,360
If there's a grand tomb,
why don't you go yourself?

228
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
You think I'm an idiot?

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,970
That grand tomb belongs to my ancestors.

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,050
I don't dare to.

231
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,880
Your ancestors?

232
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,690
-Hu.
-Hu.

233
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,610
I don't think he's lying.

234
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,170
Why don't we hear him out?

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
That grand tomb is

236
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,450
in Lvjia Village, Mi County.

237
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,090
It belongs to
my maternal grandfather's family.

238
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,120
His ancestors were all very capable.

239
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
They were all high-ranking officials
in the Song Dynasty.

240
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
The highest position was Prime Minister.

241
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,050
There must be valuable things
in that grand tomb.

242
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,420

244
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,000
The artifacts we dug up last time
in Fengjiapo

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,860
have been sold.

246
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,330
Here's the money.

247
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,410
Alright.

Jianhui.

249
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,170
Zhao Youlin

250
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,120
is not very generous with the payment.

251
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,970
Do we really need to offend King Hua
for his sake?

252
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,120
King Hua is a thief after all.

253
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,860
He's hidden in the shadows.

254
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,390
Zhao Youlin is different.

255
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,880
I went to his collection exhibition today.

256
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
The Heavenly King figurine
and the bronze mirror we sold

257
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,940
were just lying there in plain sight.

258
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,820
He's got some nerve.

259
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,360
Isn't he afraid the police
will come knocking?

260
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,970
He's got all the paperwork in order.

261
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,640
Even if they investigate,
they won't find any issues.

262
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,600
In our hands,
these items are stolen goods,

263
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,930
but in his possession, they become
legitimately inherited collections.

264
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,700
He's become a great benefactor

265
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,300
bringing overseas cultural relics
back home.

266
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,710
You think it's unfair, right?

267
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,250
That's just how the world works.

268
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,640
Whoever has money and connections

269
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
gets to make the rules.

270
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,520
I don't really think it's unfair.

271
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,180
After all, snakes

272
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,090
and rats have different paths to walk.

273
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,480
We just focus on making our own money,
that's all.

274
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,140
There's an end to a rat's path.

275
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,930
When people ask what you do,

276
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,660
are you comfortable saying
you're a tomb raider?

277
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,600
We're the ones who dug up those items.

278
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,850
We're the ones
who brought those relics to light.

279
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,180
We get a bad reputation,

280
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,330
while they get all the credit.

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,880
Why?

282
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,970
It's because

283
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,130
we don't have connections.

284
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,050
Zhao Youlin is a big tree.

285
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,850
We need to find a way

286
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,540
to enjoy its shade.

287
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,530
But he won't deal with us directly.

288
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,030
How can we get close to him?

289
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,600
We cater to his interests.

290
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,730
During this period,

291
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,540
keep an eye out for Song Dynasty ceramics.

293
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,570
I hope we're not going to warm up

294
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,330
to someone who's snubbing us again.

295
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,090
As long as our offering
is substantial enough,

296
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,550
the path we'll walk in the future
won't be a rat's path anymore.

297

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,810
Is this the grand tomb you mentioned?

303

This is where my Lv family buried people
for generations.

304
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,240
It's been too long.

305

have long since disappeared.

306

But the grand tomb

307
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,690
is right here in this peach orchard.

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,520
Thank you all for your hard work.

374
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,580
Alright, alright.

375
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,940
Go back and bring it.

376
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,520
Take it easy.

377
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:45,720
Okay.

378
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,090
Here, have some wine.

379
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,760
It's fine, it's fine.

380
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,330
Put it here.

381
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,330
Here, put it here.

382
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,250
Let's go.

383
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,800
Time to work.

384
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,790
Get to work, let's go.

385
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,220
It's right here.

386
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,640
Come on.

387
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,050
Cousin.

388
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,050
Let's get to work.

389
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,710
I haven't been here for years.

390
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,450
I can't remember at all

391
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,850
where my maternal grandfather was buried.

392
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,650
Fifty meters ahead,

393
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,830
that's your grandfather's tomb.

394
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,730
I heard from my uncle

395
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,760
that our Lv family ancestors

396
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,850
also came from a prominent family.

397
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,690
During the Song Dynasty,
there were the Four Virtuous Lv Brothers,

398
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,890
who were very famous.

399
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,720
My grandfather must have been buried
next to those four virtuous men, right?

400
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
How could we be qualified

401
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,850
to be buried next to them?

402
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,970
Our ancestors

403
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,690
were distant relatives
of the Four Virtuous Lv Brothers.

404
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,150
They were caretakers
of their family tombs.

405
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:33,880
What?

406
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,570
Our ancestors were gravekeepers?

407
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,140
Not just our ancestors,

408
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,520
our family has been tending their tombs
for generations.

409
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,920
Up until the liberation.

410
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,030
Cousin.

411
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,750
Where were these four brothers buried?

412
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,880
Why do you ask?

413
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,460
I was thinking,

414
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,240
when I have time,
I'd like to pay my respects to them.

415
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,440
To absorb some of their righteousness.

416
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,050
The Lv Family Tomb

417
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,210
had dozens of households

418
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
of their descendants buried there.

419
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,680
If you're asking me which tomb
belongs to those four brothers,

420
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,079
I really can't remember.

421
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,560
When I was young,
I heard my grandfather say

422
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,640
that the Lv family temple is on
the southwest side of the peach orchard.

423
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,730
If you walk east from the family temple,

424
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,060
there's the Spirit Way.

425
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,579
At the end of the Spirit Way

426
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,079
is the Lv Family Tomb.

427
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,220
Cousin, well, look,

428
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,600
we have a lot to do at home.

429
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,010
You go back and take care of things.

430
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,440
I'll stay here and keep watch.

431
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,770
Just let me
do something nice for my uncle.

432
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,410
I promise
I won't let even a single bug fly in.

433
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,160
Alright then.

434
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,850
It gets cold at night.

435
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,880
I'll go get you some clothes.

436
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,340
No need.

437
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:44,910
You go back.

438
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,180
Okay.

439
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,010
What are you doing here?

440
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:21,900
Who is it?

441
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,940
Taiping.

442
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,550
What are you doing here?

443
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,370
I'm guarding the tomb for my cousin.

444
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,210
The tomb hasn't been dug yet.

445
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,500
It's the middle of the night.

446
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,230
You scared us, I'm telling you.

447
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,900
It's cold. Take care of yourself out here.

448
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,370
Take care.

449
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,820
We're leaving. Let's go.

450
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,660
Hello, Hu.

451
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,680
The cultural relic conservators just left.

452
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,340
They won't come back tonight.

453
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,110
You guys come quickly.

454
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,110
It's right here.

455
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,890
My cousin said this is the location
of the family temple.

456
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,220
Along that path,

457
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,800
turn and go to the end.

458
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,610
That's where
the Lv family's grand tomb is.

459
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,640
I asked you to find out
the specific location of the grand tomb,

460
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,150
not the Spirit Way of the family temple.

461
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:19,850
I know.

462
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,040
I didn't dare to ask too many details.

463
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,500
I was afraid my cousin
would get suspicious.

464
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,190
Follow the path that he mentioned

465
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,980
and explore further.

466
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,310
Okay.

467
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,090
Hurry, hurry.

468
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,300
Still can't catch my eye.

469
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,650
Jianhui,

470
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,700
lately,

471
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,900
everyone's been scrambling for
Song Dynasty ceramics.

472
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,230
I'd say I acted quickly.

473
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,050
Those kiln sites' storage pits
are all too mediocre.

474
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,550
Zhao Youlin has high standards.

475
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,570
Ordinary artifacts won't catch his eye.

476
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,810
Catch his eye?

477
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
We're making money with our skills.

478
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,560
Why should we get close to him?

479
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,760
You can't fill a stomach with crumbs.

480
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,150
Guang, Zhao Youlin's hands

481
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,120
are even dirtier than ours,

482
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,190
yet why can he stand proudly
in the spotlight

483
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,630
while we can only be tomb raiders?

484
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,910
In the future, you'll get married
and have children.

485
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,930
We can live in the shadows
our whole lives,

486
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,790
but our wives and children can't.

487
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,690
Alright, I understand.

488
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,540
I'll keep collecting them.

489
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,460
Hu.

490
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,870
Take a look here.

491
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,510
It's variegated earth.

492
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,130
Big Mole.

493
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,360
We'll make our move tonight.

494
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,510
Don't let me down.

495
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,050
Shan.

496
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,980
Mark this spot.

497
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,730
What's wrong with you?

498
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,630
Oh my god!

499
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,540
Why are you here?

500
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,400
Why can't I come?

501
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,600
I came for your uncle.

502
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,490
Why do you look so scared?

503
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,890
What have you done wrong?

504
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,220
Where did you get this phone?

505
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Give me the phone.

506
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,600
Where did you really get this phone?
Tell me the truth!

507
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,730
My boss gave it to me.

508
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,370
Your old problem is back again?

509
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
What old problem?

510
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,190
Which woman bought you this phone?

511
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,480
There's no woman involved.

512
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:41,900
Give it to me.

513
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,030
Let me see who you've been contacting.

514
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,220
What are you two arguing about?

515
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,020
It's nothing.

516
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,560
Brother, it's nothing.

517
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,410
You'd better be honest with me!
I'm telling you.

518
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,420
Stop arguing anymore.

519
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,910
It's fine, it's fine.

520
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,040
I'll head out first.

521
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,250
Taiping.

522
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,980
I think you're in very poor health.

523
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,220
Tonight,

524
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,160
let your cousin
take over the tomb-watching duty.

525
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,290
You don't need to go.

526
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,190
I can do it.

527
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,160
I can do it.

528
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,270
Lie down quickly.

529
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,300
Get some rest.

530
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,190
Cousin, I can do it!

531
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,710
Mrs. Zan.

532
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,570
There are three sites
with river pebble paving.

533
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,370
This one

534
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,140
was discovered 30 years ago

535
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,510
near the Mausoleum of Empress Dowager Bo.

536
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,260
Mr. Zan engaged in the excavation
at that time.

537
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,920
Take a look.

538
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,420
And this one

539
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,660
was found by us

540
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,460
in the foundation for the pump well house.

541
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,260
This one was discovered in the looting pit

542
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,060
of the black pottery figurines.

543
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,990
However, it can't be located now.

544
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,920
How far is the foundation

545
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,200
from where the black pottery figurines
were unearthed?

546
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,660
Not far,

547
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,740
about 50 meters in a straight line.

548
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,020
After you asked about the notes last time,

549
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,390
I talked to a few old friends.

550
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:05,900
They

551
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,180
haven't seen this kind of stone paving
before,

552
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,610
but it can be inferred that

553
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,230
it's some kind of architectural remains.

554
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,500
If it's a human burial,

555
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,370
could it

556
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,160
be related to Empress Dowager Bo?

557
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,150
Some scholars suggested back then

558
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,960
that this might be the tomb of
Empress Dowager Bo's granddaughter,

559
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,140
Princess Guantao.

560
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,470
As for whose tomb it is,

561
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,510
we can't jump to conclusions now.

562
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,520
I suggest,

563
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,850
we continue to focus on
the black pottery figurines

564
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,600
and conduct a more detailed field survey

565
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,130
around the Yin Village area

566
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,490
to see if we can
find more direct evidence.

567
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,490
Don't worry, Mrs. Zan.

568
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,160
I'll report this matter

569
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,250
to the institute.

570
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,170
Are you two

571
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,460
not joining us?

572
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,640
My vacation is almost over,

573
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,330
and I'm planning to return
to the provincial institute.

574
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,730
I need to go back to Yusai.

575
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
Look at you two.

576
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,390
You two are not allowed to leave today.

577
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,450
Have a meal with me.

578
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,200
I've learned to cook a few dishes.

579
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,640
You can be my guinea pigs.

580
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:18,570
Alright.

581
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,970
You're leaving so soon?

582
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,380
What's going on between you two?

583
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,410
There's nothing between us.

584
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,360
Come on,

585
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,810
you think I don't know anything?

586
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,930
You came to Qinchuan for him, didn't you?

587
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,560
Mrs. Zan,

588
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,560
once bitten, twice shy.

589
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,900
Do you really have no thoughts at all?

590
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,230
The wise don't fall in love.

591
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,720
There's no possibility.

592
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,820
She turned you down?

593
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,680
I didn't even mention it.

594
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,590
You...

595
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,760
You fool.

596
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,960
I thought you were a wolf.

597
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,340
Turns out you're just a weak sheep.

598
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,760
I've thought it through.

599
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,120
I'm in Yusai,

600
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,160
and she's at the provincial institute.

601
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,360
We're separated by thousands of miles.

602
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,040
It's not going to work,

603
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,440
right?

604
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,310
It's too unfair for her.

605
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,600
Also,

606
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,180
I don't know what she's really thinking

607
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,580
and whether she would accept this.

608
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,870
Are you a fool?

609
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,690
Back then, Luo Qing

610
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,940
came to Qinchuan just for you.

611
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,320
Hu.

612
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,690
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

613
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,890
It's bright enough to split a mountain.

614
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:55,590
Be careful.

615
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,170
Okay.

616
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,660
Alright, Hu.

617
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,380
Come on, get ready.

618
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,800
Uncle!

619
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,840
Uncle!

620
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,540
You bringer of bad luck, what's wrong now?

621
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,480
My uncle must know
I'm here to dig up the tomb.

622
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,810
He's telling me to stop.

623
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,730
Uncle!

624
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,520
The sound of firecrackers is a good thing.
It'll cover for us.

625
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,600
Set them off when you're ready.

626
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:24,970
Okay.

627
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,840
You'll just remain a poor devil.

628
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,690
This pit is so beautiful.

629
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,050
Hu.

630
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,810
Who are you kowtowing to?

631
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,250
You're really a fool.

632
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,310
It's your family's stuff you're taking.

633
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,360
What's wrong
with making a living that way?

634
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,420
It's only natural.

635
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,730
Now I see you...

636
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,670
Go, go, go.

637
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,170
Go over there and keep watch for me.

638
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,370
Keep a lookout for me.

639
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,810
Let's go.

640
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:28,920
It's done.

641
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:29,800
Okay.

642
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,360
Alright, alright. I'll give it a try.

643
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,890
Alright.

644
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,290
Give me a push.

645
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:51,700
How is it?

646
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,160
I'll do it.

647
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,380
A posture of saluting.

648
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,240
We've struck it rich.

649
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:31,540
Pull.

650
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,390
Slowly.

651
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,800
Ancient Chinese...

652
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,560
Ceramics...

653
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,600
Image Collection.

654
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,080
Feng Xian...

655
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,040
Feng Xian what?

656
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:05,740
Sheng.

657
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,820
Are you dozing off?

658
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,120
Nonsense.

659
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,880
I'm reading.

660
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,490
Come on, I heard you snoring.

661
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,690
I was just deep in thought.

662
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,900
When did you get here?

663
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
I-I just arrived.

664
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,800
What are you doing here?

665
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,090
Can't I come to see you without a reason?

666
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,040
Why are you here if there's nothing?

667
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,550
I brought you a treasure.

668
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,780
Here, take a look.

669
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,370
How is it?

670
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,280
Isn't it beautiful?

671
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,870
Where did you get it?

672
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,300
I've been lucky lately.

673
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,750
I dug up a grand Song Dynasty tomb

674
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,050
and got quite a few Song Dynasty ceramics.

675
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,380
Go, go, go. Take it away.

676
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,690
Song Dynasty ceramics?

677
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,090
Wasn't the last time embarrassing enough?

678
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,140
Sheng, this is absolutely genuine.

679
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,700
It's from the Lv Family Tomb.

680
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,650
You know?

681
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,150
The brothers in that family
were all amazing.

682
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,450
One of them was called Lv Dalin.

683
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,730
I dug up his family's tomb.

684
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,930
Look at you, acting all knowledgeable.

685
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,530
How could I not know Lv Dalin?

686
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:19,890
Look.

687
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,830
He wrote
the Illustrated Study of Antiquity.

688
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,200
When have you ever heard

689
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,880
that his family's tomb was robbed?

690
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,290
Always talking about
Song Dynasty ceramics.

691
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:29,800
Let me ask you,

692
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,740
do you know why Song Dynasty ceramics
are so valuable?

693
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,600
No, I don't.

694
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,420
Your lack of knowledge is your downfall.

695
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,730
Come on, I'll educate you a bit today.

696
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,560
Move aside.

697
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,300
Don't press on my books.

698
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,120
I'll arrange them properly for you.

699
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,270
Show some respect for books, will you?

700
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,690
Right.

701
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,820
Let me tell you something.

702
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,360
During the Song Dynasty,

703
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,070
it was popular to burn paper offerings.

704
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,690
The burial items were all made of paper.

705
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,160
Things like joss paper,

706
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,020
paper horses, and paper clothes.

707
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,260
Even the emperor led the way
in burning paper offerings.

708
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,180
Even if there had been real items
in tombs,

709
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,770
do you think the ancestors
from the Song and Yuan dynasties

710
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,830
would have sat around doing nothing?

711
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,690
Would they have left
those valuable things behind?

712
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,550
What are you thinking, young man?

713
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,120
Sheng,

714
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,170
I dug up the tomb myself.

715
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,950
It's definitely a Song Dynasty ceramic.

716
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,880
It can't be fake.

717
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,260
Remember that tomb in Shangyi last time?

718
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,460
Wasn't that also dug by you personally?

719
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,010
Yet you still got tricked, didn't you?

720
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,870
Well, Sheng, let me tell you.

721
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,600
This time is really different.

722
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,360
I scouted the location myself.

723
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,620
I blasted the pit myself.

724
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,350
I went down into the pit myself.

725
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,200
There's no way it could be fake.

726
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,270
I still have several dozen pieces

727
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,670
of porcelain and bronze.

728
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,790
What period is the bronze from?

729
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,820
The bronze is...

730
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:54,830
From the Zhou Dynasty.

731
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,880
Then, could Zhou Dynasty items

732
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,780
that ended up in a Song tomb be real?

733
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,830
Are you a fool?

734
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,530
That's impossible.

735
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,790
Go away and get rid of this stuff quickly.

736
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,320
J-J-Just forget it.

737
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,489
Well.

738
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,020
I'll pick out a couple of books
for you to read.

739
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,980
People need to learn, you know?

740
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,679
About the Tang Dynasty.

741
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,610
Here, just these three books.

742
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,050
Take them home and study well.

743
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,190
You can't get by without common knowledge.

744
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,120
Right, Sheng. You study hard then.

745
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,170
I'm heading back.

746
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,400
Don't just eat all day.

747
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,210
We should improve together.

748
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:35,639
[Collectibles Town, South Market]

749
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,380
Come on, sir!

750
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,010
Come in and have a seat, sir!

751
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,270
Li Quan.

752
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,090
Did you see that person?

753
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,280
He's carrying a bag.

754
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,140
Go check where he's going

755
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,020
and whether he's going to make a deal.

756
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,550
Alright.

757
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,670
Anyone here?

758
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,680
Feel free to look around.

759
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,620
I'm not here to buy something.

760
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:25,880
Have a seat.

761
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:40,610
What is it?

762
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,640
See what I've got here.

763
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,230
What do you think after you've been
looking at it for so long?

764
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,290
Are you going to say something or not?

765
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,710
Mr. Hong, why is the door closed?

766
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,370
Are you busy?

767
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:44,720
What's up?

768
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,720
I've run out of ink pads at my shop.

769
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,710
Can I borrow a red ink pad from you?

770
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,440
Sure.

771
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,930
Is all Mr. Mu's money

772
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,260
tucked away on his body?

773
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,950
He's made so much money,
yet too stingy to buy an ink pad.

774
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,950
It's not for free.

775
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,530
200.

776
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,600
Why are you talking about money?

777
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,850
I'll bring it back when I'm done.

778
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm leaving. You can get back to work.

779
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,200
Just go.

780
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,630
The door...

781
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,680
No need, no need, no need.

782
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,010
I'm leaving.

783
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,720
Tanghulu!

784
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,960
Fresh tanghulu!

785
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,850
Bro, you acted quickly.

786
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,380
No sincerity, no deal.

787
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:16,920
50,000.

788
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,270
50,000? That's too low.

789
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,840
It's a Song Dynasty ceramic.

790
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,160
Jianhui.

791
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,080
Jianhui.

792
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,490
You didn't misjudge.
He's making a deal.

793
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,050
On what item?

794
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,530
A vase.

795
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,450
From what I heard,
it's a Song Dynasty ceramic.

796
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,980
How much did Mr. Hong offer?

797
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,200
50,000.

798
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,140
50,000.

799
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,790
That means it's worth
at least 100 thousand.

800
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,610
What does that piece look like?

801
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,950
The mouth of the vase
is very small and short,

802
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,280
like a blooming flower.

803
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,580
The body is about this big,

804
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,270
20 cm tall.

805
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,950
The glaze is celadon.

806
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,550
Sounds like a Yaozhou ceramic.

807
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,130
Yaozhou ceramics
are mostly plates and bowls.

808
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,330
Vases are quite rare.

809
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,320
Seems Xing Zhaohu

810
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,610
has found something valuable.

811
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,130
Guang.

812
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:18,970
Jianhui.

813
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,450
I need to ask you something.

814
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,180
Do you know
what Xing Zhaohu has been up to lately?

815
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,130
I don't know.

816
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,250
I don't have much contact with him.

817
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,780
Aren't you close with Shan?

818
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,090
I only know that
Shan has been following Xing Zhaohu.

819
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,700
They haven't dug up something valuable
these years.

820
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,900
They're not well off.

821
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,810
If it weren't for Xing Zhaohu,

822
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,870
who has some kind of

823
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,720
scrap steel business,

824
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,970
they would've led...

825
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,110
Where is his place?

826
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,490
Take me there.

827
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
One porcelain vase is worth 50,000.

828
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,800
Could these be worth a million?

829
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,060
It's hard to say.

830
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,740
This vase is surely valuable.

831
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,370
But we might have some inferior ones here.

832
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,210
The quality varies.

833
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,270
I can't be sure how much they're worth.

834
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,930
Let's be patient.

835
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,040
We should ask a few more places.

836
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,200
Alright.

837
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,100
You're right.

838
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,060
Good things come to those who wait.

839
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,480
Hu, my brother.

840
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,570
Isn't this Mr. Mu from Nameless Pavilion?

841
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,940
Is my memory failing me

842
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
or you?

843
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,790
Since when did we become brothers?

844
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,970
As I recall, we're sworn enemies.

845
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,410
Old foes.

846
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,530
We have a blood feud.

847
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,490
Hu.

848
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,350
We're all in business.

849
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,070
There's no such thing as a lasting grudge.

850
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,180
I'll get straight to the point.

851
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,740
I heard Hu has dug up something valuable.

852
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,010
You're like a dog,

853
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,380
with a keen nose, aren't you?

854
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,410
Since I've caught the scent,

855
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,140
why don't you let me have a look?

856
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,380
I find you quite interesting.

857
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,700
You want to see them,

858
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,140
and I shall show you?

859
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,130
Hu,

860
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,860
let's put our past grievances behind us.

861
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,410
We both aim to make a fortune.

862
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,490
Money is the priority,

863
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,890
and we're all its slaves.

864
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,940
I came here with sincerity.

865
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,740
You can pay me no respect,

866
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,660
but if you don't respect money,

867
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,860
that's not right.

868
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,540
Cultured man.

869
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,760
It's fine. Open it.

870
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,870
Slowly, be careful.

871
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,190
Since you've seen them,

872
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,020
show me your sincerity.

873
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,620
Five million.

874
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,070
I'll take them all.

875
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,410
You think I'm like you,

876
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
blinded by money?

877
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,520
Ill-gotten gains are cursed.

878
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,710
You even stole from your own family's pit.

879
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,850
You've really got the nerve.

880
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,740
Watch your mouth.

881
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,730
What, Gunner?

882
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,970
You fence-sitter.

883
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:58,900
Don't get cocky.

884
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,610
The tables will turn.

885
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,660
I'm lucky now.

886
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,700
As for you two,

887
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,930
black-hearted thieves.

888
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,820
Not for long,

889
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,660
you're bound to fall.

890
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,010
Five million.

891
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,900
Even if it's 50 million,

892
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,380
I still won't sell them to you.

893
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:17,910
Get lost.

894
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,230
Bye.

895
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,450
Hu, don't take offense.

896
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,150
As I said before,

897
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,130
we risk our lives every day.

898
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,030
When it comes down to it,

899
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,650
it's all for money.

900
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,880
We should stay focused on making money,
right?

901
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:39,690
Guang.

902
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,470
This is 50,000.

903
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,460
I came here with sincerity.

904
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,610
Give me 10 days.

905
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,220
I'll gather five million.

906
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,900
If during these days,

907
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,030
you find someone
offering a higher price than me,

908
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,490
you can sell them as you want.

909
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,090
How does that sound?
