Its shape is full and rounded.

111
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,240
The blue and white coloring
is very classic.

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
If you look closely,
each of the nine dragons is different.

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,870
But each one is very majestic.

114

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,190
Mr. Zhao, you're being too modest.

125
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,510
This is hardly just an antique shop.

126
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,920
This is a museum.

127
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,160
I've heard about it for a long time.

128
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,820
Never had the chance to visit.

129
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,390
Mr. Zhao is truly a role model
in Qinchuan's collectibles community.

130
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,390
Definitely.

131
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,040
Nonsense. What role model?

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,800
You're welcome to come when you have time.

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,950
I have to catch a flight.

134
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,560
I'll go first, alright?

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,270
Okay, okay, okay.

136
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,270

Zhao Youlin.

144
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,430
He's just putting on airs,

145
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,310
pretending to be so arrogant.

146
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,840
He started out
as a construction contractor.

147
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,430
Your business has grown significantly
over the past few years.

148
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,360
Now you're even joining auctions.

149
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
You know very well my assets.

150
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,160
I hitched a ride with a friend

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
just to see what it's all about here.

152
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,890
Why don't you bid on a few items?

153
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
Auctions are for big bosses.

154
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,560
It's not for us
at the bottom of the pyramid,

155
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
right?

156
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,070
I think you just got used to
getting wholesale prices.

157
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,130
You don't want middlemen
to profit from the markup.

158
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,440
Uncle.

159
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,180
Are you interested

160
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,430
in getting some Song Dynasty ceramics
from tombs?

161
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,570
We can both make some money.

162
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,120
I'd like to get something for nothing too,

163
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,450
but this kind of fortune

164
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,159
is not meant for me.

165
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,040
What do you mean?

166
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,800
Look,

167
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,810
Song Dynasty ceramics were produced
in large quantities during the dynasty.

168
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,510
They weren't very valuable then.

169
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,710
Who would consider them as grave goods?

170
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,120
So you're saying we can't dig up

171
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,610
Song Dynasty ceramics from tombs?

172
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,160
The chances are slim.

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,290
Let's buy some then.

174
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,200
That's why you should take the lead
and set an example first.

175
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,920
Song Dynasty ceramics are so popular now,

176
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,240
and there aren't many sources
to get one of them.

177
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,190
Scarcity increases value, right?

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,310
In a few years, the price will skyrocket.

179
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,830
Let's not talk about these uncertainties.

180
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,350
I've brought the things.

181
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,630
Take a look.

182
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,380
These are all good pieces.

183
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,480
As usual,

184
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,750
tell me your price first.

185
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,560
Two million.

186
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,950
Are you kidding? Two million?

187
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,030
One million at most.

188
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,870
If Winthrop Auction House
auctions these items,

189
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,750
they'll at least multiply the price by 10.

190
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,230
You have seen a lot and know better.

191
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,240
You must be clearer about this than I am,
right?

192
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,840
All these years, I've considered you
a friend.

193
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,000
I've never wanted to complain,

194
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
but my brothers

195
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
risk their lives every day digging graves.

196
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,100
They're barely making ends meet.

197
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,070
I just want to earn them
some more hard-earned money.

198
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,080
We're all risking our lives doing this.

199
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,539
Alright, alright.

200
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,030
I'll take a bit of a loss.

201
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll add 200,000,

202
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,080
okay?

203
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,480
We're buddies, aren't we?

204
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,210
Two million.

205
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,020
I've already made a firm promise
to my brothers.

206
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,720
Mu.

207
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,480
You're talking tough, aren't you?

208
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,200
Don't think that just because
you've connected with Zhao Youlin,

209
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,960
someone will cover for you.

210
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,630
These collectors are all social elites.

211
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,000
They live in the spotlight.

212
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
I bet you

213
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,150
they absolutely don't dare to
take those items from the tomb.

214
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,760
Thanks for the reminder.

215
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,510
But, turning down money

216
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,470
is something I've never seen
in this business.

217
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,570
I'm leaving.

218
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,000
Ms. Luo.

219
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,160
What brings you here?

220
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,840
I had the professors from the provincial
institute take a look at the stone.

221
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,510
They all said they've never seen
anything like it before.

222
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,440
Guo Shilin's response is the same.

223
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,870
Uncle Youliang is eager
to start construction.

224
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,730
If there's no problem,
you should let him continue.

225
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,910
So you think there's no problem too?

226
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,390
Why?

227
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,080
Have you found anything?

228
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,120
Not yet.

229
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,510
So you haven't found anything new either.

230
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,870
Why waste time on those stones?

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,860
There's nothing worth studying.

232
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,150
Do you know

233
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,210
which dynasty those stones are from?

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,130
I don't know either.

235
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,930
If we don't find it out,

236
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,000
how can we conclude that
they have no research value?

237
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,750
I'm just trying to
give you a friendly reminder.

238
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,630
Don't waste your effort.

239
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,360
I know you're trying to
remind me out of goodwill.

240
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,220
Let me express my opinion as well.

241
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,150
These river pebbles
with highly consistent shapes

242
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,610
appeared in a place
where they shouldn't be.

243
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,080
Don't you find that suspicious?

244
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,390
We haven't even checked
the surrounding hydrology

245
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,440
or any other miscellaneous aspects.

246
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
And now we're saying it's not worth it,

247
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,630
no need to investigate further.

248
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,490
Do you think that's appropriate?

249
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,960
Fine.

250
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,170
Then go ahead with your irrigation well.

251
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,910
Give me Mr. Zan's work notebook.

252
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,200
We're going for a field survey tomorrow.

253
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,910
I can't give it to you.
I haven't finished reading it yet.

254
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,080
You're not even going on the field survey.

255
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,720
Why are you hogging the resources
without using them?

256
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,580
Ms. Luo, you...

257
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,360
Look.

258
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,600
How come after these years of fieldwork,

259
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,790
your speech has become so down-to-earth

260
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,320
and your actions have become
so uncivilized?

261
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,010
Cut the crap! Give it to me!

262
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,670
I can't.

263
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,870
Alright.

264
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,840
A single man and woman
in someone else's house late at night,

265
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,700
arguing and making a fuss.
Is this any way to behave?

266
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,720
Fine.

267
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,670
Go ahead and be stubborn.

268
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,240
Kun.

269
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,180
What do you want for lunch?

270
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,670
It's been a long time since I had

271
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,530
Auntie's oil-splashed noodles.

272
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
I want to try it again.

273
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,320
Okay, I'll go tell my mom to prepare it.

274
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,380
Alright, alright.

275
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,160
Xiaoman.

276
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,000
What?

277
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,550
I want to ask you something.

278
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,080
Go ahead.

279
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,030
You know, those stones in the well,

280
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,600
have you seen them anywhere else?

281
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,360
Stones?

282
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,470
No, I haven't.

283
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,830
Then, when Mr. Zan

284
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,480
was staying at your home,

285
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,940
did he take any stones
or anything like that?

286
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,490
Oh my goodness.

287
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,470
It's been so long.

288
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't remember.

289
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,680
It's okay, I was just asking.

290
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,510
Qing.

291
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,790
Good morning.

292
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,320
Morning.

293
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,720
Mom.

294
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,790
Where's the fresh garlic?

295
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,840
In the back.

296
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,230
Here, Mom.

297
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,390
When Professor Zan stayed
at our place back then,

298
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,480
do you remember him having a stone?

299
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I don't remember.

300
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,000
Think about it.

301
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,720
It's been so long.

302
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,780
Who can still remember those things?

303
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,950
What does this stone
have to do with Mr. Zan?

304
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,980
According to Mr. Zan's notes,
there was a stone before.

305
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,090
[Field survey results of the Han Mausoleum]
[A new topic for exploration and excavation]

306
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,480
But only the stone's dimensions
were recorded.

307
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,610
It didn't say
where the stone was from.

308
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,990
No wonder you've held onto the notebook
without giving it to me.

309
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,390
Why didn't you say so earlier?

310
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,990
After I returned to the site,

311
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,240
you've got so hot-tempered,

312
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,910
ready to shout at me at any moment.

313
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,310
I dare not to provoke you.

314
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,730
Alright, alright.

316
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,760
I forgive you.

317
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,500
So what should we do next?

318
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,510
I think,

319
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
Mr. Zan would not

320
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,240
place so much importance on a stone
for no reason.

321
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,640
Right?

322
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,790
I want to first go and check out

323
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,480
the situation in that well.

324
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,240
Then go to other places to search

325
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,170
to see if I can find a similar stone.

326
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,360
It would be best if we could confirm

327
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,030
where the stone in Mr. Zan's possession

328
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,150
was discovered.

329
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,080
Fang Kun.

330
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,790
If you need any help,

331
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,040
remember to call me.

332
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,840
I...

333
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,630
Ms. Luo.

334
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,630
I'm ready.

335
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,440
And this is for you.

336
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,390
What? It's not for you, Kun.

337
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,720
What's he doing?

338
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,120
Well, just let him have it.
He's afraid of getting sunburned.

339
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,030
But he's already so tanned.

340
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
I've marked out the route,

341
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,670
using villages as units.

342
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,600
How should we proceed along the route?

343
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,630
Usually, we walk in a straight line
or a V-shape.

344
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,960
If the intervals are large,

345
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,000
we should walk in a zigzag pattern.

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,630
At the same time, we need to
pay attention to natural cross-sections

347
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,510
and modern artificial borrow pits.

348
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,960
If we encounter any ruins or artifacts,

349
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,870
a positioning device is needed to
measure the precise latitude and longitude.

350
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,360
Then mark the relative positions
on the topographic map.

351
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,600
And we also need to take

352
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
relevant written notes.

353
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,600
Xiaobai,

354
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,080
dig a few more holes.

355
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,000
You must be precise
when you use the shovel.

356
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,840
Keep your feet steady.

357
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,870
Keep your eyes sharp.

358
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,000
Observe carefully.

359
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,840
Okay, got it.

360
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,020
It's like four traditional Chinese medical
diagnostic methods, right?

361
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,870
Look, doesn't this look like rammed earth?

362
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,440
But there's neither
an accumulation of tiles

363
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,970
nor the variegated earth section
of the tomb.

364
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,690
But it still looks like rammed earth.

365
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,820
So what should we do in this situation?

366
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,550
What do you do?

367
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm here to do archaeology.

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,600
Young man.

369
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
I've seen you before.

370
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,730
A few years ago,

371
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,200
you came here looking for looting pits,
didn't you?

372
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Auntie, you have a great memory.

373
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,080
You can still remember me
even though my hair has grown so long.

374
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,870
Why are you looking at this stone?

375
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,780
What's the meaning of examining it?

376
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,790
Auntie Li, you really have
such limited knowledge.

377
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,240
What's wrong with examining a stone?

378
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,080
I've even seen people
examine clods of earth.

379
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,390
They examined a big clod of earth

380
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,510
for half a day.

381
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,440
Then they wrote and drew something on it.

382
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,270
Go away. What do you know?

383
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,170
You don't understand. You...

384
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,920
Are you a college student?
A graduate student?

385
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,150
A graduate student.

386
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,480
So you're here to

387
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,340
examine these clods in the field?

388
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,150
You must be working
for a government institution.

389
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,890
How much do you make a month?

390
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,080
Well,

391
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,580
let's not worry about how much I can earn.

392
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,150
If you find any stones like this one

393
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,550
in other places,

394
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,790
let me know.

395
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,790
I'll pay you, okay?

396
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,310
You even pay for this?

397
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,720
-How much?
-Is it valuable?

398
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,920
I'll make sure you don't lose out, okay?

399
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,640
Really? Is that true?

400
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,480
Even stones are worth money,

401
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,200
right?

402
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Then tell us how much it is worth.

403
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Tell me, can the presence
of surface artifacts

404
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,440
be used as a criterion for determining
whether it's an archaeological site?

405
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,200
No, it can't.

406
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,400
It depends on whether the artifacts
are in their original context

407
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,960
or have undergone a secondary movement.

408
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,420
This requires further excavation to prove.

409
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,250
That's only half correct.

410
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,240
Because sometimes,

411
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,680
simply through archaeological excavation,

412
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,540
we can't get a definitive answer.

413
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,200
Okay.

414
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,680
What's the difference between
traditional archaeological survey methods

415
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,790
and the Systematic Regional Survey?

416
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,790
Traditional...

417
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,680
After dinner, come to my place to
pick up some literature.

418
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,240
They cover information on
Emperor Taizong of Han's Zi Mausoleum,

419
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,270
Dou Mausoleum, and South Mausoleum.

420
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,200
Take notes on everything
you think is useful.

421
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,350
Alright, understood.

422
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,210
Professor Luo.

423
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,490
-Kun.
-Sorry to interupt you.

424
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,120
Are you giving a lecture?

425
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,970
What's the meaning of this?

426
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,680
Doesn't he do well after he came?

427
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,810
Why are you being so harsh?

428
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,570
What are you? A dragon?

429
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,410
Could you lower your voice?

430
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,080
Could you lower your voice?

431
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,400
Field archaeology must
follow a scientific process.

432
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Whether it's reviewing previous work

433
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,920
or starting a new investigation,

434
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,750
you need to take notes.

435
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,480
You're sitting while making the kid stand.
Look what you're doing.

436
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,590
Here.

437
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
Let me sit for a while.

438
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,830
Let me ask you something.

439
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,790
Tell me about the achievements
of Emperor Taizong of Han.

440
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,640
In the early Han Dynasty,
due to years of warfare,

441
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,310
the economy was in decline,

442
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,310
and people could barely make a living.

443
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,440
Emperor Taizong advocated
the Huang-Lao philosophy,

444
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,720
promoting reduced forced labor
and lower taxes

445
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,680
and recuperation and relaxation
for the people.

446
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,070
The economy and culture quickly recovered.

447
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,680
Later, Emperor Jing
continued this philosophy,

448
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,210
further developing
the economy and culture.

449
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,400
This period

450
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,920
is considered to be a time of

451
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,350
rapid economic and cultural development
in Chinese history.

452
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,350
-Well said.
-It's also...

453
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,880
Look at him, this young man.

454
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,070
This is basic cultural knowledge.

455
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Now let me ask you,

456
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
the Nine Western Han Mausoleums
are in Wulingyuan,

457
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,030
but why was Emperor Taizong
buried in Bailu Plain?

458
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,920
The ancients emphasized
etiquette and rules,

459
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
stressing the arrangement of spirit tablets
in ancestral temples, called Zhaomu System.

460
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,680
No one could overstep their bounds.

461
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,030
Emperor Taizong was
Emperor Hui's younger brother.

462
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,270
He wasn't the eldest one
or a legitimate son,

463
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,200
so he wasn't qualified to be an emperor.

464
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,680
If he had been buried

465
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,880
with his brother and father in Wulingyuan,

466
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,480
it would've challenged the tradition
of respecting seniority.

467
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,400
Excellent.

468
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,790
You're so brilliant.

469
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,830
If the full score is 10,

470
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,360
he only deserves one point.

471
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,110
You'd better study hard.

472
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,640
Don't be influenced by him.

473
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,070
Look at you.

474
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,640
Gosh.

475
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,700
Take care, Ms. Luo.

476
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,550
Sit down, come on.

477
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,350
No, it's okay.

478
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,280
Sit down. Do your thing over there.

479
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,950
Ms. Luo is just like this.

480
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,480
Look at the way she is

481
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
all day long.

482
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,830
She's the same with me.

483
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,070
Very difficult to deal with.

484
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,930
Let me tell you,

485
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,590
often,

486
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,640
she makes unreasonable demands,

487
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,480
is impossible to communicate with,

488
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,310
and makes things up out of nothing.

489
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,640
I've been dealing with her
for a long time.

490
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,450
I can do nothing. I can't leave.

491
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,440
What you said is not wrong.

492
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,350
If I were like you,

493
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,350
I would have left long ago if I could.

494
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Leave? Where to?

495
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,960
I mean, Ms. Luo is right.

496
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,550
I only deserve one point.

497
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,560
Let's put the Fengjiapo case aside
for now.

498
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,790
Recently,

499
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,830
there have been frequent thefts

500
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,110
at Song Dynasty ceramic kiln sites
in Shangyi.

501
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,270
In the cultural relics market,

502
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,200
the hype around Song Dynasty ceramics
has inexplicably skyrocketed.

503
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Police departments from various regions

504
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,720
have already sent out
joint investigation notices.

505
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,270
Next,

506
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,510
the Relics Inspection Team's task

507
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,040
is to inspect the market,

508
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,790
assist in the investigation,

509
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,480
and strictly prevent opportunistic dealers

510
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,770
from illegally trafficking such ceramics.

Yes.

We can't.

Yes.

covering a wide range of artifacts.

538

I'm not sure if these few items

539
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,850
would be worthy of
Director Zhao's esteemed collection.

540

present your treasures,

542
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,630
they must be something good.

550
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,680
you're joking a bit too much.

551
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,350
These aren't just
antiques or collectibles.

552
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,680
They're cultural relics.

553
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,640
As you can see,

554
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,000
in our Mingde Museum,

555
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,030
every exhibit has a clear identity

556
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,030
and provenance.

557
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,030
These items of yours with unclear origins,

558
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,960
[Nameless Pavilion]

559
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,290
we dare not accept them.

560
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,240
I understand.

561
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,960
Then I won't bother you anymore.

562
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,680
Let me see you out.

563
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,240
No need.

564
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,880
Our Mingde Museum
used to be the Mu residence.

565
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,200
Have you heard of
the Mu family from Qinchuan?

566
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,110
I've heard a little about them.

567
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,000
The name of the museum

568
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,140
is inspired by the old saying:

569
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,550
"The way of Great Learning
lies in illuminating bright virtue."

570
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,550
It's mainly to use this old teaching
to discipline us.

571
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,480
The origins of cultural relics
should be very clear.

572
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,550
-Items from pits are not allowed.
-Please.

573
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,440
People from Qinchuan

574
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,550
have all heard something about them
more or less.

575
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,070
During the Daoguang era,

576
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,680
they prospered through business

577
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,920
and became a fourth-rank prefectural
magistrate through donation.

578
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,640
They were practically
as wealthy as a nation.

579
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,000
The Mu family

580
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,510
also had a fondness for antiques.

581
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,400
So, after accumulation
over several generations,

582
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,270
they amassed countless collections.

583
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,070
When first establishing our museum,

584
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,440
we were fortunate enough to
acquire some of their pieces.

585
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,900
But who would have thought

586
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,030
that such a family

587
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,240
would also decline?

588
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,070
Mr. Mu.

589
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
This way, please.

590
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,550
I-I came in from over there.

591
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,010
This way.

592
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,680
Okay.

593
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,470
Come, take a look at the base.

594
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,920
This is called a full-glazed base
fired with sesame-shaped support nails.

595
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,480
Bro.

596
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,350
This is a genuine Ru Kiln piece
from the Song Dynasty.

597
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,700
The situation has been tense lately.

598
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,830
Let me tell you.

599
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,680
It's just because I see
you really like it.

600
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,940
Let's cut to the chase.

601
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,070
I-Is this really from the Song Dynasty?

602
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,530
I'll give you a tenfold penalty
if it's fake.

603
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,350
I'm from the Relics Inspection Team.

604
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,440
What you just said

605
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,270
has all been recorded on video.

606
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,730
Where did you get
this set of Ru Kiln teaware?

607
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,310
Bro.

608
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,270
Bro.

609
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,720
You'd better not be joking with me.

610
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,980
Who's joking with you?

611
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,790
I'm asking you where you got it.

612
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,190
Let me be honest with you.

613
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,920
These are all just handicrafts.

614
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,400
Look.

615
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,070
They're all identical.

616
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,800
They really aren't artifacts?

617
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,270
Why would I lie to you?

618
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,310
Bro, look, look.

619
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,440
Look.

620
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,970
I smashed one for you, look.

621
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,550
Just a handicraft.

622
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,240
Alright, welcome back next time.

623
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,590
Okay.

624
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,830
Jianhui, you're back.

625
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,360
I'm back.

626
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,320
What was the inspection team looking for
in the South Market today?

627
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,920
I heard they were looking for
Song Dynasty ceramics.

628
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,960
The situation is quite serious.

629
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,720
They've even caught their attention.

630
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:32,900
Jianhui.

631
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,010
Should we follow the trend?

632
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,680
At a time like this,
the best choice is to stay out of it.

633
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,940
Don't even display handicrafts
of Song Dynasty ceramics.

634
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,720
Alright.

635
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,050
Who's there?

636
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,330
Working overtime so late at night?

637
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,810
Isn't this Ms. Luo?

638
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,320
What's up? What's going on?

639
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,630
Nothing much.

640
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,200
I came to see you.

641
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,130
What a rare visitor.

642
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,790
Why are you here to see me?

643
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,650
I'm here to double-check the data

644
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,210
to see if I missed anything.

645
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,040
Is that the diagram you drew?

646
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Let me take a look.

647
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,240
Sure.

648
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,560
Let's have Ms. Luo take a look

649
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,740
and give me a score.

650
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,640
Here.

651
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,250
Not bad. It's two points
higher than Xiaobai's.

652
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,310
You've improved.

653
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,270
Alright, two points.

654
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,790
Getting Ms. Luo's approval

655
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,550
is not easy. Thank you.

656
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,740
The person you should thank is not me.

657
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,960
It's Mr. Zan.

658
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,950
If it weren't for him,

659
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,510
your drawing skills

660
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,030
wouldn't have even matched Xiaobai's.

661
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
I agree with that.

662
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,680
Don't sit on the ground.

663
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,790
It's so cold.

664
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,510
Here.

665
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,400
How's it going? Any progress?

666
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,310
Nothing for now.

667
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,480
Well, Mr. Zan

668
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,930
has passed away for so many years,

669
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,860
yet he left us another puzzle.

670
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,180
Do you remember back then,

671
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,960
why Du Mausoleum Village
was called Du Mausoleum?

672
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,290
Because of a homophone,

673
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,120
it gave us quite a hard time.

674
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,280
I wonder what these stones mean.

675
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,240
Why are you

676
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,070
being so harsh now?

677
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,920
You're becoming
more and more like the old man.

678
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,480
I'm not that harsh, am I?

679
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,340
You think I'm too hard on Xiaobai?

680
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,350
You're going to such great lengths.

681
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,500
What exactly do you want him to learn?

682
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,080
I just want him to
know that this is a job.

683
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
It's tedious, dull,

684
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,890
and even boring.

685
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,960
There's no romance.

686
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,760
It's not beautiful or romantic.

687
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,480
I want to show him the hardest,

688
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,610
most unbearable side of archaeology.

689
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,410
If he can accept it,

690
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,130
he can stay and work.

691
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,750
If not,

692
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,980
I'll advise him to change careers early.

693
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,880
I don't agree with you.

694
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,400
I think it depends on the person.

695
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,110
Remember the time
when we used to go on excavations?

696
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,840
We'd sing songs every day
as we went to the fields.

697
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,530
How romantic it was.

698
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,830
There was a field over there.

699
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,000
Do you remember what Guo Shilin

700
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,460
always called that field?

701
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,000
The field of hope.

702
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,000
We rode bikes,

703
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,590
chasing the sunset

704
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,750
and greeting the sunrise
in that field of hope.

705
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,010
Wasn't that romantic?

706
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,130
Why are you still such an idealist
after all these years?

707
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,680
Just because you think this way

708
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,210
doesn't mean others do too.

709
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,750
You can't represent the mainstream
of this industry.

710
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,840
Several of my classmates

711
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,860
have already switched careers
to sell coal.

712
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,490
When we just graduated,

713
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,110
yes, we could move on with our ideals

714
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,510
and romance.

715
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,120
It's passion, you know?

716
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,240
But what about after getting married
and having kids?

717
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,300
In the end, reality brings everyone
back to square one.

718
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,130
What about you?

719
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,920
Staying in Qinchuan

720
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,510
alone.

721
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,020
What are you after?

722
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,090
Guo Shilin asked me this question too.

723
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,110
I told him

724
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,560
it was because of ideals.

725
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,450
But that's not entirely true.

726
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,680
Because at that time,

727
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,410
I didn't know how to answer him.

728
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,240
But now I have an answer.

729
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
A few years ago,

730
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,310
♪ The past ♪

731
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,400
I

732
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,370

Have you found anything?

759
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,480
I've seen the burial chamber.

760

I'll go in and take a look.

761
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,120
Yes, yes, you go.

762
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,030
Look at you,

763
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,000
all flustered and panicky.

764
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,660
What are you so nervous about?

765
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,640
I wouldn't take on this delicate job
if I didn't have relevant skills.

766
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,110
Are you sure this is the tomb
of that Miao something?

767
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,790
It's the tomb of Miao Guangyi,
a Founding General of the Northern Song.

768
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,990
This is his hometown.

769
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,680
Many Song Dynasty tombs
have been excavated here before.

770
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,880
They're all related to the Miao family.

771
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,030
I've searched for

772
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,470
this tomb for a long time.

773
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,270
If I weren't certain it was his tomb,

774
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,440
I wouldn't dare to offer you this price.

775
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,920
Don't speak too soon.

776
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,740
Not until we find Song Dynasty ceramics.

777
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,560
Sheng.

778
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,850
It's beautiful.

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,920
Slow down. Don't touch anything.

780
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,480
How many pieces of ceramics are there?

781
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,210
Nine pieces.

782
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,889
They're all Ru Kiln pieces.

783
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,800
How do you know
they're all from the Ru Kiln?

784
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,440
Where else can you find
Song Dynasty ceramics in Shangyi?

785
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,590
What else could it be besides the Ru Kiln?

786
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,650
Look at this color.

787
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,670
They all look like duck eggshells.

788
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,330
As for Song Dynasty ceramics,

789
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,840
where else can you find
such a greenish tint besides Ru Kiln?

790
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,719
It's absolutely stunning.

791
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,480
There's even an inscription here.

792
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,110
Look.

793
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,510
Miao Xun, courtesy name Guangyi,

794
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,000
is from Miaodian Town in Sheqi County.

795
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,730
In the first year of Guangshun,

796
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,110
Chen...

797
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,110
Qiao.

798
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,670
Chenqiao Mutiny.

799
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,630
Zhao Kuangyin seized power
from the Later Zhou Dynasty.

800
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,510
He declared the country name as Song

801
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,890
and became the founding emperor
of the Song Dynasty.

802
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,190
He appointed Miao Xun as

803
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,920
the Grand Military Advisor
of the Nation...

804
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,400
End...

805
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,960
And.

806
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,190
He had another title.

807
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,590
And the Chief of the Astronomical Bureau.

808
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,320
Qiande Imperial Inscription.

809
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,710
This is an inscription by Qianyu Imperial.

810
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,570
Oh my goodness.

811
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,590
Who is Qiande Imperial?

812
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,850
What Qiande Imperial?

813
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,710
Qiande is an era name.

814
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,280
"Imperial"
means the emperor's own handwriting.

815
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,030
It was inscribed by the emperor himself.

816
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,510
These are two separate things.

817
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,960
It's not Qiande Imperial.

818
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,000
Bro.

819
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,280
Look,

820
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,480
Miao Guangyi was from Sheqi County.

821
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,230
This was personally bestowed upon him
by Emperor Zhao Kuangyin.

822
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,030
If this isn't his tomb,

823
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,290
whose tomb could it be?

824
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,160
You must be relieved now, right?

825
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,640
Alright.

826
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,090
Give me a price for these nine pieces.

827
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,490
You want all of them?

828
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,190
After all this effort,
you think I'd leave any behind?

829
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,320
You don't have a market for them anyway.

830
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,520
I'm doing you a favor.

831
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,550
Song Dynasty ceramics
are in high demand now.

832
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,410
Among them,
the best ones are those from the Ru Kiln.

833
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,330
Since you're so sincere...

834
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,530
One million.

835
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,510
You think I'm a fool?

836
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,690
Then you tell me.

837
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,480
Look at you.

838
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,880
Is this how you haggle?

839
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,630
You're a better haggler
than someone who just halves the price.

840
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,360
This number.

841
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,480
Take it

842
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,670
or leave it.

843
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,280
500,000.

844
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,890
I'll get the money right away
if you're okay with it.

845
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,590
Alright.

846
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,050
Let me tell you,

847
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,550
I want cash, right now.

848
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,200
It's so lively here.

849
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,000
Come on, come on.

850
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,260
Look at you, all perky.

851
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,590
You even set off firecrackers
for your birthday.

852
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,050
Sister.

853
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,280
I've been having bad luck
these past two years.

854
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,000
Set off some firecrackers
just to ward off evil spirits.

855
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,920
What are you talking about?

856
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,360
Look, she even brought you a cake.

857
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,000
It smells terrible here.

858
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,670
-Why did you bring that?
-Let's go.

859
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,360
Come inside, come inside.

860
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,800
Let's go in and put the things down first.

861
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,840
Take the things, take the things with you.

862
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,040
Thank you, Shusheng.

863
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,630
Look how pleased you are.
You've been carried away.

864
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,030
Go inside and have a seat.

865
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,440
I heard you've recently acquired
a batch of Song Dynasty ceramics.

866
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,230
You're going to make a big fortune.

867
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:49,670
Why?

868
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,590
Want to make us jealous?

869
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,320
Listen to yourself.

870
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,440
How petty.

871
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,480
What do you mean by making a fortune?

872
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,880
We're preserving cultural heritage here.

873
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,440
Perfect timing.

874
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,730
Come and conduct an appraisal?

875
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,660
Where are they?

876
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,030
Right here.

877
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,660
So many pieces?

878
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,250
Don't rush. Let's examine them one by one.

879
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,070
Come on.

880
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,190
This is the first piece.

881
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,560
Take a good look.

882
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,740
Where did you get this?

883
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,760
Where else can this come from,
given its quality?

884
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,020
From a tomb, of course.

885
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,690
Song Dynasty ceramics from a tomb?

886
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,440
In our province?

887
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,000
You're an expert.
Why are you talking like an amateur?

888
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,710
Do we have such pieces in our province?

889
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,970
I've never seen anything like it before.

890
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,330
Can you tell what it is?

891
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,630
It looks like a paper-mallet vase.

892
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,960
What kiln do you think it is from?

893
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,420
Judging from its color...

894
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,070
Could it come from the Ru Kiln?

895
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,280
It really is?

896
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,710
The Ru Kiln is in Shangyi.

897
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,930
You made this fortune in Shangyi?

898
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,590
Don't ask a fellow professional, you know.

899
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,720
Right, right.

900
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,190
I understand.

901
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,120
Song Dynasty ceramics
are very precious now.

902
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,670
Even if you tell me,

903
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,920
I don't dare to get involved.

904
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,780
And I can't afford to be involved.

905
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,110
Are these all from the Ru Kiln?

906
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,960
Open them and take a look.

907
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,800
No, no, no.

908
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,510
They're very expensive.

909
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,030
Take a look, come on.

910
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,150
If I chip or bump it,
I can't afford to compensate.

911
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,320
Who's asking you to compensate?

912
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,360
Close them up.

913
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,510
Well then, tell me an estimate.

914
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,330
You're overestimating me.

915
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
In the past, for items under seven digits,

916
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,300
I could still count on my fingers.

917
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,230
But for such high-end artifacts,

918
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,590
I don't have enough fingers to count.

919
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,040
I can't tell you an estimate.

920
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,670
Can't or don't want to do so?

921
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,670
I really can't.

922
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,280
You can only ask King Hua.
He's an expert.

923
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,710
You're in for a treat today.

924
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,640
Take a good look.

925
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,320
Are you kidding me?

926
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,000
What do you mean?

927
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,960
You said you had Song Dynasty ceramics.

928
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,160
That's why I came all this way to see you.

929
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,590
You brought me a handicraft?

930
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,090
What are you doing?

931
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
What handicraft?

932
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,360
I spent over a million.

933
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,960
I personally got it from a Song tomb
in Shangyi.

934
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,280
It's a genuine piece from the Ru Kiln.

935
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,230
This is a Song Dynasty ceramic
from a Song tomb?

936
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,230
What do you think?

937
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,860
How could there be Song Dynasty ceramics
in a Song tomb?

938
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,110
If there are no Song Dynasty ceramics
in a Song tomb,

939
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,240
where could these ceramics come from?

940
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,230
From Tang or Qing tombs?

941
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,200
You don't know anything.

942
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,450
I can't explain it to you anymore.

943
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,230
Why don't you go home and ask Jianhui?

944
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:37,840
Okay?

945
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,160
He's already seen it.

946
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,670
He spotted it at a glance.

947
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,590
This is a Northern Song Ru Kiln piece.

948
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,920
He didn't even estimate the price.

949
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,780
He told me to come straight to you.

950
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,320
Jianhui knows

951
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,320
that you got a Song Dynasty ceramic
from a Song tomb?

952
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,440
Of course he knows.

953
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,800
Haven't you seen this glaze color?

954
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
It's so pleasing.

955
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
Well, do you want it or not?

956
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,280
What are you laughing at?

957
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,190
Let me tell you.

958
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,110
If you can't afford it, just walk away.

959
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,150
I'll find someone else.

960
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,760
Mr. Liu,

961
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,070
in our line of work,

962
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
we must be very cautious.

963
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:20,150
We must verify authenticity
before finding a buyer.

964
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,070
You're right about that.

965
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,260
You just don't believe
this item is genuine.

966
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,110
Let me show you another small plate.

967
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,140
Take a good look
at what's written on the bottom.

968
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,000
This inscription was written
by Zhao Kuangyin himself

969
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,920
for Miao Guangyi.

970
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,400
See for yourself.

971
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
I've seen enough.

972
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,670
Jianhui

973
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,960
is quite knowledgeable in this business.

974
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,150
Go home and ask him if it's genuine.

975
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,190
Then you'll know.

976
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,710
Okay?

977
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,880
See you next time.

978
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,320
Bye.
