[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,800
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,060
Who would offend the boss
for a little lackey?

4
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,640
Speak.

5
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,460
Who?

6
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,780
Routine check.

7
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,389
Open the door.

8
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,639
Open your doors.

9
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,910
Hurry up, hurry up.

10
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,400
It's me.

11
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,790
Get in the car.

12
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,600
Why did you get here?

13
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,590
I heard some rumors in the South Market.

14
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,320
I was worried something
might happen to you here.

15
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:29,480
Uncle.

16
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,310
Thank you.

17
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,840
Thank you, Uncle.

18
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,530
If you had come a moment later,

19
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,360
I would have been done.

20
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,920
Don't be a stranger.

21
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,120
I'll take you out of the city first.

22
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
The county roads
are less strictly monitored.

23
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,420
We'll take the back roads.

24
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:43,950
Alright.

25
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,550
Alright, alright.

26
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,050
About King Hua,

27
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,630
too many people are involved.

28
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,410
Everyone on his chain of interests
fears something might happen to him.

29
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,140
Someone's bound to tip him off.

30
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,530
Plus, this guy is as cunning as a fox.

31
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,490
The hotel he stays at
is hard for ordinary people to find.

32
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,490
The key is that all the IDs
he uses are fake.

33
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,430
The difficulty of cultural relic crime

34
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,710
lies here.

35
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,590
Our target

36
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,880
isn't just one person,

37
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,680
it's a network.

38
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,000
About King Hua's network,

39
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,899
what do we have?

40
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,960
Just a portrait.

41
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,930
So now,

42
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
we have two paths.

43
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,650
The first path is

44
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,700
focusing on King Hua.

45
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,070
But if we just chase after him,

46
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,540
we'll be passive.

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,890
The second path is

48
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,850
focusing on looting pits.

49
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,700
I think looting pits won't move.

50
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,360
Let's focus on the looting pits.

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,409
Captain Qi.

52
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
How are we going to keep an eye on it?

53
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,130
Look,

54
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,690
Qinchuan is so vast.

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,960
We have limited manpower.

56
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,830
How are we going to
keep an eye on each one?

57
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,630
On this point,

58
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,920
I think Fang Kun's idea
makes sense.

59
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,000
Black pottery figurine
are high-grade burial items,

60
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,910
most likely from
an emperor's or empress's tomb.

61
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,560
Let's focus on the
Western Han Imperial Mausoleums.

62
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,740
But what if this black pottery figurine

63
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,800
doesn't come from the imperial tomb?

64
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,310
Besides, those three graduate students

65
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,910
aren't 100% certain either.

66
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,090
Now you're just being difficult.

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,450
No, I'm just reasoning.

68
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,520
If you say that,

69
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,120
the Earth might explode,
so we'll wait and die?

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,030
How is it?

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
The thermoluminescence testing
results are out.

72
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,680
What's the result?

73
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,140
The department picked 2 pottery figurines.

74
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,350
One male, one female.

75
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,900
Look,

76
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,970
two Western Han-style pottery figurines.

77
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,680
The test results show
they're from different eras.

78
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,630
The male one is from

79
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,360
Western Jin.

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,650
The female one is from

81
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,650
Mid-Western Han.

82
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,900
What's going on here?

83
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,170
It's like an old sow

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,860
giving birth to

85
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,120
a cat and a dog.

86
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,800
Let's ask

87
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
about this.

88
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,600
Director Zhang.

89
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,550
Captain Qi. Captain Yang. You're here.

90
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,710
Come, have a sit.

91
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,310
So much to deal with
at the construction site every day.

92
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,310
You've worked hard.

93
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,070
It's fine.

94
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,510
You...

95
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,360
You're here for the results.

96
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,560
We've already given them to you.

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
There's an issue.

98
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,390
Look.

99
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,600
One is from the Western Jin,
and the other is from the Western Han.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,130
This is a mistake, isn't it?

101
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,610
It's hard to say.

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,610
Sit down first, I'll pour you some tea.

103
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,010
What do you mean by "hard to say"?

104
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,690
Logically,

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,540
it shouldn't be a mistake.

106
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,030
After all, this is an experiment
done by the provincial team.

107
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,580
They're very meticulous.

108
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,310
Right.

109
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,600
Right.

110
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,170
The thermoluminescence testing

111
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,670
has its limitations.

112
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,310
Sometimes,

113
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,880
there can be some errors.

114
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,950
Errors?

115
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,480
How big can the errors be?

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,430
Come, sit, have some tea.

117
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,070
Thank you.

118
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
How big can the errors be?

119
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,950
Sit down, I'll explain it slowly.

120
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm just impatient.

121
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,480
Hurry up.

122
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,040
Look.

123
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,210
When using it

124
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,390
to identify

125
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,160
items within 2000 years,

126
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,450
the error can be reduced to 100 years.

127
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
If conditions are ideal,

128
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,440
the error can shrink to 5%.

129
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,360
Right.

130
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,190
One is from Western Jin,
and one is from Western Han.

131
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,000
It's still wrong.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,580
Right.

133
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,490
Captain Qi.

134
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
We can't say it's wrong.

135
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,250
Let me tell you.

136
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,040
The thermoluminescence testing

137
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
has very strict requirements

138
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,040
for the conditions of testing.

139
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,360
If the testing conditions or environment

140
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,920
are not ideal in all aspects,

141
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
the error

142
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,560
can reach up to 90%

143
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,730
and draw the opposite conclusion.

144
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,130
Talking to you educated folks

145
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,440
is really tiring.

146
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,950
Let's

147
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,780
just get to the point.

148
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,600
Just give me the conclusion.

149
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,830
Is the conclusion unreliable?

150
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,220
That's hard to say.

151
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,250
Strictly speaking,

152
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,100
I can't give you a definitive answer.

153
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,560
Is it an error in the experiment,

154
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,920
or is there a time gap between the
2 pottery figurines?

155
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Let the experts and professors

156
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,520
have a look and decide later.

157
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,409
My goodness.

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,679
Director Zhang

159
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,240
has always saying that it's hard to say.

160
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,390
What's the point of having a mouth then?

161
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,990
Might as well sew it shut.

162
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,060
Saying a whole bunch

163
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,960
amounts to nothing in the end.

164
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Those experts are

165
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,480
all meticulous.

166
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,970
Meticulous.

167
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,890
He's being meticulous.

168
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,790
But we've only got a month.

169
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,990
Dacang, don't rush.

170
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,630
Let's eat first.

171
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,240
Stop thinking about it.

172
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,580
Dacang.

173
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,370
If it really doesn't work,

174
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,380
just use your simple method.

175
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,860
There are eleven

176
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,600
Western Han Imperial Mausoleums in total.

177
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,930
Nine are in Wulingyuan.

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,800
One's in Bailu Plain.
One's in Du Mausoleum Plain.

179
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,920
I'll bring some people over.

180
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,520
We'll search inch by inch.

181
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,260
Okay?

182
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,080
I think

183
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,590
I need to practice qi.

184
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,000
Calm down, calm down.

185
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,370
Speak.

186
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,720
Those three graduate students
are here again.

187
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,480
They've heard there are
experimental results

188
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,270
and wanted to look at
the black pottery figurines again.

189
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,800
How about

190
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,730
I come up with some excuse to
send them away?

191
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,430
No, no, no.

192
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,840
Calm down.

193
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,850
From today on, I'll be calm.

194
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,900
We need to handle things steadily.

195
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,240
Fang Kun

196
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,810
is reliable.

197
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,240
Many things he said.

198
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,280
I think are valuable.

199
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,370
Maybe he can even help us.

200
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,030
You go handle the paperwork,

201
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,090
I'll be there soon.

202
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,450
Captain Qi.

203
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Put the bags here.

204
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,650
You can't take it in it.

205
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,620
Captain Qi.

206
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,230
Sign here.

207
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,220
Alright.

208
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,890
I'll do it.

209
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,880
It's from the same tomb.

210
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,850
How can there be a 400-year difference?

211
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,110
Could there have been a problem
with the sampling process?

212
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,000
Impossible.

213
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,890
The Provincial Identification
Research Institute

214
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,150
is one of the top
Archaeology lab in the country.

215
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,080
From the craftsmanship,

216
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,050
it's definitely from Western Han.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,660
Captain Qi.

218
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,680
I need to tell you something.

219
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,690
Don't touch it.

220
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,250
Alright.

221
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,010
How's it going?

222
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,020
We'll go back and check the documents,

223
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,000
and give you an answer
as soon as possible.

224
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,900
That black pottery figurines

225
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
do look different from each other.

226
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,670
Where are you going?

227
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,530
The car's here.

228
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,580
You said you'd go back
and check the documents.

229
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,380
Did you find something just now?

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,370
What?

231
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,100
Come.

232
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,250
What?

233
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,550
You...

234
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,550
Are you crazy?

235
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,270
You've rubbed the color off
the black pottery figurine.

236
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,460
Do you know that touching cultural relics
without permission

237
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,460
can lead to punishment?

238
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,120
As long as you don't report me,

239
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,540
what punishment could I face?

240
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,330
Why do you think

241
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,460
we won't report you?

242
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,720
Where are you going?

243
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,450
The library.

244
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,600
Call us.

245
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,770
Fang Kun.

246
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,280
Fang Kun.

247
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,360
Fang Kun.

248
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
Fang Kun.

249
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,070
I've been looking for you for a while.

250
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,320
Do you have any ideas?

251
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,000
Tell us,

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,330
don't keep it to yourself.

253
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,460
We're accomplices now.

254
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,670
At least let's die knowing the truth.

255
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,930
I'm not an accomplice.

256
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,030
Let me tell you,

257
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,240
if you don't give me
a reasonable explanation,

258
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,700
I'll report you right now.

259
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,100
Think about it.

260
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,330
What's the principle of
thermoluminescence testing?

261
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,030
The pottery figurines are exposed to heat
during their making,

262
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,360
then they store energy.

263
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,600
During the testing,

264
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,060
this energy is released
in the form of light,

265
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,910
which helps determine
the time of its last heating,

266
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,690
and then infer the manufacturing time.

267
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,290
The time of its last heating.

268
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,080
The time of its last heating.

269
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,880
How could I have overlooked
such a simple concept?

270
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,970
So?

271
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,010
Do you remember

272
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,500
Mr. Zan talked about a case?

273
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,620
A collector

274
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,340
took a Western Zhou pottery

275
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,090
for thermoluminescence testing.

276
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,950
When the report came out,

277
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,240
it determined that the pottery was
a Ming's imitation of Western Zhou.

278
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,260
Because in the Ming Dynasty,

279
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,840
the pottery had been burned by fire,

280
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,170
which caused the error.

281
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,480
Got it?

282
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,620
I understand.

283
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,150
So, if this male figurine

284
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,430
was burned during the Western Jin,

285
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,430
the thermoluminescence testing result

286
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,000
would also be from the Western Jin.

287
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,540
Exactly.

288
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,710
I've always been curious.

289
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,200
Why are these pottery figurines black?

290
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,120
The cracks, the eyes, the noses.

291
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,630
All the holes are black.

292
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,120
Right.

293
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:44,910
Even the butt cracks

294
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,510
are black.

295
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,340
What?

296
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,100
Butt cracks...

297
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,160
Alright, alright.

298
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,640
If it had a black glaze,

299
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,410
it wouldn't be so densely coated.

300
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,340
It wouldn't get into all the holes.

301
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,690
That's why I suspected

302
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,270
it might have been burned.

303
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,130
So they were burned,

304
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,990
but why are only the male figurines

305
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,390
dated to the Western Jin?

306
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,790
Shouldn't they all be dated
to the Western Jin?

307
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,820
Did you notice?

308
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,900
The male figurines

309
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,870
are all black.

310
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,020
And the black color penetrates deep
into the clay

311
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,580
and evenly distributed.

312
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,030
The female figurines

313
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,140
are not that black,

314
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,490
and the color isn't evenly distributed.

315
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,770
I think I know.

316
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,750
I think

317
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,260
the male figurines

318
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,000
were closer to the fire
when they were burned.

319
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,460
Like the grilled potatoes.

320
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,910
Black and shiny.

321
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,070
The female figurines

322
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,340
were further from the fire.

323
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,690
Like smoked chicken.

324
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,530
Being far away,
they were burned unevenly.

325
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,190
I think you should stop with archaeology
and start roasting chicken.

326
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,850
Isn't it a vivid description?

327
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,440
You really get it when it comes to food.

328
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,100
So what are you looking for?

329
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,500
I read a document before.

330
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,890
It said tomb robbery was rampant
during the Wei and Jin periods.

331
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,710
Tomb raiders robbed the emperor mausoleum.

332
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,380
I suspect

333
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,840
the fire was caused by those tomb raiders.

334
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,900
If we can figure out

335
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,040
which emperor mausoleum they robbed,

336
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,640
we might be able to

337
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,990
pinpoint the location of the looting pit.

338
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,910
Sorry.

339
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,450
You can't bring the bag.

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,550
It's the first time I've seen

341
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,750
this batch of black pottery figurines.

342
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,590
The bodies are slender

343
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,770
and the muscles are robust.

344
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,420
Every part

345
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,780
follows the principles of human anatomy.

346
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,950
They were stolen from
Zi Mausoleum and Du Mausoleum.

347
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,800
Many treasures were taken.

348
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,880
Please wait for a moment.

349
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,400
Captain Qi.

350
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,880
Please wait.

351
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,920
Those are either
from Zi Mausoleum or Du Mausoleum.

352
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,580
Don't go in.

353
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,330
What are you doing?

354
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,720
The black pottery figurines are either
from Zi Mausoleum or Du Mausoleum.

355
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,880
Go on.

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,960
The thermoluminescence
testing results show

357
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,150
that the male figurine
is from the Western Jin,

358
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,040
and the female figurine
is from the Western Han.

359
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,680
These errors

360
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,740
are likely because they were burned.

361
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,200
There must have been a fire

362
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,130
in the tomb during the Western Jin.

363
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,290
I read a paper before,

364
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,400
it mentioned that during the Western Jin,

365
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,130
an emperor mausoleum was robbed
by tomb raiders.

366
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,920
The fire

367
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
might have been
caused by the tomb raiders.

368
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,440
And we went to find this paper.

369
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,510
In the Book of Jin,

370
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,440
it's mentioned.

371
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,160
Look,

372
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,680
in the Biography of
Suo Chen in Book of Jin.

373
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,110
It says that at the end of Western Jin,

374
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,000
there was constant warfare.

375
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,200
Hungry people in Chang'an

376
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,750
were stolen from
Zi Mausoleum and Du Mausoleum.

377
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,280
Many treasures were taken.

378
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,750
This means that
the Zi Mausoleum and the Du Mausoleum

379
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,150
were indeed robbed during the Western Jin.

380
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,110
These black pottery figurines

381
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,480
were likely stolen from these two tombs.

382
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,110
Based on that,

383
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,920
can you be sure they were burned?

384
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,970
At first, I didn't know

385
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,160
why they were black.

386
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
Then I got closer and thought,

387
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,280
why is this female figurine's

388
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,760
color so uneven?

389
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,070
It seems like
there's some colored painting.

390
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,270
At that moment, I thought

391
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,400
maybe it was burned.

392
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,830
So I wiped it with a glove,

393
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,090
and sure enough, it...

394
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,610
Get out of here!

395
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,970
Mr. Zan.

396
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,790
Why are you just standing there?

397
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,250
Get out!

398
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,590
Go, go, go.

399
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,860
Chief Zhao.

400
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,140
Captain Qi.

401
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,510
What era

402
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,920
are these butch of black pottery figurines

403
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,030
from?

404
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,030
We can't draw a conclusion yet.

405
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,760
We still need to study it more
with the professors.

406
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,590
What my student

407
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,350
said earlier,

408
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,080
don't take it seriously.

409
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,240
You'll investigate as you should,

410
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,650
don't let his nonsense

411
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,820
affect you.

412
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,280
Don't worry.

413
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,400
You think you're so great just because
you got three questions right?

414
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,460
But you've gotten a little too cocky.

415
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
You destroyed cultural relics!

416
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,300
What's the difference between you
and the tomb raider?

417
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,110
Mr. Zan, I...

418
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,530
was the only one

419
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,630
who wiped the relics.

420
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,310
It has nothing to do with them.

421
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,630
You can punish me however you like,

422
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,060
but I must stick to my conclusion.

423
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,830
The black pottery figurines
either came from the Zi Mausoleum

424
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,510
or the Du Mausoleum.

425
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,660
You're really something, aren't you?

426
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,690
What did you eat today?

427
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,740
I haven't eaten yet.

428
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,380
Mr. Zan, how about we go eat?

429
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,450
Alright.

430
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,360
What did you eat last night?

431
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,500
Last night, I had bread soaked in soup.

432
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
It is delicious.

433
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,450
It's great.

434
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,680
So are we having it again tonight?

435
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,410
I'm not having it.

436
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,400
Tonight, we can have lamp soup.

437
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,070
Alright.

438
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,790
Mr. Zan didn't even ask
what you wanted to eat.

439
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,450
Luo Qing.

440
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,860
What do you think I want to say?

441
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,860
Mr. Zan wanted to say that

442
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,890
the paper mentions

443
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,980
that during the Western Jin,

444
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,440
the Zi Mausoleum
and Du Mausoleum were robbed.

445
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,790
But we can't just assume

446
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,450
the black pottery figurines
came from one of them.

447
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,240
Maybe other emperor mausoleums

448
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,340
were also robbed during the Western Jin,

449
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,540
but they weren't recorded in the paper.

450
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,400
I just wanted to say,

451
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,570
we shouldn't make assumptions

452
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,110
based on intuition

453
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,520
when dealing with materials.

454
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,610
What's that called?

455
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,370
Empiricism.

456
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,730
I've told you countless times,

457
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,070
that archaeology is an empirical science.

458
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,110
It's all about evidence!

459
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,970
What we fear most is

460
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,880
interpreting history
with subjective judgment.

461
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,840
You eat one bite at a time,

462
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,190
you walk one step at a time.

463
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,810
I know you're smart,

464
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,980
but don't let your cleverness
lead to mistakes.

465
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,650
Mr. Zan.

466
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,880
We understand our mistake.

467
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,300
Right, we understand.

468
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,830
Alright.

469
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,040
Think about it

470
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,560
when you go back.

471
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,000
Write a self-reflection.

472
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Leave.

473
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,480
Okay.

474
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,400
Tang,

475
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,790
[Baliu Relics Protection Institute]

476
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,560
Captain Yang.

477
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,690
Welcome.

478
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,870
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

479
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,480
I just wanted to catch you off guard.

480
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,120
See if you've been doing your job.

481
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
Or if you're neglecting your duties.

482
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,700
You're here to question me. Sit down.

483
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,730
Sit down.

484
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,790
This tea's not great, don't mind it.

485
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,500
It's fine.

486
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,600
Right.

487
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,830
This is Captain Qi from
the Cultural Relics Investigation Unit

488
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,160
of Qinchuan City Public Security Bureau.

489
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,920
Captain Qi.

490
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,880
You've heard about
the black pottery figurines case, right?

491
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,340
Yeah, I've heard about it.

492
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,740
Baliu Relics Protection Institute

493
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,700
oversees the cultural relics of
the Du Mausoleum and the Zi Mausoleum.

494
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,550
We came here today to ask you something.

495
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,350
Have some tea.

496
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,340
Thank you, thank you.

497
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,400
-We just want to ask.
-Captain Qi.

498
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,930
Have tea.

499
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,840
Was

500
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,480
there anything

501
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,420
unusual

502
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,170
earlier this year?

503
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,960
Captain Yang,
what kind of question is that?

504
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,240
If something happened here,
would I not report it?

505
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,900
No signs of anything unusual.

506
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,010
Any unfamiliar faces?

507
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,510
Captain Qi, don't worry.

508
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,920
Du Mausoleum and Zi Mausoleum

509
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,780
are both
national-level cultural heritage sites.

510
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,030
Everyone here has received
cultural relic conservation training.

511
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,010
If something had happened,

512
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,540
we would've noticed by now.

513
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,750
The black pottery figurines

514
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,870
definitely have nothing to do with us.

515
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,300
Why is Mr. Zan's

516
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,900
relationship with Fang Kun so tense?

517
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,290
Let me give you an example.

518
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,570
It's like one person being like Sun Wukong

519
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,800
and the other like Master Bodhi.

520
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,200
Sun Wukong

521
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,510
travels across mountains and rivers

522
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,640
to seek out Master Bodhi for training.

523
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,640
Master Bodhi sees his talent

524
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,890
and teaches him

525
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,350
the 72 transformations,

526
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,080
and the secret to immortality.

527
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,570
But then, Sun Wukong

528
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,840
shows off in front of
his fellow disciples.

529
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,370
Master Bodhi gets mad

530
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,300
and kicks him out of the mountain.

531
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,600
That's pretty vivid.

532
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,570
Where are you going?

533
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,750
Bailu Plain, looking for the looting pit.

534
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,150
Right.

535
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,000
Write the self-reflection for me.

536
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,130
You're good at that.

537
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Stop, stop, stop.

538
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,750
So Mr. Zan's words

539
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,310
didn't even get through to you, huh?

540
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,020
Still clinging to those

541
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,580
unrealistic fantasies?

542
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,200
He was too soft on you
when he scolded you.

543
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,920
You're just too clever for your own good,

544
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,030
always in a hurry to get ahead.

545
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,710
Kun, Luo Qing's right.

546
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,600
You really need to reflect.

547
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,550
What's your job? What can you do?

548
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,720
You need to have a clear idea of that.

549
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,980
I know what I need to do.

550
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,030
I just need to prove

551
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,580
the black pottery figurines are
from either Zi Mausoleum or Du Mausoleum.

552
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,160
Let go.

553
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,070
Move aside.

554
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,540
He's hopeless.

555
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,250
We need to chant
the tightening spell on him.

556
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,340
Less than one patrol per week.

557
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,980
What did they say at the city meeting?

558
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,000
It's far,

559
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,030
but at least patrol every three days.

560
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,720
Come on,

561
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,680
you've worked at the grassroots level too.

562
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,280
You know the situation here.

563
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,730
There's a sign outside.

564
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,030
Two departments share one office.

565
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,270
Looks lively,

566
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,590
but in reality,

567
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,910
besides me, there are only 3 people left.

568
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,740
Du Mausoleum is close,

569
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,310
a patrol takes three hours.

570
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Zi Mausoleum's farther, 40 miles away.

571
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,820
It takes me two hours to ride a bike

572
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,570
from here to Zi Mausoleum.

573
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,360
Besides,

574
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,680
Zi Mausoleum isn't just one tomb.

575
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,160
It's a big area.

576
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,960
If I patrol the whole area,

577
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,890
it takes 6 hours.

578
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,230
I know the difficulties.

579
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,750
But knowing isn't enough, Captain Yang.

580
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,020
You need to help us solve the problem.

581
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,880
Forget about the person,

582
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,640
let's talk about this bicycle.

583
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,510
I've already worn out two this year.

584
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,200
No funds to replace them.

585
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,270
Director Wu brought his own bicycle.

586
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,020
He even had an argument
with his family over it.

587
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,400
Don't talk about the difficulties anymore.

588
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,070
I've been listening for a while.

589
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,720
The patrol

590
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,830
at Zi Mausoleum

591
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,880
is inadequate.

592
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,830
Now,

593
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,470
there's a possibility

594
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,350
of a case at
Nan Mausoleum and Dou Mausoleum.

595
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,030
These two are near the village.

596
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,110
If something happens,

597
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,640
the villagers will definitely notice.

598
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't agree with that.

599
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,920
The villagers are busy,

600
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,940
they're not here to watch the Mausoleums.

601
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,900
Besides, this is your job.

602
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,690
Who says we're only relying on
the villagers?

603
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,110
We have volunteered cultural relic

604
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,240
conservators at Yin Village.

605
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,790
They're dedicated and responsible.

606
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,920
I'm from Yin Village.

607
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,520
Which one?

608
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,080
You're from Yin Village.

609
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,010
A bachelor in your village,

610
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,240
named Yan Shoucun.

611
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,160
What?

612
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,790
Don't talk about
asking him to watch the Mausoleum.

613
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,250
If you tore down his house,

614
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,240
he'd probably not even notice.

615
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,110
Captain Qi.

616
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,830
Right now, it's good
if we can even find anyone.

617
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,560
Yan Shoucun?

618
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,600
Yan Shoucun.

619
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,190
You little thief!

620
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,210
Little thief!
I've been waiting for you for ages!

621
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,240
What are you doing?

622
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,750
Stop being stubborn.

623
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,750
Who's the little thief here?

624
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,200
I knew something was off
with you during the Shehuo.

625
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,550
What?

626
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,880
You're here again today?

627
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,800
-I've had enough of you.
-Stop shouting.

628
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,240
If you keep shouting,
I'll stuff your mouth.

629
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Come on, tie me up.

630
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,770
Stop shouting.

631
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,230
What...

632
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,110
Open your mouth.

633
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,440
Are you going to open it?

634
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
Still not opening it?

635
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,340
Come on, get up.

636
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,210
Get up!

637
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,130
You get up and walk!

638
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,450
Walk!

639
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,160
What's the progress

640
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,650
on the Wulingyuan's investigation?

641
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,720
I've been with Captain Yang's team,

642
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,240
and we've gone through nine Mausoleums.

643
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
They all say there are no looting pits.

644
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,440
What do you mean?

645
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,090
You can't just listen with your ears,

646
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,500
you have to see with your own eyes.

647
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,760
We've seen them.

648
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,550
You have no idea how many glares

649
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,750
we've gotten these past couple of days.

650
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,750
Everyone thinks
we're coming to cause trouble.

651
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,030
If it weren't for Captain Yang,

652
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,430
no one would've
even bothered to talk to us.

653
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,750
It's the same with me.

654
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,750
I'm hated by everyone now.

655
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:35,970
Captain Qi.

656
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,260
Chief Zhao wants you to come over.

657
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,650
Go!

658
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,510
Go, didn't you hear?

659
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,730
Hurry up.

660
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,870
Youliang.

661
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,950
Come on, move.

662
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,910
Move.

663
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,160
Youliang. I've got the little thief!

664
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,420
The tomb raider.

665
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,310
Look.

666
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,740
What little thief?

667
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,530
This guy didn't bring any tools with him.

668
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,350
How's he a tomb raider?

669
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,490
Shehuo...

670
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,810
I've been watching him since Shehuo.

671
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,480
Today,

672
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,560
I saw him on the plain,

673
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,430
Riding a bike,

674
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,190
he kept circling around Dou Mausoleum.

675
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,490
You take that towel off him.

676
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,570
L-Let him speak.

677
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,010
No!

678
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,940
What's your meaning?

679
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,800
You trying to steal my credit now?

680
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,950
Hurry up and call Qi Dacang!

681
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,770
Tell him to come.

682
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,770
If he doesn't come, I'm not leaving.

683
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,960
You fool.

684
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,640
You went to
the Relics Protection Institute

685
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,970
to order people around?

686
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,680
What's going on?

687
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
Did Director Tang complain?

688
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,310
Not doing real work, but quick at this.

689
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,230
You're too straightforward.

690
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,370
What were you supposed to do here?

691
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,750
To investigate, to make inquiries.

692
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,720
Not to lecture people.

693
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,860
They didn't patrol once a week

694
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,440
for Nan Mausoleum and Dou Mausoleum.

695
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,640
No wonder they can't stop tomb raiders.

696
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,240
You're annoying.

697
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,070
Director Tang told you.

698
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,590
They have their own difficulties.

699
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,640
His difficulties? Right now,
the hardest thing is for us police.

700
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
I checked around,

701
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,350
his problems are the biggest.

702
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,590
How dare he

703
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,110
come to complain?

704
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,640
Send me a few men,

705
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,920
I'll handle it myself.

706
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,720
Let him see

707
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,110
how it's done.

708
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,790
Can't you see

709
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,390
how busy the whole bureau is?

710
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,590
You think I'm

711
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,270
some kind of magician?

712
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,510
Just snap my fingers and
have people appear out of thin air?

713
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,350
Yeah, sure, you're quite the expert.

714
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,550
Stop sucking up to me.

715
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,720
I'm a cow, you can't butter me up.

716
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,840
And besides,

717
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,290
you don't know how big Bailu Plain is.

718
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,220
It's not a job for just a few people.

719
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,080
Fine, I'm coming right now.

720
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,200
To catch a tomb raider.

721
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,590
Go.

722
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,660
I just brewed some new tea.

723
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,550
It's good tea.

724
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,900
Save me some.

725
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,660
Alright, I'm talking to you.

726
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,100
No, stay put.

727
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,170
I won't let you run away.

728
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,510
What's going on with you?

729
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,830
How long's it been
since you washed that towel,?

730
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,520
You're gonna suffocate the guy.

731
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,030
Dacang hasn't even come yet
and you've already messed up.

732
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,960
I don't want to talk to you.

733
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,400
I'll wait for Dacang to get here.

734
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,160
Then I'll talk to him.

735
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,020
You usually act all dumb,

736
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,720
but now you think you're someone?

737
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,770
You think you're someone now?

738
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,400
When something happens,
can you take responsibility?

739
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,270
I can. I can.

740
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,590
What's going on?

741
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,300
What's going on here?

742
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,790
Dacang,

743
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,750
I've caught the tomb raider.

744
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,550
-What are you doing?
-Do you see?

745
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,920
This guy is a graduate student
from Qinbei University.

746
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,240
He's studying archaeology.

747
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,000
Look! Look! Look!

748
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,830
Did you hear that?

749
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,310
He's a graduate student
from Qinbei University.

750
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,200
He's studying archaeology.

751
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,160
He came here to do archaeology.

752
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,030
What little thief?

753
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,880
I don't care if he's
Monk Tang or Monk Sha.

754
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
He's just a little thief.

755
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,440
Sorry about that.

756
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,900
Hey, kid, you alright?

757
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,780
Give me some water.

758
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,480
Wait here.

759
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,340
Dacang.

760
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,020
Do you recognize him?

761
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,820
What are you messing around for?

762
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,170
Alright, alright.

763
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,540
Why'd you suddenly come to the plain?

764
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,190
Helping you find the looting pit?

765
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,610
That's the police's job.

766
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,580
You're just a graduate student.

767
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,410
Why are you getting involved in this?

768
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,830
I just want to prove that

769
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,070
my guess is right.

770
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,630
Are you arguing with your professor?

771
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,210
Argue with him?

772
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,440
T-this is an academic debate, you know?

773
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,590
If I can't find it at Zi Mausoleum.

774
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,190
I'll move on to Du Mausoleum.

775
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,550
Right, right.

776
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,250
Don't say anything more.

777
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,610
-Uncle.
-Let me tell you,

778
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,270
if Dacang hadn't come in time,

779
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,360
we wouldn't know
what to do with this situation.

780
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,040
Tonight, I'll have your aunt make the kid
a bowl of oil-splashed noodles.

781
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,770
That's our way of apologizing.

782
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,210
Uncle.

783
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,120
I'm investigating a tomb raiding case,

784
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,030
so I can't go into details.

785
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,720
I just want to ask,

786
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,190
have you heard of any looting pit
around Zi Mausoleum?

787
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,350
Zi Mausoleum.

788
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,770
Go ask at Phoenix Mountain.

789
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,810
It's about two or three miles
away from here.

790
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,960
How would I know about things there?

791
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,400
No.

792
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,300
I'm talking about Zi Mausoleum.

793
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,730
It's not just the tomb
of Emperor Taizong of Han.

794
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,210
What?

795
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,540
Zi Mausoleum isn't
the tomb of Emperor Taizong of Han.

796
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,400
Then what is it?

797
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,670
Well, the Zi Mausoleum

798
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,600
we're talking about is actually a broad concept.

799
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,310
It includes Emperor Taizong of Han's tomb,

800
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,270
as well as the tomb of Empress Dowager Bo

801
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,400
and Dou Mausoleum.

802
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:24,880
Then,

803
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,200
our place is closer to Dou Mausoleum.

804
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,990
But I haven't heard of
any looting pits around there.

805
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,470
Uncle,

806
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,010
can you find someone

807
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,160
to help get the bike back for him?

808
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,420
Alright,

809
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,890
small stuff.

810
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,500
I'll go.

811
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,160
-Here, take this.
-Good.

812
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,090
The blue one.

813
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,110
Alright, the blue one.

814
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,310
Thank you, thank you.

815
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,710
Fang,

816
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,960
what are you looking at?

817
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,840
I'm looking at this photo...

818
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,429
That's my dad and my great-grandfather.

819
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,880
It doesn't look like them.

820
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,810
What do you mean?

821
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,960
They'll look more alike
as they grow older.

822
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,310
Bro,

823
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,469
have some water.

824
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,800
Alright, thanks.
You go about your business.

825
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,860
No need to thank me.

826
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,920
Where's Heisa?

827
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:41,590
Lost.

828
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,540
Bro, how dare you ask?

829
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,020
Heisa got lost during Shehuo.

830
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,010
I told you about it already,

831
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,139
and you didn't care.

832
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,400
It's been so long.

833
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,639
Heisa still hasn't come back.

834
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,280
Still hasn't returned?

835
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,400
Yes.

836
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,670
You.

837
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,570
I told you,

838
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,560
it might be lost.

839
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,360
No way.

840
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,050
Heisa is clever.

841
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,110
During Shehuo,

842
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,540
I heard it barking in the field.

843
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,960
Then I ran into two people.

844
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,440
They looked suspicious,
not like good people.

845
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Heisa must have been stolen by them.

846
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,580
They probably ate dog meat.

847
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,200
Put it down here.

848
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,090
Bro, you head back.

849
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,410
Uncle's back. Uncle.

850
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,730
I found your bike, Dad!

851
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,170
Thanks.

852
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:21,900
Look at this,

853
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,450
the spokes are bent,

854
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,750
and the tire's popped.

855
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,030
It's gonna take a while to fix.

856
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,150
How about this?

857
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,560
Tonight, let Dacang take you home.

858
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,310
I still have to look for
looting pit on the plain tomorrow.

859
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,310
I'm not planning to go back tonight.

860
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,380
So where will you stay?

861
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,040
I'll stay at my Uncle's house.

862
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,150
The tomb area is so big,

863
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,750
how can he search by himself?

864
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,790
Tomorrow, I'll get a couple of
people to help.

865
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,790
Don't mention it.

866
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,030
The village is busy enough,

867
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,060
who has time to help?

868
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,230
Cultural relics are more
important than crops, right?

869
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,710
Well, of course, crops are more important.

870
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,340
What about cultural relics?

871
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
Can they be eaten?

872
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,900
Come on, at least you're the Chief, you
can't have such a low level of awareness.

873
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,760
Low awareness?

874
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,750
Do you know how many public grains

875
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,500
we've paid for these years?

876
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,860
I made sure everyone ate well
and lived well,

877
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,020
and you're saying I have low awareness?

878
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,220
What do public grains
have to do with it?

879
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,460
Alright, shut up.

880
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,240
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

881
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,830
You don't know anything.

882
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,800
Captain Qi. It's alright, I'll eat...

883
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,760
Eat.

884
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,710
Today, I've invited you all here

885
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:44,710
[Provincial Cultural Heritage Bureau]

886
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,630
to talk about the black pottery figurines.

887
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,590
In just a month,

888
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,060
the pressure is really high.

889
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,320
I hope you can overcome the difficulties

890
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,670
and provide solid evidence.

891
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,490
We need to make sure they have no excuses.

892
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,460
Right now,

893
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,260
there's some controversy
about the thermoluminescence results.

894
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,390
So, I suggest doing more experiments.

895
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,790
Before the final results come out,

896
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,590
we should also check some papers

897
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,030
to see if there are any records
of black pottery figurines.

898
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,150
College student.

899
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,070
You must really be here
to investigate our village, huh?

900
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,350
What's up?

901
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,770
What are you here to investigate?

902
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,530
Looting pit.

903
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,360
Looting pit?

904
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,560
I've been the cultural relic conservator
in this village for years,

905
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,630
and I've never heard of
any looting pits here.

906
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,310
Come on, get in the car.

907
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,540
I'll take you to look for it.

908
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,600
If we find just one,

909
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,620
I'll take my head off and

910
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,080
let you kick it like a ball.

911
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,100
Get in. Let's go.

912
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,520
I'll take you to find it.

913
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,180
Get in the car.

914
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,710
Uncle.

915
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,960
I heard you're

916
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,340
the only volunteered
cultural relic conservator around here.

917
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,880
They all say you're out
in the wind and rain,

918
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,400
doing your job well.

919
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,950
You're not easy.

920
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,900
You city folks sure know how to talk.

921
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,630
I'm not bragging.

922
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,270
I spend all day around Phoenix Mountain,

923
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,860
Nan Mausoleum

924
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,710
and Dou Mausoleum.

925
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,150
Even Emperor Taizong
of Han's great-grandson's

926
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,790
great-grandson

927
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,720
wasn't as dedicated as I am.

928
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,200
I even missed seeing my wife-to-be

929
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,190
for this.

930
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,580
They set up a date for me,

931
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,380
but I didn't make it.

932
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,060
No time.

933
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,150
Look at

934
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,010
my appearance,

935
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,670
it's not hard to find, right?

936
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,350
Right, right.

937
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,210
I feel like your vision
is even bigger than the Chief's.

938
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,590
Qi Youliang?

939
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,750
What does he know about
cultural relic conservation?

940
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,020
Does he know who
Emperor Taizong of Han is?

941
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,900
Does he know who Empress Dowager Bo is?

942
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,960
Does he know how Dou Yifang came to be?

943
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,570
Uncle, you know so much more than that.

944
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,380
What else do you know?

945
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,980
Tell me, I'm all ears.

946
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,630
If you wanna chat,

947
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,160
I could talk with you
for a whole day and night.

948
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,120
Captain Qi.

949
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,230
We've already interrogated him,

950
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,890
haven't we?

951
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,300
Yeah, we have.

952
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,560
But the interrogation now
isn't the same as the one before.

953
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,970
We've known the whole thing
on the plain.

954
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,730
We know every detail,

955
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,630
including

956
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,600
their background.

957
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,980
So, if we interrogate again,

958
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,270
it'll be totally different.

959
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,570
You actually believe
what that student said?

960
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,020
Professor Zan already said,

961
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,020
his conclusion isn't thorough yet.

962
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,900
It still needs more examination.

963
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,310
Who are you calling a student?

964
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,590
Don't try to flatter yourself.

965
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,940
Who said it's you?

966
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,440
Can you even read?

967
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,130
But I'll admit,

968
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,600
you are quite capable.

969
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:51,970
Right?

970
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,380
You're a little know-it-all.

971
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,420
Tell me,

972
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,860
has anything been moving out
from the plain recently?

973
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,400
Something came from Qigou Village.

974
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,060
The organizer is named Cheng.

975
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,650
Cheng Siqiang.

976
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,850
Cheng Siqiang?

977
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,790
Cheng Siqiang.

978
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,790
Cheng Siqiang.

979
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,480
I arrested him ten years ago.

980
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,260
He's out of prison now?

981
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,510
No wonder they say
you're sharp, Captain Qi.

982
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,590
Are you joking?

983
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,990
Today,

984
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,980
as long as it's tomb raiding on the plain,

985
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,160
just tell me.

986
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,230
Even if it's just
a few pieces of information.

987
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,050
That'll be fine.

988
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,340
But if you're spouting nonsense to me,

989
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,900
just for the charge of
assaulting a police officer alone,

990
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,160
I'll make sure you won't get away with it.

991
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,700
Look,

992
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,030
Doesn't it look like a phoenix's beak?

993
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,110
That's Phoenix Mountain.

994
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,740
To the northeast,

995
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,850
[Zi River]

996
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,460
it's near the Zi River.

997
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,750
To the southwest, it's near Bailu Plain.

998
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,110
[Phoenix Mountain]

999
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,550
[Bailu Plain]

1000
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,220
Look at all these mountains and rivers.

1001
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,750
The emperor sure knows
how to pick a tomb site.

1002
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:04,780
Uncle,

1003
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,980
do you know that
Emperor Taizong of Han's tomb

1004
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,910
in this location

1005
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,120
has another name?

1006
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,300
Wha?

1007
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,830
It's called the Cliff Tomb.

1008
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,150
Which cliff?

1009
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,610
The cliff of the mountain.

1010
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,040
It means,

1011
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,060
a hole is made halfway up the mountain,

1012
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,440
and they create
a tomb passage and chamber.

1013
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,480
You're saying,

1014
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,280
they fly up like birds.

1015
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,250
Then they dig a hole

1016
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,710
and put the coffin inside?

1017
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,840
I'm actually wondering,

1018
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,940
Why are both the Nan Mausoleum
and Dou Mausoleum

1019
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,700
[Nan Mausoleum]

1020
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,420
so grandly?

1021
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,120
[Dou Mausoleum]

1022
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,800
The Emperor

1023
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,660
made his tomb so small.

1024
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,510
[Phoenix Mountain]

1025
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,010
Because he was a good Emperor.

1026
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,300
When he ascended the throne,

1027
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,020
the economy was in recession,

1028
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,430
and everything was in disarray.

1029
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,080
So, he didn't want to
waste people's money after his death.

1030
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,070
He said that after his death,

1031
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,860
they shouldn't spend
too much money on him.

1032
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,370
But he was also a great son.

1033
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,270
So, he built a grand tomb
for his mother's Nan Mausoleum.

1034
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,740
As for his wife, Dou Yifang.

1035
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,740
Because she died later.

1036
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,380
And by then, the Western Han

1037
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,200
was wealthy,

1038
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,910
So they could afford

1039
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,800
to build such a great tomb for her.

1040
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,420
Emperor Taizong of Han must not have

1041
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,460
had a good relationship with his wife,

1042
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,010
Why else would their tombs
be so far apart?

1043
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,830
Uncle, you're really sharp.

1044
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:30,780
[Nan Mausoleum
Dou Mausoleum
Phoenix Mountain]

1045
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,550
You asked a good question.

1046
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:21,800
You see.

1047
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,190
Among the eleven emperor mausoleums
of the Western Han,

1048
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,590
their tombs are indeed the farthest apart.

1049
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,210
His father and Empress Dowager Bo

1050
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:29,980
were buried together.

1051
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,510
His son's

1052
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,550
Yangling Mausoleum, needless to say.

1053
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,220
They're in the same tomb
but in a different location.

1054
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,940
What?

1055
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,830
What is that?

1056
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,620
It means

1057
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,290
they're not buried

1058
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,460
in the same pit,

1059
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,210
but

1060
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,870
their Mausoleum

1061
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,000
are enclosed within the same big wall.

1062
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,530
In professional terms, this is called
“in the same tomb but in a different location".

1063
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,710
And there's a wall too?

1064
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,070
I've never seen that wall.

1065
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,790
I've been on patrol for so many years,
and I've never seen it.

1066
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,890
Well, then you'll just keep patrolling.

1067
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,970
I don't know where that wall is.

1068
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,470
Let's go, let's keep searching.

1069
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,000
Let's go, let's go.

1070
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,530
Let's go.

1071
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,060
You really know a lot.
