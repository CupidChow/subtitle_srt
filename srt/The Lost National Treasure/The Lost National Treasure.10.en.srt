[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,750
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:39,509
Brother.

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
-What are you looking for?
-Sit down. None of your business.

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,000
Sheng.

6
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,229
What's wrong?

7
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,650
Mu,

8
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,259
you must have known that the Song Dynasty ceramic I bought was fake.

9
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:50,990
Fake?

10
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,170
You bought it?

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,220
Didn't you say it was excavated from a tomb?

12
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,220
Stop pretending!

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,700
As soon as I said it came from a tomb,

14
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,840
you knew it was fake.

15
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,720
That must be it.

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,590
It's true that Song Dynasty ceramics are rare in Song Dynasty tombs.

17
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,480
But that doesn't mean there's none at all.

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,010
I've never been to Shangyi.

19
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,840
How would I know whether Shangyi

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,190
has a Song Dynasty tomb with Song Dynasty ceramics?

21
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,560
Even if you brought a professor from Qinbei University,

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,840
he might not know for sure.

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Even that fool King Hua

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
could tell it was fake.

25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,480
But you're saying you couldn't?

26
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,310
I've seen a few genuine pieces.

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,630
But my experience is limited.

28
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,120
I've never bought a fake one.

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,960
How would I know what a fake looks like?

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Let alone how to appraise it.

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,480
I've made a fool of myself again.

32
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,150
Just you wait. You'll see.

33
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,960
Brother, what are you looking for?

34
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,440
I'm too lazy to move.

35
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,710
Is there a catalog?

36
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,030
Yes.

37
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,240
Here.

38
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,750
Why are two photos missing?

39
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,150
What?

40
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,540
Two photos missing? That's impossible.

41
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,080
Good things can't be shown to just anyone.

42
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,830
I've kept the photos.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,950
Who are you?

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm the boss, Mu Jianhui.

45
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,750
You kept the photos.

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,360
Are those items still available?

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,420
Of course they are.

48
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm keeping them for someone who truly appreciates them.

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,500
Give me your address.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,560
I'll deliver them in person tonight.

51
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,410
The way you're holding it,

52
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,460
the angle and strength of the strokes are all wrong.

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,520
This requires inner strength.

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,030
It's not something you can master in a day or two.

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,490
Why are you learning this?

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,240
Trying to please Ms. Luo, huh?

57
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,520
Let me tell you,

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,710
instead of learning this,

59
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,030
you'd be better off training your tongue.

60
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,079
Straighten it out a little.

61
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,560
Even memorizing a Tang poem would serve you better.

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,870
Mr. Fang, you really think too little of people.

63
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,980
I'm serious about learning.

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,110
We're both men here.

65
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,770
We understand each other.

66
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,000
Fang.

67
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:00,840
Xian.

68
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,350
What is it?

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
Last time, you mentioned collecting stones.

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Was that true?

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,500
Yes, it was.

72
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,310
Here, take a look.

73
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,270
Be careful; it's heavy.

74
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,280
[Mount Tai Shigandang]

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,880
This is our family heirloom.

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,310
My mother-in-law says it's been passed down since the Tang Dynasty.

77
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,040
Now it's been passed down to me.

78
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
My good-for-nothing husband

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,430
has racked up a mountain of debt.

80
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,000
Last time you said you wouldn't let me get a raw deal.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,560
So, can you give me a good price for this?

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,920
What good price can we offer?

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,040
How could this be from the Tang Dynasty?

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,430
I'd say it's a modern reproduction.

85
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,560
You're an outlander. What do you know?

86
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,120
You can't tell one grain from another, yet you're talking nonsense here.

87
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,720
Please watch your language.

88
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,750
How can I not know?

89
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,920
This is called a Shigandang.

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,270
It's used to ward off evil spirits and protect the house.

91
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,270
It first appeared in "Jijiupian" by Shi You during

92
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,670
the Western Han Dynasty.

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,680
Besides, the words "Mount Tai Shigandang"

94
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
only appeared much later.

95
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,750
If it says "Mount Tai," then it's definitely not from the Tang Dynasty.

96
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,240
Got it?

97
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,560
Thanks for the lie.

98
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,310
That long neck of yours can't hold back your short tongue.

99
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,510
You're too talkative for your own good.

100
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,160
Fang.

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,430
Is she insulting me?

102
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,070
Please give us your judgment.

103
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,950
Would I really try to cheat you

104
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,830
out of a few bucks? Of course not.

105
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,920
Alright.

106
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,430
Well,

107
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,880
Xian,

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
I'll take this stone for now.

109
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
Whether it's from the Tang Dynasty or not,

110
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,290
I'll study it later.

111
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,740
There's one more thing.

112
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,510
Don't tell others about this for now.

113
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,950
What I want are these river pebbles.

114
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,750
If you come to me for every stone you find,

115
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,050
won't I become a pauper?

116
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,460
Right?

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,720
No problem, don't worry.

118
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,520
Well, I'll be going then.

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,750
You're quite generous, Mr. Fang.

120
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,120
Why did you accept it?

121
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,650
You've researched quite a bit about Shigandang.

122
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,040
Not really.

123
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,390
My ancestral home is in Shandong.

124
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,510
My grandpa was a history teacher.

125
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,390
He always made me read

126
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,560
books like "Spring and Autumn Annals"
and "Records of the Grand Historian."

127
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,270
I share the same name as Duke Huan of Qi.

128
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,920
Your full name is Jiang Xiaobai?

129
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,720
That's right.

130
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,350
My grandpa always told me

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,530
homesickness has a source and a destination.

132
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,310
When people wander outside,
their roots won't be severed.

133
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,909
So you're wandering out here

134
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,430
for Ms. Luo?

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,270
No.

136
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,630
I...

137
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,630
We're both men.

138
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,870
I'll just be blunt.

139
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,030
What is it?

140
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you like Ms. Luo?

141
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,560
Yes, I really like her.

142
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,120
You're acting strange.

143
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,970
Don't you like her?

144
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,540
I...

145
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,750
The food is ready.

146
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,430
Ms. Luo.

147
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,600
Why are you here?

148
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I came to keep him company.

149
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
How are you guys doing?

150
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,520
Any progress?

151
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,480
We dug up some tile fragments and such.

152
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,410
Come take a look.

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,460
Be careful.

154
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,270
The exterior features cord markings,

155
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,040
while the interior has a linen-like texture.

156
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,680
It should be from the Han Dynasty.

157
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,950
I found online that

158
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,159
there's something similar

159
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,830
to these stones arranged together

160
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,240
called "apron."

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
I've thought about that.

162
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,360
The river pebbles used for aprons

163
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,120
are basically five to
six centimeters in size.

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,800
These ones here,

165
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,950
on average, are about 25 centimeters each.

166
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,480
I see.

167
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,920
You understand?

168
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,430
I understand.

169
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,270
So, if that's the case,

170
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,830
Mr. Zan's stone is over 20 centimeters,

171
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,490
could it also be from the Han Dynasty?

172
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,960
It seems we're close to solving the puzzle

173
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,390
Mr. Zan has left to us.

174
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Put that down!

175
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,960
I've called the police.

176
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,330
Don't be afraid.

177
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,980
You must be Wen Wen.

178
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,000
You...

179
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,690
How do you know my name?

180
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,740
Guang told me.

181
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,770
You know Guang?

182
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,600
How else would I have gotten in
if I didn't know him?

183
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,540
It's alright.

184
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,790
Put it down.

185
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,220
Guang is my good friend.

186
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,760
No wonder Guang didn't let me come.

187
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,170
There are

188
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,840
so many treasures here.

189
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,590
Those are all

190
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
antiques that Guang has collected.

191
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,680
Guang doesn't just collect scrap.

192
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,140
He collects antiques too.

193
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,760
Is this your first time here?

194
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,130
Guang never let me come.

195
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,280
It's alright.

196
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,600
Well, if there's nothing else,

197
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,070
I just bought some groceries;

198
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,330
I'll go cook for Guang.

199
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,220
Wen Wen.

200
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,220
Come over here.

201
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,390
Since you're here, why don't you
come in and take a look?

202
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,990
Can I go in?

203
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,960
I said you can come in, so come in.

204
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,490
Alright.

205
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Brother, it's fresh out of the oven.

206
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,760
Wen Wen.

207
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,750
What are you doing here?

208
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,510
I saw the door was open, so I came in.

209
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,320
I thought it might be a thief.

210
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,610
Get out.

211
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,660
I said get out!

212
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,420
What are you shouting for?

213
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,370
Don't scare her.

214
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,180
Besides,

215
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,650
it's mealtime.

216
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,440
Aren't you going to invite her
to stay for a meal?

217
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,330
I just bought some groceries.

218
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,390
I was thinking of cooking a meal for you.

219
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,300
I'll go cook.

220
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,960
Okay.

221
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,350
Brother.

222
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,370
I... I'm sorry.

223
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,710
I told you last time,

224
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,720
no matter what method you use,

225
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,520
get rid of her.

226
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,490
Brother,

227
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,420
it's not like that.

228
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,370
She came to Qinchuan alone.

229
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,070
She had been deceived

230
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,960
and only just managed to escape.

231
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,820
I found her a place to stay nearby.

232
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,440
Could...

233
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,940
Could you please give me a little more time?

234
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,510
Please don't...

235
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,310
Don't do what?

236
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,630
Make her keep quiet forever?

237
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,880
If you were that scared,

238
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,430
you should've seen this coming.

239
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,480
She really doesn't know
what's going on here.

240
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,740
She might not know now,

241
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,830
but can you guarantee

242
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,410
she'll never find out?

243
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,890
Brother.

244
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,280
Brother.

245
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:15,770
How much?

246
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,150
I'd like to hear Mr. Zhao's opinion first.

247
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,010
Which Mr. Zhao?

248
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,380
My surname is Xiao.

249
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,000
Xiao,

250
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,320
it seems you're also an expert.

251
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,050
Let's not beat around the bush.

252
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,360
How about 220?

253
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,250
That's too high.

254
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,530
One hundred and fifty.

255
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,270
Well, let's round it off.

256
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,090
Two hundred.

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,260
One hundred and fifty.

258
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,030
Xiao,

259
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
if you can't make the decision,

260
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,030
let's call it a day.

261
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,440
Mr. Mu,

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,480
your words are harsh.

263
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,240
I'm the one doing business with you.

264
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,270
How can I not make the decision?

265
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,000
Two hundred.

266
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,370
Not a penny less.

267
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,390
Let me be frank upfront.

268
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,480
This item is quite desirable.

269
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,940
Many people are eyeing it.

270
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,790
Xiao,

271
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,750
the ship won't wait for those on shore.

272
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,150
Don't be so stubborn.

273
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,190
Who knows,

274
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,510
we might have many opportunities
to work together in the future.

275
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,480
Losing a big client over 50 yuan

276
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,360
is not worth it.

277
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,040
A big client wouldn't care about
three to five hundred thousand.

278
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,520
One hundred and seventy.

279
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,490
Deal.

280
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,630
Think of this as me networking
with a big client.

281
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,520
What are you doing?

282
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,510
Don't think it's too little.

283
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,040
I'll be counting on you to
pull some strings in the future, Xiao.

284
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,810
Your skills are not bad.

285
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,230
Uncle.

286
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,510
If you like it,

287
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,030
come often in the future. I'll cook for you.

288
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,240
Wen Wen,

289
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,720
I just heard you were looking for a job.
Have you found one?

290
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,430
No,

291
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,880
they wanted me to pay 100 yuan first.

292
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,960
They said

293
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,090
it was

294
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,930
an agency fee.

295
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,250
So I didn't go for it.

296
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
You're quite a smart girl.

297
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,370
Well,

298
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
I see that

299
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
you're quick-witted and diligent.

300
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,700
My wife is pregnant now,

301
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,960
but her health isn't very good.

302
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,270
I'm often busy and
don't have much time to care for her.

303
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,080
Would you be willing to move in
and keep her company?

304
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,000
We'll provide food and lodging,

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,330
plus 1,500 yuan a month.

306
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,400
One thousand five hundred?

307
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,360
What are you waiting for?

308
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,530
Hurry up and accept Brother's kindness!

309
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm willing.

310
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,630
Thank you, Uncle.

311
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Thank you, Brother.

312
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,820
You call Guang "Brother,"

313
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,550
Guang also calls me "Brother."

314
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,150
If you call me "Uncle" again,

315
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,120
it'll mess up the generational order.

316
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,450
Just call me "Brother."

317
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,850
Thank you, Brother.

318
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,120
Brother, let me get you a bowl of soup.

319
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,980
Have some soup.

320
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,960
I need a smack after dropping my chopsticks.

321
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,420
What's all the fuss about?

322
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,890
Keep it down a bit. Don't waste it.

323
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,250
Xiaobai

324
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,880
has gone to bed so early?

325
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,900
I asked him to go buy
some laundry detergent.

326
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,190
Xiaobai is quite nice, isn't he?

327
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,120
He's still out buying
laundry detergent for you this late.

328
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,580
He is a good person indeed.

329
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,510
I also think he's a good man.

330
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,070
From what I've seen
these past couple of days,

331
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,130
he's hardworking and eager to learn.

332
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,220
However,

333
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,720
he's a bit young compared to you.

334
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
What do you mean by that?

335
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
I don't mean anything.

336
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,450
Just stating the facts.

337
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,660
He's just six years younger than you.

338
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,040
First of all,

339
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm not that old.

340
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,930
I'm only five years older than him.

341
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,230
Secondly,

342
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,530
can't a woman be with
someone younger than herself?

343
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,660
Thirdly,

344
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,790
don't meddle in my love life.

345
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,150
You got it all over my face!

346
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,320
Can't I show a little concern for you?

347
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,580
What's wrong with you?

348
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,320
Hey, Bai.

349
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,360
What's up? Why are you still awake so late?

350
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,420
What's the matter?

351
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,120
Everything's fine here.

352
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,150
How's everything over there?

353
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,350
How's Xiaoxue doing?

354
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,440
What's happening?

355
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,550
Its appetite has gotten better
these past few days?

356
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,609
That's great news.

357
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,280
You should

358
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,720
bring the phone closer to Xiaoxue.

359
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,319
I want to say a few words to it.

360
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,589
I've been thinking about it
so much these past few nights

361
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,510
that I can't even sleep,

362
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,290
you know?

363
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,550
Put it on speaker.

364
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,680
What's wrong?

365
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,440
I wasn't asking you.

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,800
A colleague of mine has arrived.

367
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,680
Alright then, let's leave it at that.

368
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,210
I won't keep you any longer.

369
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,410
Get some rest soon.

370
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,410
What's the matter?

371
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,240
You're going back
in a couple of days, right?

372
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,690
No,

373
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,930
I've taken another half month off.

374
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,920
I'll be in your way for a few more days.

375
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Sorry about that.

376
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,920
I bought a little something for your child.

377
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,120
Thought I'd give it to you ahead of time.

378
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,510
My child?

379
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,040
Where did I get a child from?

380
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,200
I heard your phone call.

381
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
"I miss you so much."

382
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,030
How can you deny it now?

383
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,800
How did Xiaoxue fall for you?

384
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,680
Xiaoxue?

385
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,080
Your wife, the one you told to take care.

386
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,160
What are you laughing at?

387
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,090
What's so funny?

388
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,990
Fang Kun,

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
you're already a father.

390
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,580
Can't you be serious for once?

391
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,880
You're still laughing here.

392
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,680
How can you be so irresponsible?

393
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,630
If you don't want it, I'll head out now.

394
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,020
Xiaoxue

395
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,090
is a camel I raised.

396
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,670
It had just given birth
to a calf when I left.

397
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,580
Xiaoxue and I...

398

[I haven't named my child yet.]

399
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,190
I haven't named my child yet.

400
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,610
Why don't you, as its aunt, give it a name?

401
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,240
Crazy.

402
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,220
[Crazy.]

403
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,270
It's a male.

404
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,370
Boring.

405
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,880
I just gave this one a name.

406
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,950
It's called Dog Four.

407
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,960
That sounds awful.

408
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,770
[New message]

409
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,300
Then let's call it Camel Five.

410
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,320
Pig Three, Dog Four.

411
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,710
What a perfect match.

412
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,030
Why don't we marry them off?

413
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,030
You want to marry them off?

414
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,290
My Dog Four wouldn't be happy about that.

415
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,110
It's not for them to decide
whether they like it or not.

416
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,750
The two of them,

417
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,110
buried alongside Emperor Jing of Han

418
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,400
in the Yang Mausoleum,

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,520
might have already made
a secret pact for life.

420
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,030
Whether they made a secret pact or not,

421
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,090
how would you know?

422
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,520
Every damaged artifact

423
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,400
is a cryptic message,

424
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,280
penned by history
and addressed to the future.

425
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,350
Aunt, Uncle, you're having your meal?

426
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,960
Come on, eat up.

427
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,490
I'm not eating. I have to go.

428
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,960
Wait.

429
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,480
How can you not eat? Here.

430
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,350
-Take two eggs with you.
-Alright.

431
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,510
What? Are you still going to
look for the stone today?

432
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,640
I've searched a few villages
but found no clues.

433
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,070
I heard there's a market in town today.

434
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,350
It's crowded there.
Maybe I can find out something.

435
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,880
Look at you.

436
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,480
The stone isn't a pearl or a gem.

437
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,510
Who would specifically
collect something like that?

438
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,350
Look at you, coming back from so far away...

439

Hurry up and go.

You don't even go home.

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,480
You're just here for the stone.

442
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,400
Don't listen to her nagging.

443
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,240
If I were your parents, I'd be heartbroken.

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,700

are different from what we see.

557
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,450
We only care whether the item's
valuable or not.

558
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,250
They're calling it

559
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,960
an archaeological site,

560
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,880
claiming there's

561
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,440
tons of historical info

562
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,960
and scientific value hidden there.

563
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,420
There's a great deal of knowledge involved.

564
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,130
I suppose so.

565
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,910
Four bamboos.

566
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,130
Two characters.

567
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,980
I win.

568
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Four characters.

569
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,060
Pung.

570
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,560
I win.

571
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,880
Start from the fourth block on your side.

572
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,200
On your side.

573
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,460
Start from the fourth block on your side.

574
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,200
Nine bamboos.

575
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,350
Wait a moment.

576
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,750
Five characters, right?

577
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,300
We win.

578
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:15,740
You...

579
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,070
Are you guys cheating?

580
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,270
Don't talk nonsense.

581
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,600
Do I really need to say more?

582
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,510
A tap on the lighter
meant you were ready to win.

583
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,000
The thumb stood for one dot;

584
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,640
the other fingers, two dots.

585
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,270
A firm press meant "circles,"

586
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,640
a light one meant "characters,"

587
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,110
and a push meant "bamboos."

588
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,310
It was five characters, just like this.

589
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
No need to spell out the rest, right?

590
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,200
Brother, what do you want?

591
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,810
I want this to end right here.

592
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,290
Can you give me the IOUs?

593
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,130
Keep them safe.

594
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,870
This 300 is mine.

595
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,610
I'll take it.

596
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,810
There's one more thing.

597
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,960
This guy

598
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,240
has a baby at home
who's still being breastfed.

599
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,640
It's not easy for him to make money.

600
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,000
Don't get involved with him in the future.

601
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,420
Okay?

602
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
I'll do as you say.

603
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,730
Let's go.

604
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,770
Aren't you guys scamming me together?

605
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,030
I have to look for...

606
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,000
Let go of me!

607
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,360
What are you looking at?

608
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,070
Play your games.

609
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,110
Brother, we can't let this go
just like that.

610
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,110
We've left the table.
How can you still ask for the money?

611
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,970
That's enough.

612
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,440
If Uncle Youliang knows
you're playing mahjong here,

613
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,510
losing even your underwear,

614
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,880
will you still be able to go home?

615
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
I just wanted to
make some money for my family.

616
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,000
Make money? Make money by playing mahjong?

617
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,840
Aren't you a suona player?

618
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,110
You must earn quite a bit
with your skills, right?

619
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,000
We're in a modern era now.

620
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,240
Who likes to listen to that anymore?

621
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,400
Brother, you don't know.

622
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,130
Who still listens to the suona?

623
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,040
Here, take this.

624
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,440
What do you mean?

625
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,570
Take it, buy some food for your family.

626
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,640
Brother, you're too kind.

627
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,190
You...

628
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,440
Brother, you're right.

629
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,610
They were really infuriating.

630
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,550
You... Brother, how did you discover

631
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,750
that they were cheating?

632
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,550
Before, when we were doing
archaeological excavations,

633
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,880
I went to negotiate land acquisition.

634
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,940
After that, those people

635
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,750
ignored me completely at the mahjong table.

636
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,240
What could I do?

637
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,960
I had no choice but to just watch.

638
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,920
After watching for a while,

639
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,640
I discovered they were cheating.

640
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,170
After a long time,
I figured out their tricks.

641
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,450
The way those people

642
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,010
operated just now
wasn't sophisticated at all.

643
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,750
You're indeed a graduate student.

644
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,110
Look at me, I couldn't figure it out
for so long.

645
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,880
You're only thinking about winning money.
What can you figure out?

646
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Right, that's it.

647
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,550
Brother, it's like this.

648
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,310
Leave the matter of the stone to me.

649
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,310
In Baliu Town, I have a wide network.

650
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:18,230
[Supervision Zone]

651
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,440
I'm moving the chariot.

652
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,640
You're impressive.

653
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,110
Look at your lousy chess move.

654
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,240
My lousy chess move?

655
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,650
Now look at yours.

656
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,160
Let me see how can

657
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,180
you move.

658
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,150
Taiping.

659
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,210
You're back.

660
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:35,950
Uncle San.

661
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,030
Now that you're back, live a good life.

662
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,270
I understand.

663
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,070
Let us know if you need anything.

664
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,970
San,

665
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,070
you're quite kind-hearted.

666
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,350
Aren't you afraid that when you die,

667
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,790
he'll dig up your grave and rob your tomb?

668
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,350
You're back.

669
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,680
That's my own nephew we're talking about.

670
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,980
Your nephew?

671
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,790
Someone who's dug up graves and
robbed tombs isn't afraid to do anything.

672
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,270
He's done his time in prison.

673
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,270
Don't you think he could have changed?

674
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,270
A dog's still a dog
even if it stops eating shit.

675
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,590
Alright, let's drop it.

676
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,450
Make your move.

677
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,190
Your turn.

678
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,480
This is my wife.

679
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,860
Hello, Sis.

680
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,680
Hello.

681
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,400
Give me the luggage.

682
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,330
-Put it in her room.
-Put it inside.

683
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,380
Come on.

684
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,660
Have a seat.

685
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,170
It's really big.

686
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,340
Indeed.

687
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,500
Let me tell you,

688
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,800
when your brother goes out,

689
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,680
I'm left alone in this house.

690
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,550
It's good that you're here now.

691
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,000
Now I have someone to keep me company.

692
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,560
Alright.

693
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,310
Here.

694
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,720
Have some water.

695
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,870
Thank you, Sis.

696
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,070
You're welcome.

697
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,790
No need to trouble yourself.

698
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,400
Please sit down.

699
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:31,880
Okay.

700
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,410
You've only been out of school
for a couple of years.

701
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,120
Don't worry, Sis.

702
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,240
I can take care of all the housework.

703
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,440
I have two younger sisters at home.

704
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,420
I helped my mom raise them both.

705
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,720
When your baby is born,
I'll help you take care of it.

706
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,510
Okay.

707
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,720
Is it a boy or a girl?

708
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,070
We don't know yet.

709
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,730
The doctors won't tell us now.

710
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,970
Mu said you like sour foods.

711
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,330
It must be a boy then.

712
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,720
He really wants a boy.

713
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,210
Right?

714
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,170
You must be hungry.

715
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,960
Let's not eat at home today.

716
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,270
I haven't prepared any dishes.

717
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,680
-Jianhui.
-No need.

718
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,590
How about we treat her to some paomo today?

719
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,750
-Let's not eat at home.
-Paomo?

720
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,310
Sounds good.

721
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,460
No need.

722
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,750
It's not hygienic outside.

723
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,350
I'll go out and buy you a fish.

724
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,000
Pregnant women need to eat more protein.

725
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
That's very thoughtful.

726
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,400
Alright.

727
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,200
Then I'm leaving.

728
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,750
Okay.

729
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,160
Give her some money.

730
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,790
Oh, Wen Wen.

731
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,160
No need. I have money.

732
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,510
Take it.

733
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,680
Your money is yours.

734
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,830
This is for buying things for our home.

735
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,440
Take it.

736
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,910
-Okay.
-Okay.

737
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,200
Then I'll go.

738
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,930
Okay.

739
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,470
Kun, you really found the stone?

740
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,510
Where did you find it?

741
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,980
At a villager's house.

742
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,750
Judging from the size,

743
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,680
it's probably similar to
the one in the well.

744
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,640
But the villager doesn't know
where it was dug up from.

745
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,000
So there's no lead then.

746
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,850
Fang.

747
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,010
Are you busy?

748
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,230
Fang,

749
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,920
I need to tell you something.

750
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,640
Go ahead.

751
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,470
Come out for a moment.

752
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:08,990
What?

753
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,520
What is it?

754
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,760
Do you still want that stone?

755
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,390
Is there more?

756
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,010
Do you want it or not?

757
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,650
Of course I want it.

758
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,360
Alright.

759
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,080
I'll update you soon.

760
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,010
Fang.

761
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,720
Thieves are petty men,

762
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,580
but their cunning surpasses
that of gentlemen.

763
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,389
Lai,

764
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,400
you're smarter than me.

765
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,030
No, I'm not.

766
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,320
If I hadn't caught you red-handed,

767
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,360
you probably would have tricked me
out of all my salary, right?

768
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,760
Fang, I didn't lie to you.

769
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,920
Aren't these all the stones
you were looking for?

770
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,330
Right?

771
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,800
I was just about to get them down.

772
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,550
According to our field survey route,

773
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,360
we're approaching
Group Three of Yin Village.

774
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,320
We need to examine this area more carefully.

775
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,110
Weren't black pottery figurines
unearthed here before?

776
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,480
You're clearly well-prepared.

777
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,360
Not bad, huh?

778
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,920
But when I was researching, I found that

779
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,960
there's controversy about
the looting pit of the black pottery figurines.

780
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,800
Some say it's an outer burial pit
of the Dou Mausoleum,

781
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,840
while others claim
it's a high-ranking person's tomb.

782
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
What do you think?

783
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,510
I don't know.

784
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,480
How dare I make wild guesses?

785
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,680
Even the experts haven't clarified it.

786
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,360
What are you laughing at?

787
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,480
I'm laughing at someone
who was very bold back then,

788
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,930
and had quite a thick skin.

789
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,360
He thought he had made a great discovery,

790
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,230
jumping up and down with excitement,

791
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,800
and did quite a few ridiculous things.

792
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,060
Sounds like Kun.

793
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,230
Only he could do such things.

794
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,050
But that was him back then.

795
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,230
He has changed now.

796
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,370
Between him then and him now,

797
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,900
who do you think is better?

798
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,150
I think they both have their merits.

799
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,080
He's changing, and so am I.

800
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,560
The way we view people is also changing.

801
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:30,920
Wait a moment!

802
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,440
What are you doing?

803
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,230
What are you doing?

804
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,470
Ms. Luo!

805
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,160
Don't move!

806
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,360
Let go of me.

807
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,420
What are you doing?

808
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,440
Ms. Luo!

809
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Who are you?

810
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm an archaeologist. What else can I be?

811
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,440
This...

812
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,800
Look, the equipment is really professional.

813
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,320
These are all the
archaeological tools we use.

814
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,000
What kind of tomb raider
would carry these around?

815
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,360
That's right.

816
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,550
Tomb raiders have become
quite sophisticated these days.

817
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,190
You thought you put on a disguise,

818
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,880
and I wouldn't know you're a scoundrel?

819
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,930
Get up first!

820
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,810
Don't move!

821
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm Luo Qing from the
Provincial
Archaeological Research Institute.

822
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You can call my workplace to verify.

823
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,610
Come over here quickly.

824
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,590
Please come in.

825
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,630
Alright, sorry to intrude.

826
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,560
Please sit down.

827
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,800
Both of you, have a seat.

828
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,590
-Sit down.
-Okay.

829
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,210
Thank you.

830
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,700
Have some water first.

831
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,000
About what happened today,

832
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,130
it was truly a huge misunderstanding.

833
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,920
I'm really sorry about that.

834
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,930
If anyone's to blame for this,
it's Yan Shoucun.

835
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,390
It's alright.

836
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,070
Uncle Shoucun and I
have known each other for many years.

837
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,960
He's been living around here for years.

838
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
And his dog,

839
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,620
called Heizui, is very alert.

840
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,120
It's all because of

841
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,880
that dog.

842
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,880
Every time it barks,

843
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,800
I go check.

844
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,030
We've come up empty-handed several times.

845
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,880
That guy is quite annoying.

846
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,960
He even complained about me to my superiors.

847
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,480
Today,

848
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,230
I was supposed to be on leave.

849
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
Just to prove a point,

850
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,960
I called Kong to patrol the site with me.

851
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,630
And look,

852
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,360
what a mess it's turned into.

853
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,540
The Cultural Relics Management Office
in Baliu really has it tough.

854
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,000
You have to manage such a large area.

855
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,750
Ms. Luo,

856
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,610
you've really spoken the truth.

857
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,830
Just for that,

858
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,650
we must have a few drinks today.

859
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,360
Please wait a moment.

860
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,510
I'll ask Kong to go buy some dishes.

861
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,440
-It's okay.
-No need. Don't bother.

862
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,300
It'll be quick.

863
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,880
It'll be ready soon, very soon.

864
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Section Chief Wu,

865
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,880
is this person's surname Zan?

866
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,920
Yes, Professor Zan.

867
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,430
He's my father's friend.

868
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,670
Mr. Zan has mentored me before.

869
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,700
He's my teacher.

870
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,760
Please sit down.

871
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,800
Let me tell you about it. Come on.

872
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,940
What a coincidence!

873
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,920
Let me tell you.

874
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,770
Eat up.

875
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,880
Well,

876
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,550
Professor Zan

877
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,810
is my father's friend.

878
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,280
I remember when their archaeological team

879
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,000
came to our site for excavation,

880
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,800
they discovered an animal bone.

881
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,190
They called my father over

882
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,190
to see what it was.

883
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,600
Oh, I see.

884
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,660
Your father was a biology teacher.

885
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,110
Mr. Zan has mentioned this to us before.

886
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,720
My father, at that time,

887
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,800
made a mistake.

888
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,880
He mistook the rhinoceros bone

889
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,070
for a wild ox bone.

890
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,810
Because of this incident,

891
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,960
he became acquainted with
the archaeological team.

892
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,710
He also developed an interest
in historical artifacts.

893
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,320
I became a cultural relic conservator

894
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,920
because of their influence.

895
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,550
That's truly a fateful connection.

896
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,150
Oh, right.

897
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,280
I have some photos here.

898
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,140
You two sit down. I'll go get them.

899
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,350
Here they are.

900
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,120
Come on.

901
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,000
I didn't expect to come here

902
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,960
and see what Mr. Zan was like
when he was young.

903
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,820
Help yourself.

904
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,520
It's fine.

905
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,680
Come on, take a look.

906
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,110
Look.

907
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,890
This is Empress Dowager Bo's tomb.

908
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,130
This is that rhinoceros bone.

909
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,360
This was their dormitory back then.

910
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,160
Wait a moment.

911
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,800
Ms. Luo, look at the stones in this pit.

912
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,260
They're very similar to
the ones in the well.

913
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,640
What do you mean?

914
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,760
Section Chief Wu,

915
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,070
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

916
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,330
I need to go right away.

917
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,150
I'll skip the meal.

918
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
Let Xiaobai keep you company
for a few more drinks.

919
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,110
The food will be ready soon.

920
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,970
It's okay.

921
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,150
It's really urgent.

922
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,850
Ms. Luo.

923
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,260
Fang Kun.

924
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,170
I know why Mr. Zan

925
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
is interested in river pebbles now.

926
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,800
Mr. Zan

927
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,730
once discovered the river pebble remains

928
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,880
at the excavation site of
Empress Dowager Bo's tomb.

929
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,680
No wonder he was so interested in

930
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,810
a suddenly appeared river pebble.

931
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,330
Let's go.

932
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,010
Where to?

933
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,110
I know where Mr. Zan's river pebble

934
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,040
came from.

935
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You mean

936
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,750
Mr. Zan's river pebble

937
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,040
came from here?

938
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,530
How do you know?

939
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,620
Where

940
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,250
did you find this?

941
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,030
Haven't I been troubled by this stone

942
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,440
these past few days?

943
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,830
I can't sleep at night.

944
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,920
As soon as I fall asleep,

945
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,650
Mr. Zan comes to me in my dreams.

946
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,700
Last night, Mr. Zan appeared in my dream.

947
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,770
He said, "Fang,

948
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,660
you should go

949
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,530
take a walk around Auntie's house.

950
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,010
Find a wall.

951
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,000
The river pebble is inside that wall."

952
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,160
When I woke up this morning,

953
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,980
guess what?

954
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:52,940
What?

955
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,600
The stone was really inside the wall.

956
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:57,600
Well,

957
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,370
did Professor Zan

958
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,400
not tell you

959
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,060
why it was in the wall?

960
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,470
No, he didn't.

961
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,860
Why?

962
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,080
Alright, I'll confess to you.

963
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,960
If I don't,

964
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,080
the guilt will crush me.

965
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,370
It's like this.

966
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,880
I originally

967
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,760
picked this stone up from the field.

968
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,230
I brought it back and
used it to weigh down the vegetable jar.

969
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,690
I...

970
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,450
When you all came that time,

971
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,370
you stayed at my place, remember?

972
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,070
One day,

973
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,120
Professor Zan saw this stone.

974
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,920
He asked me where I picked it up.

975
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,660
I only remember it was near

976
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,090
the looting pit.

977
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,760
Which looting pit?

978
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,320
The one with the little black figures.

979
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,480
The looting pit with
the black pottery figurines?

980
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,350
Yes.

981
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,740
When Professor Zan heard that,

982
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,130
he insisted on buying this stone.

983
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,090
Later,

984
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,790
didn't Professor Zan have an accident?

985
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,440
The stone was left in his house.

986
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,600
Nobody wanted it.

987
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,020
Then later, when we were building a wall,

988
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,300
I took this stone

989
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,280
and stuffed it inside the wall.

990
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,760
The moment the well-digging crew stopped,

991
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,940
I thought

992
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,010
if you found out,

993
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,120
you'd probably go all out

994
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,990
and tear down my whole wall.

995
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,190
Didn't expect you

996
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,230
to be so tactful for once.

997
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,110
When have you ever given me a chance to be?

998
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,550
I wanted to,

999
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,880
but who would've thought

1000
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,630
you'd head straight to Yusai?

1001
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,950
Then give me a chance now.

1002
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,480
Near Empress Dowager Bo's tomb,

1003
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,210
they discovered remains
of river pebble paving.

1004
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,070
They also found some near the looting pit
with black pottery figurines.

1005
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,280
Does Mr. Zan think

1006
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,740
there's some connection between these two?

1007
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
What do you think?

1008
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,480
I just feel that the looting pit
with black pottery figurines

1009
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,230
is becoming more and more mysterious.

1010
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,070
We must figure out what's really down there.
