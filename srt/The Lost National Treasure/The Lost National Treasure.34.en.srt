00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,979
[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,729
King Hua has confessed.

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,560
King Hua.

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,740
Who is King Hua?

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
King Hua has been caught.

7
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,380
He confessed everything.

8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,509
Ten years ago,

9
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,789
the one who sold him
the black pottery figurines

10
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,850
wasn't Yan Xiaowu.

11
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,440
It was you.

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,150
I don't know the person
you're talking about.

13
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,230
I've never seen him.

14
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,090
I don't know why he would frame me.

15
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,520
Do you want to meet Wang Jiahao?

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,900
It's up to you. Even if I meet him,
I won't recognize him.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,030
I know you

18
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,040
must be worried about committing perjury

19
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,440
and the sentencing.

20
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,400
I can assure you,

21
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,630
if you confess honestly

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,950
and help us testify against Mu Jianhui,

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,520
we will make sure
it’s noted in your case file

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,840
as a meritorious act

25
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,100
and help you seek leniency.

26
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,079
How about that?

27
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,520
I sold the black pottery figurines
to King Hua.

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
It has nothing to do with Mu Jianhui.

29
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,650
He wasn't involved.

30
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,360
I admit

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,750
you are smart,

32
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,760
have high EQ,

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,710
and your knowledge is even higher.

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,120
I can only say it's a pity.

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,840
Do you think

36
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,450
the current Yan Xiaowu

37
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,680
is still

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,860
the same as he was 10 years ago?

39
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,370
And then what do you think?

40
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,360
Captain Qi.

41
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm hungry.

42
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,329
Do you provide meals here?

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,180
Sorry to ask,

44
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,930
but can I pay

45
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,290
to add a dish for Xiaowu?

46
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,329
His favorite scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

47
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,990
Provocation.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,970
It’s absolutely provocation.

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,910
Mu Jianhui

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,310
is so sure that Yan Xiaowu won't confess.

51
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,310
He's so arrogant.

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,970
You must be so pissed off.

53
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,990
Eat, eat.

54
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,710
Eat your meal.

55
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,430
You're full of anger. You can't eat.

56
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,710
If you don't eat,
how can you stay up with them?

57
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,370
There are still 12 hours to go.

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,960
I just don't understand.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,430
If Yan Xiaowu

60
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,870
was a stone,

61
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,420
his wife and kid
would’ve warmed him up, right?

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
A bright future is right in front of him.

63
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Why did he do this?

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
He's still covering for Mu Jianhui.

65
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,310
Is he planning to keep digging up tombs
with Mu Jianhui?

66
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,510
Or are their brotherhood bonds
just that deep?

67
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,720
Brotherhood?

68
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,560
Mu Jianhui must have some leverage on him.

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,510
Logically, he just got out of prison,

70
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,630
they shouldn't have met yet.

71
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,159
They don't need to meet.

72
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,000
About Yan Xiaowu's situation inside,

73
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,159
he must have a way to know.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
Including how many times
we've met Yan Xiaowu.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,530
He's prepared for all of it.

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,720
Just tell me,

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,080
what does Yan Xiaowu have

78
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,250
that could make

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,830
Mu Jianhui control him?

80
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,830
Threatening him with his wife and child.

81
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,490
We're watching them closely.

82
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,330
How could he threaten them?

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,810
He’s not a gangster.

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,800
I think

85
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,230
everyone's in it for something.

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,560
Yan Xiaowu has been in jail

87
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,260
for 10 years for Mu Jianhui.

88
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,480
It's definitely not brotherly love.

89
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,190
Mu Jianhui must have offered him a deal.

90
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,920
Money?

91
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:34,390
But

92
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,670
he can’t get that in jail, right?

93
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,120
It's hard to say.

94
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,770
Anyway,

95
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,830
you guys keep interrogating.

96
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,510
I

97
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,050
will go visit
Yan Xiaowu’s house tomorrow morning.

98
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,960
What if his wife refuses to cooperate?

99
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,400
She will cooperate.

100
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,190
Why?

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,540
Because I believe.

102
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,159
I just believe, that's all.

103
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,630
From the first day

104
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,490
I started this job,

105
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,240
we all see

106
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,680
the dirt

107
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,800
and evil.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,390
But I always believe

109
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,680
that people have a conscience.

110
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
If I didn't have this belief,

111
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,730
I wouldn't have

112
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,030
persevered until today.

113
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
If I didn't have this belief,

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,920
I’d think

115
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,160
there’s

116
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,240
no hope

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,560
in the world.

118
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,080
I choose to believe.

119
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,120
Bao is indeed excellent.

120
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,240
I heard from his teacher that he wanted

121
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,430
to get into Qinchuan University
Affiliated Middle School.

122
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,960
His grades are good enough.

123
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,430
Qinchuan University
Affiliated Middle School

124
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,030
doesn’t just admit students
with good grades.

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
Maybe that’s why Yan Xiaowu

126
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,650
keeps taking the blame for others.

127
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,070
No,

128
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,550
-Don’t argue.
-Xiaowu...

129
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,240
I'll get straight to the point.

130
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,370
I'll speak frankly.

131
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,080
You're a good woman.

132
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,360
You can give up a lot for your child.

133
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,040
Parents' love for their children
makes them plan for the long term.

134
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,120
But you've never

135
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,680
considered it from
the child's perspective.

136
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,560
If you really care about his future,

137
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,590
you should think from his point of view.

138
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,200
If he encountered this situation,

139
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,470
how would he choose?

140
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,240
I'm getting old.

141
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,210
I really can't hold it anymore.

142
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,310
Twenty-four hours,

143
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,470
my back is about to break.

144
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,390
Don't rush,

145
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,040
there's still half an hour left.

146
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,120
Captain Qi,

147
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
to be honest,

148
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,000
I really admire you guys.

149
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,270
You know some things are meaningless,

150
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,470
but you still do them.

151
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,630
If you insist on dragging this out,

152
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,289
I'll stick it out with you
for another half hour.

153
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,200
Close the door.

154
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,440
You two.

155
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,370
What are you doing here?

156
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,650
Go back.

157
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,830
Go home.

158
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,600
Officer,

159
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,120
they

160
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,110
don’t know anything.

161
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:52,750
Go home.

162
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,120
Go home quickly.

163
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,500
Sit down.

164
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,370
Go home!

165
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:55,840
Don't move.

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,270
Sit down!

167
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,210
What are you doing here?

168
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:57,910
-What are you doing?
-Stay put!

169
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,390
Go home!

170
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,720
Sit down!

171
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,480
What are you two doing here?

172
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,010
Sit down!

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,000
What are you here for?

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,200
Yan Xiaowu, I'm warning you, sit down!

175
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,750
Behave yourself!

176
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,210
Go home.

177
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,120
Go home.

178
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,410
Go home!

179
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,970
Sit down.

180
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,510
Xiaoli.

181
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,150
Xiaowu.

182
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,000
The source of this money.

183
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,890
The police already knew about it.

184
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,030
Xiaoli.

185
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,430
If you do this,

186
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,080
my 10 years in prison
would have been for nothing.

187
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,010
Go home, be good.

188
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,320
Go home.

189
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,670
Go home!

190
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,550
Yan Xiaowu, behave yourself!

191
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,080
Sit down!

192
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,750
It's for nothing!

193
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,390
Yan Xiaowu, behave yourself!

194
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,270

195
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,240
Officer, I'm begging you.

196
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,890
I'm begging you.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,530
I haven't spent
a single cent of this 920,000.

198
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,910
I'll hand it over to the government.

199
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,280
Please, I beg you, let Xiaowu go, okay?

200
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,320
Calm down first.

201
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,250
I'm begging you.

202
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,220
-Please. Please.
-Calm down.

203
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,320
-Calm down.
-I'm begging you.

204
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,150
I'm begging you.

205
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,960
Xiaoli.

206

209
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,690
I wanted to hand it over.

210
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,790
Don't blame my mom.

211
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,760
As for school,

212
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,970
even if I don’t go anymore,

213
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
I won’t spend a penny of dirty money.

214
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,730
This has nothing to do with my mom.

215
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,670
If you want to scold someone, scold me.

216
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,470
It's my fault.

I'm sorry.

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,780
You probably can't leave now.

What do you mean?

223
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,030
I remember you said,

224
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,550
the best people to bribe are the poor.

225
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,360
What a pity.

226
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,960
There are

227
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,550
always people who are immune to wealth

228
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,510

the Gunner's real name.

How's Hong Kong?

238
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,170
Hong Kong is great.

239
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,730
Have you been there?

240
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,480
No.

241
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,860
I saw it on TV when I was little.

242
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:12,960
I...

243
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,670
I only know there's a place called  Ca...

Causeway Bay.

245
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,220
There's only one Haonan in Causeway Bay.

246
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,040
That's me, Chen Haonan.

247
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,440
I like that line from Liang Kun.

248
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,350
If you're in the game,

249
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,670
you gotta own up to it.

250

Take your beating like a man.

251
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,560

What's that?

254
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,130
It's...

255
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,840
For us gangsters,

256
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,870
we must do what we say.

257
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,550
If we say we'll kill his whole family,

258
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,210
then we kill his whole family.

259
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,330

Okay.

You’re good to go.

Luckily, Qiang ran fast.

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,900
Otherwise, he would have been
caught today.

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,270

What did Qiang say on the phone?

285
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,580
He said Hong Kong is great.

286
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,630
There are pretty women everywhere.

287
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,130
What's so great about that?

288
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,880
Aren't the women in Yusai
better than those girls?

289
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,840
Pull over.

he left his hometown to make a living.

apologize to you again.

Is she still working for you?

355
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,450
Not anymore.

356
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,850
When did she leave?

357
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,790
It's been a while.

358
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,160
Why did she leave?

359
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,240
I don't know.

360
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,690
She didn’t explain it in detail
when she left.

361
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,520
What's going on with Wen Wen?

362
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,770
Nothing.

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,240
About other things,

364
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,920
could you tell me more?

365
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,000
I haven't been in touch with her
for a long time.

366
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,630
Well then,

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,720
could you tell me about

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,810
What do you mean?

372
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,780
Don't you know?

373
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,400
Anyway,

374
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,080

You don't know Li Yuanguang?

380
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,960
Your...

381
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,920
your husband's sworn brother,

382
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,530
how come you don't know him?

383
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,940
I've never met this person.

384
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
That's not right.

385
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,720
Wasn't it him

386
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,730
who introduced Wen Wen
to work as your nanny?

387
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,120
I've never seen him.

388
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,220
Take another look.

389
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,010
Look carefully at that photo.

390
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Li Yuanguang is Wen Wen's husband.

391
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,980
They're also from the same hometown.

392
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,480
With that connection,

393
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,880
Wen Wen must have

394
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,140
come to your house
through Li Yuanguang.

395
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,610
He's also your husband's sworn brother.

396
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,130
I don't know.

397
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,320
I've never met this person.

398
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,920
Do you have Wen Wen's phone number?

399
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,830
Yes,

400
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,880
I have her old one.

401
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,170
I'm not sure if she's changed her number.

402
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,880
Okay, thank you.

403
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,150
Oh, right,

404
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,880
the...

405
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,310
the child you were holding yesterday

406
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,830
must be Wen Wen's.

407
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,540
No.

408
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,260
It's not like that.

409
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,560
I found this child.

410
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,510
Found?

411
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,060
Where did you find it?

412
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,240
Just at Mount Nan,

413
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,640
right in front of my yard.

414
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,310
I've been taking care of him for a while.

415
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,200
I saw that no one came
looking for the child.

416
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,270
So I processed the adoption paperwork
for the child.

417
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,400
The child now has an ID card.

418
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,460
I can get it for you.

419
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
My child is awake.

420
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,330
Alright, alright.

421
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,100
You take care of the child.

422
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,370
We've asked everything we needed to.

423
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,830
Thank you for your cooperation.

424
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,630
Go take care of the child,
go take care of the child.

425
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,800
Hello, the number you have dialed
does not exist,

426
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,690
please check it and dial it later.

427
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,040
So Wen Wen's number does not exist.

428
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
This child should be Wen Wen's.

429
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,510
Judging from Liu Shulan's reaction,

430
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,160
she must have just found out.

431
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,090
Then this situation is a bit strange.

432
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,110
Based on the time

433
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,400
provided by the security guard
at his residential complex,

434
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,530
Wen Wen must’ve left

435
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,890
shortly after this baby was born.

436
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,440
So, what exactly happened

437
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,200
between her and Li Yuanguang?

438
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,350
She abandoned her own child.

439
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,040
Moreover,

440
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,070
how did this child end up

441
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,720
with Liu Shulan?

442
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,110
I’ve already asked around
in Li Yuanguang’s hometown.

443
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,840
Neither he nor Wen Wen is there.

444
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,600
However,

445
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,610
Li Yuanguang came back some time ago.

446
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,070
He was looking for Wen Wen.

447
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,160
I found out from Wen Wen’s family that

448
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,890
she made a call from Jiaocheng.

449
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,110
So

450
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,040
Li Yuanguang

451
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,350
is very likely

452
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,000
to have gone to Jiaocheng to look for
Wen Wen.

453
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,350
Yes.

454
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,690
What did you find out there?

455
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,910
Big findings.

456
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,990
Let's go to Jiaocheng first
and talk in person.

457
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,850
Go to Jiaocheng.

458
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,610
Look at this.

459
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,740
It does look like a rammed earth wall.

460
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,970
But it's hard to say if it's
an outer enclosure wall.

461
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,720
Master,

462
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,110
didn't you say

463
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
that ancient walls were made
by ramming earth blocks?

464
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,790
The rammed earth has impressions,

465
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,520
like the stone pancakes we eat.

466
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,730
Look,

467
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,490
aren't these impressions?

468
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,390
This is indeed rammed earth.

469
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,920
But our area is

470
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,350
at the westernmost end of the plain,

471
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,740
the terrain is uneven.

472
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,720
Back then, to build the mausoleum complex,

473
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,250
they leveled the low areas.

474
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,480
They built rammed earth walls
on top of the rammed earth foundation.

475
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:35,880
Right.

476
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,720
You mean

477
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,350
we need to look for rammed earth walls
within the rammed earth?

478
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,640
Yes.

479
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,680
Usually, we look for processed earth
in raw earth.

480
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,720
But now,

481
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,880
we're looking for processed earth
within processed earth.

482
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,480
Looking for rammed earth
within rammed earth.

483
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,200
Mr. Lu is right.

484
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,750
Under the current circumstances,

485
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,720
we can’t just rely on the rammed earth

486
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,400
to determine the outer enclosure wall.

487
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,550
We need to see if
it can form a linear structure,

488
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,210
if it can connect as one piece.

489
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,360
Words are never as good as
seeing it in person.

490
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,590
Okay. Xiaoman, lead the way.

491
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,720
Let's go take a look.

492
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,720
Alright. You've just recovered,

493
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,580
-but you’re so active.
-Let’s go.

494
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,000
Take it easy, take it easy.

495
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,600
Slow down.

496
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,130
How deep is the hole?

497
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,910
How is it?

498
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,310
Look at this soil.

499
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,880
I just explored a two-meter area.

500
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,590
This section of soil

501
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,720
is relatively pure,

502
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,270
densely structured,

503
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,070
and very hard.

504
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,710
It is indeed
a section of rammed earth wall.

505
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,310
I think our plan to find
the outer enclosure wall

506
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,790
can move forward now.

507
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,310
What do you think?

508
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,880
Right.

509
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,870
Here's the thing.

510
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,920
Everyone, let's search carefully
around this area again,

511
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,350
see if we can find a linear pattern.

512
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,930
No problem.

513
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,400
Don't run!

514
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,830
Don't run!

515
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,240
Stop!

516
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,550
Stop!

517
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,160
Don't run!

518
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,550
What's going on?

519
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,350
-Stop!
-Stop!

520
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:50,880
What happened?

521
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,680
What's wrong?

522
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,340
Stay there!

523
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,940
What's the situation?

524
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,020
What's happening?

525
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,960
What's going on?

526
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,200
Someone punctured the tires.

527
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,930
Did you see what he looked like?

528
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,400
I didn't see clearly.

529
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,590
I just shouted once and he ran away.

530
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,720
I couldn't catch up.

531
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,400
He ran faster than a rabbit.

532
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
-This is also punctured.
-Look at the front.

533
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,790
It’s broken.

534
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,250
It’s broken, it’s broken.

535
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,760
I feel really...

536
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,350
Someone must be deliberately
targeting our archaeological team.

537
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,350
The other day, when the power went out,
my father went to check.

538
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,960
Someone

539
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,680
deliberately cut the electrical wires
in my house.

540
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,880
My bicycle was fine these past few days,

541
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,400
but suddenly the chain broke.

542
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
I guess someone
must have deliberately broken it.

543
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,960
Is our archaeological team
getting in someone's way again?

544
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Didn’t we solve all the land issues?

545
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,490
Could it be the landfill site?

546
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,320
Captain Luo,

547
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,790
all the loose soil has been cleared.

548
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,450
We've started mapping today.

549
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,160
Good.

550
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,000
Thank you for your hard work.

551
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,500
Take it easy, take it easy.

552
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,230
Captain Luo.

553
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,200
Lu. Xiaoman.

554
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,490
How's the search going?

555
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,260
Xiaoman and I

556
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,730
followed that area
for several hundred meters,

557
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,260
drilling countless holes,

558
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,270
but we didn’t find any more traces
of rammed earth.

559
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,600
These are my work notes.

560
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,550
It records

561
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,810
all the points and lines we’ve searched.

562
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,560
Captain Luo,

563
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,440
more than half of
the three months have passed.

564
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,900
Should we keep searching?

565
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,060
Could it be that there's
no outer enclosure wall at all?

566
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,480
It's hard to say.

567
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,920
This terrain was originally
full of gullies and ravines.

568
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Over the years, many relics
must have been washed away,

569
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,200
and many walls have been broken.

570
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,680
Plus, some roads were built later,

571
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,720
which also buried part of the site.

572
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,380
Hello, Guo.

573
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,960
Even if there's an outer enclosure wall,

574
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,070
it would still be hard to
find a complete linear pattern.

575
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,600
Alright.

576
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,590
At excavation point No. 2,

577
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,050
an official seal was also found
in pit No. 27.

578
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,680
The Seal of the Sikong Department.

579
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,710
What's the Seal of the Sikong Department?

580
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,540
It was an institution

581
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,070
that managed large-scale national projects

582
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,640
at that time,

583
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,900
equivalent to today's

584
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,280
Ministry of Housing
and Urban-Rural Development.

585
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,720
Got it?

586
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,640
The previous Music Bureau Director's Seal

587
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,350
represents the Music Bureau pit.

588
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,350
So does this official seal represent

589
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,400
that pit No. 27 is
the Construction Department?

590
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,440
You could say that.

591
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Look,

592
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,880
this is the Seal of the Sikong Department.

593
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,410
This one.

594
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,720
This represents
the Department of Implements.

595
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,530
This is the Warehouse Seal.

596
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,080
This is the Granary Seal.

597
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,720
And this represents
the Department of Carriages.

598
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,310
These

599
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,110
all represent different
government agencies

600
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,750
and treasuries of the Western Han dynasty.

601
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,640
Basically, it’s almost certain.

602
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,150
Right.

603
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,310
That's why

604
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,480
I called all of you here

605
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,810
to discuss this matter.

606
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,000
What's almost certain?

607
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,300
Look at these outer burial pits
we've discovered.

608
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,030
In terms of quantity and scale,

609
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,830
structure,

610
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,640
and cultural relics,

611
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,750
they're actually highly consistent with
the Yang Mausoleum.

612
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,550
Including these official seals
we've found,

613
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,720
which should be
simulating government institutions.

614
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,680
Like the large number of outer burial pits
near the main burial chamber,

615
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,200
if they have symbolic meaning,

616
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,060
then in the highly centralized
Qin and Han periods,

617
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,040
the tomb owner

618
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,550
must be an emperor.

619
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,730
Well,

620
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,680
so we don't need to look for
the outer enclosure wall anymore, right?

621
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,740
This evidence is convincing enough.

622
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,590
Let's hope so.

623
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,360
I'll report this to
the provincial institute right away.

624
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,830
In such a short time,

625
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,540
to have achieved such results

626
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,830
is inseparable from your

627
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,560
Han Mausoleum
archaeological team's hard work.

628
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,690
However,

629
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,100
regarding the identification
of the Zi Mausoleum,

630
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,920
we believe

631
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,480
we should be cautious.

632
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,510
The chain of evidence

633
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,190
should be more rigorous.

634
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,240
Okay?

635
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,550
The key issue is
we're running out of time.

636
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,680
The three-month deadline is almost here.

637
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,790
If someone

638
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,350
compares this to the Yang Mausoleum

639
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,810
and asks me about
the "same site, different grave" structure.

640
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,550
If

641
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,880
the grand tomb in Yin Village
is the Zi Mausoleum,

642
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,740
is there an outer enclosure wall?

643
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,430
How should we explain it?

644
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,720
We can

645
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,350
add more manpower to
search for the outer enclosure wall.

646
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,150
But it's still the same problem.

647
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,000
If we don’t find it by the deadline,

648
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,310
what do we do?

649
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,110
If

650
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,230
we can't find the outer enclosure wall,

651
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,300
we need to prove it doesn't exist.

652
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,920
We are researchers,

653
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,000
not creators.

654
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
What we need to do

655
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,730
is just to restore history.

656
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,240
As for the time issue,

657
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,810
we'll figure out a way.

658
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,530
I understand, Mrs. Zan.

659
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,970
Pepper yogurt.

660
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,570
Have a bottle to try.

661
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
She's working at

662
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,120
a yogurt shop
in the Jiaocheng Ancient Town.

663
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,240
After leaving home,

664
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,640
she went straight there.

665
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,830
We also checked her call records.

666
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,640
In the past year,

667
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,450
she only made one call home.

668
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,890
She's never contacted Li Yuanguang.

669
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,670
Has she called recently?

670
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,070
No.

671
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,420
Oh, right.

672
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,640
There were a few unknown numbers
from Qinchuan,

673
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,030
but she didn't answer any of them.

674
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,760
We also checked these numbers.

675
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,830
Most of them can't be reached.

676
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,430
Moreover,

677
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,650
the numbers were

678
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,320
all registered with fake IDs,

679
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,640
so it’s likely

680
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,880
Li Yuanguang used
a temporary phone card to call her.

681
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,600
So Li Yuanguang might not have come
to see her.

682
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,000
I think so too.

683
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,790
Is Wen Wen alone or with someone else?

684
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,930
What do you mean?

685
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,170
Your captain means to check if she

686
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,720
left her husband and child back then

687
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,010
because she had someone else.

688
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,270
We checked this too.

689
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,490
She's been alone all this time

690
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,750
and hasn't made any friends either.

691
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,050
What are you thinking?

692
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,640
Are we

693
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,030
focusing on the main target
while isolating support

694
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,760
or launching a frontal attack?

695
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,800
Our investigation of Wen Wen

696
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,530
must have caused quite a stir
in her village.

697
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:11,030
Li Yuanguang might have heard about it.

698
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,130
Whether he'll come or not
is another matter.

699
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,980
Let's go for a frontal attack.

700
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,940
How about trying
a bottle of pepper yogurt?

701
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,110
Are you buying the pepper or the yogurt?

702
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,030
These are all from the local mountains...

703
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,490
You must be Wen Wen, right?

704
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,650
We're from the Relics Inspection Team

705
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,800
of Qinchuan City Public Security Bureau.

706
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,260
We're here to investigate

707
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,150
your husband, Li Yuanguang.

708
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,630
He’s suspected of

709
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,480
illegally excavating ancient tombs

710
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,410
and trafficking cultural relics.

711
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,360
You mean

712
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,170
he's been digging up
other people's graves?

713
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,800
Wen Wen,

714
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,760
what are you doing here?

715
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,430
I saw the door was open, so I came in.

716
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,400
I thought it might be a thief.

717
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,690
Get out.

718
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,070
I said get out.

719
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,110
What are you thinking about?

720
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,810
Nothing.

721
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,440
Is this a serious crime?

722
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
Well, it depends.

723
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,920
First,

724
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
it depends on what exactly he did.

725
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,820
Second,

726
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,810
surrendering voluntarily

727
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,230
and resisting arrest

728
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,760
will definitely lead to
different outcomes.

729
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,510
Do you know where he is now?

730
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,040
Isn't he in Qinchuan?

731
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,460
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

732
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,590
You're husband and wife.

733
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,770
You just had a baby.

734
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,890
How come you haven't been
in contact for so long?

735
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,130
Where's your child?

736
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,940
The child is with his father.

737
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,410
With his father?

738
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,900
I'm afraid he might be
at Mu Jianhui's house.

739
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,360
Why would he be at his house?

740
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,200
I'm asking you.

741
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,260
You're his mother.

742
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,210
In that case,

743
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,190
he must know.

744
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,440
Who?

745
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,290
Nothing.

746
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,180
He should be at his house.

747
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,070
I don't believe

748
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,960
that any mother

749
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,750
would be so heartless

750
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,510
to abandon her newborn baby

751
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,630
and run away.

752
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,230
What exactly happened
between you and Li Yuanguang?

753
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,760
Why did you abandon the baby?

754
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,670
You don't seem like a heartless person.

755
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,800
Please stop asking.

756
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,960
This has nothing to do with Yuanguang.

757
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,690
Who does it have to do with then?

758
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,400
No one.

759
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,480
It's my own problem.

760
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,110
You must have

761
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,440
witnessed your husband committing a crime

762
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,150
and didn't want to be with him anymore,

763
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,010
so you ran away?

764
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,190
No, that's not it.

765
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
Wen Wen, I remind you,

766
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,020
there's a crime called concealment
for failing to report known criminal activity.

767
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,770
I don't know anything.

768
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,000
Two yogurts, please.

769
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,400
How much?

770
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,760
Black or white?

771
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,640
It's really pepper flavor.

772
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,710
Delicious.

773
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,550
Wen Wen,

774
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,710
based on what we know now,

775
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,690
Li Yuanguang won't be able to escape.

776
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,890
He will definitely be caught.

777
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,710
If you can

778
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,430
provide information in time

779
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
and persuade him to turn himself in,

780
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,320
we can still seek leniency for him.

781
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,920
You've been with him for so long,

782
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,400
I don't believe

783
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,960
you haven't noticed anything unusual.

784
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,710
Wen Wen,

785
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,070
to be frank, I'm doing this
for your child.

786
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,880
I feel sorry for both of you.

787
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,270
It will be too late if we wait any longer.

788
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,930
But I really don't know anything.

789
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,170
I always thought he was a scrap collector,

790
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,770
maybe tinkering with some old items.

791
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,030
That's right.

792
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,180
What kind of old items?

793
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,760
I only saw it once.

794
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,410
Mu was there too at the time.

795
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,630
You're getting closer to the truth.

796
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,800
Mu Jianhui.

797
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,110
Where was he?

798
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,480
At his scrap yard.

799
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,100
Mu was tinkering with
an antique at the time.

800
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,010
What exactly was it?

801
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,320
I can't say for sure.

802
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,120
I just saw the room was full of old items.

803
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,650
Mu said they were scrap items
Yuanguang had collected,

804
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,180
and then sold to him.

805
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,160
Where is this scrap yard?

806
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,840
It's right in front of
the Qinchuan East Suburb Power Plant,

807
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,570
in a village called Wangjiapu.

808
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,400
If your husband contacts you,

809
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,800
contact me immediately.

810
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,230
Wen Wen,

811
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,360
this is the best

812
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,480
and only way

813
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
for your husband,

814
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,670
for you,

815
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,480
and for your child.
