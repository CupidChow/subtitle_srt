[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,759
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,200
What's wrong with you?

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,530
Why is your face so pale?

5
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,710
The pregnant woman had severe bleeding.

6
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,910
Captain Qi just donated 400 cc of blood.

7
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
You go back first.

8
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,580
I'll take care of things here.

9
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,810
Mu Jianhui.

10
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,430
Yes.

11
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,940
Mu Jianhui.

12
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,150
I'm Zhao Feng,

13
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,540
Deputy Chief
of the Public Security Bureau.

14
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,750
About today's incident,

15
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,610
I'm very sorry.

16
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,079
If you have any requests,

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,710
just tell me.

18
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,910
I only ask for my wife and baby
to be safe.

19
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,060
What's the use of telling you?

20
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,150
The family of Liu Shulan.

21
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,370
How is it?

22
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,430
The fetus couldn't be saved
due to prolonged oxygen deprivation.

23
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,030
The mother is stable for now.

24
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,750
But her body
may have difficulty conceiving again.

25
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,210
You'd better be mentally prepared
for this.

26
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,330
This is all because of you!

27
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,990
Mu Jianhui!

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
-Mu Jianhui, calm down!
-Qi!

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,120
My baby is gone!

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,720
Calm down!

31
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,710
-Calm down!
-What should I do?

32
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,280
Calm down!

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,000
What should I do?

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
We're also heartbroken
over losing the baby.

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
I promise you

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,000
we'll definitely give you an explanation.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,600
Calm down.

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,960
Calm down.

39
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,800
Go.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,680
Take him back.

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,210
Alright.

42
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,610
Let's go.

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,260
Have a seat.

44
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,490
Mu Jianhui.

45
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,560
We understand

46
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,390
how you feel.

47
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,670
But according to the procedure,

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,659
we still need to

49
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,040
have a few words with you.

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,100
I have nothing to talk about with you.

51
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,390
It's just about the cultural relics,
right?

52
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,520
Go ahead and search.

53
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,720
Here are the keys to my house

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,540
and my shop.

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,520
Search however you want.

56
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,520
You've misunderstood.

57
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,390
The matter of cultural relics

58
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,720
can be discussed later.

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
What we want to talk about now

60
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,680
is your wife.

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,680
We'd like to understand the situation
in more detail,

62
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,830
so we can give you a proper explanation.

63
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,890
What explanation?

64
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,680
You clearly saw
my wife was heavily pregnant,

65
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
yet you still searched our home

66
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
and upset her.

67
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,630
We can understand how you feel.

68
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,560
How old are you?

69
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,490
Are you married?

70
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,750
Do you have children?

71
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,950
We're in our forties.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
We finally had this baby
after so much difficulty.

73
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,510
Do you know how many medicines
my wife took

74
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,970
and how much she suffered?

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,480
Do you know how close my baby
was to being born?

76
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,040
You don't really know anything.

77
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,370
How can you understand?

78
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,400
That isn't just about a baby,

79
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,760
but about half the life of my wife and me.

80
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,530
Mu Jianhui.

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,270
I...

82
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,360
I'm almost sixty years old.

83
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,750
No offense.

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,390
I'll call you Jianhui.

85
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,030
Yes.

86
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,820
As police officers,

87
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,320
we wear wide-brimmed hats on our heads,

88
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,030
but when we take them off,

89
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,630
we're just ordinary people.

90
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,470
We eat the same grains as everyone else,

91
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,240
suffer from possible illnesses,

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
and have and raise children.

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,380
We sincerely apologize to you

94
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,600
for today's incident.

95
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,550
This is...

96
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,960
This is my contact information.

97
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,760
If you have any requests

98
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,630
or questions,

99
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,500
feel free to call me anytime.

100
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,420
Public Security Bureau.

101
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,760
Jianhui.

102
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,520
Quickly put away the goods.

103
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,400
Guang.

104
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,230
Listen carefully.

105
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,990
In the middle of the night
when no one's around,

106
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,450
go to Liu Shusheng's home.

107
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,060
There's an alms bowl wrapped in tin foil
on his dining table.

108
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,390
Take it and keep it safe.

109
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,790
Remember, don't let anyone see you.

110
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,910
Don't touch anything else in the house.

111
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,710
Leave everything as you find it.

112
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,230
You're awake.

113
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,290
You slept here

114
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,020
last night?

115
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,150
Come on, get up.

116
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,530
Have some food first.

117
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,390
Come on.

118
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,320
Let me tell you,

119
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,100
beneath this skin,

120
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,210
we're all just ordinary.

121
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,650
We all have that human touch.

122
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,600
My wife also carried our child
for 10 months.

123
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,300
If I were in this situation,

124
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,430
I'd be upset too.

125
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,630
We're not gods, after all.

126
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,900
We couldn't have foreseen this happening.

127
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,420
The baby is innocent.

128
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,290
What I can do now

129
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,070
to make it up to the baby

130
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,260
is to catch the bad guys
as soon as possible.

131
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:42,740
Mu.

132
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,490
Wen Wen, you're here.

133
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,780
I brought some food.

134
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,570
Why don't you go eat something?

135
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,740
Have a nap after eating.

136
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,100
I'll stay here with Shulan.

137
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,830
I'm neither hungry nor sleepy.

138
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,100
Mu.

139
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,720
Shulan is counting on you.

140
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,890
Please don't mistreat your body.

141
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,290
My body doesn't matter.

142
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,480
But what should Shulan do?

143
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,810
In this world,

144
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,170
there's no woman kinder than her.

145
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,500
She swallows her sorrows

146
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,750
and wipes her tears in private.

147
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,750
No matter how hard life is,

148
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,280
she's never once lost her temper with me.

149
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,300
We've been together for over 20 years,

150
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,520
and we've been through it all.

151
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,770
We've finally...

152
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,750
Why did they have to

153
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,260
tear us apart and rub salt in the wound?

154
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,020
Let's have breakfast first.
Leave the rest for later.

155
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,420
I bought some spicy soup.

156
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,870
Sit down.

157
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,070
Where's the spicy soup?

158
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,550
It's right here.

159
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,100
That was a total brain fart.

160
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,290
I failed to see
what's right under my nose.

161
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,220
You're probably confused
from not sleeping enough.

162
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,260
Here.

163
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,120
Eat.

164
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,940
It's darkest under the lamp.

165
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,350
What?

166
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,740
We can't let Liu Shusheng go!

167
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,620
Stay right here!

168
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,380
Your superior told me to leave.

169
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,100
You can't leave!

170
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,020
Alright, I won't leave, I won't leave.

171
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,860
What can you do to me?

172
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,720
Let me tell you.

173
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:55,810
Go, get inside.

174
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,460
You won't let me leave.

175
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,250
Hurry and leave!
If you're not leaving, then don't!

176
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,060
Don't leave!

177
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,630
This matter isn't over yet!

178
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,770
Go.

179
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,340
What are you doing?

180
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,670
Master, let me tell you.

181
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,460
Let me tell you.

182
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,380
I didn't have time during the search.

183
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,740
The table
was full of dishes and chopsticks.

184
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,530
It might have been darkest under the lamp.

185
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,390
Can you be sure?

186
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,980
If you can be certain the alms bowl
is on the table,

187
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,890
I'll apply for a search warrant right now.

188
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,620
-Okay.
-I'll be responsible for anything wrong!

189
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,170
Worst case,
I'll take off this police uniform!

190
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,140
Why would you be responsible?

191
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,860
I'll be responsible.

192
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,790
What responsibility can you take?

193
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,500
The woman is lying in the hospital!

194
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,810
A baby has gone!

195
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,340
I asked you out to eat some paomo.

196
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,870
It's to help you relax a bit.

197
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,630
Look at that expression on your face.

198
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,350
From the black pottery figurine case
until now,

199
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,350
it's been such a long time.

200
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,460
We've put in so much effort.

201
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,120
We've finally had some leads.

202
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,930
And now it's suddenly stopped.

203
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,530
That's not called stopping.

204
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,660
That's called managing.

205
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,470
Planning dynamically.

206
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,770
Observing its development.

207
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,860
You gather those clues

208
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,690
and build up evidence.

209
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,220
And you can defeat the enemy in one move.

210
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,680
Dacang.

211
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,020
Let me ask you.

212
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,650
If Mu Jianhui

213
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,460
invites you out for a meal, would you go?

214
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:30,930
No.

215
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,930
You fool.

216
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,260
You should go.

217
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,740
And go with a smile on your face.

218
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,930
This is also management.

219
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,460
No, no, no. I won't.

220
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,100
Why can cats catch mice?

221
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,150
Because their claws

222
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,610
can retract and extend.

223
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,500
Once the claws extend,

224
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,820
they can grab firmly and fiercely.

225
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,460
Let me give you some advice.

226
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,480
See if you can keep an eye on

227
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,770
that mouse's tail.

228
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,700
Where did Mu Jianhui

229
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,340
work when he was young?

230
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,900
The East Suburb Watch Factory.

231
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,150
Can you remember anything?

232
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,170
The case you handled yourself.

233
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,270
Yan Xiaowu is also from the watch factory.

234
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,630
They might know each other.

235
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,480
If we connect the dots,

236
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,900
the alms bowl

237
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,580
and black pottery figurines

238
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,220
might all be related to Mu Jianhui.

239
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,460
That's right.

240
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,930
Don't rush.

241
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,100
Take your time managing

242
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,370
and investigating the case.

243
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,280
Are you from the archaeological team?

244
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:46,890
It's okay.

245
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,860
Auntie Wang,
you're asking something you already know.

246
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,690
The whole village knows

247
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,850
I'm from the archaeological team.

248
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,930
Look at you.

249
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,380
Stop putting on airs.

250
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,740
Why are you pretending to be a big shot?

251
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,100
Who is in charge here? Come out.

252
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,500
If there's anything, tell me.
What's wrong?

253
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,020
You?

254
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,810
The land you're digging now

255
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,670
is my family's.

256
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,140
Don't you have to give me anything

257
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,400
for the holes you made?

258
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,770
Yeah, I'll be direct.

259
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,500
Give me the money, and you can dig here.

260
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,740
Leave if you don't.

261
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,260
We've got an official letter

262
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,380
issued by the government to do this.

263
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,570
I don't care about your official letter.

264
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,620
I only care about my land.

265
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,530
Since you've poked so many holes
in my land,

266
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,530
it can't be watered.

267
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,050
Without watering,
how can the seedlings survive?

268
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,740
My whole family

269
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,380
is counting on this land
to support our lives.

270
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,220
How are we gonna live?

271
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,220
-We're civilized. Don't make a scene here.
-Get lost!

272
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,890
Then I'll talk to you in a civilized way.

273
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,860
Why is there a subsidy for
the archaeological work in other villages?

274
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,460
Why is there none for our village?

275
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,260
The subsidy is issued by the government.

276
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,410
From the city level down to the district,
township,

277
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,810
and finally our village,

278
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,690
our archaeological team is not in charge

279
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,490
throughout the entire process.

280
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,100
The subsidy they promised you

281
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,260
will be awarded to you.

282
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,530
You can rest assured about this.

283
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:46,860
Okay.

284
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,930
Then when I get the money,

285
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,260
you can start digging, right?

286
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,660
Leave.

287
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,870
Auntie Wang,

288
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,170
why don't you trust us?

289
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,230
I only trust money.

290
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,990
Leave! Hurry up and leave!

291
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,620
Hurry!

292
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,110
What are you doing?

293
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,260
-Alright, alright.
-No more digging. Leave!

294
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,460
Alright, just let me take the stuff, okay?

295
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:01,860
Hurry.

296
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,440
Alright, alright.

297
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,500
Are you leaving or not?

298
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:04,940
I'll leave.

299
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,470
Give it to me and I'll leave.

300
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,569
Take it and leave.

301
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,700
Given what Auntie Wang did today,

302
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:10,810
well...

303
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,940
You two are back too.

304
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,849
We're not allowed to enter.

305
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:14,710
What happened?

306
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,740
If they don't get the subsidy,
we can't do the field trip.

307
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,599
What about you?

308
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,260
Same here.

309
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,790
I still need to find Uncle.

310
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,220
Even if the subsidy is in,
he still needs to stamp the paperwork.

311
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,500
Given the villagers' current attitude,

312
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,130
it's definitely not appropriate
to enter the field rashly.

313
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,530
Right.

314
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,840
Let him plead on their behalf

315
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,770
to see what's going on.

316
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,300
Let's go.

317
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,050
Why are you back so early today?

318
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,810
Qingguo's silly wife

319
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,740
is so unreasonable

320
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,870
that she stopped us.

321
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,460
She asked us for the subsidy.

322
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,190
Where's Dad?

323
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,790
He should come and mediate.

324
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,330
These uneducated old men and women
in the village

325
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,260
surely need to be dealt with!

326
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,810
Why are you yelling? Let's talk calmly.

327
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,540
I-I was talking about his wife.

328
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,420
Father isn't here. He went out.

329
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,280
Where did he go?

330
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,020
He said he was going to a meeting in town.

331
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,740
I guess

332
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,380
he won't be back for a while.

333
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,810
He doesn't leave early or late,

334
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,810
but as soon as there's trouble, he's gone.

335
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,270
How can you talk like that?

336
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,170
Father didn't leave on purpose.

337
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Let's not stand at the door.

338
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,660
Come inside. It's very cold.

339
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,850
Come on, let's go inside.
Come in, come in.

340
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,980
Come with me to the village committee
to find the accountant

341
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,530
to see what's going on with the subsidy.

342
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,770
It's no use even if you go.

343
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,330
Once the subsidy is in,
the accountant will definitely release it.

344
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,190
Let's just ask.

345
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,460
We'll go to the village committee.

346
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,440
Why are you asking me

347
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,610
about the subsidy?

348
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,610
I'm not the one who took the money.

349
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,420
Uncle, that's not what we meant.

350
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,570
We were wondering

351
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,370
if you could call the higher-ups

352
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,290
and ask about when the subsidy

353
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,740
will actually arrive.

354
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,110
I don't want to get involved in this mess.

355
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,290
As people often say,

356
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,090
"There is a huge gap
between superiors and subordinates."

357
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,770
I'm just a small accountant
in the village.

358
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,430
It's not my place to call them.

359
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,080
Wouldn't I be asking for trouble?

360
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,530
Well,

361
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,530
let's go back to the institute first.

362
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,590
We'll get back when the subsidy is in.

363
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,500
I see your mind is already at

364
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,610
the Lv Family Tomb.

365
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,230
To be honest,

366
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,580
it's already at Lvjia Village.

367
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
You're hopeless.

368
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,660
I'm not going back.
This matter isn't settled yet.

369
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,320
If the accountant won't go,
we'll go ourselves.

370
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,920
Go? Who do you know?

371
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,570
Do you know the township head
or the district chief?

372
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,770
I know Ma Chaoyue.

373
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,900
Don't you remember?

374
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,100
I saved his life once.

375
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,640
Shouldn't he do me a favor?

376
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,500
Do you a favor?

377
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,770
If I were him, it would be good enough
not to kick you out.

378
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,740
Do you a favor?

379
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,810
If he kicks me out, so be it.
It's just testing the waters.

380
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,340
Let's go.

381
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,470
Please come in.

382
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
Section Chief Ma.

383
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,500
You're here.

384
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,760
Are you busy right now?

385
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,050
Come on, have a seat.

386
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,710
Okay, okay.

387
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,370
What rare guests!

388
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,190
What wind blew you two here?

389
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,390
Aren't you doing archaeological work
in Yin Village?

390
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,240
What's the matter?

391
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,370
Well, about that...

392
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,430
We're facing a bit of trouble now.

393
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,290
You know, our fellow villagers...

394
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,420
Their archaeological subsidies
haven't been distributed yet.

395
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,880
They won't let us work
in the fields anymore.

396
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,570
You need to understand this situation.

397
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,370
It's not easy for the villagers either.

398
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,220
It's a reasonable request, after all.

399
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,770
I understand, I understand.

400
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,700
Of course we understand that.

401
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,050
Right.

402
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,380
I came today to ask about

403
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,180
when exactly

404
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,940
these subsidies

405
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,540
will be distributed to them.

406
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,350
Listen to yourself.

407
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,310
You've got me stumped.

408
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,770
If I had the official seal in my hands,

409
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,870
I could make sure the money

410
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,420
reaches our villagers' hands

411
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,130
today.

412
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,850
But you know, there's a process.

413
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,330
We need to ensure
every step is error-free.

414
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,230
The money

415
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,460
will be securely

416
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,260
deposited into the villagers' pockets.

417
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,660
Right?

418
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,900
Section Chief Ma,
you surely have some influence.

419
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,530
I mean,

420
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,220
can you do Yin Village a favor

421
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,630
and set up a fast track?

422
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,670
If I make exceptions for everything,

423
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,770
then what's the point

424
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,970
of having rules here?

425
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,570
Section Chief Ma.

426
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,120
It's like this.

427
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,980
Let's cut the small talk.

428
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,010
Given our relationship,

429
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,250
can we speak frankly?

430
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,110
Go ahead.

431
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,770
You're from the district office.

432
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,570
Can you go and give

433
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,570
the villagers an assurance?

434
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,570
Give them some peace of mind.

435
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,130
You sure know
how to assign tasks to others.

436
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,090
Once everyone feels at ease,

437
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,900
we'll naturally be able to
work in the fields.

438
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,460
Then we can continue with our work.

439
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,790
I'm just in charge of culture and tourism.

440
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,090
How can I interfere
with financial matters?

441
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,820
If you ask me,

442
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,330
you should stop work for now.

443
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,580
You'll start working again

444
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,180
when the subsidy is in place.

445
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,290
Run out of tricks, haven't you?

446
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,090
Stop with the hindsight wisdom.

447
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,020
No, I don't understand.

448
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,590
What are you so pleased about?

449
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,530
You got it right.

450
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,370
I am pleased.

451
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,090
I'm so pleased that I'm bubbling with joy.

452
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,810
I'm going to call Director Zhang
right now to report.

453
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,090
No.

454
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,700
I'm going to report good news.

455
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,900
Don't think that just because
work stops here,

456
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,360
you'll be able to
go to the Lv Family Tomb.

457
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,420
[Baliu District People's Government]

458
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,350
Don't think you're the only one
with a silver tongue.

459
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,850
Director Zhang, it's me, Shilin.

460
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,130
Yes.

461
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,420
We've got a big problem.

462
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,330
The villagers' subsidies
still haven't been distributed.

463
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,130
They won't let us work in the fields.

464
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,330
It's a serious issue.

465
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,600
Right, that's what I thought too.

466
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:03,980
Look,

467
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,260
there's not much scheduled recently.

468
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,850
How about

469
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,630
we go to the Lv Family Tomb to help out?

470
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,420
It's mainly Fang Kun.

471
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,210
He misses Luo Qing terribly
every day when he doesn't see her.

472
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,020
Every night, he called out in his bed,

473
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,260
"Luo Qing, Luo Qing."

474
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,470
I'm embarrassed to say it.
I'm even blushing.

475
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,080
How about

476
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,900
you let us two go help
at the Lv Family Tomb?

477
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,020
It'll ease his lovesickness
at the same time.

478
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,750
What do you think? Is that okay?

479
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,520
Don't worry.

480
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,370
Let's go.
We just have nothing better to do anyway.

481
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,500
Let's take a trip to the Lv Family Tomb.

482
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,460
You've completely ruined my image
in Director Zhang's eyes.

483
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,260
What image do you even have left?

484
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
Everyone, please continue eating.

485
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,940
I have something to tell you all.

486
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,020
Our preliminary
archaeological excavation plan

487
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,150
has been submitted.

488
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,610
Our main task at this stage

489
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,660
is to collect information

490
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,500
to lay the foundation
for the next step of field excavation.

491
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,740
Regarding this Lv Family Tomb,

492
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,850
those who know it best
and are most familiar with it

493
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,090
are still their descendants.

494
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,530
So, I was thinking

495
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,090
we should conduct

496
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,180
interviews and investigations with them

497
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,330
to get a clear understanding
of the basic situation of the tomb.

498
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,060
I volunteer.

499
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,390
I'm super good at dealing with people.

500
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,900
Don't be so sure yet.

501
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,640
This matter is not simple.

502
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,850
Captain Luo.

503
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,900
Mrs. Zan, why are you here?

504
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,500
Ms. Xiang.

505
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,770
Could you arrange a place for me to stay?

506
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,630
Are you coming out of retirement?

507
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
I heard that the institute

508
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,610
has sent out
all the field archaeological teams.

509
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,140
You're short-handed here.

510
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,610
Even Mr. Hou
from artifact authentication has come.

511
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,020
I have nothing to do,

512
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,020
so I came to lend a hand, okay?

513
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,220
That's great.

514
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,330
Ms. Luo, who is this?

515
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,370
Let me introduce her to you.

516
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,660
This is Ms. Xiang,

517
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,260
a senior in our archaeology field.

518
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,940
She mainly focuses on
Sui and Tang dynasty archaeology.

519
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,280
Let's give her a warm welcome.

520
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,290
Welcome, Ms. Xiang.

521
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:50,940
Hello, Ms. Xiang.

522
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,270
Hello everyone, hello.

523
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,700
Please, continue eating.

524
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,260
Alright, alright.

525
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,740
Let's eat, let's eat.

526
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,740
Ms. Xiang, you can stay with me then.

527
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,290
It'll be convenient for me
to consult with you.

528
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,370
Come on, I'll help you move in first.

529
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,300
Okay, thank you.

530
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,880
Lv Dalin is the founding father
of our archaeology field.

531
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm just here for the participation.

532
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
Making important decisions

533
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,720
still relies on you young people.

534
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,060
[Outpatient and Inpatient Department]

535
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:15,900
Shulan.

536
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,540
Say something to me, please.

537
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,750
You can resent me, hate me,

538
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,700
or even wish me dead.

539
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
Anything is fine.

540
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,160
Just don't give me the silent treatment.

541
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,370
What right do I have

542
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,870
to blame others?

543
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,730
The baby has gone under my care.

544
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,330
I deserve to die.

545
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,630
What nonsense are you talking about?

546
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,900
It's just that
we weren't meant to be with the baby.

547
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,300
It's not anyone's fault.

548
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,970
The Buddhist scriptures say

549
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,010
that the bond between children and parents

550
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,980
is very deep.

551
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,370
Some come to repay kindness,

552
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,830
some to settle grudges,

553
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,480
some to collect debts,

554
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,420
and some to repay debts.

555
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,250
I wonder what kind of bond

556
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,530
our baby had with us.

557
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,590
Stop it,

558
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,940
Jianhui.

559
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,790
I know your ancestors were once glorious,

560
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,170
so you're dissatisfied
with the current situation.

561
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,470
You want to be superior to others.

562
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,150
But your greed

563
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,810
has already destroyed our baby.

564
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,330
Plant good seeds

565
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,990
to reap good fruits.

566
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,440
Stop harming others and yourself.

567
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,740
Guang,

568
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,910
what do you think

569
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,330
of this alms bowl?

570
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,590
It's beautiful.

571
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,600
No matter how beautiful it is,

572
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,220
I gained it

573
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,410
at the cost of my baby's wife.

574
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,750
Do you think it's worth it?

575
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,240
They say,

576
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,030
Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life,

577
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,290
Earth has the generosity
to bear all things,

578
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,170
and a gentleman
takes pleasure in helping others succeed.

579
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,150
Why haven't I encountered any of these?

580
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,940
This world

581
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,310
always seems to be against me.

582
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,960
I take one step forward,

583
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,830
and it punches me.

584
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,990
Sometimes I want to give up,

585
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,150
but I'm not the one who's wrong.

586
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,610
I can't bow my head.

587
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,360
Jianhui,

588
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,480
let's stop this business.

589
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,560
An alms bowl for your baby's life,

590
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,220
just to get a smile from someone.

591
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,110
I can't do such a thing.

592
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,910
You're wrong.

593
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,040
This is a path paved

594
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,740
with your nephew's life.

595
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,390
This path leads to Hong Kong,

596
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,700
to Europe,

597
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,420
to the whole world.

598
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,950
If we make this path work,

599
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,240
your nephew's death

600
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,420
will not be in vain.

601
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,860
Is money more important
than your baby's life?

602
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,510
Is there nothing else in life

603
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,430
to strive for besides money?

604
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:09,840
There is.

605
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,920
There must be something
more noble than money

606
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,120
that can lead us elsewhere.

607
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,420
What?

608
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,940
Belief.

609
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,270
Shulan believes in Buddha.

610
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,830
In the end,

611
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,320
isn't it just finding a path

612
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,060
when there seems to be no way out?

613
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,580
I only believe in myself,

614
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,830
because I know

615
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,710
which path I want to take.

616
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,870
Mu Jianhui is my former coworker.

617
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,910
We used to work

618
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,660
at the watch factory.

619
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
We're just nodding acquaintances.

620
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,240
What's the matter?

621
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,550
Go ahead.

622
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,200
I've confessed everything I should.

623
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,730
I've been

624
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,700
in this prison for so many years.

625
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,950
I've accepted my fate.

626
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,320
What more do you want?

627
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,550
What do you want?

628
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,350
Xiaowu.

629
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,500
You

630
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,150
are very loyal.

631
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,670
You're good

632
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,760
to your family and friends.

633
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,910
But you need to differentiate
between situations.

634
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,730
You've taken the blame
for all their wrongdoings,

635
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,740
covering up for them.

636
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,490
You've sacrificed
your youth and the rest of your life.

637
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,320
Is it worth it?

638
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,040
Cover up?

639
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Captain Qi, who am I covering up for?

640
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,060
So stubborn.

641
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,730
I don't understand what you're saying.

642
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,530
Why would I cover up for others?

643
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,040
If not for yourself,

644
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,860
don't you think about your wife and child?

645
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,020
I'm here,

646
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,240
with these handcuffs on.

647
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,170
I don't care about others anymore.

648
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,410
You're right. This is indeed genuine.

649
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,620
It's a fine piece.

650
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,460
Look,

651
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,700
the rim here

652
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,750
is inlaid with silver studs,

653
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,570
featuring 12 curved ribs,

654
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,130
a deeply curved belly,

655
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,480
and a concave base.

656
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,530
Inside,

657
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,700
it's decorated with a peony spray pattern,

658
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,430
and outside,

659
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,630
there's a peony scroll pattern.

660
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,500
The condition is exquisite.

661
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,020
It's truly rare.

662
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,660
Take another good look at it.

663
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,110
You've said it all.

664
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,980
I've racked my brains
and can't think of anything else to add.

665
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,180
Don't be ridiculous.

666
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,350
You need to look carefully.

667
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,830
Later, when you negotiate the price
with Mr. Mu,

668
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,420
don't let him take advantage of you.

669
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:46,790
I'm telling you.

670
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,120
I don't dare to negotiate the price today.

671
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,920
My skills are quite limited.

672
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,030
Besides,

673
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,980
it's my first time
seeing this treasure too.

674
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,070
Xiao is raising its value here.

675
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,910
Then I'll be thick-skinned

676
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,500
and give Mr. Zhao my price.

677
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,150
That's more like it.

678
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,590
You two go on.

679
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,150
I'll go check out the backyard.

680
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,980
Don't wander off.

681
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,150
I'll need you for something later.

682
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,210
Alright, alright.

683
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,310
Mr. Mu,

684
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,260
tell me your expected price.

685
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,550
Let's see if you can

686
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,840
give me a shock.

687
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,430
Mr. Zhao, don't tease me.

688
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,790
Even if I'm not good at taking hints,

689
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,950
I know better than to underestimate you.

690
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,430
How dare I try to fool you?

691
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,940
I don't want money for this alms bowl.

692
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,540
I'm giving it to you as a gift.

693
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,030
That won't do.

694
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,460
Everything has its price.

695
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,880
I can't take advantage of small favors.

696
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,660
Taking small advantages

697
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,200
leads to owing big favors.

698
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,870
It'll be hard to settle accounts later.

699
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,670
Now, there are

700
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,830
two options.

701
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,030
Either

702
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,630
you follow the market price

703
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,760
and name your price,

704
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,360
or

705
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,640
take your item and leave.

706
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,220
Since I've brought it here,

707
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,880
I don't plan on taking it back.

708
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,660
If Mr. Zhao doesn't want it today,
I'll smash it.

709
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,830
Listen to yourself.

710
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,910
You're trying to put me in a bind,

711
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,370
stuck between two choices

712
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,320
and unable to move forward or back.

713
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,070
Bro.

714
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,990
Talking about money

715
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,850
doesn't hurt feelings.

716
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,020
But when it comes to feelings,

717
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,480
it lightens one's wallet.

718
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,850
If you have something to say,

719
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,050
just say it straight.

720
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,360
You have a discerning eye.

721
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,040
I was just planning
in my head how to put it,

722
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,900
and you've seen right through me.

723
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,520
It's like this.

724
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:38,180
I've been in the tomb-raiding business
for 10 years,

725
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,380
but I've only managed to make ends meet.

726
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,500
When it comes to
finding tombs and appraising goods,

727
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,100
I'm unchallenged as the best

728
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,350
in Qinzhou.

729
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,700
But without a bridge,
I can't cross the river.

730
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,790
Without a ladder,
I can't climb the building.

731
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,850
The treasures in my hands are wasted.

732
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,270
Let me be straight with you.

733
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,350
I just want to ride under your banner.

734
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,110
My banner

735
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,180
isn't the best.

736
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,320
But it holds an impressive status.

737
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,930
Are you trying to join me
with just this item?

738
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,530
Wouldn't that render my place
less important?

739
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,710
Of course, I wouldn't dare to belittle you
with just one alms bowl.

740
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,580
But this time,

741
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,120
I'd dare to snatch sparrows
from a hawk's nest.

742
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,050
Next time, if you want the moon,

743
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,300
I'll climb to the sky to fetch it.

744
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,110
If you want a turtle,

745
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,730
I'll dive into the ocean to catch it.

746
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,930
As long as you can name

747
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,740
the treasures in Qinzhou,

748
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,940
I can get them for you.

749
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,310
Leave the dirty work to me.

750
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,470
You just sit comfortably
in your command tent.

751
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:49,830
Well,

752
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,150
let me know when you're free.

753
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,240
Take a trip to Hong Kong.

754
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,270
I'm sorry,

755
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,550
the number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

756
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,730
Wen Wen.

757
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,429
Where's Shulan?

758
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,250
She has been discharged from the hospital.

759
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,250
She said she wants to stay
in the mountains for a while.

760
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,040
That's fine.

761
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,040
Take good care of her.

762
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,170
It's cool in the mountains.
Don't let her catch a cold.

763
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,570
Remember to have her soak her feet
at night.

764
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,540
If you need anything,
I'll bring it there another day.

765
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:51,980
Got it.

766
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,350
Hello, Auntie.

767
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,190
We came here before.

768
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,250
Do you remember us?

769
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,100
We'd like to visit Fugui.

770
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,640
Here, these are for you.

771
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,230
He's gone out.

772
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,540
When will he be back?

773
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,870
I don't know.

774
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,220
Well,

775
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,130
we

776
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,460
need to collect a lot of information
before the excavation.

777
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,060
Fugui knows the most

778
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,100
about the Lv family's affairs.

779
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,870
We'd like to consult with him in person.

780
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,270
He can't help you with

781
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,190
your scholarly matters.

782
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,590
Well, we won't bother you then.

783
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,430
Thank you.

784
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,340
Take these with you.

785
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,460
Senior.

786
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,610
Mr. Hou.

787
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,520
Do you have any findings
on your end today?

788
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,190
I'm sorry,
I don't have much success either.

789
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
The villagers here

790
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,540
don't know anything
about relics or remains.

791
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,310
Some people

792
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,630
can't even explain the history
of the Lv family clearly.

793
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,350
But they all say

794
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,500
that Lv Fugui's family

795
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,230
has the most information on this.

796
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,200
They say that in the entire Lvjia Village,

797
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,790
they know the most about the Lv family.

798
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,980
This Lv Fugui is really hard to deal with.

799
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,350
I think we should just
forget about all this.

800
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,940
Let's just do the field survey directly.

801
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,420
To understand the structure of the tomb,

802
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,550
a field survey by just us is not enough.

803
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,640
That Lv Fugui doesn't show up.

804
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
What should we do?

805
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,230
Captain Qi said,

806
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,790
he'll bring the suspects
to identify the scene this afternoon.

807
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,120
Lv Fugui should appear.

808
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,050
Finally caught these guys.

809
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,840
Was this pit dug by you?

810
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,790
Yes.

811
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,270
Get up.

812
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,030
Wang Taiping.

813
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,190
Guo Fengshan.

814
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,970
Both of you, say to the camera.

815
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,500
Did you dig this looting pit?

816
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,280
-Yes.
-Yes.

817
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,700
Louder!

818
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,560
-Yes!
-Yes!

819
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,400
Let's go.

820
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,200
Captain Qi, Captain Qi!

821
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,020
Let Fugui come in.

822
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,580
Let Fugui come in.

823
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,850
Fellow villagers.

824
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,640
No more talk.

825
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,440
No more talk, no more talk.

826
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,050
Taiping.

827
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,060
I won't hit you.

828
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,500
It's not that I don't want to.

829
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,160
It's our ancestors who forbid it.

830
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,960
Four Virtuous Lv Brothers

831
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,520
taught people etiquette and righteousness

832
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,150
and rectified customs
in the Guanzhong region.

833
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,790
They wrote down
the principles of proper conduct

834
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,450
in the Lv's Village Covenant,

835
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,790
so that elders could pass them on
to their descendants

836
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,620
generation by generation.

837
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,510
Taiping, look what you did.

838
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,990
You dug up our ancestors' tombs

839
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,580
just for some money

840
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,080
and trampled on the teachings
passed down for thousands of years.

841
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,760
You've brought shame

842
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,910
to our long-standing reputation.

843
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,420
This is what we call
disgracing our ancestors!

844
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,480
Do you understand?

845
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,010
I have sinned!

846
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,630
I have committed evil deeds!

847
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,230
Repeat after me.

848
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,750
Get up!

849
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,270
Virtue means doing good
whenever you see it

850
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,370
and correcting mistakes
when you hear them.

851
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,280
Virtue means doing good
whenever you see it

852
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,620
and correcting mistakes
when you hear them.

853
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,530
One should be able to govern oneself.

854
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,590
One should be able to govern oneself.

855
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,980
Manage one's family.

856
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,890
Manage one's family.

857
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,950
Show respect to
one's parents and older siblings.

858
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,920
Show respect to
one's parents and older siblings.

859
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,440
Teach one's children and younger siblings.

860
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,900
Teach one's children and younger siblings.

861
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,630
Command one's servants.

862
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,480
Command one's servants.

863
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,760
Maintain one's political integrity
and moral authority.

864
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,800
Maintain one's political integrity
and moral authority.

865
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,360
Serve one's elders and superiors.

866
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,290
Serve one's elders and superiors.

867
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,150
Maintain harmony
with relatives and friends.

868
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,810
Choose one's friends wisely.

869
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,030
Stay true to honest and upright values.

870
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,880
Be generous in bestowing favors.

871
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,360
Be trustworthy.

872
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,070
Help those in distress.

873
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,920
Correct one's mistakes.

874
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,590
Plan for others.

875
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,170
Bring people together to get things done.

876
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,590
Fugui!

877
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,760
Fugui, Fugui!

878
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,110
Fugui.

879
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,150
Hello, I am...

880
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,230
I know you.

881
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,680
I don't know

882
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:11,960
the thing you're going to ask about.

883
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,510
Fugui,

884
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,670
do you have any issues
with our archaeological team?

885
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,670
I'm just a farmer.

886
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,230
How could I have any opinions
about you educated people?

887
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,090
Let me tell you,

888
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,520
the Lv family affairs

889
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,310
are all written in the books.

890
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,510
Reading books and newspapers
is your forte, isn't it?

891
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,440
Go home and read them yourself.

892
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,640
I can't comment on it.

893
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,280
Fugui,

894
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,800
we know you know the Lv family best.

895
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,230
Could you tell us about it?

896
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,560
Don't try to flatter me.

897
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,700
I can't bear it.

898
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,330
Fugui, it's like this,

899
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,590
we do have the documents,

900
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,920
and we're all studying them.

901
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,450
However,

902
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,150
many remains, like the Lv Family Tomb,

903
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,960
aren't recorded in the relevant books.

904
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,690
For example,

905
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,650
how large
is the Lv Family Tomb area exactly?

906
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,670
Where is the Spirit Way?

907
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,360
Where is the family temple?

908
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,090
I don't know.

909
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,320
Fugui, we can pay you.

910
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,510
That's not what I meant.

911
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,800
Kid, do you know how to talk?

912
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,840
Is this how an educated person speaks?

913
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,510
Listen to yourself.

914
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,670
Do you know the saying
"Virtuous men earn wealth righteously"?

915
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,150
I'm sorry.

916
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,400
If you don't know, I'll teach you.

917
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,130
Please, please don't be angry.

918
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,300
Although I'm not wealthy,

919
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,710
I know what money I should
and shouldn't earn.

920
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,880
I know what to do.

921
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,610
It's still those words.

922
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,320
I won't say anymore.
You figure it out yourselves.

923
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,070
No, Fugui, that's not what I...

924
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,130
Alright, alright.

925
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,920
What a coincidence!

926
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,960
Kun, Shilin.

927
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,040
Fang Kun.

928
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:33,970
Shilin.

929
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,910
What's going on here?

930
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,920
Well,

931
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,910
you really know how to make an entrance.

932
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,880
What are you standing there for?

933
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,810
Let's go, hurry.

934
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,080
Let's go, let's go.
We'll talk back at the base.

935
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:11,640
Jianhui,

936
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,550
our Song Dynasty ceramics
have just been listed.

937
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,960
And an antique shop in Hong Kong
called Xiwan

938
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
wants 300 pieces.

939
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,460
I got it.

940
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,070
You prepare the customs declaration.

941
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,730
I'll personally deliver the goods
to Hong Kong.

942
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,500
[Hong Kong]

943
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,710
Finally arrived.

944
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,180
Let's check our goods.

945
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,480
Beautiful, indeed.
