[Episode 2]

3
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,600
Didn't you answer

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,080
some of their questions last time?

5
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,680
This time,

6
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,750
they've come up with a few tricky questions again.

7
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,080
What kind of questions?

8
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,830
Simply put,

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,920
which looting pit did these pottery figurines come from?

10
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,740
But doesn't Winthrop Auction House

11
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,690
usually specify the origin?

12
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,370
You mean Sanmiao Village?

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,390
What?

14
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,030
Sanmiao Village?

15
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,880
They labeled it as from Sanmiao Village in the western suburbs.

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Western suburbs?

17
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,669
Wulingyuan in the western suburbs?

18
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,820
It's not that far.

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,830
So these pottery figurines we've recovered this time,

20
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,850
what are their characteristics?

21
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,200
Are they the same as those of the six pieces?

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,990
Well, the degree of blackness

23
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,440
of these pottery figurines varies.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,310
Some are darker,

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,060
while others are lighter.

[Sanmiao Village]

27
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,250
Why isn't he answering the phone?

28
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,250
He must be asleep.

29
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,170
Sleeping that deeply, huh?

30
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,590
Captain Qi, we found it.

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,660
You found the looting pit?

32
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,200
No,

33
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,870
in the farmland near Sanmiao Village,

34
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,150
I found tools hidden by the tomb raiders.

35
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,350
How did you find them?

36
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,360
Well, that's because Captain Yang is so experienced.

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
He took me around the village to ask questions.

38
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,270
A villager said

39
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,440
that his farmland had been destroyed.

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,870
But it is just a small area.

41
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,110
Captain Yang thought this was a bit strange,

42
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,320
so he brought me over to take a look.

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,100
And guess what?

44
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,760
Only this area was flattened.

45
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,140
I quickly dug it up,

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,320
and as soon as I did, I found these tomb-raiding tools.

47
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,360
Newly buried.

48
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,360
There are only two possibilities.

49
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,340
Either they haven't started digging yet,

50
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,350
or they're halfway through.

51
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,829
There's no looting pit nearby?

52
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,670
This area is quite large, and it's not easy to search.

53
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,780
But Captain Yang said, since the tools are here,

54
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,970
they haven't succeeded yet.

55
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,110
They should be back soon.

56
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,550
Right.

57
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,490
Quickly restore everything to its original position

58
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,770
at the scene.

59
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,800
Hide nearby.

60
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,290
Don't startle them.

61
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,610
I'm coming right away.

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,930
It's right here.

63
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,710
Oh my goodness.

64
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,660
The pit is already dug.

65
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,150
Looks like they're going to loot artifacts today.

66
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,410
Luckily, we came today.

67
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,270
Otherwise, it would have been over.

68
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,910
Slowly, slowly.

69
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,520
Hold on to it.

70
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,590
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

71
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,050
Hold on to it, hold on to it.

72
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,850
Oh my god!

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,390
H-How did he go down?

74
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,170
Are you okay?

75
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,210
Say something.

76
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,030
I'm gonna die from that fall!

77
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,980
Hurry, hurry!

78
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,030
The shovel is coming.

79
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,120
Don't drop me like I dropped him.

80
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,240
Get down quickly, quickly.

81
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,500
Why hasn't Captain Qi arrived yet?

82
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,270
If they succeed in looting artifacts, they'll get away.

83
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,530
There are three of them and only two of us.

84
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,050
Chasing them is a problem.

85
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,520
They won't get away.

86
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,580
Why do you say that?

87
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,150
I have a gun.

88
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,510
What's there to be afraid of?

89
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,730
We're two against one now.

90
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,680
Let's catch him red-handed.

91
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,880
We'll deal with the two below later.

92
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,690
We can do it.

93
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,880
Why bother with all that effort?

94
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,520
Why?

95
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,320
Look at that pit.

96
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,710
There's only one person there.

97
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll go over and kick him down with one foot.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,600
We'll catch them all at once.

99
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,690
We can do it.

100
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,940
Police! The police are here!

101
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,080
-Stop!
-Go after him!

102
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Stop right there!

103
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,150
Captain Yang!

104
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,280
Guard the entrance!

105
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,610
Okay.

106
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,059
Be careful.

107
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,200
Stop!

108
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,170
Shots fired!

109
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,100
Don't move!

110
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,690
Still running?

111
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,120
Run if you can!

112
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,910
What took you so long to get here?

113
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,170
Where's Captain Yang?

114
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,710
Inside.

115
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,030
Captain Yang!

116
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,760
Are you alright?

117
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,640
I'm fine.

118
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,600
No movement from them, right?

119
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,050
No.

120
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,200
Did you catch

121
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,080
that on-site commander of the tomb robbery?

122
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,590
Yeah.

123
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,430
Guys!

124
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,080
It's stuffy down there!

125
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,060
Come up for some air!

126
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,260
Are you sure there are two of them?

127
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,920
Sure.

128
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,610
Zhou and I saw them clearly.

129
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Has there been no movement at all?

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,770
They probably heard the commotion up here.

131
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,500
They don't dare to make a sound.

132
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,750
Bro!

133
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,450
Your accomplice has already confessed.

134
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,870
There's no need for you to hold out down there.

135
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,990
Come up quickly.

136
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,450
How about I give you a hand?

137
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,640
Yongfu.

138
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,120
They don't have a blower.

139
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,540
There's not much oxygen left down there.

140
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,470
Contact the nearby village and police station

141
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,520
to ask for a blower.

142
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,580
I've made the call.

143
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,010
I've made it.

144
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,160
Guys.

145
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,090
You're both professionals.

146
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,080
You know

147
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,470
the oxygen down there won't last much longer.

148
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,220
It's not worth risking your lives

149
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,290
any further.

150
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,440
Right?

151
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,680
Well,

152
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,450
if you come up now,

153
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,260
I'll consider it as turning yourselves in.

154
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,090
We can arrange for leniency. What do you think?

155
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,560
He's asking us to turn ourselves in?

156
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,630
-You can think about it.
-Think of us as fools?

157
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,680
Just say the word.

158
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,750
Let us know.

159
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,090
-You're safe, okay?
-If we're caught red-handed...

160
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,150
Even if we turn ourselves in, we'll still be sentenced.

161
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,320
No response?

162
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,030
I'm going to answer the phone.

163
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:23,710
Hello.

164
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,920
Go ahead.

165
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,800
Guys,

166
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,490
say something!

167
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,440
Tie.

168
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,080
Tie.

169
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,890
Tie, don't fall asleep.

170
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,750
If you do, you'll stop breathing.

171
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,780
Captain Qi.

172
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,800
The village and the police station don't have any blowers.

173
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,710
The director said to borrow one from the neighboring village.

174
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,840
That'll be too late.

175
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,030
We can't wait anymore.

176
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,090
What are you doing?

177
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,650
What are you doing?

178
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,760
If anyone's going down, it should be me.

179
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,410
That's enough!

180
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,450
How many tomb raiders have you dealt with?

181
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,920
Once someone comes down...

182
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,320
You two, stop talking nonsense.

183
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,230
The oxygen is thin down there.

184
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,490
We're going to hit him.

185
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,660
We'll take down as many of them as come down.

186
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,590
Captain Yang...

187
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,640
If we keep dawdling, they're going to die!

188
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Slow down, slow down, slow down!

189
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,800
-Captain Qi, slow down!
-Loosen a bit.

190
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,840
Hold on to it, hold on to it.

191
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,290
Loosen a bit, loosen a bit, come on.

192
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,490
Loosen a bit, come on.

193
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,080
You two can come if you want,

194
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,710
but why do you have to drag me into this?

195
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,110
When the cat's away, the mice will play.

196
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,400
Mr. Zan will scold us to death after he returns.

197
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,720
You're Fang Kun's pillar of strength.

198
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,440
Once you leave,

199
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,080
he

200
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,990
will lose all his souls completely.

201
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,990
Aren't you afraid that with this pillar of strength around,

202
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,630
he might poke a hole in the sky?

203
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,030
You...

204
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,870
Sir.

205
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,510
May I ask you something?

206
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,370
Is Sanmiao Village somewhere around here?

207
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,230
Yes, it is. Why?

208
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,540
Is there an ancient tomb in this village?

209
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,130
What do you do?

210
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,070
We're an archaeological team here to do research.

211
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,960
Yes, that's right.

212
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,200
Archaeologist team, huh?

213
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,420
A gang of tomb raiders was just caught last night.

214
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,400
I guess there must be an ancient tomb.

215
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,320
Otherwise, why would those tomb raiders

216
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,720
be digging around there?

217
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,280
D-Do you know where it is?

218
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,940
Where is it?

219
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,800
Go straight ahead from here.

220
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,330
It's about 500 meters away.

221
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,970
But now the police have cordoned off the area.

222
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,630
Thank you, sir.

223
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,230
Thank you, thank you so much.

224
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,320
What a coincidence.

225
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,920
We've just arrived and already encountered tomb robbery.

226
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,040
Could it be the black pottery figurine gang?

227
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,750
It can't be, right?

228
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,710
The situation is so tense right now.

229
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,510
They wouldn't dare to commit crimes in such circumstances.

230
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,840
Let's make way, come on.

231
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,230
Fang Kun.

232
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,230
-Mr. You.
-Mr. You.

233
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,560
What are you doing here?

234
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,080
We heard that the black pottery figurines were from here.

235
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,280
So we wanted to take a look.

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,530
On the day when those six black pottery figurines were withdrawn from auction,

237
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,680
it was these young archaeologists

238
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,570
who helped answer the questions.

239
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,110
So young.

240
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,830
Truly accomplished at such a young age.

241
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,880
You... You're also here to see the black pottery figurines?

242
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,510
Yes, yes.

243
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,510
Well,

244
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,710
we'll wait for you up ahead. See you in a bit.

245
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,770
Alright, alright.

246
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,010
The one who can solve our puzzle has arrived.

247
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,540
Let's go.

248
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,840
You're awake.

249
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,620
Officer Qi.

250
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,450
How many years have you been a police officer?

251
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,280
Why are you still so eager to take the lead?

252
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,080
You acted like a reckless rookie.

253
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,920
Do you know

254
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,040
you almost lost your life in there?

255
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,400
My head hurts badly. I need some quiet.

256
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,860
Of course it hurts.

257
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,030
Luckily, the oxygen was extremely low in that pit.

258
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,870
The tomb raiders didn't have much strength.

259
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,580
Otherwise,

260
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,120
you'd be gone.

261
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,540
Even Captain Yang couldn't stop you.

262
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,990
Look how capable you think you are.

263
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,110
What are you smiling about?

264
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,840
You just can't be more serious.

265
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,560
You've finally woken up.

266
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,920
You scared us to death.

267
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Chief Zhao, well,

268
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,140
Mr. You brought Director Zhang here.

269
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,550
It's alright.

270
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,370
Okay.

271
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,740
Hey, put it down slowly. Slowly.

272
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,680
Keep an eye on him.

273
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,230
Mr. You.

274
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,800
Chief Zhao.

275
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,230
Thank you for coming all the way here.

276
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,440
Captain Yang, Chief Zhao is here.

277
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,110
Mr. You.

278
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,920
Thank you for making such a special trip.

279
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,510
It's no trouble at all.

280
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,110
It's nothing compared to your efforts.

281
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,240
I didn't expect such high efficiency.

282
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,400
Who's down there?

283
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,330
Director Zhang.

284
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,750
He got excited as soon as he arrived.

285
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,590
So he went down by himself.

286
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,800
I don't think these black pottery figurines

287
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,060
have any connection to Sanmiao Village.

288
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,990
Why?

289
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,660
-What evidence?
-What evidence do you have?

290
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,230
What's the main manufacturing technique for black pottery figurines?

291
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,830
Assembly.

292
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,450
Molding.

293
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,630
That's right.

294
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,280
And they have diverse forms.

295
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,830
They're also much smaller than the terracotta figures of the Qin Dynasty,

296
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,080
with proportional body proportions,

297
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
full-faced appearances,

298
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,430
and lifelike expressions.

299
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,680
These characteristics

300
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,630
are all consistent with those

301
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,960
of the pottery figurines unearthed from the Western Han Imperial Mausoleums.

302
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,560
So I can basically determine

303
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
that they were unearthed from the Western Han Imperial Mausoleums.

304
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,440
But look at this area beneath our feet,

305
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Sanmiao Village.

306
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,410
Although it's relatively close to Wulingyuan,

307
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,280
it's still quite far from the Western Han Imperial Mausoleums.

308
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,040
So I think

309
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,570
the possibility of them being unearthed here

310
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,080
is almost non-existent.

311
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,540
That makes sense, really.

312
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,780
There's really something to you.

313
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,820
Quite professional, aren't you?

314
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,770
Where are you from?

315
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,800
-Who are you?
-Y-You are...

316
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,020
I'm from the Qinchuan City Public Security Bureau.

317
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,680
I'm Captain of the Cultural Relics Inspection Team.

318
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,599
My name is Qi Dacang.

319
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,260
Captain Qi.

320
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,190
W-We are graduate students from Qinbei University.

321
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,890
-We're from the Department of Archeology.
-Department of Archeology.

322
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,420
Fang Kun.

323
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,550
Guo Shilin.

324
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,079
Luo Qing.

325
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,290
Young students.

326
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,319
Who brought you here?

327
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,500
Mr. You.

328
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,339
Mr. You.

329
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,680
Zan Maochang is our supervisor.

330
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,500
Have you been to the scene?

331
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:29,950
No.

332
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,470
But about the black pottery figurines

333
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,990
at the Winthrop Auction House,

334
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,470
we answered the questions.

335
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,310
If you study cultural relics,

336
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,310
you're experts in the field.

337
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,840
We wouldn't dare to say that.

338
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,440
I'm just an outsider anyway.

339
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,600
But why do I say

340
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,270
there's something to what he said?

341
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,850
Look,

342
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,410
have you seen the Terracotta Warriors of Emperor Qin Shi Huang?

343
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,670
Yes.

344
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,120
You see, those Terracotta Warriors,

345
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,510
each one has a different face.

346
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,070
Why?

347
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,790
They're life-sized, and some are even larger than life.

348
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,990
They're all painted.

349
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,680
It shows the nation's strength.

350
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,320
By the Han Dynasty...

351
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,450
-The terracotta figures buried with him...
-He's coming up.

352
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,980
-Slowly.
-Slowly, slowly.

353
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,120
Pull, pull hard.

354
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,270
Come on, come on, pull hard.

355
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,360
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

356
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,560
Quick, quick, quick.

357
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,090
One, two, three, go.

358
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,560
Did you see anything?

359
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,420
What did you eat? You're so heavy.

360
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
Turn that off, turn that off.

361
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,130
Come on, come on, slowly.

362
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,470
How is it? What's the situation down there?

363
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,270
It's just

364
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,960
an ordinary Qing Dynasty tomb.

365
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,200
If we rule out this looting pit,

366
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,070
could Sanmiao Village

367
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,130
be the excavation site of the black pottery figurines?

368
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,850
It's hard to say.

369
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,550
From the structure,

370
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,230
I'm also inclined to believe the black pottery figurines

371
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,840
are basically consistent

372
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,160
with the pottery figurines found in the Western Han Imperial Mausoleums.

373
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,750
However,

374
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,560
archaeology needs to speak with evidence.

375
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,750
After all, we haven't found

376
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,510
identical black pottery figurines

377
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,440
in any imperial mausoleums.

378
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,790
What if

379
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,160
this is just our subjective speculation?

380
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,200
We might be missing the forest for the trees.

381
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,790
If we're heading in the wrong direction,

382
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,320
we'll get further and further from the truth.

383
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,710
-Chief Zhao, we're leaving.
-Thank you.

384
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,770
-See you.
-See you.

385
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,550
Thank you for your efforts.

386
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,150
Thank you.

387
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,440
Drive slowly.

388
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,440
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

389
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,160
Too many hands make light work, but too many heads make for confusion.

390
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,230
So many experts,

391
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,000
yet not one has a solid idea.

392
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,880
It's like they didn't say anything at all.

393
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,230
But they're on the right track, aren't they?

394
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,990
They're experts after all. They need to be rigorous.

395
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,270
Eyes wide open, mouth slow to speak.

396
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,980
You think

397
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,440
they're all as clueless as you?

398
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,610
Like hitting a louse with a hammer.

399
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,600
Big show,

400
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,200
no results.

401
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,180
Stay safe, Chief Zhao.

402
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,130
And he's judging me?

403
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,160
He's really angry.

404
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,510
Dacang.

405
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,730
Is your injury better now?

406
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,840
It doesn't hurt anymore?

407
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,100
It's nothing, really.

408
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,880
When the tomb raider hit me with that shovel, his hand was already weak.

409
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
-Good for you.
-I was planning to...

410
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,840
Pretend to be sick for a couple of days

411
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,770
to make my master feel sorry for me.

412
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,360
Instead, I got disciplined

413
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
and have to write a self-criticism.

414
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,080
The lead in Sanmiao Village has gone cold again.

415
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah.

416
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,760
Looks like we can only start with King Hua now.

417
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,750
Well,

418
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,160
I'll go back now

419
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,330
and do a surprise inspection.

420
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,240
Alright.

421
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,600
Okay.

422
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,870
I'll go first.

423
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,410
Captain Qi.

424
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,970
-Captain Qi.
-Captain Qi.

425
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,400
What's going on with you guys?

426
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,210
Haven't left yet?

427
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,610
Right.

428
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,410
We have something we'd like to discuss with you.

429
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,120
You see,

430
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,610
it's difficult to find a needle in the sea.

431
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,490
Why don't we focus on the needle itself?

432
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,490
What do you think?

433
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,610
What do you mean?

434
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,090
We want to take a look at the black pottery figurines.

435
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,640
Each of these black pottery figurines...

436
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,120
Has a slightly different shade of black.

437
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,020
Is that all?

438
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:30,840
Well,

439
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,500
it's been almost half an hour.

440
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,780
I've risked making a mistake,

441
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,290
and this is the conclusion you gave me?

442
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,370
Has a different shade of black?

443
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,440
I suggest we start the investigation from the 11 Western Han Mausoleums.

444
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,970
11 Western Han Mausoleums?

445
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,650
Do you know how big they are?

446
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,400
I only have one month.

447
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,270
Experts,

448
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,880
the museum is closing. The tour is over.

449
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,200
Go back to your studies.

450
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Captain Qi, Captain Qi, wait a moment.

451
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,960
Can I share my opinion?

452
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,950
I've made a visual assessment.

453
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,020
Based on the appearances,

454
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,540
the materials,

455
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
and the manufacturing technique of these pottery figurines,

456
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,920
they should be from the mid-Western Han period.

457
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,450
As for why they're black...

458
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,540
I haven't found an answer yet.

459
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,400
You all have X-ray vision in those eye sockets of yours?

460
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,810
Visual assessment?

461
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,380
Visual assessment can indeed have errors,

462
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,770
but with current technology,

463
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,750
thermoluminescence testing

464
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,280
can minimize these errors.

465
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,840
Move along, move along.

466
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
Stop looking, stop looking.

467
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,470
Move along, move along.

468
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,600
Stop looking, stop looking, stop looking.

469
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,330
What's going on? Why are they arresting people everywhere lately?

470
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,030
Well.

471
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,690
This man really doesn't look like a good person.

472
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,540
What's going on?

473
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:53,580
Who knows?

474
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,610
Why are they suddenly targeting the South Market?

475
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,140
They've caught quite a few people these days.

476
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,880
What kind of people did they catch?

477
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,340
They're all tomb raiders.

478
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,990
How do they end up in the South Market to catch these tomb raiders?

479
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,920
Who knows?

480
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,990
It looks like a big deal.

481
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,740
The waters in the South Market are murky.

482
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,710
Every issue starts with us.

[Busy Shop for Sale]

484
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,670
[Xisong Pavilion]

485
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,470
Mr. Wu.

486
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,230
Mr. Wu.

487
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,510
Mu.

488
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,160
What brings you here?

489
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,120
There's nothing here

490
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,030
for you

491
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,430
to conduct an appraisal.

492
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,740
Why are you planning to sell the shop?

493
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,360
Can't do it anymore.

494
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,990
Are you afraid the police will investigate wrongly

495
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,190
and come to your door?

496
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,460
Don't joke around.

497
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,230
I'm running a legitimate business.

498
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,600
If I'm upright, I don't fear shadows.

499
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,570
You've almost run your business in Shang County.

500
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,750
Let's talk business.

501
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,190
How much are you planning to sell it for?

502
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,760
350 thousand.

503
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,360
Can it be lower?

504
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,820
Well...

505
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,310
You want to buy it?

506
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,310
I can't afford it.

507
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm asking on behalf of a relative.

508
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,440
No wonder.

509
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,030
We're neighbors.

510
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,470
And you introduced this.

511
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,330
How about this?

512
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
I'll lower the price by 10 thousand.

513
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,640
Thank you, thank you.

514
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,960
Mr. Wu,

515
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,640
everyone calls you the source.

516
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,840
Do you know why the police are targeting the South Market?

517
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,960
If business really can't be done,

518
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,820
I guess my relative won't dare to take over the shop.

519
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,960
I heard

520
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,880
it's about the pit.

521
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,200
The police are looking for someone called, called...

522
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,990
Someone called King Hua.

523
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,190
He's from Guyue, not much related to us.

524
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,600
It'll be clear once the case is solved.

525
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,010
Alright, that's it.

526
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,980
I'll go back tonight and tell my relative.

527
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,600
Alright, alright, alright.

528
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,990
I'm leaving.

529
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,880
Alright, alright.

530
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,480
Take care.

531
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,440

533
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,390
Newly unearthed?

534
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,940
This is a bronze square wine vessel with beast face patterns.

535
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,440
These two tripods also have beast face patterns.

536
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,360
This is a jade handle with phoenix bird patterns made of green jade.

537
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,090
These are all from the early Western Zhou period.

538
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,250
Where did Hu dig the pit?

539
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,950
You're not going into the pit.

540
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,310
Why worry about it?

541
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,590
Show us how much these are worth.

542
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,010
Give us an estimate.

543
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,990
This amount.

544
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,830
100 thousand?

545
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Add another zero.

546
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,600
Sheng,

547
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,330
who will you sell these artifacts to?

548
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,500
Is it still King Hua?

549
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,550
Why are you suddenly interested in selling the artifacts?

550
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,600
Do you have any ideas?

551
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,650
No ideas.

552
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,320
Haven't you heard?

553
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,180
Many people have been arrested in the South Market.

554
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,590
When did that happen?

555
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,110
You haven't caught wind of it at all?

556
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,270
Should I have?

557
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,550
I'm busy with my company affairs all day.

558
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,010
I don't have time to worry about such things.

559
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,210
What's it all about anyway?

560
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,200
I heard the police are looking for King Hua.

561
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,610
Hu, do you know about this?

562
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,850
I-I-I only deal with underground matters.

563
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,530
I don't know about what's happening above ground.

564
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,390
Whatever it is,

565
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,610
I think you'd better lie low for a while.

566
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,230
Wait until this bad wind blows over before selling them.

567
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,720
As long as we don't leak anything ourselves,

568
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,480
no ill wind can touch us.

569
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,890
Don't you agree?

570
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,120
Right.

571
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,280
That's right.

572
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,840
Alright, that's it then.

573
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
I'll be going now.

574
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,550
Hu,

575
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,710
you've been busy all night too.

576
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,170
Go home and get some sleep.

577
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah.

578
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,490
I'll head back then, Sheng.

579
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,000
What?

580
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,600
What if this backstabber

581
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,090
is really your brother-in-law?

582
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,350
Are you really going to chop off his hand?

583
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,780
Go get me a bowl of oil-splashed noodles.

584
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,230
Hurry up.

585
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,850
I don't believe it.

586
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:18,950
Six Dots.

587
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,800
-It's a win!
-It's a win!

588
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,380
Wow, a winning tile!

589
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,560
And it's a Multi-player Ron.

590
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,240
Come on, come on.

591
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,030
Pay up quickly, pay up quickly, come on.

592
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,090
I'll owe it for now.

593
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,790
We'll settle it in the next round.

594
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,120
Why do you do this again?

595
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,010
You already owe quite a bit.

596
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,600
The rule we set is to settle after each round.

597
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,680
If you do this again,

598
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,040
it won't be fun anymore.

599
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,860
Just one more round on credit.

600
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,200
Just one more round.

601
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,580
Xiaowu,

602
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
isn't that your wife and kid?

603
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,410
Look where she's going with the luggage and the kid.

604
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,600
Honey.

605
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,440
Honey.

606
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,030
Honey.

607
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Where are you going?

608
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,270
It's none of your business.

609
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,270
You're my wife.

610
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,680
How can it not be my business?

611
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,140
Where's the 5,000 yuan I put in the wardrobe?

612
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,270
Yan Xiaowu,

613
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,990
how much do you think our family has?

614
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,750
You gamble like this every day.

615
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,840
Have you ever thought about me and the kid?

616
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,680
I just wanted to make more money.

617
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,790
I can't live like this anymore.

618
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,550
I want a divorce.

619
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:21,990
Honey.

620
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,210
Honey. Honey.

621
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,990
I-I'm begging you.

622
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,990
I'm begging you.

623
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,380
For the sake of our kid.

624
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,550
Captain Qi.

625
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,440
What?

626
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,500
You've got panda eyes from staying up.

627
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,820
What's going on?

628
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,240
It's nothing.

629
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:45,930
Oh, right.

630
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,360
They've basically confessed everything here.

631
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,220
I asked around.

632
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,450
These thieves are quite clever.

633
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,550
They only confessed to recent crimes.

634
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,320
They didn't mention anything from the past.

635
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
That's why they're called thieves.

636
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,420
Is there anything useful?

637
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,310
No.

638
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,330
They said they didn't know anything about the black pottery figurines.

639
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,330
They don't even recognize King Hua.

640
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,060
Quickly interrogate those people caught in the black market.

641
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,640
Right.

642
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,770
The tomb raider who hit me with a shovel,

643
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,860
bring him over.

644
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,700
It's not an informal interrogation.

645
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,360
Just a chat.

646
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,130
Alright.

647
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,680
It's mealtime.

648
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,550
But I'm really too busy.

649
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600
I can only work overtime.

650
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,610
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

651
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,470
You dug quite a few pits, didn't you?

652
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,120
I didn't.

653
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,390
Eat.

654
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,580
Captain Qi.

655
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,680
I-I didn't mean to.

656
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,920
W-What do you plan to do with me?

657
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,310
Why would I do with you?

658
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,960
This is my workplace.

659
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,840
I'm just doing business according to official principles.

660
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,900
That little grudge

661
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,200
isn't worth my time.

662
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,820
Eat up.

663
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,790
Just don't try to fool me.

664
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,310
Have you heard?

665
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,130
There's a batch of black pottery figurines

666
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,610
intercepted during an overseas auction.

667
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,680
What black pottery figurines?

668
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,740
You don't know yet?

669
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,030
How much is this candlestick?

670
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,030
Zhang, do you think the arrests in the South Market...

671
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,960
-Should be related to this matter?
-Five hundred.

672
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,680
I don't know.

673
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,610
This candlestick is part of a pair.

674
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,160
The other one is in my car.

675
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,990
Do you want to see it?

676
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,990
Let's take a look.

677
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:30,930
Okay.

678
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,520
Let's go.

679
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,450
Alright.

680
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,840
Who told you to come looking for me?

681
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,170
You even dare to come to the South Market?

682
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,510
There are too many people and prying eyes here.

683
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,880
If Liu's people see us,

684
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
neither of us will make it out alive.

685
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,560
Brother,

686
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,710
it can't be that bad, can it?

687
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,710
I'm a new face.

688
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
No one knows me.

689
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,840
Had life not been so unbearable,

690
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,240
I wouldn't have come at all.

691
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,280
What happened?

692
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,210
My wife wants to divorce me.

693
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,300
You've gambled again?

694
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,550
Brother, let's do it one more time.

695
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,230
You couldn't have picked a worse time.

696
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,740
Things are already in chaos.

697
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,000
What's troubling you?

698
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,970
That batch of black pottery figurines is in trouble.

699
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,450
What?

700
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,360
What happened?

701
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,000
I sold that batch of goods

702
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,600
to someone called King Hua.

703
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,960
The police are looking for him.

704
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,000
Have they found him?

705
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,860
If they had found him,

706
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,590
would we still be talking here?

707
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,770
Right.

708
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,550
Look what I asked.

709
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,330
Liu

710
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,190
has started to suspect me.

711
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,070
He just dug up some artifacts in a pit.

712
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,330
I guess he'll still sell them to King Hua.

713
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,880
Once they meet,

714
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,770
if Liu applies some pressure,

715
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,770
King Hua will definitely rat me out.

716
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,470
Wait,

717
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,120
so what if he rats you out?

718
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,940
You're his brother-in-law.

719
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,060
He wouldn't dare to do anything to you, would he?

720
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
Brother-in-law?

721
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,030
His uncle once took away a pit from him.

722
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,710
He had someone chop off his uncle's arm.

723
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,470
What?

724
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,800
So brutal.

725
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,150
Brother,

726
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,280
why don't we put some pressure on King Hua first?

727
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,790
Easier said than done.

728
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,250
This guy is very slippery.

729
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,710
He uses each phone number only once.

730
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,550
It's impossible to contact him.

731
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,100
Then we're at a dead end.

732
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,100
Just 10 thousand yuan,

733
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,560
what good did it really do?

734
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:37,690
Xiaowu,

735
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,410
we've been dealt a bad hand our whole lives.

736
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,900
Isn't the grave robbing just our way of not accepting our fate?

737
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,560
Without seeing the last card,

738
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,590
we can't determine the winner.

739
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,010
Let's split up.

740
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,990
You keep an eye on Liu.

741
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,170
I'll find a way to locate King Hua.

742
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,170
We absolutely can't let them meet.

743
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,040
No problem.

744
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,340
King Hua you mentioned,

745
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,210
his name must have been inspired by Guyue.

746
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,480
How do you know?

747
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,030
Those from Guyue are usually receivers.

748
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,909
Those receivers are all very sneaky.

749
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,580
What's that idiom called?

750
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,510
Something about rabbits and burrows?

751
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,260
A crafty rabbit has three burrows.

752
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,989
Yes, yes, yes. A crafty rabbit has three burrows.

753
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,909
You cultured person is really something else.

754
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:46,960
I just heard it

755
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,760
from a tomb-raiding organizer.

756
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,130
According to him, those people don't stay in hotels when they come to Qinchuan.

757
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,659
They specifically choose small inns in urban villages.

758
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,860
And they frequently change locations.

759
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,230
That's right.

760
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,100
Those places are a mixed bag.

761
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,490
Hiding in plain sight.

762
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,640
Good for hiding.

763
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:13,830
You're indeed

764
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,980
smart.

765
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,710
It's not only good for hiding

766
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,180
but also convenient for escaping if anything happens.

767
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,380
If you have his photo,

768
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,350
check a few urban village inns,

769
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,870
and you might just find that person.

770
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,080
Tomb Raider,

771
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,870
you're the smart one.

772
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,750
So young

773
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,380
and so clever.

774
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,690
You must stay on the right path in the future.

775
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,560
If you want to eat roujiamo again, it's on me.

776
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,710
Can you tell me

777
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,350
the name of that organizer

778
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,710
you mentioned earlier?

779
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,840
Captain Qi.

780
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,200
Captain Qi.

781
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,180
Du!

782
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,140
Du!

783
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,920
What's up, Captain Qi?

784
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,060
Find this tomb-raiding organizer

785
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,550
to draw a portrait of King Hua,

786
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,580
then confirm it with the Suizhou police.

787
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,640
Alright, quickly.

788
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,770
[Jililai Hotel]

789
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,310
This person looks familiar.

790
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,620
He stayed here before.

791
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,420
He seemed to have a Guyue accent.

792
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,670
Do you have his registration information?

793
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,470
Yes, yes, yes.

794
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,180
Mu,

795
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,240
that Liu guy has left his home.

796
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,790
He's carrying a bag.

797
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,390
That bag looks big and heavy.

798
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,730
It must contain those artifacts.

799
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,860
Quickly follow him.

800
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,090
I'm on my way.

801
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,100
Keep me updated on his location.

802
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,470
He's heading towards the East Gate now.

803
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,980
Got it.

804
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,890
Brother, he just passed Chrysanthemum Lane, and he's heading towards Xiama Bridge.

805
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,710
Brother,

806
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,380
he's now heading towards Luyuan Street.

807
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,030
Don't follow too closely.

808
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,690
Make sure you're not spotted.

809
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,000
Xiaowu.

810
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,920
I followed him to a place in the alley of Xiama Bridge called...

811
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,430
Liang's Hotel.

812
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,190
So, they're made of bronze?

813
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,080
What are you doing?

814
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,110
What do you mean?

815
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,470
Do you know the police are watching you?

816
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,140
I don't.

817
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,060
You're such an idiot.

818
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,520
I don't care who you're doing business with,

819
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,730
but what I hate most

820
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,410
is those who betray their own.

821
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,350
Who gave you those black pottery figurines?

822
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,410
Just give me a name.

823
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,180
Mr. Liu,

824
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,350
you know the rules of the trade.

825
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,650
I can't betray others.

826
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,360
Brother.

827
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,180
Xiaowu.

828
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,990
I'm afraid I won't make it in time.

829
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,430
What?

830
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:40,980
Well,

831
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,710
let me give you a tip.

832
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,100
Go and find out

833
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,270
who set the rules in Qinchuan.

834
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,830
I am the rules.

835
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:51,990
I'm not asking for your opinion.

836
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,990
I'm telling you.

837
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,470
If you speak up today,

838
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,710
you can take these goods.

839
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,430
If you don't,

840
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,460
see if you can leave Qinchuan.
