[The Lost National Treasure]

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,789
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,430
Give me back my child.

4
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,200
Wen Wen,

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,800
this child is mine too.

6
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,930
What did you promise me back then?

7
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,870
You said that no matter whose child he is,

8
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,729
once he's born,

9
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,590
he belongs to Yuanguang and me.

10
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,640
If I give you the child,

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
how will you raise him?

12
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,150
How will you provide for him?

13
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,610
Wen Wen,

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,560
this isn't a path to life;

15
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,650
it's a path to ruin.

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,280
If Guang knew about this in the afterlife,

17
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
how could he ever rest in peace?

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,080
How dare you bring up Yuanguang?

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,440
If it hadn't been for you,

20
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,669
would he have ended up like this?

21
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,470
You ruined him.

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,760
You destroyed our whole family.

23
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,460
I'll bear your hatred and resentment,
whatever it may be.

24
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,120
But I won't give you the child.

25
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,150
With me,

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,120
he can go to the best schools,

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,850
get the best education,

28
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,990
eat well and dress well.

29
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,950
Can you give him that?

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,030
The mistakes were ours.

31
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,910
He didn't do anything wrong.

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,370
Why should we take away his chance
to grow up healthy and happy?

33
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,000
Wen Wen,

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm doing this for your own good too.

35
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,190
The past is behind us.

36
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,970
Why not move on and look ahead?

37
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,340
You're still young.

38
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,980
How will you ever remarry
if you're raising a child on your own?

39
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,640
Whether I remarry or not
is none of your concern.

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
That child is my flesh and blood.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,329
I don't care whose blood

42
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,010
runs in his veins anymore.

43
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,310
Even if we have to beg on the streets,

44
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,280
at least it's earned
with a clear conscience.

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,310
Unlike you,

46
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,030
every cent you earn

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
is stained with Yuanguang's blood.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,260
If you're set on taking the child,

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,710
then sue me.

50
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,470
You were Guang's wife,

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,480
and I've always wanted the best for you.

52
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,120
But when it comes to the child,

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,710
I won't give in.

54
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,630
It's alright now.

55
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,990
Let's cut the cake for the child.

56
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,050
I don't know you anymore.

57
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,840
Today,

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,680
we're

59
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,520
joined by colleagues
from both the Public Security Bureau

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,320
and the Cultural Relics Bureau.

61
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,490
A special welcome to Chief Cheng Zhi,

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
who just returned from Beijing

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,980
and came straight here from the airport.

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,090
Chief Cheng,

65
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,870
would you like to say a few words?

66
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,530
Chief Zhao,

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,980
I'm in no rush to speak.

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,750
Let's first hear what our colleagues

69
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,680
from both departments have to say.

70
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,960
Since no one is speaking up,
I'll go first.

71
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,020
The Uncle's gang

72
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,830
has been operating in Qinzhou Province

73
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
for over a decade.

74
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,650
Their criminal operations

75
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,750
have persisted over a long period

76
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,680
and extended across a wide region.

77
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,440
The gang members
come from diverse backgrounds,

78
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,870
ranging from ordinary citizens

79
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,390
to

80
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,000
prominent figures.

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
Honestly, I'm not one

82
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,240
to complain,

83
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,190
but today, I have to speak up.

84
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,100
We're really struggling.

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,560
We're facing three major challenges
in our investigations:

86
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
First, the number of cases
is overwhelming—

87
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,380
it's tough.

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,170
Second, there are too many
cultural relics to recover—

89
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,620
that's tough too.

90
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,950
Third, there are many people to arrest—

91
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,880
again, not easy.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,750
When these difficulties pile up,
it gets harder to handle.

93
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,190
These three—

94
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,120
Hold on a moment.

95
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,430
I know what you're trying to say,

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,650
so let me
put your mind at ease first, alright?

97
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,330
The March 17th case

98
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,040
has drawn significant attention
from leadership

99
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,570
at both
the provincial and municipal levels.

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,510
After much deliberation,
the provincial authorities have decided

101
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,920
to elevate the March 17th case

102
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,630
to a provincially supervised case.

103
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,830
The special investigation team
will be upgraded,

104
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,120
with the city bureau
assigning top officers

105
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,950
to reinforce the investigation team.

106
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,000
This also places higher demands

107
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,570
on our investigators.

108
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,160
We must further refine
the division of responsibilities,

109
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,920
assigning specific individuals
to handle tasks

110
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,310
such as arrests, interrogations,

111
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,920
field investigations,
and case documentation

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,190
to improve overall efficiency.

113
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,250
If that's the case,

114
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,090
I won't say anything further.

115
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,920
While we're not afraid of challenges,

116
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
we certainly welcome

117
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,870
any support

118
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,650
the leadership can offer.

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,160
Enough.

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,070
I know what you're getting at.

121
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,540
You're asking for

122
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,550
logistical support, right?

123
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,870
Rest assured,

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,800
the higher-ups have specifically
reviewed the matter

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
and issued clear instructions:

126
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,720
Funding for the investigation
will be fully guaranteed.

127
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,600
Necessary vehicles will be provided.

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,480
No matter which jurisdiction
the investigation leads to,

129
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,270
local police departments

130
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,000
are required to offer
full and unwavering support.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you, sir.

132
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,120
There's a buzzword
making the rounds these days—"so dope."

133
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,510
Since our colleagues
at the Public Security Bureau

134
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,480
have taken such a strong lead,

135
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,750
we at the Cultural Relics Bureau
can't drop the ball either.

136
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,480
During my recent trip to Beijing,

137
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,240
I met with leaders and experts from the
National Cultural Heritage Administration

138
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,160
and reported the details
of the March 17th case

139
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,800
to them.

140
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,190
The leaders specifically asked me

141
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,190
to convey their appreciation
for all your hard work.

142
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,600
They also hope you'll conduct a thorough
investigation into the criminal gang

143
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,480
and ensure it is completely dismantled.

144
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,560
Efforts to recover the involved
cultural relics must be intensified,

145
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,000
and we must prevent
any further loss of cultural heritage.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Of course,

147
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,120
our cultural relics department

148
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,850
will provide full cooperation

149
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,190
and coordinate closely
throughout the process.

150
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,790
Comrades,

151
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,190
since the 18th National Congress,

152
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,830
the Central Committee has made

153
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,830
the protection of cultural relics
a top priority like never before.

154
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,270
issuing a series
of significant directives.

155
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,240
The Ministry of Public Security and the
National Cultural Heritage Administration

156
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,510
have jointly established

157
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,000
a dedicated coordination group to combat
crimes related to cultural relics.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
This group is tasked with deploying
efforts to crack down on such crimes,

159
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,800
overseeing major cases,

160
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,090
coordinating
cross-regional investigations,

161
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,159
and supporting local authorities
in safeguarding cultural heritage.

162
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,070
At the same time,

163
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,990
we're gradually improving
the system and mechanism

164
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,120
for recovering
cultural relics lost overseas,

165
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
ensuring their prompt return home.

166
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,800
On this basis,

167
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,930
commissioned by
Ministry of Public Security

168
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,120
and
National Cultural Heritage Administration,

169
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
the Qinzhou Provincial
Public Security Department

170
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,560
has set up a national center
to combat cultural relic crimes.

171
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,070
The center has successfully completed
its trial operation

172
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,930
and will officially launch soon.

173
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,480
It will be responsible for

174
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,190
the collection, review,
analysis, and evaluation

175
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,310
of nationwide data
related to cultural relics crimes,

176
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,950
providing comprehensive
information support

177
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,010
to aid your efforts in solving cases.

178
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,400
Comrades,

179
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,750
our work in protecting cultural relics

180
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,669
has entered a new era.

181
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,909
From the Central Committee
to the general public,

182
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,970
everyone is paying close attention.

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,750
With that comes
even greater responsibility

184
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,720
on our shoulders.

187

We've uncovered a new lead.

206
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,790
Recently,

207
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,030
Chief Wu

208
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,420
traveled to Xiao Guoqiang's hometown,
Huang Plain,

209
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,790
and found out that, twenty years ago,
he worked as a driver for someone.

210
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,450
That person

211
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,930
was none other than

212
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,150
Zhao Youlin.

213
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,750
We looked into his background before.

214
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,150
Didn't seem like he had any ties
to Huang Plain, right?

215
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,550
He did.

216
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,360
There was a connection.

217
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,230
Back then, Zhao Youlin had taken on
a construction project in Huang Plain.

218
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,270
During our investigation,
we heard some rumors

219
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,120
that

220
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,720
he uncovered an antique at the site.

221
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,150
Then he sold it off

222
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,280
and suddenly got rich overnight.

223
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,160
The story hasn't been confirmed,

224
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,550
but the fact

225
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,610
that Zhao Youlin deliberately
hid this part of his past

226
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,150
makes him very suspicious.

227
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,080
So,

228
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
we'll keep tracking Xiao Guoqiang.

229
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,180
As for Zhao Youlin,

230
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,960
look into him thoroughly.

231
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,560
Be careful. Watch your step.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,530
This way.

233
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,100

-Mrs. Zan.
-Thank you.

This is the section of

238
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,920
the rammed earth wall we've uncovered.

239
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,140

240
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,480
Look here.

241
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,790
Yes.

242
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

243
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,300
Come on.

245
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,420
Mrs. Zan.

246
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,380
It is indeed a rammed earth wall.

247
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,690
Incredible.

248
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,150
Just incredible.

249
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,030
I heard

250
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
it's been quite the challenge

251
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,440
for your team
to find this rammed earth wall.

252
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,700
Don't even mention it.

253
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Most archaeologists

254
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,390
look for signs of disturbed soil
in raw earth,

255
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,390
but we're out here

256
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,860
trying to find disturbed soil
inside disturbed soil,

257
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,210
and rammed earth hidden in
more rammed earth.

258
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,330
The terrain here

259
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,550
was originally uneven.

260
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,650
So, in the past,
when building the mausoleum complex,

261
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,270
they first filled low areas,
then built rammed earth walls on top.

262
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,470
As a result, we're now

263
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,670
searching for rammed earth
within rammed earth.

264
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,120
We've documented

265
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,720
the number of boreholes
in our archaeological log,

266
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,520
but honestly,

267
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,360
if you asked us now,

268
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,340
we couldn't even tell.

269
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,550
There are just too many.

270
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,270
Sometimes,

271
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,790
we'd find two or three meters
of this rammed earth wall,

272
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,870
and then it would suddenly cut off.

273
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,670
It's fragmented,

274
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,200
with many twists and turns.

275
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,240
We've found traces of this kind of wall
surrounding the Yin Village grand tomb

276
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,150
in all four directions:
east, south, west, and north.

277
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,440
Based on our preliminary estimates,

278
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,900
the remaining foundation

279
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,080
stretches about

280
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,040
1,200 meters from east to west,

281
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,650
and 860 meters from north to south,

282
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,670
forming a perfect enclosure
around both the Yin Village grand tomb

283
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,550
and the Dou Mausoleum.

284
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,120
Do you all remember

285
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,430
the paved stone remains
we discovered earlier?

286
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,000
During this excavation,

287
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
we've uncovered several more sections.

288
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,030
At present, we estimate the structure
to be about 423 meters in length

289
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,360
and 1.5 meters in width.

290
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,360
We believe

291
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,510
this may mark

292
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,750
the boundary of the mausoleum complex
of the Yin Village grand tomb,

293
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,750
so we've tentatively named it
the "stone enclosure."

294
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,440
If that's the case,

295
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,050
then the Yin Village grand tomb

296
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,150
appears to have had
a stone-built mausoleum boundary.

297
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,480
Yes.

298
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,170
The Dou Mausoleum

299
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,730
also has its own
rammed earth enclosure wall.

300
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,550
So both of them are located
within a single large mausoleum complex,

301
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,080
right?

302
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,550
Yes.

303
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,870
This setup

304
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,160
clearly follows the burial tradition

305
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,670
where the emperor and empress share
a mausoleum but rest in separate tombs.

306
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,200
Exactly.

307
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,360
The configuration
of the Yin Village grand tomb

308
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,960
and the Dou Mausoleum

309
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,240
is very similar to
the Yang Mausoleum of Han.

310
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,380
Therefore, we can basically confirm that

311
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,720
we have found key evidence identifying

312
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,200
the Yin Village grand tomb

313
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,730
as the Zi Mausoleum
of Emperor Taizong of Han.

314
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,550
That's great.

315
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,040
Though we don't have

316
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,580
a complete set of evidence

317
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,640
or a full report,

318
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,400
this one piece alone

319
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,600
is enough.

The landfill site

321
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,360
has been putting up fierce resistance.

322
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,600
They've pushed us too far.

323

His generous contribution

370
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,720
has significantly enriched

371
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,630
the Mingde Museum's holdings.

372
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,070
In the future,

373
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,320
these pieces will be proudly showcased

374
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,109
in the Mingde Museum's exhibitions,

375
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,400
adding brilliance and depth
to the collection.

376
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,750
I

377
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,319
have a deep connection
with the Mingde Museum.

378
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,720
My father was born here.

379
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,589
Today,

380
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,270
by donating my treasured collection,

381
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,830
I hope these pieces
can finally return home.

382
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,110
Mr. Mu has always
held a deep affection for our museum.

383
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,350
In recognition of

384
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,400
his generous contributions,

385
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,670
the board has officially

386
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,000
appointed Mr. Mu Jianhui
as a permanent board member.

387
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,610
Director Mu,

388
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,190
from now on, this will be your office.

389
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,590
This is the director's office.

390
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,040
I don't think it's quite appropriate

391
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,830
for me to be working here.

392
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,030
Why not?

393
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,310
Before long,

394
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,890
we'll all be calling you Director Mu.

395
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,550
It's still too early for that.

396
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,080
Don't be so modest.
It's just a matter of time.

397
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Take a look around.

398
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,480
If anything's missing,

399
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,590
let me know and I'll have someone fix it.

400
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,020
Alright, I'll take a look.

401
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,260
Okay, take your time.

402
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,550
-Thank you.
-I'm leaving.

403
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,680
No need to see me out.

404
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,030
Dad.

405
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,400
Is this where you lived
when you were young?

406
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,590
Yes.

407
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,830
Can we go back there?

408
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,240
We can't.

409
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,610
I am Mr. Mu Jianhui's attorney.

410
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,820
He has personally entrusted me

411
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,510
to speak with you
regarding the matter of child custody.

412
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,110
There's nothing to discuss.

413
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,580
I've already decided to file a lawsuit.

414
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,130
Have you found a lawyer?

415
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,370
Ms. Wen,

416
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,880
the best lawyer in Qinchuan
is sitting right in front of you.

417
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,960
You don't need to scare me.

418
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,480
I'm not afraid of anything.

419
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,010
I'm not trying to scare you.

420
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,240
I just want to give you a few reminders

421
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,240
based on my professional expertise.

422
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,300
When Liang was still breastfeeding,

423
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,990
you abandoned him and ran off.

424
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,090
At the very least,
that's called being irresponsible;

425
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,770
at worst,

426
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,410
it's abandonment.

427
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,360
One is a mother
who abandoned her child and ran off.

428
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,430
The other is a father
with financial stability

429
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,030
who has devoted everything to the child.

430
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,520
Who do you think
the court will grant custody to?

431
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,680
Mr. Mu has mentioned

432
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,730
that he and your husband
were good friends.

433
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
He doesn't want to face you in court.

[Letter of Custody Waiver]

435
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,850
If you're willing
to voluntarily give up custody

436
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,610
and no longer interfere in
their family's life,

437
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,840
he's prepared to offer you
10 million yuan

438
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,410
as a one-time payment.

439
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,250
Even if I know I'll lose,

440
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,920
I'm still suing.

441
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,970
Then we'll see you in court.

442
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,050
That won't be necessary.

443
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,030
Shulan.

444
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,960

call her Mom.

446
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,070
Mom.

447
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,290
He's usually very easy to take care of.

448
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,880
This bag has everything he normally uses.

449
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,590
Liang.

450
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,960
Attorney Chen.

451
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,400
Mr. Mu.

452
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,790
How did the negotiation go?

453
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,650
Your wife brought the child here.

454
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,720
What do you mean?

455
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,970
She gave the child back to Wen Wen.

456
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:41,800
Jianhui.

457
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,420
Shulan,

458
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,680
why did you give the child to her?

459
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,940
No particular reason.

460
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,070
It was just time to do the right thing.

461
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,400
Are you out of your mind?

462
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,360
That's my child.

463
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,300
It's our child.

464
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
Where are you?

465
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,410
I'm at the watch factory dormitory

466

where we used to live.

467
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,230
What are you doing there?

468
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,560
Jianhui,

469
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,110
turn back.

470
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,310
It's not too late.

471
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,710
I've contacted the police

472
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,270
and turned myself in.

473
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,100

Shulan.

475
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,000
What kind of life I've been living
all these years?

476
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,600
Treated like a dog,
looked down on by everyone,

477

risking my life,

478
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,880
pushing through one hurdle after another—

479
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,540
and now, I've finally made it.

Come take a look at the Mingde Museum.

482
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,600
This is my family's legacy.

483
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,810
And soon, it'll be back in my hands.

484
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,380
Please don't do anything reckless.

acting foolish all these years.

it has been confirmed

492
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,370
to be a Han Dynasty bronze chime bell.

493
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,960
I'll arrange for Liang to identify

494
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,430
Mu Jianhui as soon as possible.

00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,630
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

Captain Qi, there's no one in the office.

497

at the base to keep watch.

[There will be no more mistakes.]

553
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,070
The archaeological work
on the Zi Mausoleum

554
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,030
began in the 1960s.

555
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,810
Back then,

556
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
a small burial pit

557
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,680
from Empress Dowager Bo's South Mausoleum,
located to the east of Yin Village,

558
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,070
was excavated in a rescue operation.

559
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,110
In the 1980s, two veteran archaeologists

560
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,280
conducted systematic surveys

561
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,270
and measurements

562
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,070
of the 11 Western Han Mausoleums,

563
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,800
laying a solid foundation
for the future archaeological research

564
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,330
of the Western Han Imperial Mausoleums.

565
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,000
After 2003,

566
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,350
researchers from

567
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,160
the Qinchuan
Archaeological Research Institute

568
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,160
discovered the grand tomb in Yin Village,

569
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,040
along with surrounding outer burial pits,

570
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,030
stone enclosures, and other features
during their exploration.

571
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,890
These findings

572
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,310
brought the relationship between
the Dou Mausoleum, Phoenix Mountain,

573
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,970
and the Yin Village grand tomb

574
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,880
into the academic spotlight,

575
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,770
sparking discussions

576
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,640
about the exact location

577
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,290
of Emperor Taizong of Han's Zi Mausoleum.

578
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,280
May I ask,

579
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,720
will the main tomb of Zi Mausoleum
continue to be excavated?

580
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,110
Under our country's
cultural heritage policy,

581
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,440
the excavation of ancient imperial tombs

582
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,720
is generally not permitted.

583
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,310
Archaeology

584
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,030
is not treasure hunting.

585
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,160
We can't simply excavate
every tomb we discover.

586
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,720
What we choose to excavate now

587
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,790
is based on current research needs.

588
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,700
This is a legacy
we should leave to future generations.

589
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,360
When the technology is ready,

590
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,550
and when their research demands it,

591
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,960
then the time will be right
for excavation.

592
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,890
Okay, thank you.

593
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,750
If I may add to
what the director just said,

594
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,450
our top priority right now

595
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,200
is to protect
these mausoleums and cultural relics.

596
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,160
Our archaeological team
hopes that in the future,

597
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,480
we'll be able to build a site museum

598
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,830
on the Bailu Plain

599
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,550
-to showcase...
-Director Yan.

600
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,170
And preserve the discoveries
from the Zi Mausoleum...

601
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:14,550
Director Yan.

602
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,920
And Empress Dowager Bo's South Mausoleum.

603
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,110
It will also help more people

604
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,920
gain a deeper understanding
of our Chinese culture.

605
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,850
Okay, thank you.

606
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,270
Then may I ask, have the stolen artifacts
from the Zi Mausoleum been recovered?

607
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,070
Wait a moment.

608
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,830
I'll take this question.

609
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,530
The stolen artifacts from the Zi Mausoleum
have been recovered one after another.

610
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,030
Bravo!

611
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,580
Bravo!

612
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,450
Mr. Fang,

613
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,170
are you familiar with this place?

614
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,180
The black pottery figurines
were unearthed here.

615
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,170
Let me correct you.

616
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,690
The black pottery figurines
were stolen from here.

617
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,550
You're right.

618
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,120
No one knows better than I do

619
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,840
how they were dug up

620
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,960
and sold overseas.

621
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,880
If it weren't for me,

622
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,310
how would foreigners

623
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,960
come to understand
the rich history of Chinese culture?

624
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,310
Taking our ancestors' treasures

625
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,910
and selling them overseas,

626
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,900
then letting foreigners show them off,

627
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,560
yet acting like
that's something to be proud of?

628
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,880
Don't be so harsh.

629
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,030
Without me, what would you be studying?

630
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,560
Even the probing shovel you use

631
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,830
was invented by tomb raiders.

632
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,000
That's right.

633
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,580
It was invented by tomb raiders.

634
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,920
But it's just a tool.

635
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,880
A knife is a harmless kitchen utensil
when used for cooking,

636
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,140
but it becomes a weapon when used to harm.

637
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,080
We use probing shovels
to uncover and verify history,

638
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,200
while you use them

639
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,470
to turn our intact Chinese culture

640
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,340
into something broken and unrecognizable.

641
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
If I hadn't brought
the black pottery figurines to light,

642
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,830
you would never have known

643
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,160
where Zi Mausoleum was.

644
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,350
I am the herald.

645
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,960

I'm laughing at
your ignorance and shamelessness.

649
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,640
Years ago, we already began

650
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,440
excavating the
Western Han Imperial Mausoleums.

651
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,960
Even if the grand tomb in Yin Village
hadn't been found,

652
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,470
our plan was to

653
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,280
explore Phoenix Mountain anyway,

654
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,300
and we would have still confirmed
there were no remains beneath it.

655
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,100
Yin Village

656
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,719
and the Zi Mausoleum

657
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,610
would have come to light regardless.

658
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,570

countless man-hours and resources in,

661
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,739
yet still haven't completed
a single tomb after all these years.

662
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,030
With just one shovel,

663
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,820
I cracked the whole thing.

664
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,380
Because you're in it for the money.

665
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,190
We're not.

666

671

of Chinese civilization.

673

Is Ms. Luo doing well?

735
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,480
Are you...

736
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,080
Are you willing to part with her?

737
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,670
On her end,

738
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,840
everything must be going smoothly.

739
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,630
I trust her.

740
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,030
Each archaeologist

741
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,000
has their own responsibilities.

742
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,960
Back then, Ms. Luo gave up

743
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,360
the Lv Family Tomb for me.

744
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,220
That was a huge sacrifice.

745
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,760
Though she never said it aloud,

746
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,320
everyone understands.

747
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,400
A project is like our own child.

748
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,680
Sometimes, it's even more important
than our own lives.

749
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,110
Yes.

750
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,170
If you ask me
whether I'm willing to part with her,

751
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,800
of course I'm not.

752
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,370
But I can't be that selfish.

753
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,240
Right?

754
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,070
Mr. Bai!

755
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,570
Coming.

756
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,250
Here.

757
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,190
You... you go ahead with your work.

758
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,630
Alright.

759
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,360
Coming!

760
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,190
Archaeology

761
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,510
can make a nation's history

762
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,510
clearer and more transparent.

763
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,170
Archaeological discoveries

764
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,670
can fill in the gaps

765
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,130
missing from historical records and texts.

766
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,480
They piece together

767
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,960
every trace of history,

768
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,400
reconstructing the complete story
of Chinese civilization's development—

769
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,110
making it accessible to everyone,

770
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,770
and sharing it with the world.

771
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,800
Striking the ground
to mend the tapestry of history—

772
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,060
that's the true meaning of archaeology.

773
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,030
Every word we archaeologists say,

774
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,360
every judgment we make,

775
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,670
could determine

776
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,440
whether a piece of history

777
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
and civilization

778
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,510
is understood correctly or not.
