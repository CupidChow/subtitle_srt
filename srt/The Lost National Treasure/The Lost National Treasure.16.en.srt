[The Lost National Treasure]

2
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,900
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,930
Over the years,

4
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,560
we've dug quite a few pits

5
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,820
and made a lot of money.

6
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,870
It's enough for you
to spend for the rest of your lives.

7
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,390
You must be...

8
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,840
Must be trying to get rid of me.

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm not getting rid of you.

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,130
I'm begging you.

11
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,650
Zhao Youlin has pushed me to the edge.

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,210
If I can't get the alms bowl,

13
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,520
all these years of foundation,

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
including myself,

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,260
will be ruined.

16
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm the one who got involved
with Zhao Youlin.

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,870
It has nothing to do with you.

18
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,560
I can't let you take risks because of me.

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,290
I'm not afraid of taking risks.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,520
If we can't make it in Qinchuan,
we'll leave.

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,050
Shangyi,

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,710
Hedong,

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,070
Longshan,

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
anywhere is fine.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,470
We have skills.

26
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,910
We can still make a comeback.

27
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,730
Do you know why I

28
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,400
had to cling to Zhao Youlin?

29
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,450
It's certainly not for the money.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,750
Look at Shan and Big Head.

31
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,079
They were gone in the blink of an eye.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,530
The fact that we're still alive

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,040
isn't because we're so capable;

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,460
it's because we're lucky.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,120
But how much luck do we have left?

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,130
How long can it last?

37
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,280
Who knows?

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,800
The cultural relic protection department
isn't there just to look good.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,150
They might raid us all at once tomorrow.

40
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,310
Before the heavy rain falls,

41
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,830
I need to find an umbrella for our brothers.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,910
That umbrella is Zhao Youlin.

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
I don't understand as much as you do,

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,540
and I can't be of much help.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,680
But I do know

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,740
that I can't leave you here alone now.

47
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,590
A bronze ritual food vessel from the Western Zhou Dynasty.

48
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,310
A bronze mirror from the Han Dynasty.

49
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,640
A celadon vase with an incised floral rim.

50
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,550
What exquisite craftsmanship!

51
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,390
What precious cultural relics!

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,079
Professors,

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,690
may I ask a question?

54
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,190
These cultural relics

55
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,680
date from the Western Zhou

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,030
to the Tang Dynasty.

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,430
Why would they

58
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,750
appear in a tomb belonging
to the Lv family of the Northern Song?

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,360
This reflects the cultural connotation
of our relics,

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
and that's where their charm lies.

61
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,400
They not only reflect
the manufacturing techniques of that time,

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,030
but also reveal

63
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,190
the aesthetic tastes of
the scholar-official class.

64
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,840
The literati and scholars
of the Song Dynasty

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,800
all longed for the etiquette-based
society of ancient times.

66
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,520
So they had a special fondness

67
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,430
for antiques and
these ancient ritual vessels.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,630
After death,
they would follow ancient customs

69
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,710
and use their cherished possessions
as burial objects.

70
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,640
Director Zhang,

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,680
look at this covered bronze ding
with fish and tiger patterns.

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,560
It must have been excavated before.

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,890
It looks familiar to me.

74
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,120
This is clearly a decorative piece
for appreciation.

75
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,870
A small bronze ding was excavated
in Feng County five years ago.

76
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,390
Its shape and patterns
are identical to this one.

77
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,430
You mean

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,190
this one and the one excavated before

79
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,040
might be a pair?

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Yes, a pair of artifacts

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,950
that have been separated
for over 2,000 years.

82
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,080
And now, in our time,

83
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,870
they unexpectedly meet again,

84
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,190
both coming to light together.

85
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,360
This could be considered

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,830
a once-in-a-lifetime encounter
in the archaeological world.

87
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,920
Captain Qi, how many artifacts
have we confiscated in total?

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,720
One hundred and twenty-eight pieces.

89
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,800
There's still one bowl missing.

90
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,390
Here,

91
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,240
this is a sketch based on
the suspect's description.

92
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,430
Take a look, Director Zhang.

93
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,190
Captain Qi, this isn't just a bowl.

94
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,190
It's an alms bowl.

95
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,620
Look,

96
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,070
it even has silver clasps.

97
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,930
Right?

98
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,980
Look at this.

99
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,430
Just thinking about these tomb raiders

100
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,600
makes my blood boil.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,680
Look at how they've ruined
these precious artifacts.

102
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,390
Exactly.

103
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,270
We're also worried that this incident

104
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,750
might attract more tomb raiders.

105
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,270
The Lv family of Mi County
has had a far-reaching influence,

106
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,070
comparable to

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,210
the Three Sus from Meishan.

108
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,240
We can't let it be destroyed further.

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
I suggest

110
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,270
we carry out an emergency excavation.

111
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,480
Director Zhang,
regarding the emergency excavation,

112
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,070
our institute has already reported it.

113
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,750
The results should be out soon.

114
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,950
Our leaders have also

115
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:32,520
stated that,

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,270
since this involves the founding ancestor,

117
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,920
we can't handle it alone.

118
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,390
Therefore, it has been decided that
we will take the lead

119
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,720
and collaborate with your municipal office

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,920
to carry out a systematic excavation
of the tomb complex.

121
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,159
Darling,

122
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,870
why do we have to run?

123
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,310
Even though we lost over a hundred thousand

124
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,240
down the drain,

125
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,930
at least we still have the bowl, right?

126
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,270
You don't understand anything.

127
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,920
That thing is a ticking time bomb now.

128
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,560
With the situation so tense,

129
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,480
if I don't leave, I might not even survive.

130
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,070
Let's go quickly.

131
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,430
Don't scare me.

132
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,480
Who is it?

133
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,130
Go see who it is.

134
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm scared.

135
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,310
You go.

136
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:12,630
Go.

137
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,080
If they're looking for me, say I'm not here.

138
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,390
Who is it?

139
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,020
I'm your brother-in-law.

140
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,190
Brother-in-law.

141
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,909
Shusheng.

142
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,159
Are you going on a long trip?

143
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,390
What are you doing here at this time?

144
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,620
Want to see me make a fool of myself?

145
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,830
I'm eating well and sleeping soundly
these days.

146
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,930
Just about to go on vacation.

147
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,260
Stop being so stubborn.

148
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,290
What a chicken-hearted fool,

149
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,620
trying to run before the storm even comes.

150
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,220
Feng,

151
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,680
go inside first.

152
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,900
We need to have a chat.

153
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,470
Put that suitcase away.

154
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,910
Sit down.

155
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,000
What is there left for us to talk about?

156
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,230
If you run away,

157
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,920
isn't that as good as confessing?

158
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,960
You're just handing over clues to
the cultural relic protection department.

159
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,080
Besides, where do you think you're going?

160
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,010
What exactly are you trying to say?

161
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,310
Let's cut to the chase.

162
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,080
I want that alms bowl.

163
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,220
What alms bowl?

164
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,340
That bowl Xing Zhaohu gave you
is called an "alms bowl."

165
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,250
I knew you didn't come here
for anything good.

166
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,950
You can have it if you want.

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,159
How much are you willing to pay?

168
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,890
One million.

169
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,340
I came here with sincerity.

170
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,659
The money is in the car.

171
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,320
Even if you

172
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,570
sell the alms bowl to King Hua,

173
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,909
he would give you 500,000 at most.

174
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,390
Don't bring up King Hua.

175
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,370
I know the market.

176
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,100
A Song Dynasty ceramic

177
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,970
can easily fetch tens of millions
at auctions.

178
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,450
You're still thinking about auctions?

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't forget,

180
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,930
you're just a tomb raider.

181
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,520
Of course,

182
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,410
selling the alms bowl to me
might be different.

183
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:14,970
Shusheng,

184
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
give me the alms bowl,

185
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,890
you take the money.

186
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,050
When I achieve great things in the future,

187
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,780
you'll be the top contributor.

188
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,320
You must think

189
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,280
I'm as stupid as Xing Zhaohu,

190
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
letting you sweet-talk me

191
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,080
until I'm completely confused.

192
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,830
You can have it if you want.

193
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,690
Four million.

194
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,330
One million.

195
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,460
That's already all my savings
from these years.

196
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,340
Mu Jianhui,

197
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,700
I used to think I had to
interpret your words in reverse,

198
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,630
but since the incident at Lvjia Village,

199
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,810
I've reconsidered.

200
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,280
Your words

201
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,210
are wrong both ways.

202
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,440
How many tombs have you
excavated over the years?

203
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,370
One million is all your wealth?

204
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,160
Who would believe that?

205
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
One million in cash.

206
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:08,890
The rest

207
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,420
has all been spent on the car,
house, and shop.

208
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,700
I've already told you everything.

209
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,510
If you still don't believe me,

210
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,610
there's nothing more I can do.

211
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,940
Then find a way to sell your house and land.

212
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,700
Anyway, four million.

213
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,280
Not a cent less.

214
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,320
Big Head's

215
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,030
true identity

216
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,070
hasn't been confirmed yet.

217
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,910
We're checking his car at the same time.

218
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,180
Well,

219
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,480
there's no sign of Xing Zhaohu

220
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,710
at any of the main entrances or exits.

221
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,340
But regarding Shan,

222
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,820
there's a major breakthrough.

223
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,950
Shan confessed that

224
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,180
in the black pottery figurine case
back then,

225
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,300
there were four perpetrators.

226
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,010
One of them was Big Head.

227
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,970
Another one went by the nickname Gunner.

228
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,580
His real name is unknown.

229
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,530
I feel like Shan

230
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,930
still hasn't come clean.

231
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,850
This guy is very cunning.

232
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,110
He's also trying to read us.

233
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,700
What we've got on him,

234
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,410
he's already confessed to.

235
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,610
As for the rest, he's just

236
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,610
pretending he doesn't know a thing.

237
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,690
This is typical of these tomb raiders.

238
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,450
The more they talk,

239
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,790
the more people they implicate.

240
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,690
They'll face retaliation.

241
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,270
If Big Head isn't working with
Xing Zhaohu anymore,

242
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,570
then why did he go to
the hair salon to pick up goods?

243
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,170
Is he just a runner or a buyer?

244
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,930
According to Shan,

245
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,930
Big Head

246
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,780
was originally just a gravedigger.

247
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,500
How could he afford to
buy Xing Zhaohu's goods?

248
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,500
I think

249
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,450
at most,

250
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,860
he's an on-site commander.

251
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,500
An on-site commander?

252
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,570
Who is he running errands for?

253
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,810
Xing Zhaohu or someone else?

254
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,740
It's very likely

255
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,420
there's someone behind this.

256
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,700
That person

257
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
must know that Xing Zhaohu

258
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,090
robbed the Lv Family Tomb

259
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,170
and also know that Xing Zhaohu
was planning to flee from Qinchuan.

260
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,170
If this inference is correct,

261
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,690
Xing Zhaohu might have sold

262
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,410
these artifacts to this person

263
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,260
before fleeing.

264
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,570
This person

265
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,380
then had Big Head

266
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,450
pick up the goods.

267
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,860
You think

268
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,850
this person is connected to
the black pottery figurine case?

269
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,210
I wouldn't dare say that without evidence.

270
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,540
Yongfu,

271
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,840
I think

272
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,270
we should leave Shan

273
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
hanging for a bit.

274
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,470
We'll interrogate him again
once we have new evidence.

275
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,880
Sounds good.

276
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,140
Now,

277
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,150
regarding Big Head,

278
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,210
we'll investigate both the man and his car.

279
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,470
Distribute his photo

280
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,500
to all police stations.

281
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,900
Right now,

282
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,700
the most promising lead

283
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,670
might be Big Head.

284
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,410
Master,

285
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,500
we've been at the municipal office
for so many years.

286
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,260
We're quite experienced, right?

287
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,860
Moreover,

288
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,450
we follow the urban construction team
every day,

289
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,250
checking if there are tombs here

290
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,260
or there.

291
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,800
That's all just mine-sweeping work.

292
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,830
Finally, a Lv family tomb shows up,

293
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,100
and

294
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,450
it matches my expertise. Let me go, please.

295
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,060
Guo,

296
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,450
there are some things
you still don't quite understand.

297
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,110
But it's also a recent notice.

298
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,440
The Municipal Cultural Heritage Bureau

299
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,050
has entrusted our office
to conduct an exploration

300
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,770
in the area
of the black pottery figurine looting pit.

301
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,290
So, after our deliberation, we've decided

302
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,250
to send you to Yin Village.

303
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,450
Yin Village?

304
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,570
There are so many people in our office.

305
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,890
Why don't you send someone else?

306
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,440
I still want to go to the Lv Family Tomb.

307
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,410
Then tell me,

308
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,060
who in the whole office

309
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,220
knows Yin Village better than you?

310
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,230
Yes.

311
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,600
Master,

312
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,170
I do feel you're

313
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,250
being a bit unfair here.

314
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,680
Guo,

315
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,650
I get that

316
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,710
you have your complaints,

317
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,370
but you're not seeing

318
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,310
the full picture on this.

319
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,200
You'll head to Yin Village,

320
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,880
finish the work in just a few months,

321
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,540
and then I'll transfer you
to the Lv Family Tomb.

322
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:37,860
Alright?

323
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,330
Keep up with us.

324
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,660
Let's go.

325
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:03,620
Move.

326
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,050
Hello?

327
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:08,930
Kun,

328
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,540
what are you doing?

329
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,520
Do you miss me?

330
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,840
What's wrong? Did something happen?

331
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,170
There's a good project,

332
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,200
but the leader won't let me go.

333
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,080
He insisted on sending me
to Yin Village for exploration.

334
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,290
The Yin Village exploration
has been approved?

335
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,490
When are you leaving?

336
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
What do you mean by "when are we leaving"?

337
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,080
Can't you focus on the main point?

338
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,340
Right now, your friend

339
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,050
is unappreciated for his talents.

340
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,470
Wait.

341
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,770
Isn't it good for you to go to Yin Village?

342
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,600
They're all familiar people there, right?

343
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,000
How many of you are going?

344
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,930
How large is the initial exploration area?

345
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,730
You idiot.

346
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,050
Hello?

347
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,420
Uncle,

348
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,580
you're impressive.

349
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,620
I really underestimated you.

350
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,400
In just a few short years,

351
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,370
you've collected so many good things.

352
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,540
As they say in your Qinchuan dialect,

353
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,720
it's

354
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,070
liao za lie (wonderful).

355
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,630
Okay,

356
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,570
name a price.

357
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,510
That's the spirit.

358
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,640
Three hundred yuan.

359
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,440
You take it all. How's that?

360
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,250
Three hundred yuan?

361
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,290
Okay.

362
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,350
Deal.

363
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,550
But

364
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,320
that has to include those two
Sui and Tang items

365
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,710
you gave me last time.

366
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,480
King Hua,

367
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,200
you know very well that I've already sold

368
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,480
those two items.

369
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,500
If that's the case, I'm sorry.

370
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,640
Without those two items,

371
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,780
I can only offer you

372
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,030
100 yuan.

373
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Consider those two Sui and Tang artifacts

374
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,910
a favor I owe you.

375
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Next time,

376
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,020
I'll bring you a few even better ones.

377
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,140
Will there ever be a next time?

378
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,880
I heard there was trouble
in Lvjia Village in Mi County.

379
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,050
A gravedigger was even lost there.

380
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,380
He was one of your brother-in-law's men.

381
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,550
Can you

382
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,000
really stay out of it?

383
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,120
Whether you're planning to flee

384
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,630
or retire from this business,

385
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,320
this deal today

386
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,740
is likely to be our

387
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,790
last collaboration.

388
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,750
I'm just facing some

389
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,210
minor troubles right now.

390
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,320
But I'll still be in this business.

391
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,290
There will be plenty of opportunities
to work together in the future.

392
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,609
Let's talk about the future

393
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,630
when the time comes.

394
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:07,760
Okay?

395
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,550
That's the price,

396
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,280
100 yuan.

397
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,359
King Hua,

398
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,599
over the years, how much have you
taken from me?

399
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,880
How much money have you made?

400
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,430
I'd say at least

401
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,740
half your fortune is thanks to me.

402
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,350
Even if

403
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,700
it's just for the sake of our past,

404
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,850
I'm not asking you to add 200 yuan,

405
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,560
but at least throw in 50.

406
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,230
You're right.

407
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,560
We do have some history between us.

408
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,190
But

409
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,500
if we're talking about money,

410
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,560
it's worth maybe

411
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,950
50 cents.

412
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,260
That's insane.

413
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,610
Ms. Luo,

414
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,540
the moon is beautiful tonight.

415
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,230
Would you like to
enjoy the moonlight together?

416
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,040
Xiaobai,

417
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,760
where are you?

418
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,260
What are you up to
in the middle of the night?

419
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,370
Where's the moon?

420
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,230
Xiaobai?

421
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,650
Xiaobai?

422
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
How come it's you?

423
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,700
Surprised?

424
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,880
Shocked?

425
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:28,980
What?

426
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,320
Is Yusai so boring

427
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,590
that you had to come back?

428
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,430
♪ Time leaves its marks, worn and faded ♪

429
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,890
I'm not leaving this time.

430
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,220

431
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,480

Why?

434
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,980
♪ Quietly speaks ♪

435
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,910
♪ The past's clarity and muddle unfold ♪

436
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,600
Because I want to enjoy
the moonlight with you.

437
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,670
Afraid you'd get bored
and keep bothering Xiaobai.

438
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,280
♪ Watch the sunset over the plains ♪

439
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,130
Crazy.

It's not exactly what I expected.

449
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,420
But isn't that just how life goes?

450
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,690
You seem pretty happy to me.

451
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,210
Really.

452
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,020
Come on.

453
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,660
Dough drop soup.

454
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,410
I learned how to make some
to help settle your stomachs.

455
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,950
Try my cooking and
tell me what you think.

456
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,520
What's wrong? Why are you

457
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,780
sighing and groaning?

458
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,120
What's the matter, Shilin?

459
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,580
Are you still in a bad mood?

460
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,710
I've already accepted it.

461
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,930
I've resigned myself

462
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:43,970
to it.

463
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,180
Let it be.

464
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,230
Don't be discouraged.

465
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,300
Didn't Zhang Fengchun say

466
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,170
after finishing the Yin Village project,

467
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,410
he'll let you help with the Lv Family Tomb?

468
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,140
At that time,

469
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,340
the three of you can be together again.

470
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,890
Who? Which three?

471
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,690
The... The three of us together?

472
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,170
What?

473
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,220
You're still going back to Yusai?

474
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,170
Not for now.

475
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,620
That's what I meant.

476
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,010
I recommended you to
the heads of the provincial institute.

477
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,040
The Lv Family Tomb is short-handed.

478
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,110
You can go there

479
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,320
and keep Luo Qing company.

480
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,690
Mrs. Zan,

481
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,240
I didn't come back this time
to go to the provincial institute.

482
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,970
I want to go to the municipal office.

483
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,970
You must be crazy.

484
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,560
Not going to the provincial institute,
but the municipal office?

485
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,400
I'm living proof of the harsh reality.

486
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,730
I've been in the municipal office
for so many years

487
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,250
but haven't gotten a single big project.

488
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,170
Running after construction projects
every day,

489
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,410
no professional title at all.

490
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,450
What are you trying to do here?

491
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,650
He's got his whole heart set on the site.

492
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,520
Only by going to the municipal office
can he explore the site.

493
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,450
See? Only Luo Qing understands me.

494
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,520
The key is

495
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,730
the municipal office is fully staffed.

496
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,650
If you go there, you won't even
have a position.

497
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,110
The municipal office has no positions left?

498
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,760
What should I do then?

499
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,170
If I go, I can only be a temporary worker.

500
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,570
Let me be your assistant.

501
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,330
You're really out of your mind.

502
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Just bear with me for a couple of days.

503
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,100
This is the deal with the accommodation.

504
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,360
You can still change your mind if you want.

505
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,170
It's pretty good, isn't it?

506
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,630
This is a lot better than
what we had in Yusai.

507
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,580
Where do I sleep?

508
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,250
You can choose either
the top bunk or the bottom one.

509
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:14,780
Alright.

510
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,520
Aren't you already married?

511
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,680
Why don't you just stay at home?

512
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,040
It's not far from your home, is it?

513
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,770
You've been to my place before.

514
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,770
It's a two-bedroom apartment,
about 60 square meters.

515
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,690
My father, mother, and sister live together.

516
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,880
It's already very cramped.

517
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,140
If my wife and I go back,

518
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,040
there's not even a scrap of space to use.

519
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,240
Every time we go back,

520
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,610
my sister has to move out
and stay with someone else.

521
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,410
It makes my wife feel quite uncomfortable.

522
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,250
Weren't you planning to buy

523
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,910
your own house since college?

524
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,370
I'm stuck in construction work every day.

525
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,930
I can't get a professional title

526
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,970
or a raise.

527
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,790
How can I afford to buy a house?

528
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,170
You know how low the salary
is at the municipal office.

529
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,010
I didn't know that.

530
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,760
You don't really know anything,

531
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,600
yet you just came back
and gave up everything?

532
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,260
I'm single, so I only need to
worry about myself.

533
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,400
Why should I care about that?

534
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,550
What about Luo Qing?

535
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,580
Have you considered her feelings?

536
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,160
What feelings of Luo Qing should I consider?

537
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,490
You don't even consider her.

538
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,700
Yet you called her out to watch the moon.

539
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,860
How could you know?

540
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,890
Who am I?

541
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,100
So, what's the result?

542
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,720
The result is that she rejected me.

543
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,760
I knew it.

544
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,730
If I were her, I would reject you too.

545
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,540
What?

546
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,290
I'm curious about one thing.

547
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,080
Why did you

548
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,730
have to tell her

549
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,720
that you came back for Yin Village?

550
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,650
It's the truth.

551
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,490
If you tell Luo Qing

552
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,800
that you came back for
the archaeological survey in Yin Village,

553
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
then she will feel

554
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,180
that in your heart,

555
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,650
she's not as important as
your archaeological work.

556
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,040
How do you think she would feel?

557
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,100
Is that important?

558
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,250
Isn't it enough that I came back?

559
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,530
It's the result that matters, right?

560
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,660
For a girl, it is important.

561
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,210
When you were in school,

562
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,840
weren't you good at chatting with girls?

563
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,500
How did you become such a fool?

564
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,220
I think you're overthinking it.

565
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,880
Luo Qing is definitely
not that narrow-minded.

566
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,910
It's pointless to argue.

567
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,490
Do you want some instant noodles?

568
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,150
No, thanks.

569
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:47,890
[I'm not only here for Yin Village,
you know that.]

570
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,530
[Dog Four: Oh.]

571
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,140
Director Zhang,

572
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,140
Fang Kun is here.

573
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,360
Director Zhang,

574
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,890
I'm here to report for duty.

575
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,080
Ah, Fang,

576
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,010
I'm so glad you're here.

577
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,730
If the project wasn't so urgent,

578
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,320
I honestly wouldn't have
the nerve to ask you to come.

579
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,170
We haven't even

580
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,730
settled your permanent position yet,

581
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,650
and here we are,
already expecting you to start working.

582
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,690
If word gets out,

583
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,930
people will say our institute's
being unfair.

584
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,440
No worries.

585
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,360
It'll happen sooner or later.

586
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:33,840
No rush.

587
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,270
[Baliu District People's Government]

588
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,840
Chief,

589
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,370
what brings you here?

590
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,170
I'm looking for the district chief.

591
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,770
It's about the cherry planting
in our village.

592
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,440
If the district chief has to manage
what your village plants,

593
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,540
he'd work himself to death.

594
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,800
You should go to the township office first
for this matter.

595
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:56,770
What's the problem?

596
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,300
I want to ask you something.

597
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,770
-It's said that...
-Go ahead.

598
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,330
An archaeological team
is coming to our village.

599
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,990
You're quite well-informed.

600
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,930
That's true.

601
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,890
The cherry trees in our village
have just been planted.

602
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,640
It'll take three to four years
before they start bearing fruit.

603
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,240
Now is exactly the most crucial time
for them to grow.

604
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,290
If the archaeological team comes,

605
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,480
they'll poke holes all over the ground.

606
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,200
Then we won't be able to
fertilize or water properly.

607
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,880
What should we do?

608
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
The archaeological team
strictly adheres to the rules.

609
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,940
They won't ruin your land.

610
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,100
Besides,

611
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,770
didn't you get government subsidies
for young crops?

612
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,890
They'll definitely minimize
the farmers' losses as much as possible.

613
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,620
That's true.

614
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,960
But I can't just let them ruin my land

615
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,160
for a little subsidy.

616
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,780
If they destroy the seedlings,

617
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,980
what's the point of doing archaeology?

618
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,290
Can you tell them

619
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,200
not to come to our village?

620
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
They have official documents
authorizing them to enter your village.

621
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,680
On what grounds could I possibly stop them?

622
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,210
Besides,

623
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,340
archaeology

624
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
is part of our cultural undertaking.

625
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,050
We must balance economic growth
with cultural preservation.

626
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,110
Do you understand?

627
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,010
Fine.

628
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,290
Even if you won't deal with it,
I won't support their work either.

629
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,420
Hey, you're really a stubborn old man.

630
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,810
Look, what's this?

631
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,340
Hurry up.

632
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,780
Dinner's ready.

633
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,190
Okay.

634
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,290
Father, dinner's ready.

635
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,130
Let's dig in.

636
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
My arms are getting sore from holding him.

637
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,680
Where's Lai?

638
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,530
Chubby baby.

639
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,800
He said his classmate
has a construction project out of town.

640
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,460
He went to see if there's
any work that pays well.

641
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,910
His classmate?

642
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,000
He didn't even finish junior middle school.

643
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,480
What classmates could he have?

644
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,000
He must be wasting time
at the mahjong table again.

645
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,460
You're really something,

646
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,130
can't even keep your man in check.

647
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,920
Nursing a baby

648
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,650
is already exhausting enough.

649
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,850
How can I possibly have time
to watch over him?

650
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,290
Listen, if you've got pent-up anger,

651
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,370
go vent it outside.

652
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,500
Why are you getting so worked up over her?

653
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,130
It's just an archaeological team.

654
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,530
Look how worried you are.

655
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,960
If we nurture the land,

656
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,520
it will nourish us in return.

657
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,100
They're going to dig
a bunch of holes in the field.

658
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,160
How much less fruit will our trees bear?

659
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,570
How much less money will we make?

660
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,770
Don't be so troubled.

661
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,770
That archaeological team
is all our acquaintances.

662
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,170
They won't ruin our land.

663
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,780
Uncle Youliang.

664
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,250
Uncle.

665
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,270
Auntie.

666
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,130
-Guo.
-Auntie.

667
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,240
Fang, hurry up.

668
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,050
Come inside.

669
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,440
Okay.

670
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,200
Come in.

671
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,720
Uncle.

672
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,650
Shilin.

673
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:34,850
Kun.

674
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,390
You really splurged.

675
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,240
Here, I brought you a leg of lamb.

676
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,200
Next time you visit, just come empty-handed.

677
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,960
Call me "Uncle".

678
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,890
Call me "Uncle".

679
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,420
-Oh yeah.
-Have a seat.

680
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,070
-Come on.
-Let's have a drink with Uncle Youliang.

681
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,000
-Okay.
-I'll get you a cup.

682
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,720
Okay, get the cups.

683
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,330
Sit down.

684
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,090
Sit.

685
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,680
I'll go put these things away.

686
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
Sit down quickly.

687
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,890
These shoes are for Xiuheng.

688
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,270
Don't worry about it. Sit down quickly.

689
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,070
I won't drink.

690
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
My stomach hurts.

691
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,720
Brother, sit down quickly.

692
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,260
Okay.

693
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,100
What's wrong?

694
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,500
What's the matter?

695
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,280
Uncle, it's like this.

696
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,050
You know that piece of land
in our village that's often looted?

697
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,770
We'd like to explore further.

698
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,040
Uncle.

699
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,680
We're all our own people here.

700
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,210
Let's be straightforward.

701
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,550
We might need to stay
in Yin Village for a while longer.

702
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,570
We'd like to stay at your place.

703
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,430
Would that be convenient for you?

704
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,400
A few technicians will arrive tomorrow.

705
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
The accommodation fee
will be calculated the same as before.

706
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,010
Tell me,

707
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,500
how do you plan to explore these pits?

708
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,770
Are you going to turn my land
into a honeycomb?

709
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,700
A bunch of holes?

710
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,090
Uncle, we promise you

711
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,530
we won't damage the villagers' land at all.

712
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,200
Once we're done, we'll be careful
not to step on any seedlings,

713
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,330
and we'll fill in
the excavation holes right away.

714
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,590
Yes.

715
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,610
What do you think?

716
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,700
Captain Qi.

717
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,010
Here.

718
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,940
We've identified Big Head.

719
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,050
His real name is Hong Datong.

720
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,260
He's an unemployed guy from Shang County.

721
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,850
Usually,

722
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,010
he does odd jobs at the wholesale market.

[Basic Information of Regular Residents]

724
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,180
The vehicle has been tracked down as well.

725
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,090
The license plate is fake.

726
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,180
And it's a scrapped vehicle.

727
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,850
The vehicle came from

728
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,710
a scrap car recycling plant
in the eastern suburbs.

729
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,370
Found it.

730
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,320
Found it.

731
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,650
It is indeed from our factory.

732
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,310
It's weird.

733
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,270
There's no record
on this outbound delivery note.

734
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,240
But you're the boss.

735
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,770
Don't you know when a car is missing?

736
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,530
Officer,

737
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,040
look. My factory has at least

738
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,150
thousands of cars, if not tens of thousands.

739
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,480
Well,

740
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,520
how can I remember them all?

741
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,800
So according to what you're saying,

742
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,950
with so many cars in the factory,

743
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,390
you wouldn't notice
if they all went missing?

744
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,190
We usually have someone on duty.

745
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,150
Who was on duty during that period?

746
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,320
It's a rotating shift.

747
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,450
Why don't I take you
to the staff dormitory to ask around?

748
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,360
Where are they?

749
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,250
That's strange.

750
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,430
I'll make a call.

751
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,480
Captain Qi!

752
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,150
Stop!

753
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,120
Don't run! Stop!

754
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,340
Stop!

755
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,390
Stop!

756
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,940
Where do you think you're running off to?
Stop!

757
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,370
How annoying! Why are you chasing me?

758
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,580
You!

759
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,670
What are you guys up to?

760
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,710
Police.

761
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,960
You must have done something wrong.

762
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,210
I haven't done anything wrong.

763
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,010
It's just that

764
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,880
I sold a scrapped car illegally.

765
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,670
What's your name?

766
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,730
My name is Wang Jin.

767
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,340
Who did you sell the car to?

768
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,330
I'm afraid to say.

769
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,730
I'm really afraid to say.

770
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,200
The person who bought the car

771
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,470
forced me to do it.

772
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,830
At first,

773
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,480
I really didn't want to sell it to him.

774
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,190
But he hired someone

775
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,740
to beat me up badly.

776
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,630
I had no choice.

777
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,800
That's why I sold it to him.

778
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,070
Now that I've told you,

779
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,020
he'll definitely send someone
to beat me up again.

780
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,880
Let me tell you,

781
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,550
the fact that I found you

782
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,070
means that person has committed a crime.

783
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,400
And it's not a minor one.

784
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,540
If you confess,

785
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,190
I can arrest him.

786
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,400
How would he be able to beat you up again?

787
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,300
If you stay silent,
that counts as harboring a criminal.

788
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,580
You're the one who'll end up
in jail for sure.

789
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,470
I don't have the guts.

790
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,430
I don't have the guts.

791
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,890
Tell us!

792
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,410
I'll tell you.

793
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,440
I'll tell you.

794
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,710
He was the one who came looking for me.

795
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,230
One time when he was on the phone,

796
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,430
in the conversation,

797
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,630
he seemed to say his name was...

798
00:32:59,630 --> 00:32:59,990
What?

799
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:00,820
He...

800
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,030
Don't rush me. Let me think.

801
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,190
He said his name was Liu something.

802
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,320
Liu what-sheng?

803
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:06,950
Liu...

804
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,620
Liu Shusheng.

805
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,320
Yes, that's it. Liu Shusheng.

806
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,050
But I'm not sure about

807
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,640
-the exact three characters.
-Go check it out.

808
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,300
Investigate it immediately.

809
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,770
You're back.

810
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,790
Where are the items?

811
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,440
I sold them to King Hua.

812
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,120
Those were all our treasures.

813
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,040
You just sold them like that?

814
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Right now,

815
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,380
it's not about what we can or can't do.

816
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,980
As long as we get paid,
that's all that matters.

817
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,700
We have money.

818
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,950
Where did it come from?

819
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,810
I have 500,000.

820
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,570
The brothers chipped in 100,000.

821
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,010
I don't want the money.

822
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,530
This matter has nothing to do with you.

823
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,290
If you don't take this money,
I'll just burn it.

824
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,540
Guang,

825
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,010
I won't forget your kindness.

826
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,949
Without you, we wouldn't be here.

827
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,120
We're just a dozen fools,

828
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,870
wasting our days and nights
at the mahjong table.

829
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,760
The money we make
is barely enough to spend.

830
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,880
I'm just worried it's not enough.

831
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,610
It's enough.

832
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,739
When I make money in the future,

833
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,139
I'll pay you back double.

834
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,360
Officer Qi,

835
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,989
I've already told you

836
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,580
everything I know.

837
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,760
What more do you want to squeeze out of me?

838
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,920
When pus gathers inside,

839
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,720
it's bound to burst eventually.

840
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,830
You carry around

841
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,420
so many

842
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,030
dirty secrets every day.

843
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,090
Aren't you tired?

844
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,220
Do you know Liu Shusheng?

845
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,550
No, never heard of him. I don't know him.

846
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,770
You're afraid of Liu Shusheng too?

847
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,700
I don't even know him.

848
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,230
How could I be afraid of him?

849
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,790
No,

850
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,100
I can see you're very afraid.

851
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,060
I don't know him.

852
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,950
Please, don't ask anymore.

853
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,210
I don't know anything.

854
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,440
He must know everything about you.

855
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,850
You're afraid he'll go after your family.

856
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,600
No, I don't know him.

857
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,200
Why are you crying?

858
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,500
Can't I miss my wife and children?

859
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,570
[Qinchuan City Detention Center]

860
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,310
Captain Yang.

861
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,110
What's wrong?

862
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,720
Come with me to Shan's house.

863
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,250
Let's go.

864
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,470
What's wrong?

865
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,890
This police car and uniforms

866
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,970
make us too obvious going into the village.

867
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,990
That's right.

868
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,280
Shan's been arrested.

869
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,910
How will his wife and children get by?

870
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,400
There are plain clothes in the trunk.

871
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Let's get changed

872
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,380
and take a taxi there.

873
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:41,910
Alright.

874
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,580
Who is it?

875
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,070
This is Shan's house, right?

876
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:18,990
Yes.

877
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,090
We're here to investigate
and gather some information.

878
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,360
Shan isn't home.

879
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,970
Please open the door first.

880
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,700
Police.

881
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,240
Open up.

882
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,120
What

883
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,870
brings you here?

884
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,530
We're here to see you.

885
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,900
Any difficulties in your life recently?

886
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:54,580
No.

887
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,290
Nothing at all.

888
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:57,740
Everything's fine.

889
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,800
How about the kids?

890
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
They're not here?

891
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,040
The older one isn't home.

892
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,310
The little one hasn't been

893
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,710
feeling well these days.

894
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,290
He's sleeping now.

895
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,550
What's wrong with him?

896
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,160
He's got a runny nose.

897
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,920
He probably caught a bit of a cold.

898
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,380
What happened to his face?

899
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,290
What happened? How did he get hurt so badly?

900
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,300
It was dark at night.

901
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,530
He fell off his bike.

902
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,350
Fell off a bike and got hurt this badly?

903
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,390
Someone beat him up, didn't they?

904
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,310
Who did it?

905
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,120
He is usually very well-behaved.

906
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,290
He doesn't cause trouble either.

907
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,710
How could he get into a fight with someone?

908
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,020
He just fell, that's all.

909
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,220
Has someone been

910
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,920
intimidating you lately?

911
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,380
No one is intimidating us.

912
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,140
I'm just an honest farmer
trying to make a living from the land.

913
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,270
I don't know anyone.

914
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,330
Really, no one is intimidating us.

915
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,310
Tell me,

916
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,450
who hit you?

917
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,160
Don't be afraid.

918
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,700
You mustn't hide anything, okay?

919
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,860
I'm telling the truth.

920
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,500
Take this.

921
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,780
What... What is this for?

922
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,580
It's for treating his injuries.

923
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,910
My phone number.

924
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,020
Keep it.

925
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,250
If anyone intimidates you again,

926
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,180
give me a call.

927
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,180
Hey little one,

928
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,880
call me.

929
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,140
You must tell us.

930
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,590
If anything happens, you must let us know.

931
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,020
Liu Shusheng.

932
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,270
He beat me to it again.

933
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,350
I'll drag him out, skin and all.

934
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,120
Don't be so anxious.

935
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,590
We need to take things one step at a time.

936
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,500
What?

937
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,750
Did you...

938
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,550
leave us any money?

939
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,600
You...

940
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,890
You don't have money?

941
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,350
My...

942
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,880
My wallet is in my police uniform.

943
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,410
I left my uniform in the car.

944
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,690
How do we get back?

945
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,820
How do we get back?

946
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,500
Let's go back

947
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,640
and borrow some from her.

948
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,350
Twenty yuan.

949
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,550
I just gave her money,
but now you want to borrow from her?

950
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,060
Or else?

951
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
What should we do?

952
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,660
Dacang,

953
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,310
you should start eating some walnuts.

954
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,640
It might help that slow brain of yours

955
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,580
catch up.

956
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,420
How about 150 yuan?

957
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,600
I haven't eaten yet.

958
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,800
Let's eat some paomo.

959
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:36,910
What?

960
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,310
Lamb paomo.

961
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,570
Do you want some?

962
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,040
What are you looking for?

963
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,370
Where's my shirt?

964
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,590
There's a celebration tomorrow.

965
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,000
I need to dress formally.

966
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,910
It's right here.

967
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,280
Can you iron it for me?

968
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,990
Stop right there.

969
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,100
What's wrong?

970
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,630
Take it out.

971
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,170
Take what out?

972
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,390
Take it out,

973
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,620
and I'll pretend none of this ever happened.

974
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

975
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,440
What are you doing?

976
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,770
I told you.

977
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,740
You think I didn't see that?

978
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,690
Why won't you listen to me?

979
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,670
What is this?

980
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,010
I'm asking you, what is this?

981
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,540
What are you yelling about?

982
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,490
I paid for this out of my own pocket.

983
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,470
Since you've already seen it,

984
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,870
I might as well be honest.

985
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,430
I've got some debts.

986
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,130
They said

987
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,370
if I can't pay up, they'll come
cause trouble at home.

988
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,230
I'm not scared.

989
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,770
But your father is someone important.

990
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,380
When the time comes,
it'll be his reputation on the line.

991
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,420
What are you saying?

992
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,560
Why are you bringing up my father?

993
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,220
-What are you talking about?
-Give it to me!

994
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,310
Let go!

995
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,310
-Give it to me.
-You're snatching it,

996
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,020
yet you think...

997
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,310
-You think you're right?
-Give it to me.

998
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,210
What do you want? You want to hit me?

999
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,240
What do you want to do?

1000
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,350
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

1001
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,500
You want to hit me, don't you?

1002
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,120
-Give it to me.
-Right?

1003
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,990
Don't get involved in
other couples' business.

1004
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,300
You'll only bring trouble upon yourself.

1005
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,940
Ouch! Let go!

1006
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:32,950
It hurts!

1007
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,970
You want to hit me, don't you?

1008
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,160
Help!

1009
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,870
-Help!
-Come on.

1010
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,830
Hurry!

1011
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,840
How dare you hit me!

1012
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,900
How dare you hit me!

1013
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:41,470
How dare you hit me!

1014
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,220
Alright.

1015
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:42,870
Calm down.

1016
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,500
Let go!

1017
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:44,530
Let go of me!

1018
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,660
I'll take you on.

1019
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,700
That's enough.

1020
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,830
Come on, Mr. Lu.

1021
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,310
-I won't give in anymore!
-Let him go.

1022
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:49,910
Let him go.

1023
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,160
Come on, hit me.

1024
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,420
-Come on.
-Look at her.

1025
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,950
Lai, you bastard.

1026
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,120
What do you think you're doing?

1027
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,310
Why are you putting on airs?

1028
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,060
Come on. If you've got the guts, try me.

1029
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,580
If you dare to lay a finger
on Xiaoman today,

1030
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,660
I'll rip your arm off.
