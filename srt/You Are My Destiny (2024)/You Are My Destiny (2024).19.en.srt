1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 19=

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,480
Tell me,

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,110
who are you?

9
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,070
Who are you?

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,430
Who the hell are you?

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,920
Everyone is bullying me!

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,750
Are you going to work in this outfit?

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,150
(Sorry, Shan.)

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,840
(Nie Group is facing
the biggest crisis ever.)

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,790
(The CEO will be criminally liable.)

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,470
(You have to leave the Nie Family.)

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,920
Listen,

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,480
we haven't got the payment,

19
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,450
and the debt collectors
are looking for us.

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Most of our revenues

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,150
are from Nie Group.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,050
Now their assets are frozen.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,040
They have no choice.

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,040
Then call your daughter

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,820
and tell her to sell
Nie Lingfeng's villa

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,780
and help us.

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,820
Mom, Mom.

28
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,100
I want to call my sister

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,780
and play with my brother-in-law.

30
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,740
What brother-in-law?

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,340
He's missing.

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,500
He left your sister.

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,580
How can he come?

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,820
Mom, you're lying.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,180
When my sister came,

36
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,460
he was also here.

37
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,460
What?

38
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,780
Are you serious?

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,420
Are you out of your mind?

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,940
How can you believe his words?

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,180
I thought if I killed Nie Lingfeng,

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,660
Shan would get all their assets.

43
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,420
I can't believe this idiot

44
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,940
is defending them.

45
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,020
Yong is so useless.

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,420
He can't even handle a girl.

47
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,860
How could he let her go?

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,260
What should we do?

49
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,100
Mom, I want to play with my sister.

50
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,340
I miss her.

51
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,020
Sister?

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,540
You can't escape this time.

53
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,540
(What's wrong with Nie Lingfeng?)

54
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,820
(Never mind.)

55
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,060
(I have to work.)

56
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,700
Hello.

57
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,620
Mr. Wang,

58
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm calling to ask you

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,700
when we can get the loans?

60
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,300
Nie Group needs

61
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
the money to solve this crisis.

62
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,340
Could you please

63
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,300
speed up the approval process?

64
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,060
Ms. Gu,

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,060
Nie Group's use
of disqualified materials

66
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,300
is all over the news.

67
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,740
I don't think

68
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,460
I can approve this.

69
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,180
Mr. Wang, it's important to us.

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,460
Can I

71
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,900
talk to you in person?

72
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,460
We shouldn't meet

73
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,580
at this point.

74
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,780
Maybe later.

75
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,340
- Mr. Nie.
- Hello.

76
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,740
Mr. Wang.

77
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,220
I've been calling you all afternoon.

78
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,150
Why didn't you answer my calls?

79
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,140
What's wrong with the loans?

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,900
Mr. Nie,

81
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,820
it's the bank's decision.

82
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,340
I have no other way.

83
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,220
Bank's decision?

84
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,580
Xu has told me
the paperwork is complete.

85
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,780
We only need your signature!

86
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,900
Mr. Wang,

87
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,700
do I need to remind you

88
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,460
how you got the position?

89
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,460
If I hadn't handed over our accounts

90
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,540
to you,

91
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,540
how could you be promoted
to the president?

92
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,740
Listen,

93
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,100
if we can't get the loans,

94
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,180
I'll give the accounts
to someone else!

95
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,900
Okay. Mr. Nie, calm down.

96
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,900
Don't worry,

97
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,860
I'll approve it.
