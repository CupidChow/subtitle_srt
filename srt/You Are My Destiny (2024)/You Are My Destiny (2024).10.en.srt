1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 10=

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,220
(Two Years Ago)
Grandpa,

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,710
you've been pushing me to get married.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,560
Besides, you said

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,030
if I didn't get married,

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,840
I wouldn't be able to
manage the company.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,560
Now I've found the right person.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,350
Lingfeng, you're always
picky about girls.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,880
Who's this rich heiress?

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,400
Gu Yashan.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,910
Who?

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,070
Gu Yashan, the daughter

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,520
of Gu Group's CEO

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,440
Gu Zetian.

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,960
No, you can't!

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,950
Gu Zetian is a nasty rat.

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,560
Like father, like daughter.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,430
Their factories cut corners.

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,590
I've wanted to stop working with them
for a long time,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,510
not to mention the marriage.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,120
Speaking of which,

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,870
Xu Siyao

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,640
is a good girl,

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,590
and you're close.

30
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,840
- You can...
- Grandpa.

31
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,350
Let me rephrase it.

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,640
If I don't marry Gu Yashan,

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,280
you'll never have a great-grandchild.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,240
Shut up!

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
You....

36
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,790
You... Fine.

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,710
You can marry her.

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,000
But it has a price.

39
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,350
What price?

40
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,200
You have to sign a prenup.

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,350
Otherwise, as long as I'm alive,

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,870
you can never marry her!

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,430
Ms. Gu.

44
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,030
We've got the deal.

45
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,430
Let's go back.

46
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,260
(13 Years Ago)
Mom, Dad,

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,430
are you really gone for good?

48
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,190
Grandpa is my only family now,

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
but he has a bad temper.

50
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,430
He forces me
to study and practice every day.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
My life is meaningless.

52
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,910
Your parents

53
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,590
are just like my mom.

54
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,400
They've become stars in the sky.

55
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,190
Maybe we can't see them,

56
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,520
but they'll always be there.

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,590
Shan, let's go.

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Shan?

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,400
What are you doing? Let's go.
