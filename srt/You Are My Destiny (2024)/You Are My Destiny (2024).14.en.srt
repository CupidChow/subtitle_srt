1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 14=

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,030
We've got the DNA test result.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,320
(Zhang Meng)
100% match.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,920
Yi Rongshu is Nie Lingfeng.

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,750
(Nie Lingfeng, you pretended)

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,390
(to be missing,)

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,320
(left a property
full authorization agreement)

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,840
(that got me into trouble,)

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,150
(and posed as a bodyguard.)

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,390
(Do you think it's funny?)

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,240
(You've really taken me for a fool.)

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,240
(This isn't over.
I'll teach you a lesson.)

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,630
Go home.

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,120
Did you work out today?

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,270
Ms. Gu,

21
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,680
I get up at 6:00 a.m.
and work out every morning.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,230
Jog 10 kilometers.

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,760
What are you waiting for?

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,910
Go.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Okay.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,710
Another 10 kilometers.

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,630
Ms. Gu.

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,560
Isn't it a bodyguard's duty
to protect his master?

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,120
How can you do a good job

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,760
without a strong body?

31
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,150
Do you agree,

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
Yi Rongshu?

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,870
What is he...?

34
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,150
Why didn't we

35
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,430
recognize him?

36
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,240
To be honest,

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,520
Mr. Nie is quite charming

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,870
when he doesn't look like a gentle scum.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,190
But who'd have thought he'd be

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
a bodyguard and take care of you?

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,910
Maybe we were both blind.

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,680
But what's Mr. Nie

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,960
doing this for?

44
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,630
Shan.

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,470
What's your plan?

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
My plan?

47
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,430
I'm good to make him realize

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,430
he's made big mistakes.

49
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,400
I want to go shopping.

50
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,680
Wait here.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,080
I'll get changed.

52
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,140
(Two Hours Later)
