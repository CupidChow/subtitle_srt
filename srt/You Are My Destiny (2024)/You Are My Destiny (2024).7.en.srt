1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 7=

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,070
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,520
How did you know this?

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,200
I heard it from a friend.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,480
From a friend.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,600
A friend?

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,670
Then your friend...

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,870
Hello?

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,320
Ms. Gu, the contract has been stamped.

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,280
I set up the dinner

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,200
to give you the contract,

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,470
but I was distracted
and forgot about it.

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,710
Have you left?

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,920
Can you come back to take it?

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,230
Okay, I got it.

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,070
Go back to the restaurant.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,710
Come here.

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,590
Grandpa, what's wrong?

24
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,120
Do you know a new designer

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,920
called Ji Chenxing?

26
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,200
We want the exclusive

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,920
cooperation rights to his exhibitions.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
You'll be

29
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,400
in charge of this.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,070
Talk to him.

31
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,510
Okay, I'm on it.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,480
If you can make it,

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,310
you'll impress everyone.

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,150
Lingfeng has insisted on
making you the person in charge.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,520
If you're not capable,

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,430
you should hand over this position.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,910
After all, Nie Group

38
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,470
needs to move forward.

39
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,710
Go.

40
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,150
(Grandpa is trying to kick me out.)

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,560
(Ji Chenxing must be a hot potato.)

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,710
I'll go on a trip with Shan for a while

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,680
to visit Ji Chenxing in G city.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,630
Take care of the company.

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,800
No problem, Boss.

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,960
Keep investigating the kidnapping.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,470
It's a good opportunity.

48
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
Don't miss it, Boss.

49
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,300
(Han Jian Fine Art Gallery)

50
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,630
This painting is so beautiful.

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,560
Are you fond of this genre?

52
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,800
My mom did.

53
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,120
Before she fell ill,

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,710
she often took me to galleries
and auctions to watch paintings.

55
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,680
After she died,

56
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,310
Auntie Cheng gave away
all her paintings.

57
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,030
I haven't been to

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
any galleries in the past 15 years.

59
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,800
Sorry, Ms. Gu.

60
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,430
Mr. Ji is busy right now.

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,680
Can you come back later?

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,080
Okay.

63
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,960
Hurry, catch them!
