1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 18=

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,880
Are you going to work in this outfit?

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,870
(So cute.)

9
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,840
Shan, are you practicing peeling skills?

10
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,340
(Yi Zi'ang: Good morning. Good night.)

11
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,180
(Meng, what are you doing?)

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,020
(Block)

13
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,430
So annoying.

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,760
Meng.

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,710
Book a romantic restaurant for me.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,840
Two seats.

17
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,920
Two seats?

18
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,920
Didn't you want to divorce him?

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,350
Well, have you changed your mind?

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
That's great.

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,230
I fell in love with him.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,590
But Shan,

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,200
which one of him?

24
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,310
What's

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
the difference?

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,030
Our assets have been frozen
for two weeks.

27
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,030
The crisis of the group

28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,840
is out of control.

29
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,630
What can we mortgage now

30
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,150
to get loans?

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,520
There's a newly acquired subsidiary

32
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,680
with independent accounts

33
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,150
and available assets.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,470
But it's up to President Wang

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,150
to give us the loans.

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,470
If we don't get the loans,

37
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,910
the company can't afford
the compensation.

38
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,430
As the acting president,

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,240
Mrs. Nie will go to jail.

40
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
(No matter what,)

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
(I won't let you get hurt anymore.)

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,870
I think

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,560
there's a misunderstanding between us.

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
Ms. Gu,

45
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,870
I think you're wrong.

46
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,560
There's nothing between us.
