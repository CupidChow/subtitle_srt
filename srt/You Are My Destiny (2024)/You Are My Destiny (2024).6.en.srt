1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 6=

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,640
How did you know the wine was drugged?

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,000
Not just that.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,520
The entire Gu family is suspicious.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,200
My family is suspicious?

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,070
What do you mean?

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,560
Am I not a Gu?

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,070
Are you suggesting
something's wrong with me?

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,590
No.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
You're a Nie.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,390
Everyone believes

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,310
I married Nie Lingfeng

18
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,920
for money,

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,590
and I'm just a spy of the Gu Family,

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,790
right?

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,150
I don't know about others,

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,870
but Mr. Nie doesn't think so.

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,880
By the way,

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,280
I've heard

25
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,640
Mr. Nie is a love-struck husband.

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,560
Love-struck husband?

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,950
Who told you that?

28
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,870
Maybe

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,000
he's just into money and beauty.

30
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,950
Two years ago, my dad's company
was in trouble.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
He took advantage of this

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,430
to force me to marry him.

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
If I didn't accept it,

34
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,480
he'd cancel

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,400
our long-term partnership.

36
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,190
He's just a hypocrite

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,680
who wants to

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,360
control business

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
through marriage.

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,080
Mr. Nie.

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,630
We've worked together

42
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,910
for a long time.

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,150
Can you please forgive me this time?

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,400
Mr. Gu,

45
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,190
you have to shut down all the projects

46
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,960
with low-quality

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
building materials.

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,750
Do you know how much money

49
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,190
we've lost?

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,190
Gu Group

51
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,120
has to bear the loss.

52
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,520
Mr. Nie, please don't.

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,150
I'll be broke,

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,310
and my entire family

55
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,710
will be homeless.

56
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm begging you.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,870
The marriage was Gu Zetian's idea.

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,470
For the marriage,

59
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,710
the Nies had to help the Gus
solve the problem,

60
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,590
and Nie Lingfeng
paid a big price for that.

61
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,030
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,520
How did you know this?
