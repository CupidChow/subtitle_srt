1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 20=

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,800
They're in the middle of a crisis.

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,790
No one knows if they can

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,840
survive this.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,520
How dare he threaten me

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,520
with the accounts?

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,790
The world is cruel.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,670
When we were thriving,

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,880
he was a loyal dog,

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,280
and now he's changed.

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,240
What can I do?

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,550
Got it.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,230
(Gu Yashan)
I still want to talk to you.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Please give me a chance.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,480
(Mr. Wang)
Go to

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
Qinjiang Hilton Hotel Room 1508

22
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,430
at 10:00 p.m.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,400
Shan.

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,510
Why are you getting dressed
at this hour?

25
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,640
Where are you going?

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,350
This nasty rat wants
to take advantage of you.

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,400
Otherwise, why would he

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,560
tell you to go to the hotel?

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,000
Shan, you can't go.

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,310
Meng, don't worry.

31
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,280
I'm very experienced.

32
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,030
If I can't even handle

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,870
a middle-aged bald man,

34
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,520
I'll forsake my name.

35
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,470
You don't need to worry about me.

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,590
Then I'm coming with you.

37
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,030
Shan,

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,750
I'm still worried about you.

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,590
Maybe I should come with you.

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,280
Shan,

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,630
do you like Nezha or Monkey King?

42
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,820
(15 Years Ago)

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,000
Shan, what's wrong?

44
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,360
Why does Auntie Cheng
dislike me so much?

45
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,080
When my dad's away,

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,870
she only feeds me rice

47
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,120
without dishes.

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,030
(Younger Zhang Meng)
Last night, I saw...

49
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,360
Really?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,560
I get it. She must be a witch.

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,240
Come on, let's get the revenge.

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,120
What's this?

53
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,120
Shan, Shan!

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,310
What happened?

55
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,240
Yahan is missing!

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,360
What should I do?

57
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,870
Meng, I lost my sister!

58
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,310
Shan,

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,080
from now on, I'll be your sister.

60
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,030
I'll protect you like the way

61
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,030
Monkey King protects Tang Priest.

62
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,470
Meng, I can handle this.

63
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,840
Give me half an hour.

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,680
Wait here.

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
No.

66
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,240
Meng, trust me.

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,870
If I don't come back,

68
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,710
call the police.

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,920
Shan!
