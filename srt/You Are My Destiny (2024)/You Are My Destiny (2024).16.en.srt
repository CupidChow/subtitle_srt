00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 16=

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,960
Boss.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,510
Tell the movie theater
to play The Double Man

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,790
right now.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,470
Boss, we don't own this movie theater.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,030
It's not up to us.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,350
Can you do it or not?

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,010
Yes, no problem.

14
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,750
Take it off.

15
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,750
(Nie Lingfeng,)

16
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,800
(what are you really up to?)

17
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,000
(Which one is the real you?)

18
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,710
Enough.

19
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,470
I haven't finished.

20
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,710
Now it's finished. Let's go.

21
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,080
You...

22
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,030
Stop pulling me. I can drink!

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,400
Get off me!

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,080
Stop it. Let's go home.

25
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,590
Yi Rongshu.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,640
Tell me,

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,030
who are you?

28
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,400
Who are you?

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Who the hell are you?

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,120
Everyone is bullying me.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,750
Cheng Yingjuan is bullying me.

32
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,190
My dad is bullying me.

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,870
Grandpa wants to kick me out.

34
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,800
You're all bullying me!

35
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,520
If my mom was still alive...

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
If my mom was here,

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,030
no one could bully me!

38
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,870
I miss her!

39
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,910
I miss my mom!

40
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,030
If she was alive,

41
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,590
she'd never let me feel sad!

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,960
I have no family.

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,630
No family! Do you understand?

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,710
What about your husband?

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,120
Have you ever loved him?

46
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,800
Have you ever loved your wife?
