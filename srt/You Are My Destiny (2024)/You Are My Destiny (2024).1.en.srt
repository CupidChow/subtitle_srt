1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,670
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,270
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,870
Wait.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,080
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 1=

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,150
You're so useless.

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,000
Find her now!

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,140
(Keep Right)

10
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,500
(Nie Lingfeng, President of Nie Group)

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,680
How's the investigation going?

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,150
(Yi Zi'ang, President's Assistant)
The brake pad was damaged,

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,000
but we haven't found out who did it.

14
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,710
It's not the first time.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,200
I need to disappear for a while.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,000
Keep digging.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Is there any high-tech product
for disguise?

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,750
(Disguise Contact Lenses, Sample)
Here.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,200
We just purchased a tech company.

20
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,910
They've developed disguise contact lenses

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,150
that can interfere with
other people's brains

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,680
and lead to misidentification

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,180
of the wearer's facial features.

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,320
In other words.

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,270
with this,

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,150
you'll become a completely

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,240
different person in other people's eyes.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,780
Even your family

29
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,230
can't recognize you.

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,240
I'm just

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,030
worried about Shan.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
What? Mrs. Nie was kidnapped?

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,620
(One Day Later)

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,680
(Gu Yashan, Nie Lingfeng's Wife,
Vice President of Nie Group)

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,400
(Who saved me last night?)

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,150
(He looked like Nie Lingfeng.)

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,470
(I've been avoiding him
since I became his)

38
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,280
(contractual wife 9 months ago.)

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,870
(I only met him once at the wedding.)

40
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,560
(I can't remember what he looks like.)

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,630
(Was that him?)

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,740
(File Pocket)

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,680
Shan, I've found
some bodyguards for you.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,190
(Zhang Meng, Shan's Bestie and Assistant)
Please let them in.

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,430
You're so stubborn.

46
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,000
Let them in.

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,870
Ms. Gu, I'm a boxing champion.

48
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,680
Ms. Gu, I've protected
many heads of state.

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,120
Ms. Gu, I'm a famous bodyguard

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,840
with 10 years of experience. Look.

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,560
(Did she recognize me?)

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,280
Is he also a bodyguard?

53
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,550
Take it off.

54
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,960
Show Ms. Gu what you've got.

55
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,500
(She didn't recognize me.)

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
Which part would you like to see?

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,630
Loyalty is the basic requirement
of a bodyguard.

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,630
You have to do what I say.

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
Take it off, or get out.

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
What are you doing?
