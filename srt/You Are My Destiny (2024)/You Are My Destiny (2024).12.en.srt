1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 12=

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,800
Gu Yashan, you...

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,750
Auntie, don't kick us out!

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,320
We just want to see our dad.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,390
Please don't kick us out!

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,430
Please don't kick us out!

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,070
When did you get pregnant?

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,880
When did you give birth?

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,840
You recovered so fast.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,840
You've never missed any shows,

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,030
and your kids have grown up.

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,880
Isn't this Ms. Xu?

18
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,200
I heard you had a crush on Lingfeng.

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,120
Oh, sorry,

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,950
he knows you like him, right?

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,280
You must be so upset

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,200
to see our children.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,950
Enough. Stop arguing.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,240
Mengyin,

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,040
take the kids back.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,840
Let's go.

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Okay.

28
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,040
Since we've found Lingfeng's children,

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,280
and he's missing,

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Gu Yashan

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,510
has no reason to stay.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,960
Grandpa,

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
if I don't marry Gu Yashan,

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,430
you'll never have a great-grandchild.

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,760
But it has a price.

36
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,790
You have to sign a prenup.

37
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,400
According to the prenup,

38
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,680
you'll get out of this family

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,760
without taking anything from us.

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
(It's weird.)

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,630
(Grandpa is a smart man.)

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,120
(How could he accept
the kids so easily?)

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,470
(Did he set up)

44
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,360
(the whole thing?)

45
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,870
Family reunion is important.

46
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,280
You should at least do a DNA test.

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
Shut up!

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,840
How dare you speak right here?

49
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,520
It's important to the family,

50
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,710
and I believe

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,360
you're thinking about

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,910
the same thing.

53
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm just speaking out

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
for you.

55
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,310
I'll arrange a DNA test,

56
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,680
and I'll show you the result.

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
We can do it right now.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,310
This is the hair I found

59
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,360
in Mr. Nie's room.

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,470
It only takes

61
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,190
three hours to get the test result.

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
You...

63
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,630
Where did you get the hair?

64
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,520
That was my hair.

65
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,190
I knew he wouldn't dare
to do the test right here,

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,520
so I did it on purpose.

67
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,400
How did you know he wouldn't dare?

68
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,960
They're not his kids.

69
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,870
How do you know?
