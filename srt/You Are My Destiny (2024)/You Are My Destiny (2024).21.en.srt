00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

(Nie Lingfeng)

8
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,550
Hello.

9
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,840
Mr. Wang, I've arrived.

10
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,680
Okay, come upstairs.

11
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,640
Why don't we have a drink
at the bar first?

12
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,090
Okay.

13
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,510
It'll help us warm up.

14
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,920
You go first. I'll be right there.

15
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,430
I'm wondering

16
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,360
if you can still be
so arrogant this time.

17
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,150
Mr. Wang,

18
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,520
thank you for your time.

19
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,710
As you know,

20
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,590
Nie Group is in trouble right now.

21
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,870
We really need your help

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,750
with the loans.

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,080
It's not

24
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,590
impossible.

25
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,590
As your friend,

26
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,590
I'll be honest with you.

27
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Ms. Gu.

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,310
You can

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,680
either offer me one thousandth
of the share

30
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
or

31
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,870
come upstairs with me right now.

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,030
Mr. Wang,

33
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,190
as you know,

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
the share is not

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,430
up to me.

36
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,150
Money does no good to our relationship.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,190
Don't worry. As your friend,

38
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,750
I'll sign it tomorrow.

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,400
All our materials are legally compliant.

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,710
Mr. Wang,

41
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,120
you have no reason to reject us, right?

42
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,190
Besides,

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,590
I've got

44
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,000
a voice recorder.

45
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,630
You nasty woman!
