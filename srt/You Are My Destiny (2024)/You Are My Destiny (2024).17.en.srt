1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 17=

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,840
I fell in love with her a long time ago.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,150
I swore I'd marry her

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,670
one day.

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,190
(Wait.)

11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,790
(I'm a bodyguard.)

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,920
(I can't kiss her.)

13
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,600
(I can't cheat on myself.)

14
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,430
Boss,

15
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,510
what are you thinking?

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
Boss.

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,870
How's the investigation going?

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,630
It was Gu Zetian who damaged the brake.

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
We've got the person,

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,400
and he admitted it.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,470
Why would he do that?

22
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,080
Our new buildings have cracked walls

23
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,560
because Gu Group used

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,520
disqualified materials.

25
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
It must've been

26
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,710
a desperate attempt
to cover up the evidence.

27
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,590
Check the other neighborhoods

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,910
and compensate
the owners for their losses.

29
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,990
Got it.

30
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,430
We've found the truth about the brake.

31
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,280
Boss, the group needs you now.

32
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,590
You have to come back.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,400
Come back?

34
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,520
What's wrong with Gu Yashan?

35
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,240
I've been so good to her.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,000
She's scared of night,

37
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,030
so I installed streetlights on the road.

38
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,240
She liked that cake,

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,400
so I bought the cake store.

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,630
Now I'm just a bodyguard,

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
but she...

42
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,080
But what?

43
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,520
Do your work.

44
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,190
Boss, are you

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,310
cheating on yourself?

46
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,710
Finish your work.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,800
Gu Yashan, Gu Yashan,

48
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,280
what have you done?

49
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,310
You're up early.

50
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,870
I'm going to work.
