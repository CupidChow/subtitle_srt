1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 9=

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,550
Then

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,430
please take a look
at the exhibition plan

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,880
for Nie Group's new building.

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,150
Let's sign a framework agreement first.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,920
However, I don't do

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,200
commercial exhibitions.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,240
Maybe next time.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,150
Mr. Ji, we can't wait.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,670
It'll be open next week.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,110
I want to sleep.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,470
Tomorrow, okay?

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,870
Dude, I need to use the bathroom.

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
By the way,

20
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,360
we can donate the profits of the auction

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,590
to Children's Fund,

22
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,910
and it won't be a commercial exhibition.

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,520
Can you accept that?

24
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,030
Not enough.

25
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,080
(He's really a tough cookie.)

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,560
Hi, Alex,

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
it's me.

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,870
How are you doing?

29
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,360
(Why is he so rude?)

30
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,470
Hey, man. I'm great. How are you?

31
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,310
Good.

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,150
Have you heard of a young Chinese artist

33
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,680
named Ji Chenxing?

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,400
Yeah. He's been popular recently.

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,190
He's interested in working with you.

36
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,800
What do you think?

37
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,280
I can help, only for you though.

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,190
Thanks, bro. I owe you one.

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,430
Okay.

40
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,840
(He's not that useless after all.)

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,190
(I found many collections)

42
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,800
(of Alex's works in your gallery.)

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,080
(I knew)

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
(you'd work with us for him.)

45
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,380
(Yazhi Hotel)

46
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,260
(Xu Siyao, Only Daughter
of Xu Group's President)

47
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,150
Grandpa Nie,

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
what's wrong with
your granddaughter-in-law?

49
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,280
Lingfeng just went missing,

50
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,310
and she's cheating with her bodyguard.

51
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,280
Gu Yashan is way out of line.

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,630
I told Lingfeng not to marry her,

53
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,560
but he was so stubborn.

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
And now

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,190
he's missing.

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,910
I think the Gus did this.

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,030
I agree.

58
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,800
I wonder what tricks

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,840
Gu Yashan played with Lingfeng.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,910
Look at her sad face

61
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,120
and her loser father.

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
Why did Lingfeng fall for her

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
and insist on marrying her?

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,510
Whether it's Gu Zetian

65
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,160
or Gu Yashan,

66
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,480
we have to cancel the partnership.

67
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,120
Grandpa, leave this to me.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,360
I'll deal with her.

69
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,510
Siyao, go home.

70
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,160
I can handle this.

71
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,870
Grandpa!
