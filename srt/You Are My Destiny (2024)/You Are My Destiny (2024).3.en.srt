1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 3=

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,580
(Mrs. Gu, Shan's Biological Mother)

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,300
(15 Years Ago)

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,520
The doctor said I was pregnant.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Really?

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,840
- That's great.
- When will you marry me?

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,390
What's the rush?

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,350
She's dying.

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,880
I don't care. Marry me.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,670
(Younger Gu Yashan)
If it wasn't for this,

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,000
why would I be your maid?

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,400
It's been so many years.

18
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,230
Shan, you're here.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,120
Who's this?

20
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,120
My bodyguard.

21
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,630
Shan.

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,680
Why did you bring

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
a bodyguard
to your dad's birthday party?

24
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,820
(Gu Yinghao, 14 Years Old)

25
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,030
(Shan's Half-brother)
Sister.

26
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,020
(Congenital Brain Damage)
Hao.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,590
Are you blind?

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,960
(She hit her again.)

29
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,400
(So cruel.)

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
Hey. Stop crying.

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,190
Let's go over there

32
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,310
and play with dinosaurs, okay?

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Let's go.

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Shan.

35
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,030
Dad.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,750
I shouldn't have said

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,630
those harsh words.

38
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,680
I know Mr. Nie well.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,030
Once Nie Lingfeng is dead,

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,120
he'll definitely kick you out.

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,200
Dad.

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,400
He's only missing, not dead.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,630
You're doing this

44
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,280
for yourself, aren't you?

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,000
I have to take care of

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,840
everything in the company.

47
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,750
The Nie Family is our biggest client,

48
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,750
and your brother is brain-damaged.

49
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,430
You have to think about his future.

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,120
Brother, I like playing with dinosaurs.

51
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,360
Yinghao is usually afraid of strangers.

52
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,470
Since he likes you,

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,310
spend more time with him.

54
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,980
Okay.

55
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,210
Come on.
