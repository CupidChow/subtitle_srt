1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 11=

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,580
(Nie Group Board of Directors)

8
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,640
(Why are there so many people?)

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,240
What's happening?

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
All bodyguards wear sunglasses.

11
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,710
Everyone,

12
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,000
you must've heard

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,040
my grandson Mr. Nie Lingfeng,

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,870
the president

15
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,350
of Nie Group,

16
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,280
has been missing for days.

17
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,280
I invited

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,480
all the shareholders here

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,070
because I wanted to tell you something.

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
Recently, our group...

21
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,620
(Lu Mengyin, A Has-been Star,
Lingfeng's Rumored Girlfriend)

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,510
Sweethearts,

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,920
after we get in,

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,510
keep an eye on that old grandpa

25
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,430
and that auntie.

26
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,350
You've seen the pictures.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,000
Can you recognize them?

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,070
Good.

30
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,000
Do as I told you.

31
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,680
If you do a good job,

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,350
you'll have a home.

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,560
If not,

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,150
I'll send you back to the orphanage,

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
understand?

36
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

37
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,150
(This must be great-grandpa.)

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,680
(I must please him.)

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,120
Great-grandpa! Great-grandpa!

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,680
I've finally met you.

41
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,030
Great-grandpa.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Are they Lingfeng's children?

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,470
(I thought that dying man)

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,870
(had a good plan.)

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,310
(It turns out he invited Lu Mengyin.)

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,960
(It's even worse.)

47
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,470
(Gu Yashan is still here,)

48
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,000
(and there's another actress.)

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,120
Come on. Get closer.

50
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
Closer.

51
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,360
- Good. Good.
- Smile. Smile.

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,520
Let me record this.

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,280
(Lu Mengyin)

54
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,280
(tried to seduce Lingfeng)

55
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,000
(to get rich a few years ago)

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,710
(but failed.)

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,360
(I can't believe)

58
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,590
(she's using the kids)

59
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,680
(to get into the family.)

60
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,710
(Isn't she ashamed?)

61
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,080
Nie Lingfeng,

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,000
you're such a troublemaker.

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
I'll definitely

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,710
divorce you.

65
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,430
Sister,

66
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,960
you know, Lingfeng and I
loved each other.

67
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,870
After he married you,

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,080
I didn't want to expose the kids.

69
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,190
However, I heard Lingfeng was missing.

70
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,910
I just want to bring them home.

71
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,430
Isn't this Ms. Lu Mengyin?

72
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,630
I know you mean no harm.

73
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,960
However, as Lingfeng's wife,

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,280
there's no way you can make me believe

75
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,190
they're Lingfeng's

76
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,840
illegitimate children.

77
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,800
Gu Yashan, what do you mean?

78
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,080
Are you saying they're not
Lingfeng's kids?

79
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,910
After all, I'm an actress.

80
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,070
Why would I do something

81
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,430
that might ruin my career?

82
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,950
You'd beg for gossip.

83
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,030
What did you say?

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,630
Nothing.

85
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,390
It occurred to me

86
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,360
that Lingfeng once told me a joke.

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,600
An unknown actress

88
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,160
tried every means to sleep with him,

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
but he rejected her

90
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,430
every single time.

91
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,800
He never

92
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,870
touched her.

93
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,360
Gu Yashan, you...
