00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 8=

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,070
Hurry, catch them!

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,800
Go!

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,150
Stop. I can't.

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,840
You're not going anywhere.

11
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,070
Go!

12
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,150
Who are you?

13
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,790
Get off me!

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Hello, I'm Ji Chenxing.

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,660
(Ji Chenxing, French-Chinese,
Emerging Painter and Designer)

16
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,430
Ji Chenxing?

17
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,270
Hello,

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm Gu Yashan, the vice president
of Nie Group.

19
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,280
I went to your gallery,

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,950
but they said you were busy.

21
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,190
Sorry,

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,230
I went out.

23
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,550
It's okay.

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,000
Nice to meet you.

25
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,070
Your Frech is good.

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,080
Hello, Mr. Ji,

27
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,310
I'm Yi Rongshu.

28
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,980
This is?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,840
Bodyguard.

30
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,750
Go to my house to treat the wound.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,560
Why were they after you?

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
I don't know.

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,310
I've been followed lately.

34
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,560
So, you hired a bodyguard, right?

35
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,270
How about this?

36
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,680
If you go to the hotel,
you'll be exposed.

37
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,520
Just stay here for now.

38
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,630
There are two kinds of bodyguards,

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
detective bodyguard

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,030
and fighter bodyguard.

41
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,800
What do you mean?

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
I get it.

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,590
You must be

44
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,750
a detective bodyguard.

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
Mr. Ji...

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,280
He hits me.

47
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,590
Mr. Ji.

48
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,030
Mr. Ji.

49
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,520
What do you think of
the exclusive cooperation?

50
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,120
If you want to get more shares,

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
just tell me.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,120
I don't like working with big companies.

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,590
So many restrictions.

54
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,750
Don't worry.

55
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,750
You'll have a great deal of autonomy.

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,910
And it will be written
into the contract.

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
But...

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,840
I like working with you.
