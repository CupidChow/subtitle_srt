1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 22=

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,960
All our materials are legally compliant.

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,320
Mr. Wang,

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,710
you have no reason to reject us, right?

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,790
Besides,

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,200
I've got

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,640
a voice recorder.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,240
You nasty woman!

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,670
It's about half an hour.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,000
Half an hour.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,280
Yashan, you have to be fine.

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,870
Who are you?

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,990
Hey!

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,950
Why didn't you run away?

20
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,870
Do you think I'd leave you alone?

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,070
Boss, we've fulfilled our mission.

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,280
We got both of them.

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,310
Find a place to finish her.

24
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,680
Don't let her run away again.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,040
Don't worry, Boss. I won't let you down.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
Little fool.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,590
So are you.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
Nie Lingfeng.

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,200
You said you fell in love with me
a long time ago.

30
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,640
Why didn't you tell me that?

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,640
I used to think

32
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,080
you were a heartless

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,030
playboy.

34
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,190
When did you find out

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,590
I was Yi Rongshu?

36
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,470
But do you know

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,630
the lollipop I got when I was 14

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,120
lit up my entire world?

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,560
After we got married,

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,030
I did everything I could
to take care of you,

41
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,630
but you didn't fall in love with me.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
Take care of me?

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,870
Madam Wang lost

44
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,750
her only cake store
because of you, okay?

45
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,360
You liked eating cakes,

46
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,870
so I bought that store.

47
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,120
You can have cakes whenever you want.

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,240
Besides,

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,360
Madam Wang knew it was for you,

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,630
and she was so happy.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,310
What about the movie theater?

52
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,430
That too.

53
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,680
You can watch movies whenever you want.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,470
Do you know

55
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,870
movie theater is a place
to gather everyone together?

56
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,150
I get it.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,640
Then I'll hire

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
some people to keep you company.

59
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,800
I've never seen anyone
expressing their love like this.

60
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,750
Since my parents died,

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,870
I've become the only hope
of Nie Group.

62
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,240
All I can do is study and train.

63
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,910
I'm surrounded by company staff.

64
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,430
I wanted to respect you

65
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,590
and wait for you to like me.

66
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,710
However,

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,910
life never worked out
as I expected it to.

68
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,910
Maybe I don't understand love.

69
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,310
Will you accept me

70
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,000
for what I am?

71
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,190
But when you kissed me,

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,310
you seemed good at it.

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
I...

74
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,750
I couldn't help myself.

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
Guys,

76
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,430
are you ready to die?

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,390
What a bummer.

78
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,480
Since I'm going to die,

79
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,360
can you tell me

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,950
who sent you?

81
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,310
I'm a man of principle.

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,870
Do you think I'll tell you?

83
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,790
Do it.
