1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 2=

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,200
What are you doing?

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,390
(Oh, no. I screwed it up.)

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,870
Grandpa.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,140
(Nie Chengyuan, Nie Lingfeng's Grandpa,
Founder of Nie Group)

11
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,310
Grandpa.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,790
I'm choosing a bodyguard.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,520
You flirtatious woman!

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,510
Grandpa.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,880
I almost died the other day.

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,640
Why can't I choose a bodyguard?

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,240
How dare you mention that?

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,390
Lingfeng has gone missing

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,320
since he saved you.

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,670
How can you do this at home?

21
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,910
Today...

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,950
I must

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,430
teach you a lesson!

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,480
I...

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,430
Good.

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,880
Good!

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,400
(Property Full Authorization Agreement)
What's this?

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,070
Where did you get that?

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,310
Did you plan

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,120
the whole thing?

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,590
(Property Full Authorization Agreement)
You want our property.

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,760
You'll never get it!

33
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,150
Shan.

34
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,760
Mr. Nie...

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
It's okay, Meng.

36
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,400
Leave us alone.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
Take it off.

38
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,760
(Still?)

39
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,230
What's your name?

40
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,990
Yi Rongshu.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,470
Disguise?
[*Homophone]

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,280
Rong for melting,

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,000
and Shu for writing.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,310
(Why does he look like)

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,910
(the person who saved me?)

46
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,360
Are you short of money?

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
My baby daughter,

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,960
(Gu Zetian, President of Gu Group)
he's disappeared for days.

49
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,590
He must've died.

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,190
Hurry up

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,840
and take over

52
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,560
Nie Group's assets.

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Dad.

54
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,560
I was kidnapped,

55
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,000
and you only care about money?

56
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,630
You're fine, aren't you?

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,910
Listen,

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,120
once Nie Lingfeng is dead,

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,400
they'll kick you out immediately.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,100
(Cheng Yingjuan, Shan's Stepmother)
Don't you remember

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
how they forced you

62
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,750
to marry him?

63
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,190
No matter how they treat me,

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,910
I must find Nie Lingfeng first.

65
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,520
You're so noble.

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,840
When they kick you out,

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
we won't keep you either.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
Useless woman,

69
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,400
you'll be homeless!
