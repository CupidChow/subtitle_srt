1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
It's your father's birthday.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,320
Come on. Cheers.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,890
Wait.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,110
I can't cheat on myself.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,340
=You Are My Destiny=

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,340
=Episode 23=

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,670
I'm a man of principle.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,280
Do you think I'll tell you?

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,160
Do it.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,350
Come on.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,630
Get him.

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,870
Stop!

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,840
Don't hit me!

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,840
How much did they pay you?

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,270
50 thousand yuan?

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,240
500.

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,670
I'll pay each of you 50 thousand yuan.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,150
- Stop! Cheng Yingjuan!
- A man of principle?

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,750
- It was Cheng Yingjuan!
- Principle?

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,960
I'm so sorry!

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,510
It's her again.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,560
Why does she want to kill me?

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,790
- Shan!
- Boss!

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,840
Shan!

25
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,070
Meng.

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,840
Boss, what's that?

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,320
Are you okay?

28
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,070
Meng.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
Nie Group failed to control the quality

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,200
of our materials

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,790
and caused losses to our property owner​​s.

32
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,870
I'd like to express
my sincere apology to everyone.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,870
We'll assume any financial

34
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,920
and legal responsibilities.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,590
I assure you

36
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,710
we've got enough loans

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,400
to afford the compensation.

38
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,840
I'd like to express

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
my gratitude to our vice president

40
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,400
Ms. Gu Yashan.

41
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,680
She's also my grandson's wife.

42
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,230
Thanks to her,

43
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,200
we got the loans in time

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,040
and had the chance

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,870
to start over.

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,590
We'd also like to...

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Friends from the media

48
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,840
(He Dafei, President of He Group)
and all walks of life,

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,240
(Third Biggest Shareholder)
on behalf of

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
the shareholders of Nie Group,

51
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,150
I announce we'll help Nie Group

52
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,840
through the crisis

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,030
and rise again!

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,960
Okay. Mr. Nie Sr., Mr. Nie,

55
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,960
thank you.

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
This is the end of the interview.

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,640
Yashan...

58
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,190
I didn't mean to hurt my daughter.

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,280
Why would I hurt my daughter?

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,960
It's all because of that vicious woman.

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,590
She's insane!

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,870
He was the one who cut corners.

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,280
After it was exposed,

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,190
he wanted to kill Nie Lingfeng.

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,590
She... She's done evil things

66
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,590
behind my back.

67
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,960
I... I don't know anything.

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Please believe me!

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,560
Gu Yashan is still alive, isn't she?

70
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,680
My son is so young.

71
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,400
He needs me!

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,680
Gu Yashan has everything.

73
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,150
My son is mentally damaged!

74
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm begging you!

75
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
Please let me go!

76
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,750
Let me go!

77
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,000
You'll have a lot of time

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to study law in jail.

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,630
By the way, here's another thing.

80
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,590
After you were arrested,

81
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,590
your son Gu Yinghao

82
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,630
didn't go to the orphanage.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,510
Gu Yashan and Nie Lingfeng
have been taking care of him.

84
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,920
He's doing well.

85
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,430
You don't need to worry.

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,480
(Lu Mengyin adopted the kids for money
and abandoned them.)

87
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,740
(All the brands
have stopped working with her.)

88
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,190
(An unknown consortium
fueled this incident,)

89
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,580
(and Lu Mengyin has been blocked
by the entire industry.)

90
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,320
(Indecent video of Xu Siyao,
the heiress of Xu Group, was leaked.)

91
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,940
(Xu Group suffered a great loss
and became a mediocre company.)

92
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,220
(President Wang was sentenced to jail for
corruption, bribery, and malpractice.)
