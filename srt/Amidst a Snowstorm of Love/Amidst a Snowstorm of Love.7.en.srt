=Episode 7=

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,079
Yiyang, my sister-in-law made these

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
just for you.

27
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,479
My wife said that

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,440
these years have been tough for you.

29
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,719
Now you're graduating

30
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,479
and settling down.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,320
It calls for a good celebration.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,919
Yeah.

33
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,640
Come on.

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,399
Cheers.

35
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,176
Cheers.

36
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,840
Dig in.

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,640
Try it.

38
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,080
How is it?

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,120
- Nice.
- Right?

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Have you ever

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,279
considered going back?

42
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,760
Yeah, that's our homeland.

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,959
Not in the next five years though.

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
We should make more money.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,359
We can't go back after a decade

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,279
and start from scratch, right?

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,919
And you?

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,279
I haven't thought about it.

49
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:57,040
Anyway, I'll be stuck with you guys.

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,040
Try the shrimp.

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,279
Let me try it.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,680
I've been living my life

53
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:10,359
just thinking about today.

54
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,439
Not willing to think
too much about tomorrow.

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,680
The more thinking, the more worry.

56
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,880
Only serves to weaken one's resolve.

57
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:25,760
But in the future,

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
I'll have to think more.

59
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,200
Sir.

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,559
I heard you were moving out.

61
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,639
Yeah, next week.

62
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,359
My teammates and coach came.

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,519
I'll join them.

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,559
Are you coming back?

65
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,136
No.

66
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,999
Are you heading home
right after the game?

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,079
Who knows when we'll meet again?

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,839
Let me get you two front tickets.

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,079
Come and watch me play.

70
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,600
No need, I'll get tickets myself.

71
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,320
You're new here.

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
I bet I have more friends here.

73
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,560
I can get good tickets.

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,919
Right.

75
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:26,269
(Be there soon.)

76
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,228
I'll head home now. See you then.

77
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:29,068
Go ahead.

78
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,188
You worked hard. Enjoy the weekend.

79
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:36,869
(She's leaving so soon.)

80
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:39,468
(That kid may not be able to date her.)

81
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:48,389
She's in the billiard room.

82
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:52,788
Tian, who are you talking to?

83
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:56,468
(Did he run into Lin Yiyang?)

84
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:09,468
This place is great. Look around.

85
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:10,028
(He's here?)

86
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,348
I'm going to extend the rent
once I get enrolled.

87
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:14,669
Give me the key.

88
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,468
I'll check upstairs.

89
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,389
I thought you weren't coming.

90
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:24,296
Just passing by.

91
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:32,168
Where are the slippers?

92
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:33,748
It's okay. No need.

93
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,748
We haven't mopped for days.

94
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:48,068
I'm not here for you.

95
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:49,948
If you can't handle this,

96
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,269
how do you go pro?

97
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:56,669
I didn't say I couldn't handle it.

98
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:00,109
Let me get you some water.

99
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:00,869
No need.

100
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,989
I'll drink.

101
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,989
Are you here to watch
the Youth Competition?

102
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:13,669
I'm here for Lin Yiyang.

103
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,188
(You spilled the beans?)

104
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:25,828
When is he coming back?

105
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:30,184
N-No idea.

106
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:32,909
Aren't you

107
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,148
very close to him?

108
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:36,072
We...

109
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,708
We are

110
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:43,148
getting along with him.

111
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,349
But he wouldn't update us
about his schedule, would he?

112
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,148
No...

113
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:50,869
Do you have his contact?

114
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:54,669
Yeah. Don't look at her.

115
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,909
She doesn't.

116
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:56,869
They're not that close.

117
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,549
(My sweet little brother)

118
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,789
(is repaying me for looking after him.)

119
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,388
Ask him when he's coming back.

120
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:07,588
Don't tell him I'm here.

121
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:09,669
Okay.

122
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:11,669
I-I'll ask him now.

123
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:12,869
I'll ask him.

124
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:21,309
Well, he may not come back this week.

125
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,388
He goes to school in another city.

126
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:24,549
Want some more?

127
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:25,789
(You're asking him for real?)

128
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,268
(I have no choice.)

129
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,429
He replied?

130
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:40,469
He's downstairs.

131
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:56,229
(Are they going to fight for real?)

132
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,549
(Come on.)

133
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:01,229
(They haven't met
since they were high school kids.)

134
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,229
(And they're still going to fight?)

135
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:05,909
(He has a temper.)

136
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:07,469
(If things go wrong,)

137
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:08,789
(stop him.)

138
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,789
(I can't.)

139
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:20,188
What's wrong?

140
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,708
Yiyang, come and meet my brother.

141
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:41,549
I'm Meng Xiaotian
and he's Meng Xiaodong.

142
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:04,429
That's so not you.

143
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,349
Don't you always button up till here?

144
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:11,588
It's hot in here. I unbuttoned it.

145
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:14,268
People may think that
you're about to fight me.

146
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:15,188
Hard to say.

147
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,029
Let me wash my face.

148
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:27,188
Save the formality.

149
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:31,388
You got me wrong.

150
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:34,188
My neck is hurting from the trip.

151
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:35,828
I'm putting ointment.

152
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,469
Wait for me if you want to talk.

153
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,549
Why are you standing here?

154
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:56,828
Have you eaten?

155
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:07,469
Well,

156
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,388
I'm a bit tired.

157
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:12,029
I'm going to take a nap.

158
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,148
Go ahead and talk.

159
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:25,588
I left something in your room.

160
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,629
You just left me out there?

161
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:31,269
It must be fine, right?

162
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,988
They can't possibly
end up fighting in there.

163
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:36,309
Let them be if they fight outside.

164
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:39,429
Nobody is going to die, right?

165
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,309
What...

166
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,192
No, it's worse if they fight outside.

167
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,708
What if someone calls the police

168
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:48,389
and gets them arrested?

169
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,988
Right, they'd better fight in the house.

170
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,228
How about this?

171
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:57,429
If they start fighting,

172
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,948
I'll rush out, hug our brother, and cry.

173
00:11:00,228 --> 00:11:02,948
Take Yiyang away
when our brother is dazed.

174
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:06,468
I will sacrifice myself for Yiyang.

175
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:09,389
Take a look.

176
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:20,509
Yin Guo.

177
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:22,789
What's wrong?

178
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:23,909
Close the door.

179
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,348
Why? Trying to say something?

180
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,309
I don't know how to put it.

181
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:43,389
Keep thinking then.

182
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,429
Can you hear them?

183
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:00,108
Ready to talk?

184
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:01,749
I'm here for you.

185
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:08,029
People keep coming for me.

186
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:09,708
Seriously.

187
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,188
You should keep yourselves occupied.

188
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:16,309
What is it?

189
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:18,708
I haven't heard from you for years.

190
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:21,149
It wouldn't cross my mind

191
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,749
that you'd be here
hadn't it been for Xiaotian.

192
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,588
You quit playing.

193
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:35,068
Isn't it a pity?

194
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:40,588
Next subject.

195
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:42,269
What else

196
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:45,188
is there to talk about?

197
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:49,988
You've got a temper, huh?

198
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,348
I'm talking to you

199
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:55,549
just to be polite, okay?

200
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:06,749
Nothing.

201
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:11,909
It's so hot.

202
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:17,669
Why is a world champion

203
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,909
picking on a nobody like me?

204
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:23,188
Self-mockery?

205
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,909
What happened to your pride?

206
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,429
I'm a grown-up now.

207
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:32,468
What pride?

208
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,108
That's it.

209
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:40,228
I don't mind dining out
with an old acquaintance.

210
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,108
But I'm not interested

211
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,149
in reminiscence.

212
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:45,228
Okay.

213
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:47,749
My sister, then.

214
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:53,828
Maybe I should call Grandma.

215
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:56,828
Let's not disturb Grandma just yet.

216
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:04,588
Nice tactic.

217
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:05,988
I'm not dumb.

218
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:08,669
So I was right?

219
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,588
Meng Xiaodong, don't be a child.

220
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:12,948
I finally got something on you.

221
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:15,269
Feels great.

222
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:17,909
There is a billiard room

223
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:19,309
nearby.

224
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:21,789
Let me see if

225
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,228
you're qualified

226
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:25,828
to be one of the pursuers

227
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:27,592
of my sister.

228
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,068
You don't have to
find excuses to play snooker

229
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:32,348
with me.

230
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,429
See you later.

231
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,029
Put on a shirt.

232
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,509
I don't play with someone
in sloppy clothes.

233
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,549
Still so cocky.

234
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:03,269
That hasn't changed.

235
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:06,348
I think he's gone.

236
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:08,828
Let me see.

237
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:09,384
Okay.

238
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:17,269
He's gone?

239
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,920
Yeah.

240
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:30,629
He didn't do anything to you, right?

241
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:36,429
Just a second. I'm changing.

242
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:44,828
Changing?

243
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:07,909
I haven't worn this
for snooker for ages.

244
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:15,389
Is it a bit weird?

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,669
No.

246
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:19,988
N-No.

247
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:23,629
The collar is folded.

248
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:38,749
It's fine now.

249
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:50,909
Your brother invited me to play,
so come by if you want.

250
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:52,588
Otherwise,

251
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:55,348
just stay.

252
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:58,269
We won't take long.

253
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:11,149
Yiyang left as well?

254
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,429
He said he'd

255
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:15,848
play snooker with Xiaodong.

256
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,149
I brought a friend.

257
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:21,029
Go ahead. Your room's vacant.

258
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:22,629
Lin, Lin.

259
00:17:23,068 --> 00:17:25,068
Your girlfriend works really hard.

260
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:26,509
She comes here every day.

261
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:30,629
Yeah, she's going
to participate in a tournament.

262
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,269
A global one.

263
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,149
Impressive.

264
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,416
This one?

265
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:46,509
You know me.

266
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,909
Unless I retire or change my profession,

267
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:51,629
I won't play Nine-Ball.

268
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,948
I'm very loyal to my career.

269
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:56,068
I haven't played snooker

270
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,389
with anyone since I quit the club.

271
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:08,868
Snooker on the table of Nine-Ball.

272
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:10,669
We'll each take a step back.

273
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:12,029
Get the cue sticks.

274
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:18,108
Same old rule.

275
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:19,549
Flip the coin.

276
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:21,228
You're a guest.

277
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:23,068
You go first.

278
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:26,108
Then you're bound to lose.

279
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:30,309
Hey, guys.

280
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,588
We need a snooker referee here.

281
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:36,228
As soon as I arrive, I hear you call.

282
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,149
Do me a favor.

283
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,429
We need someone to keep score.

284
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:40,988
Lucky I am here.

285
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:41,789
Thanks, man.

286
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:50,309
It's my first time playing like this.

287
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:51,669
You'll get used to it.

288
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,152
Hey, Lin.

289
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:00,908
Who's your friend?

290
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:07,428
Meng Xiaodong?

291
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:09,628
Yeah, I'm Meng Xiaodong.

292
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,108
A famous person.

293
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:15,789
A true celebrity we have here today.

294
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:20,108
Hey, everybody, listen up.

295
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,909
A big big snooker star
is in the house today.

296
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:25,989
He has won the world championships.

297
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:26,989
Come on, come on.

298
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:28,908
It's a pity if you miss this.

299
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:58,269
Yin, we have a world champion here.

300
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,148
Yeah, I know.

301
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:33,428
Trying to let me win?

302
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:09,789
Everyone. Free beer from my boss.

303
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:17,160
Want some?

304
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:18,509
Some water, please.

305
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:20,949
Get some water for him.

306
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,148
Okay.

307
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:45,029
Who is he?

308
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,068
He's

309
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:50,789
an old friend.

310
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,029
Your girlfriend is outside.

311
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:57,309
Okay, thanks.

312
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:08,949
(You're here?)

313
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:12,388
(I told him not to tell you)

314
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:14,588
(until you're done.)

315
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:18,148
(We're done.)

316
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:21,828
(So fast?)

317
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,560
(Who won?)

318
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:31,668
Are we done here?

319
00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:33,749
Can't you be serious?

320
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:34,828
It's not over.

321
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:37,108
So tiring.

322
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,388
I didn't come all the way back

323
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:40,668
to play snooker with you.

324
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,709
Come with me.

325
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:44,549
We booked a hotel.

326
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:49,749
Maybe not today.

327
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:52,428
It's getting dark and I haven't packed.

328
00:23:52,628 --> 00:23:53,269
Tomorrow.

329
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:55,749
Walk me out.

330
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:02,216
What?

331
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:06,029
You never asked for that.

332
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,949
You wouldn't want anyone
to disrupt your training.

333
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:10,469
What happened today?

334
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:12,509
You never overthink like this.

335
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:18,148
Who's led you astray?

336
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:20,828
Let's go.

337
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:34,309
Let me get you a cab.

338
00:24:34,588 --> 00:24:35,628
No need. I'll take the metro.

339
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:39,068
I'm hungry. Wait for me.

340
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:41,868
Eat at the hotel...

341
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:45,068
One hotdog.

342
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:00,108
You never have street food.

343
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,549
Why are you acting weird today?

344
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,148
People are complicated.

345
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:11,989
Back then,

346
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,509
a girl blocked Lin Yiyang
in the locker room.

347
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:15,949
I helped him out.

348
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:18,309
Vivid memories.

349
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:24,828
He was so popular?

350
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:28,229
Kind of. Not so much popular as me.

351
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,148
What's wrong?

352
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:35,148
Why is it spicy?

353
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:37,549
You didn't ask him to make it non-spicy.

354
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:40,789
He asked but I didn't pay attention.

355
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,469
Never mind. I can't waste it.

356
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,549
Stop eating.

357
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:46,189
It's okay.

358
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:47,549
You can't handle spice at all.

359
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,549
Are you going to marry him?

360
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:04,749
He's a nice guy. Poor family, though.

361
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,056
No parents.

362
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:07,949
That's not a problem.

363
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:09,348
I can make your parents

364
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:10,549
accept that.

365
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:13,509
He lost his parents?

366
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:16,309
W-Wait.

367
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:20,269
Why did you mention my parents?

368
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:22,108
Try harder.

369
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,348
Lure him back home.

370
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:26,189
You got us wrong.

371
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:28,108
We're not there yet.

372
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:32,628
W-We're not really a couple.

373
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,989
Our career life lasts long.

374
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:39,309
He can easily

375
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,229
play until he reaches 40.

376
00:26:42,388 --> 00:26:43,549
He's only 27.

377
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,108
It's his prime time.

378
00:26:45,828 --> 00:26:46,749
He has many chances.

379
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:48,712
Guo.

380
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:50,749
Make him come home.

381
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:53,320
You'll see

382
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:55,789
how talented he is.

383
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,108
We trained hard together back then.

384
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:04,549
There were so many players.

385
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:07,068
Only a few remained.

386
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:10,229
It's so good

387
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:12,628
to see him again.

388
00:27:15,588 --> 00:27:16,709
You found a good boyfriend.

389
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,709

390
00:27:20,828 --> 00:27:21,549
Xiaodong.

391
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,668
I can guarantee that he's a decent guy.

392
00:27:24,628 --> 00:27:25,549
You got us wrong.

393
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:26,749
Get married.

394
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:27,976
Xiaodong.

395
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:28,872
Alright.

396
00:27:29,908 --> 00:27:31,949
Come and join us at the hotel.

397
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:35,628
See you.

398

You arrived earlier than last week.

404
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:06,549
I was eager to see you.

405
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:15,828

561

562
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:49,789

I can get you something
if you're hungry.

568
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,309
No need. I'm not.

569
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:45,269
It's his mentor.

570
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:47,789
They talk for at least two hours
every time.

571
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:50,988
It's fine. I'm not waiting for him.

572
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:10,749
I have no idea.

573
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:42,629
What are you looking for? Need help?

574
00:42:42,948 --> 00:42:45,229
I got a sprain during the training.

575
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,028
Found it. Thanks.
