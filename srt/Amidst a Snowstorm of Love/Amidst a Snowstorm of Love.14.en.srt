=Episode 14=

25
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,160
Is Lin Yiyang inside?

26
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,520
Yes, he is.

27
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,559
That cake...

28
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
That cake will be stale soon.

29
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,519
You deliver it to Guo right now.

30
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,919
Don't tell her I'm drunk.

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,600
(I don't care about the cake.)

32
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,680
(I'm worried about you.)

33
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,880
Didn't you hear me?

34
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,512
(Why are you so good to me?)

35
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:40,079
(We just got together.)

36
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,200
(Don't you know
how to play hard to get?)

37
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,760
(You're wasting your pretty face.)

38
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,040
(You treat me so well like a fool.)

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,799
(You fool, I feel bad for you.)

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,400
Got it. I'll eat it right away.

41
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,200
Why did you drink so much alcohol?

42
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,119
Didn't anyone stop you?

43
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:35,720
What's wrong? I'm here.

44
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,000
Right now,

45
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,320
am I in your heart?

46
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,480
Lin Yiyang.

47
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,000
Slow down.

48
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,160
What on earth is going on?

49
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
He looked happy when leaving.

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,799
Eat the cake.

51
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,119
What cake?

52
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,480
He suddenly ran out of the hotel
in the middle of the night.

53
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,440
He wanted to buy you a cake.

54
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,119
But the shop was closed.

55
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,600
When Jiang Yang and I rushed over,

56
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,480
he sat in the corner outside the shop,

57
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,000
falling asleep against the wall,

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,599
like a vagrant.

59
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,360
After being woken up, he did one thing.

60
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,320
He shoved his phone into my hand

61
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,159
and asked me to buy a cake.

62
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,320
He thought the shop was open.

63
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,680
They are all signature cakes.

64
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Just pretend I bought it
and you've already eaten.

65
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,519
I bought many beers.

66
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,440
I didn't buy expensive beers
with his credit card.

67
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,079
The total cost

68
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,839
of these beers is less than that
of the one he bought you before.

69
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Lin Yiyang really cares about you.

70
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,279
It's more than that.
He did a lot for you secretly.

71
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,800
Previously, to invite you to a meal,

72
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,479
he played a game for someone.

73
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,800
Do you remember? He played for you.

74
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
For me?

75
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:31,680
You went to his school,
but he happened not to be there.

76
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,639
He asked his classmate
to take care of you and Xiaotian.

77
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,839
In return, he played a game for someone.

78
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,240
My classmate lost a game
to them last month.

79
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,880
He asked me to win back the game.

80
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,320
He must be your good friend.

81
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,000
Not really. I wanted to treat someone
to a meal but had no money or time.

82
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,920
This game is a condition of exchange.

83
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,800
So you mean...

84
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,159
Yes. You know how proud he is.

85
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,079
Nobody can order him to play pool.

86
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,800
But he did it for you.

87
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:27,479
Why did Lin Yiyang stop playing pool?

88
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,320
For a professional player,
it's normal to fall into the slump.

89
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,599
He was too sharp and arrogant before.

90
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,039
Suddenly, he lost several matches
in a row, hitting rock bottom.

91
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,440
Rumors quickly spread
that he took money to throw games.

92
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,680
Later, in a competition,

93
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,479
he had a conflict with the referee.

94
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,680
He was suspended for six months.

95
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,064
My coach asked him to apologize,
but he refused.

96
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,240
Out of anger, my coach kicked him out.

97
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,599
Actually, we all understand

98
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,880
the moment he left Dongxin City,
he had already given up.

99
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,039
After so many years,

100
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,200
we still feel sad when talking about it.

101
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,760
But he did make a mistake.

102
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,279
Despite all these years,

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,920
he hasn't given himself a chance
to turn back.

104
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,760
I have a match tomorrow. I gotta go.

105
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,159
You take care of him.

106
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,120
I'll see him after the game.

107
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,479
No problem.

108
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm leaving. I'll be back soon.

109
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,120
See you.

110
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,320
Guo, why are you not asleep?

111
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,280
Are you nervous about tomorrow's match?

112
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:10,640
Yes.

113
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,400
You are always calm.

114
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,520
How come you are nervous?

115
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,959
Relax. Have a good rest.

116
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,079
My boyfriend was an excellent player.

117
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,200
So, I need to be better than him.

118
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:36,239
Yin Guo, the player from China,
is the first to secure her place in the final.

119
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,560
The final starts at 11 AM.

120
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,280
Both finalists are from China.

121
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,239
A word of advice, eat less.

122
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,719
An upset stomach might affect your game.

123
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,040
Thanks. I look forward to our game.

124
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,839
Me too.

125
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,239
So, are you nervous?

126
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm good. No matter what,
at least the champion is Chinese.

127
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,959
Good for you. You are so calm.

128
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,879
I'll see you on the field.

129
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,400
I'll be there.

130
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:38,759
How's your mindset?

131
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,759
Don't worry. I feel good now.

132
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,719
I'll keep your phone for you.

133
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,999
I've muted it. I'll put it on the chair.

134
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:52,759
If your son gives you a call,
I'll answer it for you.

135
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,119
Thanks a lot.

136
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,216
Go for it.

137
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,560
Now entering is Yin Guo from China.

138
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,152
Entrant now is Liu Xiran from China.

139
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:22,719
It is another final
between two Chinese players.

140
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,200
In the semi-final,

141
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,999
we introduced Liu Xiran, a veteran

142
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,440
returning to the game
after many years of retirement.

143
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,879
She's trying to get the prize money
to raise her child.

144
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,200
She's a solo player without a coach.

145
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,800
It's already

146
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,239
a miracle comeback
for her to reach the final.

147
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,280
Dear guests and everyone joining us
for the live broadcast.

148
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,839
The final of the Women's Nine-Ball
Open Championship now begins.

149
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,920
Come on.

150
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,479
You too.

151
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,160
Ready.

152
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,359
Three, two, one, go.

153
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,400
You're awake.

154
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm worried about you.

155
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:08,999
You became silly?

156
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:13,959
Oh, no. What happened?

157
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:24,552
Lin Yiyang.

158
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,400
Do you know how much you drank?

159
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,119
You drank almost two bottles.

160
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,759
I fed you medicine three times
for your hangover.

161
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,920
I think it doesn't work

162
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,839
after drinking.

163
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:48,400
I know, but I had no choice.

164
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,400
You threw up the medicine.

165
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,839
I had to make you drink more water.

166
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,560
Why did you drink so much?

167
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,320
To drown my sorrows.

168
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,759
I met many old friends,

169
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,719
bringing back

170
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
many memories.

171
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,359
My dad told me
people don't get drunk in a good mood.

172
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,479
Your dad is right.

173
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,839
But,

174
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,959
I can't always drink to forget.

175
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,280
The past is the past.

176
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,879
So, you've decided to let it go?

177
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,920
Yeah.

178
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,999
Do you remember you took a shower?

179
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,440
Sort of.

180
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,599
Do you remember you ate noodles?

181
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:37,800
Did I?

182
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,959
Do you remember what we did?

183
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:52,599
We

184
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,039
did something?

185
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,519
No, not really.

186
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:44,440
Tell me. I want to know.

187
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
I was just kidding.

188
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,920
I was kidding.

189
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,959
I know.

190
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,440
What day is it?

191
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,479
It's noon on Sunday.

192
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,319
The game is over?

193
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,840
The runner-up. I lost to Liu Xiran.

194
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,959
Win her next time.

195
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:11,944
Get some rest. I will take you
to watch the sunrise later.

196
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:13,360
Watch the sunrise?

197
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,920
Now it's noon. Where is the sunrise?

198
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,239
Not here.

199
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,880
We'll go to an island.

200
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Are you serious?

201
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,479
Of course, I had already booked it
before the competition.

202
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,120
But how did you get my passport number?

203
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,600
Xiaotian told me.

204
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,479
Go get ready.

205
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,920
Just grab some clothes.

206
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,959
I've prepared everything we need.

207
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,036

You can sleep more.

242
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:00,959

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,920
I realize

248
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,600
that sometimes, you can tug at my heart.

249
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,279
Will you treat others like this?

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,200

So what?

254
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,559
It's gloomy.

255
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:00,360
Will it be foggy later?

256
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,479
No, the sun will come out soon.

257
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,279
How do you know?

258
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,360
I checked the app.

259
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,319
Put on warmer clothes.

260
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,640
It'll be cold on the mountain.

261
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,208
I'll get it for you.

262
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,120
How about we go on?

263
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
You seem energetic.

264
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,640
Make it to the summit?

265
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:54,824
Sure.

266
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,759
The sun really came out.

267
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:25,239
Yes, it seems we are very lucky.

268
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,039
So beautiful.

269
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,360
So beautiful. How high is it?

270
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,559
4,300.

271
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,799
What? And the place our plane landed?

272
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,840
Over 2,000, I guess.

273
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,680
So, if we drive down from here,

274
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,279
will we experience winter and summer?

275
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,239
I guess so.

276
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,440
It's one of the famous
astronomical observation places.

277
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:28,600
Due to its high latitude, observers see
the stars of the northern hemisphere.

278
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,039
You can see more than 80 percent
in the southern hemisphere

279
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,120
At night, when looking up,

280
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,160
you'll see the galaxy really closely

281
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,039
as if you could touch it.

282
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:44,920
Really? Right here? With a telescope?

283
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,704
No need for that.

284
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,559
You can see it anywhere on the island.

285
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,080
If you're an astronomy enthusiast,
you'll need a telescope.

286
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Or go to the visitor center,

287
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
and you can use the telescopes there.

288
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,064
Your head ache?

289
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:15,400
I'm okay. It's a bit hard to breathe.

290
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:19,719
But no worries. It also happened
when I visited Jiuzhaigou.

291
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,719
I'll be fine when we go downhill.

292
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,999
I'll go to buy something.

293
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,360
Wait for me here.

294
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,719
If you get cold, get in the car.

295
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,279
Turn up the heater. Don't catch a cold.

296
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,352
Okay.

297
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,160
What did you buy?

298
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,519
Snacks and coffee.

299
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,400
Put it on the cup holder for me.

300
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,880
Wait a moment. I'll be right back.

301
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,160
Okay.

302
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,319
It's cold.

303
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,400
Are we going?

304
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,752
Yes.

305
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,680
Put it on.

306
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,200
Why?

307
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:29,999
Check the time.

308
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,920
Within three hours,
we'll reach a place you like.

309
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,719
You're mysterious.

310
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,464
Are you hot?

311
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,880
There's a gas station down the hill.

312
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Let's fill up the tank
and then change into summer clothes

313
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,104
Okay.

314
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,959
2 hours and 37 minutes?

315
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,400
You drove so fast. It's my first time

316
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,680
coming all the way down from an altitude
of over 4,000 meters.

317
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,880
Let's go. I'll take you to have fun.

318
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:52,680
What are you holding?

319
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:54,120
Ice cream?

320
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,479
I planned to rent a pickup.

321
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,039
I can load it with snow and take it
to the beach for you to make a snowman.

322
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,799
But I changed my mind.

323
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:07,200
First, there's not much snow
on the mountain peak.

324
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:10,680
Second, loading a car
with snow is detectable.

325
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,160
If you find it in advance,
it won't be a surprise.

326
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,640
I didn't get much snow. Just for fun.

327
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,288
Come on.

328
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,360
Right, the snow will melt soon.

329
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,440
You help me pile it up
and make a snowman.

330
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,719
What if it melts?

331
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:41,920
