A car is coming. I gotta go.

26
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,239
Please. If someone sees us,
my family will know we're dating.

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,559
Stay two more minutes, okay?

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,359
What are you doing? Stop it.

29
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,080
What if we are discovered? Behave.

30
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,760
Xiaodong, why are you still here?

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,359
Just work stuff. Could I see the person
in charge of women's Nine-Ball?

32
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:04,799
Okay.

33
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,359
You go to the meeting room.

34
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,040
Xiaodong, bye.

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,639
Xiaodong, bye.

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,159
Lin Lin, Xiaodong is looking for you.

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,999
Xiaodong.

38
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,639
You two talk. I'm leaving now, bye.

39
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,240
Practice hard.

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,824
Okay.

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,439
What's up?

42
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,040
How has Jiang Yang been doing recently?

43
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,559
Why are you asking me about him?

44
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:40,719
I saw you driving his car here.

45
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,559
I realize I haven't seen you
for a long time.

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,880
We just saw each other at the airport
a few days ago, remember?

47
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,880
You have something for me?

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,200
Yes.

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,680
Speak up.

50
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,239
It's about Guo and Lin Yiyang.

51
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,839
Aren't they good?

52
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,160
Guo's mom was the referee
for that match.

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,720
She has a bad impression of Yiyang.

54
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,440
Later, Mr. He pleaded on his behalf
to reduce his suspension.

55
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,600
This makes things difficult now.

56
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,440
You do care a lot about the guys
from Dongxin City.

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,799
Don't be silly.
If I don't, should I care about you?

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Anyway, I got it. We'll talk later.

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,959
Yang lent you his car.
What will he drive?

60
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,560
Why do you care about his car?

61
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:56,040
Do you think something is going on
between me and Jiang Yang?

62
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,280
No, I bet you're not interested in him.

63
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,919
That's hard to say. After all,
Jiang Yang is the boss of Dongxin City.

64
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,760
He's not bad compared to you.

65
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,000
Lin Lin.

66
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,839
Alright, gotta go.

67
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,040
Drive safely, especially on the highway.

68
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,320
Okay, got it.

69
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,079
Good luck.

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,720
Thanks.

71
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,280
I wish you luck in beating Xiaodong.

72
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,959
That depends on his skills.

73
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,720
Xiaodong, I'm going in.

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,600
Practice hard.

75
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,240
Okay.

76
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,920
Nice car. Give me a lift.

77
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,320
Didn't you drive?

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,440
I just saw you,
so I had the driver take the car back.

79
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,279
You have a driver
and still want to ride in my car?

80
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,479
I'll stop by your place on the way.

81
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,832
Coming.

82
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,279
Lin Lin.

83
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,760
Are you packed?

84
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,200
I just finished it.

85
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,519
Your roommate is away?

86
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,159
She went to the dorm next door

87
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,440
This is the new training plan
for you two.

88
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,399
Okay.

89
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,279
Remind her to read when she gets back.

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,159
There's something else I want to say.

91
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,839
Sure, sit here.

92
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,639
What's the matter?

93
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,599
It's not a big deal. Duncuo and you...

94
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,880
We are still in a secret relationship.

95
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,399
I understand. Xiaodong just told me

96
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,159
that Duncuo will have a long way
to go before winning

97
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,000
your family's approval.

98
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,479
Yeah, and I think

99
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,800
if others keep talking about it,

100
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
it won't be good for our training.

101
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,279
You just met with Xiaodong, right?

102
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,399
He just came over.

103
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:06,120
I saw him.

104
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
Alright, there's training tomorrow.
You should rest early.

105
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm leaving.

106
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,440
Okay, see you tomorrow.

107
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,959
See you.

108
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:22,800
Bye.

109
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,479
Go to sleep now.

110
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,072
Good night.

111
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,079
Lin Yiyang, can I ask you something?

112
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,312
(Go ahead.)

113
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,440
I just wanted to ask you

114
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
if Lin Lin ever liked anyone
besides Xiaodong.

115
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,200
(No.)

116
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,079
Lin Yiyang, you pulled over
to text back. Who is it?

117
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,800
Who else could it be? Guo's inquiring
about you and your ex-girlfriend.

118
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:35,440
We've broken up.
What does she want to know? Drive.

119
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Alright, I'm going to park. You go up
to the third floor. Jiang Yang is there.

120
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,680
Jiang Yang is there?

121
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
I won't go.
You drive me back to Bei City.

122
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,159
Did you two have a fight?

123
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,479
I never argue with others.

124
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,479
Alright, go right now. If I stop longer,
I'll get a ticket. Quick.

125
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,640
Perfect timing. Eat with me.

126
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,040
I don't eat anything after 10:00 PM.

127
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,119
To stay in shape?
You're handsome enough.

128
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,160
On guard?

129
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,239
What's going on?

130
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,800
He seems to be irritated by someone.

131
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,200
I just don't want to eat.

132
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,520
Back then in Hel, we used to drink
and eat together at midnight, didn't we?

133
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,912
Let's skip the drinking.
A competition is coming up.

134
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,759
No alcohol for a month.
Let's have soft drinks instead.

135
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,640
Our recent performances are similar.
Are you mad about that?

136
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,879
My people are not at their best.

137
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,719
Otherwise, you can't catch up.

138
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,999
Big talk. You're more confident
than the former leader of Bei City.

139
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,440
Stop arguing.

140
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,680
Do you want me to lead you over?

141
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,720
Thank you.

142
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,999
Oh, right,
I saw Lin Lin driving your car.

143
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,079
Wasn't her car broken down?

144
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,719
Exactly, it's just been fixed.
I lent my car to her.

145
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,440
You didn't even check it
before letting her drive on the highway?

146
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,599
You two came back together?

147
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,599
I understand now.

148
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,800
What?

149
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,024
I don't drink.

150
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,800
Have you got the wrong idea
because Lin Lin drove my car?

151
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,800
Lin Lin and I have known each other
for over ten years.

152
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,359
If possible, I would be with her.

153
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,079
Tell him what I did this afternoon.

154
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,280
He was on a blind date.

155
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,920
I guessed right.

156
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,200
Enough.

157
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,560
Do you still like Lin Lin?

158
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,239
I knew it.

159
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,239
Come on. You read this.

160
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,239
I've read it. What else should I know?

161
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,839
After all, it's no small matter.
Read it again.

162
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,200
As I said, I'll cover the larger amount,
and you cover the smaller one.

163
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,680
Even brothers are cautious about money.

164
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,800
Aren't we closer than identical twins?

165
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,280
Then we should be more cautious.

166
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,999
We are adults, you know.

167
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,879
Good friends don't involve money.
Otherwise, no good friends.

168
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:35,920
You've changed, really.

169
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,239
How many then?

170
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,239
You need to sign seven copies.

171
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,119
I just returned, so I'm not familiar
with the house-buying process.

172
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,879
You take care of it
and make them deliver the house sooner.

173
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,560
Understood.

174
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,119
And before the transfer,
try not to let the coach find out.

175
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,479
They say life is fickle,
but the years are ruthless.

176
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,119
when fulfilling filial duties,

177
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:23,999
we will realize how fast time passes.

178
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,968
If I could come back earlier,

179
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,040
at least I could have bought this house.

180
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:45,448
(Commodity Housing Contract)

181
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,680
Are you getting married?
Why did you buy a house?

182
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,119
Let your mom sign on the last page.

183
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:01,999
Don't tell your dad.

184
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:09,192
The six of us bought it for our coach.

185
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,599
You kidding? My dad won't accept it.

186
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,879
Let me finish, please.

187
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,079
The seniors didn't catch a good time,

188
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,560
so they retired
before the industry took off.

189
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,479
Lin Yiyang and I are lucky
to catch the good times.

190
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,079
Lin Yiyang and I bought this house
in full, half each.

191
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,160
The seniors didn't contribute money,
but they were witnesses.

192
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,520
It's no big deal.
After all, we can earn money.

193
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,839
You and Yiyang have indeed done well.

194
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,719
But what you earn is yours.

195
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,839
There's no need to give my dad this.

196
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,160
It was Yiyang's idea.

197
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,520
He also said

198
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,599
it was a tacky but substantial gift.

199
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,999
Well, take it back.

200
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:57,999
I haven't finished yet.

201
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,560
You hear me out.

202
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:06,839
My dad doesn't value this kind of stuff.

203
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:13,320
Do you know he misses Yiyang?

204
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,280
I do.

205
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,759
So instead of giving me this,

206
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,999
you might as well persuade him
to see my dad.

207
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:28,599
He has his plans. Maybe he wants

208
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,680
to clinch the championship this time

209
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,560
and return home in glory.

210
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:39,148
(Snooker China Open)

211
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,260
(Snooker China Open)

212
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:25,879
No coach?

213
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,719
How do you feel about playing
against Xiaodong in the first frame?

214
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,320
It's alright.

215
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,876
(Snooker China Open)

216
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,200
My family has been talking about you.

217
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,400
About what?

218
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,880
My aunt is very rigid, much like Mr. He.

219
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,799
Winning means nothing to her.

220
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,120
I'm not surprised. I understand
she will not change her opinion of me

221
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,840
just because my ranking is high now.

222
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,999
I don't believe a successful man

223
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,640
equals a good man.

224
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,239
I do believe
the victor reigns supreme on the field,

225
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,880
but I don't believe it in society.

226
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:36,519
Me too.

227
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,559
It's useless to say sweet words

228
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,279
to make others see me differently.

229
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,600
Smart people observe how others act

230
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
instead of listening to them.

231
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,719
Glad to hear that.

232
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,959
When I made my comeback
in the first match,

233
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,319
no one backstage knew me.

234
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,239
Back then, I wanted to talk to someone.

235
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,400
The first one I thought of was Guo.

236
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:38,519
I called her
and didn't tell her where I was.

237
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,600
I told her I wanted to play matches.

238
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,239
She was happy to hear that.

239
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,400
I told her
that if I didn't achieve good results,

240
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,120
the future might be messy.

241
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,799
Guess what she said?

242
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,039
What did she say?

243
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:12,799
She said when I pursued her,
I was a poor student,

244
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,160
and she was a common player.

245
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,120
Things couldn't be worse than that.

246
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:23,479
In the end, she said

247
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,120
she was ranked third in the world.

248
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,719
At worst,

249
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,999
I am the boyfriend
of the 3rd-ranked player.

250
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,719
Guo is a treasure. You're lucky

251
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,559
to have you.

252
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,360
I didn't expect to play against you
in the first round.

253
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,519
Xiaodong, come on.

254
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,959
Yiyang, good luck.

255
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:15,999
Come on.

256
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,352
Let's go.

257
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,120
Thank you.

258
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,719
Place your bets. Let's see who will win.

259
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,400
Meng Xiaodong? Or Lin Yiyang?

260
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:38,640
How is the game going?

261
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,160
It hasn't started yet.
Do you want to join us?

262
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,640
Please come and sit.

263
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,360
Okay.

264
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,519
I've been expecting this match.

265
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,680
I rushed out and forgot my phone.

266
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,440
It's about to start.

267
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,719
Dear audience

268
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,600
and those who're watching online,

269
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,680
welcome you to follow the live broadcast

and focus on the first round
of the Snooker China Open.

271
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,840
Today, six Chinese players are qualified
for this match.

272
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,920
(First, we would like to introduce
to everyone the head referee.)

273
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,759
(Yin Junsong, an international referee
from China. Welcome him with applause.)

274
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,400
Welcome Yin Junsong.

275
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Alright, next up,

(Snooker China Open)
Two Chinese players will come.

277
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,840
The first to enter is Lin Yiyang.

278
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,799
Welcome Lin Yiyang.

279
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,759
(Live Snooker China Open)
(Welcome Lin Yiyang.)

280
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,959
(The next is Meng Xiaodong from China.)

281
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,239
Welcome him.

282
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,959
Welcome Meng Xiaodong.

283
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,759
Both players are ready for the match.

284
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,136
I believe
everyone is familiar with them.

285
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:28,719
Yes, indeed.

286
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,600
Meng Xiaodong has brought a lot of glory
to our country.

287
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,039
And Lin Yiyang has won many victories

288
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,400
over the past year.

289
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,160
The two Chinese players met
in the first round,

290
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,160
attracting great attention.

291
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,360
(Live Snooker China Open)
(I believe they will be impressive,)

292
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,559
(living up to expectations.)

293
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:48,160
(Yes, I am also looking forward to it.)

294
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,160
(I would like to remind you all.)

295
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,920
(To create a good atmosphere
for the game,)

296
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,600
please do not walk around
during the match.

297
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,999
Also, please set your mobile phones
to silent mode.

298
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,080
And when you take photos,

299
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,959
please take off your flash.

300
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,519
The match is about to start.
Have a good time.

301
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,360
Lin Yiyang, your coach came today.

302
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,840
He told him that I was here?

303
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,479
I guess so.

304
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,279
Director, please give us a shot
of the audience.

305
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,279
Now on camera,

306
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,200
(you'll see He Wenfeng, the founder
of Dongxin City Billiards Club.)

307
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,239
(He was a coach for the national team.)

308
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,519
(He has trained
many outstanding snooker players,)

309
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,759
(including Lin Yiyang,
who is currently on the field,)

310
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:49,320
and Jiang Yang,
who will be present later.

311

(Live Snooker China Open)

312
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:08,319
Okay, dear friends,
amidst your attention and anticipation,

313
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,640
the match officially begins.

314
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:14,559
Frame one, Lin Yiyang, to break.

315
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,600
(Lin Yiyang is coached by He Wenfeng.)

316
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,784
(Unfortunately, he left his coach
very early.)

317
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,759
(But today, I can tell
he never forgot his coach.)

318
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,640
(Yes. His experiences are interesting.)

319
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,200
(He's lived abroad for many years.)

320
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,672
(And we thought he would not return.)

321
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:35,319
(Live Snooker China Open)
(Unexpectedly,)

322
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,920
(he's returned to the field
of the China Open.)

323
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:41,880
(Yes, it is said that after this match,)

324
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,680
(he plans to stay.)

325
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,479
Jiang Yang and Meng Xiaodong
will lose their positions.

326
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:50,920
He's both calculating and talented.

327
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,999
His bow has earned him points.

328
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,600
He has won so much prize money
as soon as he returned.

329
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,959
He's trying to get the prize money.

330
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,080
The prize money
for competitions abroad is substantial.

331
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,559
The Nine-Ball game is centered in Asia

332
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,279
where top players exist.

333
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,360
Even if he wants to play,
he won't make the cut.

334
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,200
This year's dark horse.

335
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,640
He won the Hangzhou game.
Do you remember him?

336
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,920
All right, guys.
The competition starts this afternoon.

337
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,640
It's a mixed-team game.

338
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,759
Lin Lin.

339
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:48,799
Lin Lin. Miss Lin.

340
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,440
What's up?

341
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,279
Nothing. I have the medicine you want.

342
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,400
I put it in your dorm.

343
00:28:58,999 --> 00:28:59,840
Thanks.

344
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,360
I gotta go.

345
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,479
You can talk now.

346
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,880
About this afternoon's competition,

347
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,479
can we choose our own opponents?

348
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,840
Who's your opponent?

349
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:21,039
If I play a match with Lin Yiyang,
he can't beat me.

350
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,920
Just for the money.

351
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,239
You're sure to win.

352
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,039
Good. He just told me that his opponents
were weak and wanted a rival

353
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,160
of equal strength.

354
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,160
Male and female players can only play
against each other during training.

355
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,680
I'm rooting for you.

356
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:08,559
You first.

357
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,600
Yin Guo's opponent is one
of the top players.

358
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,799
Yin Guo was the runner-up
at last year's world championship

359
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,808
and the champion of the Hangzhou game.

360
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:44,759
She's a key trainee
of the national team, as good as him.

(Wide learning and Be Cautious)

363
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:13,160
Playing fast balls? It's more exciting
than the competition.

364
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,759
(Live Snooker China Open)
(The match is played best 6 of 11 games.)

365
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,400
(Lin Yiyang has taken the match point.)

366
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,080
(The score is 73 to 0.)

367
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,519
(Even if Meng Xiaodong gets the chance
to clear the table now,)

368
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,519
(he still needs to play two snookers
to overtake.)

369
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,279
(Lin Yiyang will win
by playing in the black ball.)

370
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:57,228

371

372
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,239
(Nice shot.)

373
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,360
(Lin Yiyang successfully
scattered the red balls.)

374
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,000
Good.

376
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,256
Great.

377

378
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:47,160
(Live Snooker China Open)
(Nice. It seems he wants to win)

379
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,680
(and go for a perfect score.)

380
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,224
Good for you.

381
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:19,239
Last year, I played against Lin Yiyang
in Hel, and I lost.

382
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:23,959
His achievements are not proven
with the mouth but with this.

383
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,759
Strength is above everything, right?

Congratulations to Lin Yiyang
for a perfect score of147 in this frame.

426
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,439
Yes, on the first day of the main draw,

427
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:20,200
a local player

428
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,480
achieved a 147 break.

429
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,024
Congratulations.

430
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:24,480
The honor belongs not only to Lin Yiyang

431
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,120
but also to the Chinese contingent.

432
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Yes, thank you,
Lin Yiyang, Meng Xiaodong.

433
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,480
Your coach is too old
to watch a long game.

434
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,680
It's a spectacular game.

435
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,680
And in the history of snooker,
the maximum break of 147...

436
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,904
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

437
00:38:36,904 --> 00:38:38,152
...only occurred over 100 times.

438
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:41,399
And it will be recorded
by the snooker federation.

439
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:45,080
So, congratulations to Lin Yiyang.

440
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,120
Congratulations.
Our coach said you played very well.

441
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,160
Where's he?

442
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:03,480
He's outside.

443
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,759
What? Are you scared of seeing him?

444
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,359
No offense, but I have to say it.

445
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,040
Your coach is already over 70.

446
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,799
If you must achieve good results
before seeing him,

447
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,759
aren't you afraid
it'll be too late for that?

448
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:32,480
Let's go.

449
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:55,160
Dad, he's here.

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,919
You've grown so tall.

453
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,600
Yiyang.

454
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,000
It's been so many years.

455
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,319
Your hands are bigger.
I can hardly hold them.

456
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,640
It's overcast.

457
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:16,879
You don't have to come.

458
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,200
If it rained,
it would be an inconvenience.

459
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,399
Before my next match,

460
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,319
I will give you a call in advance.

461
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:35,600
You can watch it at home.

462
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,080
That's good.

463
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:50,040
Coach.

464
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:54,200
I'll pack

465
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,759
and take you home.

466
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,680
Let's go home.

467
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:08,600
Go home.

468
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:13,719
Do you remember the time you lived here?

469
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:14,239

470
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,000

471
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,759
Dear.

472
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,680
Look who's here.

473
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,160
Yiyang.

474
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,759
Mrs. He.

475
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:28,960
Do you still remember me?

476
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,799
Of course, I do.

477
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,080
You've grown up.

478
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,839
You were still little
when you left Dongxin City.

479
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,200
You've grown up.

480
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:48,759
Let's stay happy
and not talk about the past.

481
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,600
Your coach bet you are sure to win.

482
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:02,200
He asked me to make a big meal for you,

483
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,080
including your favorite stir-fried pork
with green peppers.

484
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,359
He remembers your favorite.

485
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:10,919
Yeah.

486
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,120
I'm so happy.

487
