Guo.

Congratulations.

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,879
I'll hold a celebration party
for you. Let me help.

30
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:15,079
Sorry, but I have
a family reunion tonight.

31
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,160
I have to celebrate it at home.

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,919
Alright, I'll cancel the party.

33
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,879
Anyway, I own the restaurant.

34
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,879
When you win the championship,

35
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,392
I'll throw you a big party.

36
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:25,039
Okay.

37
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,279
Liu Xiran.

38
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:29,760
Have you waited for a long time?

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,599
That girl is so pretty.

40
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,679
No, your plane landed on time.

41
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,599
She is Lin Lin,
a coach from Dongxin City.

42
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,800
Meng Xiaodong's ex-girlfriend.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,559
Meng Xiaodong's?

44
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,040
Everyone's waiting to celebrate for you.

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,400
I thought Meng Xiaodong had no feelings.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,160
Me too.

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,319
Guo.

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
Xiran.

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,800
Lin Lin.

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
I saw you just now.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,919
Why didn't you call me?

52
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,959
You walked too fast.

53
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,519
Lin Lin, this is Yin Guo,
Duncuo's girlfriend.

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,559
Hello, I'm Yin Guo.

55
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,919
We have a celebration party,
so we have to go.

56
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:12,680
Okay, I have to go too.

57
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,919
Congratulations.

58
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,359
Congratulations. I gotta go.

59
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,680
Bye.

60
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,040
Help me carry it.

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,559
Look at her. When she was with Xiaodong,
which of them looked better?

62
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,040
I've never spoken to her before.

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,960
Today, I realize I like her.

64
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,840
Wake up. Let's go.
The car is parked over there.

65
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:41,320
Give it to me.

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
What do you like about her?

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,400
She's very pretty.

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,359
(Xiaodong, I met Lin Lin today.)

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,760
(Got it.)

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,959
(She looks very pretty.)

71
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,119
(She's always been pretty.
I'm training.)

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,760
Let's go. Everyone's waiting for you.

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,000
Wait. I'm not going.

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,639
I've already left the team.

75
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,799
I'm no longer one of you guys.

76
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:43,040
You don't have to throw a party for me.

77
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,679
Don't be silly.

78
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,760
You're always one of us.

79
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,024
Besides, you just won the championship.

80
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:00,760
It's an honor for us to have you.

81
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,239
Please.

82
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:05,639
You used to be better than me.
Sadly, you retired too early.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Not really. I have so many injuries
that I can't play anymore.

84
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,501
Alright, get off. Do you want me
to open the door for you?

85
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,100
Let's go, my champion.

86
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:28,260
Xiran.

87
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,544
A warm welcome

88
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:35,692
to Liu Xiran, applause.

89
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,461
Didn't you send Lin a message?

90
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,381
There's a time difference.
It's midnight there.

91
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,820
What a hassle.
You have to calculate time differences.

92
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:04,420
Look, you have a long-distance thing

93
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,784
with your first love.
What do you see in him?

94
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,420
I didn't see this coming.

95
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,580
Is it because...?

96
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:18,780
Auntie.

97
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,900
Please wait a little longer.
Her dad is in an important meeting.

98
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
He wants to celebrate with Guo.

99
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,920
If you're hungry,
you can have some soup first.

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,900
I'm not hungry. I'm fine.

101
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,700
It's not the time for meals yet.

102
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:35,304
Okay. Guo, take good care of her.

103
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:36,660
I will make a work call.

104
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:47,700
I get nervous
every time I talk to your mom.

105
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,981
I'm afraid to make a mistake

106
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,460
Why were you so afraid of her?

107
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,780
You're old enough to date someone.

108
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,700
Lin Yiyang retired after a match

109
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,780
because he argued with a referee
and was suspended for six months.

110
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,101
And my mom was the assistant chief
of the referee team for that match.

111
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,061
So, he's finished. No.

112
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,501
Both of you are finished.

113
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,621
Why are you so happy?

114
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,621
You have a good taste.

115
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,541
Get lost.

116
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:36,741
Are you working?
Can't you do it tomorrow?

117
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,460
I have other work to do tomorrow.

118
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,340
In the morning,
I have to take care of the business.

119
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,820
In the afternoon,
I need to meet with my advisor.

120
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,900
In the evening, I will meet my landlord.

121
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:48,741
Your landlord?

122
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:50,728
Will you not return after graduation?

123
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:53,660
I'll rent for another year.

124
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:04,808
Have you secured a job at Helsin?

125
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,280
There are games over there.

126
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,280
The business is not very stable.

127
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,761
I can lay a good foundation in one year

128
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:12,648
and open a new store after returning.

129
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
You'll open a billiard room at home?

130
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,080
I aim to run chain stores.

131
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:23,121
I thought you would take over the team.

132
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:34,441
Aren't you interested?

133
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,960
I know Jiang Yang is working too hard.

134
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:44,520
However, that's not my ambition.

135
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,400
I want to open a modern billiard room.

136
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,881
I'll cultivate new professional players
as I expect.

137
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,241
Since you've decided to return home,

138
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,241
why stay another year?

139
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,960
Because I need to compete
and win prize money.

140
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:15,441
Really?

141
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:21,681
You will compete?

142
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:23,432
Yes.

143
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:28,720
I want to compete.

144
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,080
Well...

145
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:45,600
You always surprise me.

146
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,121
Tonight...

147
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:50,824
Why are you crying?

148
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:54,400
I don't know.

149
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,160
We've grown up together.

150
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,321
You had a hard time.

151
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,280
You and our coach were both stubborn.

152
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,160
If any of you gave in...

153
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,160
It's over.

154
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:18,600
It's in the past.

155
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,281
(Are you asleep?)

156
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:34,600
(Not yet.)

157
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,921
(I'm going to the club in five minutes.)

158
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,880
(A video call?)

159
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,756
(Lin's Guo)

160
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,720
Did you just take a shower?

161
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,641
Yeah.

162
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
I miss you.

163
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,681
That's it?

164
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:54,760
Have you not been sleeping well?

165
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,041
Your eyes look red.

166
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,760
It's okay. I'm good.

167
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:03,641
Right, I want to ask you something.

168
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,600
You're about to graduate.

169
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:14,161
Where will you work?

170
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:18,080
It's not decided yet.

171
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,521
It's good to think it over.

172
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,041
After all, it is a big deal, right?

173
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:33,840
Alright, hurry to the club.

174
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,321
Got it. Xiaodong has gone
for closed training.

175
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:41,201
Without him, the club got better.

176
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,480
Alright, I'm going to practice.
You go to bed early.

177
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,321
Miss you.

178
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:52,161
Me too.

179
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,281
Bye.

180
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,281
Bye.

181
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:22,600
Yiyang.

182
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:25,281
Why are you up?

183
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:29,240
I heard a noise outside
and thought you were awake.

184
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,281
I wanted to ask you to review my paper.

185
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:34,360
But I heard you on the phone with
Yin Guo and didn't want to disturb you.

186
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:39,561
Okay, give it to me.

187
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:41,521
It's okay. You go to sleep.
You haven't slept well lately.

188
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:44,480
I won't have time. Let me do it now.

189
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:48,620
(Bei City Billiards Club)

190
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:51,276
(Bei City)

191
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,360
It's really impressive.

192
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,480
This club is much better
than the previous one.

193
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,904
You call me over and stay quiet.

194
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:21,240
I don't think
you just want to buy me coffee.

195
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,521
I'm worried.

196
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,321
About your relationship?

197
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:33,840
No, it's good.
The relationship is stable.

198
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
What's the matter?

199
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,559
Your ranking is shooting up.

200
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,959
And your career is flourishing.

201
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
You've got a boyfriend.

202
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,319
He's handsome and highly educated,
and your relationship is stable.

203
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,559
Look at me. A pathetic single girl.

204
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,159
Compared to me,
what have you got to worry about?

205
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,959
He's about to graduate.

206
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,159
I know that.

207
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,079
But he hasn't secured a job yet.

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,439
With his qualifications,

209
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,120
finding a job is easy for him.

210
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,319
Well...

211
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,439
As a grown man,
he must have plans for himself.

212
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,720
That's true.

213
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,240
Do you think I sometimes worry too much?

214
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,480
You're his girlfriend.

215
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,279
If you don't worry, who will?

216
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,039
Back to the job,

217
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
opportunity matters in finding a job.

218
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:50,360
Perhaps he's considering
his career direction.

219
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,480
Or maybe he has several options

220
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,000
to choose from. It's hard to say.

221
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,640
He's six years older than you
and more experienced than you.

222
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,840
He surely has his considerations.

223
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,319
You're right.

224
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,559
Hello, we'll wait for you at Gate Three.

225
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,120
Alright.

226
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,840
We've decided not
to join the competition in Macau, China.

227
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,319
The new game doesn't affect rankings.
New players can have a try.

228
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,679
Has the car arrived?

229
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,039
Almost, we can wait here.

230
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:39,919
Meng Xiaodong.

231
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Excuse me.

232
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,120
I guess five minutes to go.

233
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,319
What's up?

234
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,840
Just say hi to you.

235
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,199
I don't think you're that kind to me.

236
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,079
Meng Xiaodong, you're always so cold.

237
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,720
Spit it out. What is it?

238
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,039
Lin Yiyang is going to sign up
for this competition.

239
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,199
See, you're only interested in him.

240
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,320
Which competition?

241
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,919
Macau, China.

242
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,872
He registered as an individual.

243
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:27,919
I got it.

244
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:35,592
Sign me up for the game in Macau, China.

245
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,000
No. Book me a flight
and hotel for Macau, China.

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,919
I'll go watch the game.

247
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:41,840
Okay, no problem.

248
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,159
Same as usual.

249
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,400
You look different today.

250
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,921
Yeah, I'm not used to it as well.

251
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,881
Lin's noodles. Same as usual.

252
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,088
Alright.

253
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,161
Interview?

254
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:37,720
Sort of.

255
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:41,161
I heard from Wu Wei
that you've already received job offers.

256
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:42,201
None of them are ideal?

257
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,881
I'm working for what I want.

258
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:53,720
Good luck.

259
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,841
Lin, enjoy your meal.

260
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,224
Thanks.

261
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:32,072
(China Open (Macau) Qualifier)

262
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:08,232
Hello?

263
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,320
Are you practicing?

264
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,960
Yeah, isn't it 3:00 AM now?

265
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,841
Why are you still up?

266
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:16,584
I know you're practicing.

267
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:19,641
I didn't want to call you.

268
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,361
But today is special, and I...

269
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,040
I want to talk to you.

270
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:29,320
What's the matter?

271
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,320
There's one thing

272
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:38,720
I want to discuss with you.

273
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:42,720
Don't try to scare me. Why so serious?

274
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:46,720
Hold on, let me find a quiet place.

275
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,040
Go ahead. I'm ready.

276
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:08,480
I still want to play pool.

277
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,000
You want to make a comeback?

278
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,800
Let me finish.

279
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,881
I haven't competed for many years.

280
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:28,320
The environment has changed,
and the world is changing.

281
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,161
So is the competition and the opponents.

282
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,361
It's likely

283
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,081
that I made a wrong decision.

284
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,641
No, it's never too late
to start if you want.

285
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:50,601
I've also found a good job.

286
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,240
It's pretty stable.

287
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,320
Coming back to the field
could cause many changes.

288
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:03,016
If I can't achieve good results,

289
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,760
the future might be messy.

290
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:12,201
Lin Yiyang, listen to me. It's okay.

291
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
I'm so glad
you can come back to the game.

292
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:17,841
I'm serious. Don't worry.

293
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:21,841
No matter what happens,
I'm there for you.

294
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,280
Think about it. When you pursued me,

295
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:30,344
you were just a poor student,
and I was nothing.

296
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:33,361
Things can't be worse than that, right?

297
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,161
And I'm now ranked third in the world.

298
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:42,720
Anyway, you are the boyfriend
of the world's third-ranked player.

299
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:56,121
Don't laugh. I'm serious. Lin Yiyang.

300
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:01,881
I am your strong support.

301
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:07,361
Move forward, and I get your back.

302
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,361
Stop laughing.
I hardly say something serious.

303
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:23,000
Alright, I'll stop.

304
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:36,520
You practice. And I...

305
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,480
I have something else to do.

306
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,000
What are you going to do?
You should go to bed now.

307
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,040
Take care of yourself, okay?

308
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:48,720
Don't stay up late.

309
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,864
Got it.

310
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,280
I gotta go.

311
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,081
This is Chinese player Lin Yiyang.

312
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,651
(China Open (Macau) Qualifier)
He is the only Chinese player,

313
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,641
registered as a solo player
in this competition.

314
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:36,121
His resume is quite simple.

315
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,800
He has never participated
in any international competitions.

316
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,000
He has no points or rankings.

if they will regret or feel lucky

Who told you?

353
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,000
You guessed it.

354

Originally, I had my doubts

about you pursuing Guo.

362
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,000
But at this moment, my doubts are gone.

363
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,121
Why? Is it because I won the champion?

364
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,881
My family isn't interested in champions.

365
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,201
It's because you're frugal.

366
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:20,081
See you downstairs.

369
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,401
I just heard one thing from our coach.

370
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:39,280
How could you not tell me?

371
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,960
Guo, we're close friends.

372
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,121
You hurt our friendship.

What do you mean?

374
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,280

379
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,560
I'm in the apartment.

380
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:39,280
Aren't you in Macau, China?

381
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:40,520
I've been back.

It's okay. I'm up now.

385
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:56,601
Why didn't you tell me
about your game in Macau, China?

386
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:58,401
Didn't I call you?

387
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:07,560
So, you called me in Macau, China?

388
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,800
Yes.

389
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:15,081
You made me talk before the game.

390
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:18,161
I knew you were practicing.
I didn't want to bother you.

391
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:20,921
But then...

392
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:27,841
I was sitting in the lounge
and suddenly wanted to talk to someone.

393
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
And I thought of you.

394
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:34,161
Nervous, huh?

395
00:33:34,841 --> 00:33:35,464
Yeah.

396
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,800
I was nervous.

397
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,921
Didn't you get nervous before?

398
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:44,280
I mean, during competitions back then.

399
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,921
No, perhaps...

400
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:56,560
I was afraid of nothing as a new player.

401
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I just felt that I would definitely win.

402
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,720
It's just a championship of a qualifier.

403
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,960

Sometimes, I rely on him
to help me with my papers.

484
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:48,081
Moreover, Yiyang negotiated
with the landlord for us,

485

so we could rent an affordable house.
Am I right, Yin Guo?
