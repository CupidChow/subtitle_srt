So,

27
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,400
problem has been solved, right?

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Are you happy?

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,919
You certainly

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,959
look happy.

31
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,639
Of course.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,439
Guo.

33
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,439
I thought about

34
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,760
the days when I was 22.

35
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,120
I found a decent job,

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,240
but I still wanted to get

37
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,240
further education.

38
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,799
If I had stopped

39
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,639
back then,

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,919
I wouldn't be here today.

41
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,040
Then the paths I take,

42
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,200
the world I see,

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,480
and the people I meet

44
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,760
would be different.

45
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,760
I wouldn't be content

46
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,200
to stay where I was

47
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,200
at the age of 22.

48
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,480
You are better

49
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,840
than I used to be

50
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,639
with greater potential.

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,320
So we don't have to decide

52
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:00,680
whether we want kids now.

53
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,040
It's like

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,359
you're preaching.

55
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:06,959
I'm older than you,

56
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,679
after all.

57
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:12,119
Not so much.

58
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,919
You look quite young.

59
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,160
Yiyang.

60
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,959
Chengyan wants to discuss
the Asian Indoor Games with you.

61
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,160
Got it.

62
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,639
Someone has been eyeing my man.

63
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,239
I feel awful.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,399
I've been cautious,

65
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,760
but I still don't feel secure.

66
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,919
She's the vice-captain
of the Nine-Ball team.

67
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,560
I can't avoid her.

68
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,880
I didn't say anything.

69
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,679
What are you doing?

70
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,959
What are you doing?

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,320
What are you doing?

72
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,440
Chen An'an.

73
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,440
She sprained her ankle?

74
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,519
Need a doctor?

75
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,079
- No.
- Put me down.

76
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,440
She's just throwing a tantrum.

77
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,119
By the way, tell Chengyan

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
I'll meet my mother-in-law today.

79
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,560
We can

80
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,600
have the meeting later.

81
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,440
And inform Mr. Chen, Mr. Wang,
and Lin Lin.

82
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,519
Okay.

83
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,079
Put me down.

84
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,280
Where are we going?

85
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,280
Over there.

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,399
Do you like collecting those?

87
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,919
You had a jar of those

88
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,000
in your apartment abroad.

89
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,919
This is that jar.

90
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,000

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,399

93
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,472
lighting them up to make wishes.

94
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,839
More or less.

95
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,399

96
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,800

98
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,880
Make a wish.

99
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,719

100
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,839

is being rated.

Mr. Pei.

00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,519

00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:31,920
Yeah.

133
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,728
Right.

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,839
My mom must still be in a meeting.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,200
She can't make it for dinner.

136
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,800
Only my grandma and my dad

137
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,079
are home.

138
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,680
She's busy at work with

139
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,920
the upcoming sports meeting.

140
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,880
But she asked us to wait

141
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
for her to come back.

142
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,959
Okay.

143
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,688
Let's go.

144
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,959
I'm already getting nervous.

145
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:00,479
Don't worry.

146
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,120
I'll do my best.

147
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,680
It's fine.

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,920
Well, my dad is quite

149
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,680
easy-going.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
And I think he likes you.

151
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,360
I will please him

152
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,159
even if he's not so easy-going.

153
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,639
You... You're sweating.

154
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,920
It's too hot today.

155
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
Give me that.

156
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,800
I'll hold it.

157
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:58,479
Okay.

158
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,519
In a worst-case scenario,
I'll just carry you and run.

159
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,959
Alright.

160
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:14,519

162
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,696
Hey, there.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,976
Well...

164
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,520
You seem all flustered.

165
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:32,879
Let me introduce you.

166
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,040
This is Lin Yiyang.

167
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:34,999
Hello, Uncle.

168
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,479
I am Lin Yiyang.

169
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,999
So you are Lin?

170
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:39,800
Hello.

171
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,680
Come on.

172
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,560
Put on the slippers.

173
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:43,640

174
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,359
Come on.

175
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,400
Make yourself at home. Sit.

176
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,320
Hey.

177
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,040
Why are you here?

178
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,119
What a coincidence.

179
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,959
I'm visiting my uncle
for the snooker club.

180
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,599
And the leader of Dongxin City

181
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,359
is also here.

182
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,719
Uncle, these are for you and Ms. Wu.

183
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,040
Thank you. You're too kind.

184
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,280
Have a seat.

185
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,079
You're here to help?

186
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:14,879
Not at all.

187
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:16,599
Stop denying.

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,920
Show some respect.

189
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,440
Are you going to sit with us

190
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
or talk in private?

191
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,920
We'll join you.

192
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,959
Lin,

193
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,719
your teacher

194
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,479
often mentioned you.

195
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,200
I often heard him

196
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,119
talking to Guo's mom

197
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:40,959
on the phone.

198
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,079
People age

199
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,759
and pass away.

200
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,359
No one can escape that.

201
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,079
Take it easy.

202
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,320
Let's just chit-chat today.

203
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,079
Cheer up.

204
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,112
Yeah.

205
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,920
Alright.

206
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,079
Right. Has Guo ever told you that

207
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,280
I used to be an athlete?

208
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,920
Yeah. She mentioned that you were

209
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,920
all into sports.

210
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,280
Yeah.

211
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,920
Back in those days,

212
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,719
I wanted to do something
for the association.

213
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,440
Just like you,

214
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,560
I faced opposition from conservatives.

215
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,599
and failed to carry on.

216
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,200
This time,

217
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,200
you demonstrated courage

218
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
and execution.

219
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
Frankly,

220
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,719
I really admire you.

221
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,920
But

222
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,719
Dongxin City is different from Bei City.

223
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,560
Xiaodong

224
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
took over the club

225
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,160
from his father.

226
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
It's a modern

227
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,759
billiards club, anyway.

228
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,239
So,

229
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:44,999
it's only natural to run it

230
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,959
with new methods.

231
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,520
But Dongxin City has a long history

232
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,920
and complex

233
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,239
personnel issues.

234
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,359
You need a long-term plan

235
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,719
to make changes.

236
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,160
So far,

237
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,560
I have been quite lucky.

238
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
It's all working out.

239
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:03,400
Good for you.

240
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:05,839
Anyway,

241
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,119
if you ever

242
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,680
have any questions

243
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:09,719
or need any

244
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,719
advice,

245
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,839
come to me.

246
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,520
After all, I am much older

247
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,359
than you.

248
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,079
I can offer some advice. Right?

249
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,479
Thank you.

250
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,040
What a relief.

251
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,719
Alright. Here.

252
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,416
To you.

253
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,320
- You're back.
- Sister.

254
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,119
She's the older sister.

255
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,200
Yin Guo is younger.

256
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,759
Come down for dinner later.

257
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,479
You finally met.

258
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,359
- Grandma.
- It's my turn to say hi.

259
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,680
Hello, Grandma.

260
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,920
I am Lin Yiyang.

261
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:04,879
Lin.

262
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,959
Mom, would you like to sit?

263
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,680
No need.

264
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,640
Let's just eat.

265
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,119
Look. The meal is ready.

266
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,119
Let's eat and talk.

267
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:16,719
Lin.

268
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,320
Come on.

269
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,520
Let's eat.

270
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,560
This way.

271
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,576
Okay.

272
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,520
Sit there next to my dad.

273
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,879
Mom, here.

274
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,040
Sit.

275
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,560
Take a seat.

276
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,280
Take a seat.

277
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,568
Where is Tong?

278
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,520
Tong.

279
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,440
Wu Tong.

280
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,040
Coming.

281
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,280
Grandma. Have some tea.

282
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:41,879
Thank you.

283
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,920
Here, Uncle.

284
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,704
Thank you.

285
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,280
Xiaodong.

286
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,520
You see me now?

287
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,280
I didn't want to distract you

288
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,239
from the talk.

289
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,040
Grandma. Let me serve you rice.

290
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:57,928
Thank you.

291
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,079
Don't rush.

292
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,599
Take your time.

293
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,680
Guo's mother

294
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
is going to take a while.

295
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,239
Yeah.

296
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,264
Okay.

297
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,959
Try and see

298
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:09,999
if you like it.

299
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,424
Grandma.

300
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,400
Alright. Mom.

301
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,079
Dig in.

302
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,999
Lin.

303
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,680
Dig in, okay?

304
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,920
Thank you, Uncle.

305
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,640
Your veteran coaches

306
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,759
in Dongxin City

307
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,920
are all treasures.

308
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,440
They've trained many

309
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,560
outstanding athletes.

310
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,320
They're invaluable.

311
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:30,920
Dig in.

312
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,520
It's different

313
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,079
in Bei City.

314
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,200
Uncle.

315
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,959
We're all family here.

316
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,320
You don't have to exaggerate.

317
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,239
Bei City has its advantages.

318
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,320
We have always

319
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,440
been getting

320
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,320
the best players.

321
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,920
Yeah, you're right.

322
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,440
Each has its advantages.

323
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,079
Dad. The guest hasn't even

324
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,959
taken a bite yet.

325
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,448
Stop talking about work.

326
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,920
That's right.

327
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,440
Let him eat.

328
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,359
- Come on, let's drink.
- Okay.

329
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,959
Welcome, Lin.

330
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,200
Thank you, Grandma.

331
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,040
Lin.

332
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,479
I'm so grateful to you

333
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,400
for taking such good care

334
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,520
of Xiaotian abroad.

335
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,719
That child is just

336
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,959
too naive,

337
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,879
unlike Xiaodong

338
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,999
who is sensible.

339
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,040
He must have
caused you a lot of trouble.

340
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,800
No. It's my pleasure.

341
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,959
Xiaodong and I

342
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,920
have been old friends.

343
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,719
I would have taken care

344
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,560
of Xiaotian without Guo.

345
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,352
Yeah.

346
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,759
We're buddies.

347
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,200
That's new.

348
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,400
He is my brother-in-law.

349
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,839
Grandma. Uncle.

350
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,440
It's my first time here.

351
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,359
- Let me toast...
- Sit.

352
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,280
- Sit.
- Sit.

353
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:50,479
Let me toast

354
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,440
to both of you.

355
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,640
Grandma.

356
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,616
Uncle.

357
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,719
Uncle.

358
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,800
Okay, thank you.

359
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,079
I'm heading out.

360
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,200
Guo's mom will be back soon.

361
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,280
Go ahead and talk

362
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:30,719
to each other.

363
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,256
Lin.

364
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,079
Come and visit more.

365
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,920
Okay, Uncle.

366
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,560
Alright. See you.

367
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,680
Bye, Dad.

368
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,680
- Bye, Uncle.
- Bye, Uncle.

369
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,600
Bye.

370
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,200
Auntie is calling.

371
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,160
Just a second.

372
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,200
We just had food.

373
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
I'll help Grandma upstairs to rest.

374
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,320
Wait for me.

375
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,280
Okay, go ahead.

376
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,040
Grandma.

377
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:08,239
Stop busying yourself.

378
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,119
Go up and rest.

379
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:09,680
Alright.

380
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,536
Let's go.

381
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,256
Be careful.

382
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,112
You went to
the Seventh Secondary School?

383
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,680
We've met before.

384
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,200
Your name

385
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,239
sounded familiar.

386
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,680
You're Yan Fu's girlfriend?

387
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,520
We haven't been in touch
since we broke up.

388
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,479
Lin Yiyang.

389
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,999
Help me with the fruit plate. Hurry up.

390
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,440
My mom will be back soon.

391
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,200
Which fruits?

392
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,440
We're family.

393
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,559
You weren't on good terms with Guo.

394
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,239
Nobody said anything.

395
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,920
But she brought

396
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,080
her boyfriend home today.

397
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,519
Have you even smiled

398
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,840
this whole time?

399
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm swamped by work.

400
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:53,559
I'm exhausted.

401
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,080
Get some rest then.

402
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,559
But be nice to the guest.

403
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,840
I see.

404
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,640
My sister didn't say anything, right?

405
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm a grown man.

406
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,559
What can she do to me?

407
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,959
She didn't look so happy

408
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,080
during the meal.

409
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,279
So I was worried.

410
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,559
We had a brief chat.

411
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,039
It turns out we've met before.

412
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,440
But it was

413
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,880
a brief encounter.

414
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,799
She is a friend of my classmate.

415
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,640
In Seventh Secondary School?

416
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,480
Yeah.

417
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,600
You were already

418
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,279
a national champion back then, huh?

419
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,239
Yeah.

420
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:51,279
I was even invited to
give a speech at your school.

421
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,640
Really?

422
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,719
When?

423
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,400
When you

424
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,640
were in primary school.

425
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:03,559
You're showing off again.

426
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,176
Mom.

427
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,279
Ms. Wu.

428
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,280
Lin.

429
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,279
I was in a meeting.

430
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:11,999
Sorry about that.

431
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,559
No problem.

432
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,759
Alright, let's talk upstairs.

433
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,400
Xiaodong, join us.

434
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,200
Guo.

435
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:26,999
Go to the study.

436
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,640
Okay, right away.

437
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,040
Hurry up.

438
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:45,999
I'll do it.

439
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,528
I...

440
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,920
Get me a plate.

441
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,600
You are much more efficient
than me on that.

442
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,279
I have done all sorts of jobs.

443
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,559
I can even style it

444
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,759
if we have a few more minutes.

445
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,799
You're a keeper.

446
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,959
Let's go. Don't let her wait.

447
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,080
Wait.

448
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,400
My dad

449
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,360
listens to my mom

450
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,840
regarding my issues.

451
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,959
Got it?

452
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,479
My mom is quite reasonable

453
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,600
and she never gives people

454
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,360
a hard time.

455
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,440
If she mentions

456
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,559
the past issues,

457
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,479
just sit and listen.

458
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,479
Don't argue with her.

459
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,160
Xiaodong said that

460
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,999
she had changed her opinion

461
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,880
of you thanks to your teacher.

462
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,744
Okay.

463
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,056
Let's go.

464
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,840
Also, I mean,

465
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,759
she dotes on me quite a lot.

466
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,200
I can always act cute.

467
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,440
I'll just play it by ear.

468
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,200
I'll act cute

469
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,200
if anything goes wrong.

470
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,160
Just stay quiet.

471
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
Leave everything to me.

472
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,960
Okay?

473
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,488
Got it.

474
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,440
W-Wait.

475
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:33,680
That's it.

476
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,640
Xiaodong will help us.

477
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:36,519
Let's go.

478
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,024
Let's go.

479
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,160
One last thing,

480
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:55,840
no matter

481
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,559
what my mom says,

482
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,120
I have my opinion.

483
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:01,880
Anyway,

484
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,200
I've decided

485
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:11,920
to be with you forever.

486
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,160
Come in.

487
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,319
What's wrong?

488
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,640
Let Lin sit next to me.

489
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,759
He cut the fruits.

490
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,999
Well done, huh?

491
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,319
Nice plating.

492
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,880
Right?

493
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,999
You know why

494
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,200
she's so nervous?

495
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,239
I'm not.

496
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,080
Alright.

497
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,160
I won't eat him up.

498
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,160
Let us talk.

499
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,999
G-Go ahead.

500
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,360
I... I'll have some fruit.

501
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,080
Go ahead, please.

502
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,759
When we first met last month,

503
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
you offered me tea

504
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,039
and I could tell that

505
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,600
Guo wanted to speak for you.

506
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,799
To be honest,

507
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:36,959
I started observing you.

508
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:38,719
Because of Guo,

509
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,959
I watched all your games

510
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,279
and post-match interviews.

511
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,759
Your teacher was present once.

512
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,160
That deep bow of yours

513
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,120
changed my opinion

514
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:48,959
of you.

515
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,039
I also watched

516
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,840
the Nine-Ball Open.

517
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Why are you signaling

518
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:05,519
your brother?

519
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:07,999
I'm not.

520
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,160
I dare not do that.

521
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,319
Auntie.

522
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,959
You watched that?

523
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,039
Yeah.

524
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,400
Or I wouldn't know

525
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,200
that you kids were

526
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,920
so afraid of me.

527
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,799
You spoke fluent English.

528
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:23,959
Was it tough

529
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,799
studying abroad on your own

530
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,559
without the support of your family?

531
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,224
It was fine.

532
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:33,080
Generally, it was worth all the trouble.

533
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,160
Remarkable.

534
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,880
It's amazing that

535
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,200
you did it on your own.

536
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,799
I didn't know about

537
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,719
your academic life
before Xiaotian returned.

538
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:45,039
He stayed with his grandma for a week

539
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,640
and kept talking about
your school and your major.

540
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,559
I was very happy for you.

541
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,120
Mom.

542
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,600
He worked really hard.

543
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,200
We were only meeting

544
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:54,959
for a day or two

545
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,400
every week because

546
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,200
he was busy studying.

547
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:00,999
The year before last?

548
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,200
Alright. That's it.

549
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,880
Auntie.

550
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:21,400
Thank you for giving me a chance.

551
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,360
Thank you for getting to know me again.

552
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,999
It's the second time you offered me tea.

553
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,160
I didn't feel like it last time.

554
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,440
This time,

555
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,880
I feel like enjoying it.

556
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,200
Now we can talk about

557
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,080
something else.

558
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,319
Let's talk about

559
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,400
the indoor sports meeting.

560
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:12,680
Not business.

561
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,799
Just a chit-chat.

562
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,680
My mom is all about

563
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,600
work.

564
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:18,999
Auntie.

565
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,479
Do you feel it's a loss

566
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,160
not to talk

567
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,160
about work

568
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,840
with both team leaders here?

569
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,559
Behave yourself.

570
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,999
This indoor sports meeting includes

571
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,519
the following billiard events,

572
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Women's Six-Red Snooker,

573
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,200
Eight-Ball and Nine-Ball.

574
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,160
All individual games.

575
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,319
Men's Snooker Individual,

576
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,519
Eight-Ball, Nine-Ball,

577
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:42,799
and Snooker Team.

578
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,640
Seven events in total.

579
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,559
Any thoughts on the sign-up for now?

580
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,080
I'll go for Nine-Ball.

581
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:54,880
We also want you

582
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,160
to take part in

583
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,360
the Six-Red Snooker.

584
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:58,600
Currently, we don't

585
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,519
have another player

586
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,680
for that.

587
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,319
Six-red snooker.

588
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,999
I've been learning

589
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
billiards from Xiaodong,

590
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,640
and I can play snooker.

591
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
- But...
- Well,

592
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,160
let's talk later.

593
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:17,759
I know you hardly

594
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:18,680
participate in

595
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,959
any event other than snooker.

596
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,999
But it's different this time.

597
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,519
The number of medals
is crucial to the team.

598
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,640
I understand.

599
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,840
I will do

600
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,440
as you say.

601
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,559
Okay.

602
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,479
Let's talk tomorrow.

603
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,144
Okay.

604
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,200
Auntie.

605
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,039
I will do as you say.

606
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,519
Snooker individual and team

607
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,239
are your games.

608
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,672
Yeah.

609
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,360
I will sign up.

610
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,279
Your Nine-Ball record abroad

611
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,360
is very impressive.

612
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,680
No problem.

613
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,360
I will sign up for Nine-Ball.

614
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,080
Can you manage

615
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,440
Eight-Ball at the same time?

616
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,080
I will play as long as

617
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,840
I'm selected.

618
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,959
Wait.

619
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,680
Isn't that too exhausting?

620
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,519
What if he can't secure

621
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,039
the victory of the main games?

622
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,200
That's his decision to make.

623
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,039
He'd surely say

624
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,640
that there's no problem when asked.

625
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,279
Even if he's excellent,

626
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,759
we don't have to run him ragged.

627
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
I was just asking

628
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,239
if he could handle it.

629
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,400
The final list

630
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,559
will be decided

631
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,360
by the coaches.

632
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:30,680
He can surely

633
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,319
make the list if he wants to.

634
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
There's nothing

635
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,999
he can't do if he wants to.

636
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:36,936
Right?

637
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,559
Guo has a lot of confidence in you.

638
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,799
I got this.

639
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,080
Fine.

640
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,432
But...

641
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:52,840
But if he plays

642
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:53,600
in multiple games,

643
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,959
he may not do so well

644
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,239
in one event or two.

645
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,736
You can't blame him for that.

646
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:58,640
Of course not.

647
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,799
He has said yes.

648
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,319
Why are you so worried?

649
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,440
I'm just afraid
his old injury might recur.

650
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,360
Since you got this,

651
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,600
go for it.

652
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,640
Rest assured,

653
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,920
I will do my best
to win all the games.

654
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,360
Talk to the doctor at your club first.

655
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:24,759
Got it.

656
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,360
Auntie.

657
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,759
Have you been busy

658
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:30,640
with the sports meeting?

659
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,136
Yeah.

660
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,360
It's not just the billiards.

661
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,479
There are meetings

662
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,479
about other events.

663
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,479
We're busy forming coaching teams

664
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,400
and national teams.

665
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,039
But I'm happy.

666
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,840
I used to be a billiards referee.

667
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm so glad that

668
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,519
billiards became

669
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:49,239
an official event.

670
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,920
Alright. I have work to attend to.

671
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Let's call it a day.

672
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,680
Visit us often.

673
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,160
No problem.

674
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,959
I'll focus on the training

675
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,279
and visit you

676
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,360
after the contest.

677
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,959
Congratulations

678
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,680
in advance.

679
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,080
Captain of the Chinese billiards team.

680
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,120
Lin Yiyang.

681
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,519
This is the result of a secret ballot.

682
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,959
It came out before I headed home.

683
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,160
Your great performance

684
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,759
won over

685
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,039
everyone who voted for you.

686
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,360
Everyone hopes that

687
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,880
the new captain, Lin Yiyang,

688
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,200
can lead the Chinese billiards team

689
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,479
towards a greater era.

690
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,440
Go for it.

691
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,680
I was wondering why

692
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,039
she called and told me

693
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,039
to stay here.

694
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,600
Now I get it.

695
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,039
Congratulations.

696
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:28,600
Thanks.

697
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,920
For everything.

698
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,239
Lin Yiyang,

699
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,479
I'm so happy.

700
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,288
Really.

701
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,479
I'm so, so happy.

702
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,640
How did my mom

703
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,840
manage to keep it

704
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,360
such a secret?

705
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,559
I was also surprised.

706
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,959
I have to go.

707
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,120
I never thought

708
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,200
I'd stand here

709
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:25,920
with you one day.

710
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,799
Thanks

711
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,640
for asking Tian to come back.

712
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,479
He should

713
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,039
thank himself.

714
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,600
You managed to win over

715
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,719
my brother.

716
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,519
You didn't call him back?

717
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,920
As soon as I told him

718
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,880
to come back

719
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,400
for help,

720
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:49,640
he packed up

721
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,479
and came home

722
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,759
right away without a word.

723
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,080
He has a conscience.

724
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,400
Go and celebrate.

725
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:58,792
I'm returning to Bei City.

726
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,456
Let's go.

727
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,680
Let me take you somewhere.

728
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,680
Where?

729
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,319
You'll see.

730
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,472
We're here.

731
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,080
Hey. I've been waiting.

732
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,920
You didn't buy a motorcycle, did you?

733
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,840
Wait. I'll bring it out.

734
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,519
A gift for you.

735
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,999
What is it?

736
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:02,519
A motorcycle?

737
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,879
What is it?

738
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,120
There's nothing there.

739
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:23,816
Isn't...

740
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,520
Isn't it my...

741
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,160
- My...
- The key to the apartment in Hel.

742
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,200
This is your key chain.

743
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,120
Remember?

744
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,359
Of course.

745
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,160
Did you...

746
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,000
We can stay there

747
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:41,960
whenever we want.

748
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:43,960
You bought it?

749
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
I didn't have enough

750
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:47,000
to pay in full.

751
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,319
So I got a loan.

752
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,160
But it'll be paid off

753
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,120
by the end

754
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:52,640
of the year.

755
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,024
Come on.

756
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,239
Why did you buy it?

757
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,080
You're not going there.

758
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,279
Isn't this a waste?

759
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,600
When you dragged

760
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,680
your suitcase downstairs that day,

761
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:04,399
you went to

762
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,719
check on the laundry room

763
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,480
and took a photo.

764
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,640
Remember?

765
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:16,960
The photo was blurry.

766
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,600
And you told me

767
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,560
to send you a photo.

768
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,839
Right then, I decided that

769
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,520
once I was on the right track

770
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:28,399
and saved up some money,

771
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,560
I would buy that apartment.

772
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,839
If I can't buy

773
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,080
the exact one,

774
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,439
I'd get something in the building

775
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:39,279
at least.

776
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,759
Why didn't you tell me anything?

777
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,120
How can I spoil the surprise?

778
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:49,680
Let's do the paperwork

779
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,799
when we visit,

780
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:56,319
and the house will be yours.

781
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,359
When did you buy it?

782
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,919
I started

783
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,359
saving up after

784
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,399
my first match.

785
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:17,960
Silly you!

786
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,279
You should have told me.

787
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,839
You wouldn't need a loan.

788
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:23,759
I have the prize money.

789
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,839
I could have chipped in.

790
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:26,520
That doesn't make sense.

791
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:28,480
Why not?

792
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,719
You surely know how to waste money.

793
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,839
Who does that?

794
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,600
Anyone would

795
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:38,799
buy a house here first.

796
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,279
Who would buy one abroad?

797
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:45,120
Here?

798
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Are you talking about

799
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,919
a wedding house?

800
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,759
Come on.

801
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,600
What?

802
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,879
Who said anything about a wedding house?

803
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,719
Come on. What's with you?

804
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,080
You just visited my parents.

805
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:05,439
But

806
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,480
I can't let you

807
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
buy our wedding house.

808
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,759
It's inappropriate.

809
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:11,279
I...

810
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,879
I...

811
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,239
I'm not talking about

812
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:14,919
the wedding house.

813
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,040
No. I'm not talking about

814
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,799
getting married.

815
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,799
I don't say I am going to marry you.

816
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,399
You aren't?

817
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:22,760
Why?

818
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:24,616
Will you marry someone else?

819
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,080
No.

820
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,960
