We met before your birthday.

42
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,720
What was I doing that day?

43
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,519
Did we chat?

44
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,160
No. Actually, before meeting,

45
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,079
we never chatted via WeChat.

46
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,280
We met?

47
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,720
Come on.

48
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,239
The day we ate ramen?

49
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,560
Why didn't you tell me?

50
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,480
Didn't I buy you ramen?

51
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,032
Well,

52
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,359
you asked Meng Xiaotian
and me out for coffee

53
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,399
because of your birthday?

54
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,368
It was a coincidence.

55
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,079
Why didn't you tell me?

56
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,000
On the way home that day,
you introduced yourself.

If I had told you about it,

you would have felt awkward.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,159

61
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:17,719
Not really.
Didn't we celebrate it together?

62
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:21,079
It's not the same.
I didn't know it was your birthday.

151
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,599

152
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:39,999
you never watch live games.

153
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,280
So, they didn't tell you
and asked me to pass the message.

154
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:44,999

155
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,320

Don't the customers complain?

183
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,280
(Usually, people don't dare to,

Is there a bed?)

188
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:30,680
(Yes.)

189
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,400
Actually, I feel sorry for you.

190
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,119
(You sent me off and then went back.)

191
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,200
(You feel sorry for me? Or you miss me?)

192
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:58,696
Both. Can you take a photo
of your hand drawing?

193
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,879
(I want to use it as a screensaver.)

194
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,640
Right, my game schedule
has been released.

195
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,759
I'll send it to you later

196
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,920
and see if you can make time for it.

197
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,440
(Actually, I've been thinking.)

198
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,400
(I think you might not make it
for the group matches.)

199
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,759
(Hopefully, I can make it
to the quarterfinal.)

200
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,879
(It's on Saturday after next.)

201
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,959
(You should be free on Saturday, right?)

202
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,520
Hello?

203
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,400
You're back.

204
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,640
Why did you come back early?

205
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:03,279
The pre-match training
hasn't started yet.

206
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,519
He asked me to come back early
for the training.

207
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,120
Look at you.

208
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,600
I feel sorry for Li Qingyan.

209
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,080
He broke up right before the game.

210
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:22,360
I have nothing to do with Li Qingyan.

211
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:26,519
Right, that's true.

212
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,360
He wants to have a thing with you.

213
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,120
Well, he failed, right?

214
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,680
I heard coaches praising your boyfriend.

215
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,120
So, is he coming to your competition?

216
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,479
This is your first professional game.
It's of great significance.

217
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,559
I'm not sure.

218
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,360
He probably can't make it.

219
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,799
He's too busy
during the graduation season.

220
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,799
Okay, I'll go take a shower.

221
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,200
(Yiyang, swallow your pride.
Just apologize.)

222
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,680
(I'm begging you.)

223
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,479
You can go.

224
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,559
You leave the group.

225
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,719
No matter where you go,

226
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:41,080
I will not stop you. From now on,

227
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,039
I have nothing to do with you anymore.

228
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,640
Yiyang, apologize. Stop being stubborn.

229
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,479
Yiyang, apologize.

230
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,039
Go.

231
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,120
Don't make our coach angry.

232
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,279
Yiyang.

233
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,559
Yiyang.

234
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,400
Let him go.

235
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,080
Lin Yiyang.

236
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,600
Who doesn't make mistakes?
Can't you apologize?

237
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,400
You don't listen to me anymore, do you?

238
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,519
(I'm practicing.)

239
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,840
(Why do you suddenly want to practice?)

240
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,600
(Trying out the new cue.)

241
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,519
(Your cues are good.)

242
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,279
(I can tell the owner knows his stuff.)

243
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:07,752
(Guo.)

244
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,880
(If I make a mistake,)

245
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:19,360
(can you give me a chance
to correct it?)

246
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,840
(Not about cheating.)

247
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:40,279
(Ok, three times,
even ten times is fine.)

248
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:46,920
(Just kidding, I have a good temper.)

249
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,759
(You can buy something tasty
to appease me.)

250
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,319
(And I'll forgive you very soon.)

251
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,440
A limited edition? You look so happy.

252
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,799
That's right.

253
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:41,959
You can still laugh?
You've entered a tough group.

254
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:44,880
The group has seven tough players.

255
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,559
They're among the highest-ranked players
in the world.

256
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:50,239
It gives me the chills.

257
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,279
It's okay. Anyway,
I have to face them eventually.

258
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,440
You have a good mind.

259
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,719
If the goal is the championship,

260
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:04,640
does it matter who I meet in
the group matches?

261
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,440
Well said. Cool.

262
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,160
I want to practice.

263
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,120
Okay, be careful.

264
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,160
I just saw the team doctor today.

265
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,719
He said I couldn't practice tonight.

266
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,200
Or I have no energy for formal training.

267
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,279
Alright, I got it.

268
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:30,888
Okay.

269
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:32,519
I'm off.

270
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,160
Take care, bye.

271
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:24,680
I heard you are in a tough group.
Feeling nervous?

272
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:26,888
Not really.

273
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,319
I hear you're familiar with Lin Yiyang.

274
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,656
That's right.

275
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,559
How's he doing?

276
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,039
Pretty good.

277
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,519
He graduated with his master's this year
and got admission to a Ph.D. program.

278
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,640
Good news.

279
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,640
(I bumped into Chengyan
in the billiard room.)

280
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,959
(She asked me about you.)

281
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,160
(What will he reply?)

282
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
(Practicing now?)

283
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,759
(Anyway, I have nothing else to do.)

284
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,519
(Can't overdo the training.)

285
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,319
(Just half an hour.)

286
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,719
(You and her...)

287
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,440
(They must have known each other.)

288
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,440
Hey, you finally talked to me.

289
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,799
Go to the billiard room downstairs
and look for Guo.

290
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,624
Isn't it too late?

291
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,959
It's not proper for me
to look for your girlfriend, is it?

292
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:33,999
Chengyan is there.
I'm afraid Guo might overthink.

293
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,440
How did this happen?

294
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,400
Listen, I don't go for your sake.

295
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,360
I go there for Yin Guo.

296
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,080
What happened?

297
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,279
We've arrived at the hotel, Yiyang.
We just checked in.

298
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,239
Get a good rest. Tomorrow,

299
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,360
go practice at the billiard room.

300
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,039
Can't slack off before the competition.

301
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:14,728
Alrighty.

302
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,719
Get to the point.

303
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,279
Yiyang, is it expensive

304
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,920
to rent the billiard room?

305
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,160
How about we split the cost evenly?

306
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,872
No need, I've settled the payment.

307
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,120
No, let's split the cost.

308
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,080
Don't worry about money.
Just focus on the competition.

309
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,039
I'm going to sleep. I gotta go.

310
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,759
See, I told you.

311
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,440
When has Yiyang ever let us pay?

312
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,080
It's because you're incapable of saying.

313
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,759
What about you?

314
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:56,559
Forget it. You guys know about him.

315
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:01,239
I'm quite emotional about this visit.

316
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,080
When I came to Hel years ago...

317
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,959
Mr. Qian, please don't reminisce.

318
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,319
Let's go up and rest.

319
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,600
Can't I just reminisce about my youth?

320
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,799
(She used to pursue me.)

321
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,360
(I see.)

322
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:41,920
(Guo.)

323
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,500
(Yes?)

324
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,248
(The first time I saw you,
I wanted to get to know you.)

325
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,559
The first time?

326
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:09,880
(What is he talking about?)

327
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,920
(In the bar, by the window, I wanted
to get to know you at first sight.)

328
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,600
(It never happened before.)

329
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,920
(I wanted to talk to you more
at the Red Fish Bar.)

330
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,759
(But I didn't know
how to start a conversation with girls.)

331
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
(I had to buy you a drink.)

332
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,759
You're here.

333
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,959
I'm about to leave. Why did you come?

334
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,719
I couldn't sleep,
so I came down to have a look.

335
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,360
Yin Guo is also here.

336
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,880
Let me introduce her.

337
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,880
This is Yin Guo, Yiyang's girlfriend.

338
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,319
I see. Nice to meet you, Yin Guo.

339
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:21,440
I'm younger than you. Just call me Guo.

340
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:26,120
Sounds nice. Well, I gotta go.

341
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,799
Okay.

342
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,840
Bye.

343
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,360
Bye.

344
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,559
Small world, huh?

345
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:45,319
Many players
from Dongxin City have come.

346
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,680
And you happened to run into Chengyan.

347
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,239
Not surprising.
Anyway, we'll meet at the competition.

348
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,184
Yes.

349
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,479
I'll give you a heads-up.

350
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,440
Lin Yiyang is handsome.

351
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,360
Many girls from Dongxin City

352
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,440
pursued him.

353
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:13,880
Listen to me.

354
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,160
It's no big deal.

355
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,799
It doesn't matter
if they still think about him.

356
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,120
You must be proud.

357
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,200
You're the only one who takes him down.

358
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,200
And he pursued you.

359
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,880
He liked you at first sight.

360
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,719
Happy now? Let's go eat fried chicken.

361
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,160
I hung around last night.

362
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,080
I found a good restaurant.

363
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:56,799
I'm on a diet.

364
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,440
Come on.

365
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,719
I was asked to get down
right after a bath.

366
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,039
I have to have a big meal

367
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,279
to make myself happy.

368
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:10,799
You know what?

369
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,999
Back in high school,
a girl confessed her love to him.

370
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:15,559
On the stage at a gathering,

371
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,080
a beam of light came down.

372
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,680
The girl, standing in the middle,
expressed her love to him.

373
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:23,519
All my classmates stood up.

374
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:24,959
More than that.

375
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:30,239
He got love letters,
paper cranes, and stars.

376
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,680
The girls were
from my school or sports team.

377
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,959
And his competitors.

378
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,279
You don't know how much I envied him.

379
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,640
Among those people,

380
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,440
Chengyan pursued him violently.

381
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,264
Initially, Meng Xiaodong wanted
to poach her.

382
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:45,356
But she refused.

383
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,640
I believe she stays in Dongxin City now
because of Lin Yiyang.

384
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,479
Xiaodong never mentioned this.

385
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
She's older than you.

386
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,440
You were little when she became famous.

387
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,559
She's from the same generation
as Xiaodong and Yiyang.

388
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,400
It's not surprising.

389
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,239
What's wrong?

390
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,999
Are you here to help
or to make things worse?

391
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,999
(Your girlfriend is happy now.
Don't worry.)

392
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:13,640
There are altogether 64 people
in this tournament.

393
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,480
In this tournament,
we have the group of death.

394
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,719
This half includes the champion

395
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,000
of the last China Open,

396
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,839
the champion and the second place
of the Singapore Open,

397
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:26,239
and the champion and the second place
of the last world championships.

398
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,080
Oh, yeah. This group is packed
with the best of the best.

399
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,520
Every player is skilled
to make it to the finals.

400
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,056
(Day One of the competition)

401
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,439
How come you didn't tell me earlier?

402
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,160
I had to grab you some food from others.

403
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,799
Enjoy it.

404
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,080
It's his first time joining a big game.

405
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,000
His mindset isn't stable.

406
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,319
Mr. Qian is usually better.

407
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:40,960
I just watched the match.
Yin Guo won consecutive games.

408
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,719
Didn't you call to congratulate her?

409
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,424
No.

410
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:50,560
Unbelievable.

411
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,799
Chinese player Yin Guo
defeated the Russian veteran Noi Avilina,

412
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:16,359
seven to three in the last game,

413
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:17,640
then led by seven to one,

414
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,520
defeated Margaret from Poland.

415
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,839
Congratulations to her
for qualifying in advance.

416
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,656
(Day Three of the competition)

417
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,319
Congrats, Yin Guo.

418
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,640
Congratulations.

419
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,816
Yin Guo.

420
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,399
Hao.

421
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:40,239
Yin Guo, you're amazing.

422
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,319
How about you? What's your ranking?

423
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:45,319
I almost made it to the top 16.

424
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,919
I'm far behind you.

425
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,279
I got nervous in the game.

426
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:52,279
No worries.
It's normal in your first game.

427
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,160
I'm going to eat something.

428
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,879
Alright, go ahead.

429
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,319
Sit and take a break.
Have something to eat.

430
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:07,759
Try this. This is tasty.

431
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:08,439
This is also good.

432
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,040
My phone is out of power.
I'll eat over there.

433
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,712
Go ahead.

434
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:33,480
Yiyang.

435
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,279
Yiyang.

436
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:52,359
You're back.

437
00:40:56,839 --> 00:40:57,359
I'm back.

438
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:06,960
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

439
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,799
Yiyang.

440
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:08,424
Yiyang.

441
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,399
He is Lin Yiyang, Jiang Yang's junior.

442
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,264
Yiyang.

443
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,200
Excuse me.

444
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,799
Surprisingly, he overcame his pride
and came back to watch the game.

445
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,160
Brother, it seems I'm eager to win

446
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:13,960
and make it to the finals.

447
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:20,919
I hope he will see my game.

448
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:33,640
What did you just call me?

449
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,632
Brother?

450
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,919
You often call Meng Xiaodong brother.

451
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,600
Can't you do the same to me?

452
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,600
What songs?

453
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:06,000
Didn't you say you might not come?

454
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,040
Why did you suddenly show up?

455
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,728
You didn't tell me in advance

456
00:43:10,728 --> 00:43:11,980
You just scared me.

457
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:14,560
You almost gave me a heart attack.

458
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:16,759
Aren't you expecting me?

459
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,399
You know the answer.
