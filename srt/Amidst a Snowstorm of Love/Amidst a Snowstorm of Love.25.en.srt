=Episode 25=

25
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,639
I remember that in the past,

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,959
there were only three pool tables.

27
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,160
Everybody

28
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,239
lined up for training.

29
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,679
As young players

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
hadn't played in major events,

31
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,760
we were last ones in line

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,160
and had to give time

33
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:55,999
to the pros.

34
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,999
The rule of Dongxin City

35
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:02,639
is really nice,

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,559
opportunities

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,359
for those who are most in need.

38
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,040
Mr. He has a big family.

39
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,239
So

40
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,320
we have to wait here.

41
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:17,919
The venue is all set up,

42
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,119
arranged by myself.

43
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:22,600
Tomorrow morning,

44
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,799
I'll go fetch them at Mr. He's.

45
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,399
The rest

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,880
will be handled by Dongxin City.

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,679
You don't need to worry too much.

48
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,079
If you don't want to talk,

49
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,200
then don't.

50
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,320
We are here to keep you company.

51
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,359
By the way,

52
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,040
yesterday, when you got clothes

53
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
at my house,

54
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,760
my mom didn't say anything, did she?

55
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,600
No, there were many people
at your place,

56
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,399
all from the billiard association.

57
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,000
I just took my clothes and left

58
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,239
to avoid talking to them.

59
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,280
Did you contact him?

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
Not yet,

61
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,679
I think, anyway,

62
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,839
we are going to meet today.

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,359
So I didn't bother him.

64
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,639
Today's the memorial service.

65
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:00,959
They must have been

66
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,119
very busy last night.

67
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,799
Our family doesn't know about

68
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:04,720
your open tournament yet.

69
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,239
But don't treat our parents as fools.

70
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,760
Mr. He's been talking

71
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,560
to your mom.

72
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:10,959
They had to be feeling suspicious.

73
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
They've also asked me.

74
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,399
What did you say?

75
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:16,800
I said

76
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,760
I knew it from the start.

77
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,279
I brought you two together.

78
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,279
I've long known I'd take this blow,

79
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,839
and already gave my dad a heads-up.

80
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,839
I'm waiting for the right time
to solve it.

81
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,399
Your mom has been

82
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,360
taking me to events,

83
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,360
we've been close.

84
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,760
I will take the first blow for you.

85
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,039
You'll be fine.

86
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,360
I hope so.

87
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,800
The main thing is Lin Yiyang himself.

88
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,200
The way he's behaved

89
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,519
since coming back

90
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
has been impressive enough,

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
achieving

92
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,719
China's best result
in the open competition,

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,320
making peace with his mentor,

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,920
and now

95
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
taking over Dongxin City.

96
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,159
He has long

97
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,240
impressed everyone.

98
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,200
Don't worry.

99
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,320
I think your mom looks fine.

100
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,279
She's not angry.

101
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:09,880
Thanks.

102
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,360
But withdrawing from the competition,

103
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,279
you don't just lose the results,

104
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,200
but our parents might think

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,079
that you're love-struck

106
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,959
and irresponsible.

107
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,000
But that's not me.

108
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,120
Congratulations

109
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,680
on another championship.

110
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,240
Finally, a smile.

111
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,880
It seems that

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,680
the game or even the championship

113
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,839
can't make me happy.

114
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:41,560
I just want to

115
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
see him as soon as possible.

116
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,440
Go ahead.

117
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,039
They went to fetch Jiang Yang.

118
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,440
Should be here soon,

119
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,279
I'll go check.

120
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,200
Thank you.

Please take care of her.

129
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,560
I'll go inside.

for coming to the

133
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,240
memorial service for He Wenfeng.

134
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,520
Mr. He Wenfeng

135
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,239
was the founder of Dongxin City

136
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,440
with countless disciples.

137
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,800
Though he never participated in

138
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:36,680
international events

139
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,119
or had a world ranking.

140
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,999
The people he has taught

141
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,079
and influenced

142
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,599
are countless.

143
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,839
I'm very grateful to everyone

144
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,560
from around the world

145
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,719
for coming today.

146
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,079
I'm happy to meet my

147
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,680
senior and junior

148
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:02,599
fellow students,

149
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,560
relatives, and friends.

150
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,759
Those who made it here,

151
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,680
I believe we are all one family.

152
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Lastly, I have one more thing,

153
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:15,640
while everyone is here today

154
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Mrs. He has instructed me

155
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,640
to tell you all.

156
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,119
Mr. He's last wish before he passed away

157
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,599
was to have his last disciple,

158
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
Lin Yiyang,

159
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,440
in charge of Dongxin City.

160
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:42,959
Lin Yiyang and I

161
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,719
have both agreed on this matter.

162
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,920
So the new head of Dongxin City

163
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:49,759
Is Lin Yiyang.

164
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,784
Mrs. He.

165
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,479
He's said everything

166
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,200
I wanted to say today.

167
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,560
Here,

168
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,839
on behalf of Mr. He,

169
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,879
I thank you all,

170
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,239
thank you all,

171
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
for coming to see him off one last time.

172
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,640
Ms. Wu.

173
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,920
Thank you.

174
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,920
Thank you.

175
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,712
Thank you.

176
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,200
Thank you.

177
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,392
Thank you.

178
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,599
Thank you.

179
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,560
Thank you.

180
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,896
Thank you.

181
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,119
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

182
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,879
My condolences.

183
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,479
Thank you.

184
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,320
My condolences to you.

185
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,599
Thank you.

186
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,280
Condolences.

187
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,839
Thank you.

188
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,800
Mom. Tired from a long flight?

189
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm fine.

190
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,920
I couldn't talk

191
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,200
with my colleague here.

192
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:49,839
You look pale.

193
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:51,719
Didn't sleep on the plane?

194
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:52,920
I did.

195
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,479
Perhaps I'm just tired

196
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,280
after the long flight.

197
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,752
Let's go home.

198
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,032
Aunt.

199
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,200
Go home with us.

200
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,520
Grandma is home, wants to have dinner with you.

201
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,359
Okay. I'll follow you.

202
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:07,528
Okay.

203
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,719
Mom.

204
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
I...

205
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:14,959
Can I...

206
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
go back later?

207
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,920
Grandma really misses you.

208
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,479
Won't you go see her first?

209
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,759
I won't be too late.

210
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,280
I'll go back as soon as I can, okay?

211
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,040
Go ahead.

212
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,200
Don't be too late.

213
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,879
Thank you, Mom.

214
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,999
Aren't you afraid of being seen?

215
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,239
My mom already knows.

216
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,520
My brother told Mom

217
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,959
that he brought the two of us together.

218
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,959
Where are you planning to go?

219
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,479
Heading back to Dongxin City.

220
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,959
Let's go.

221
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,320
I'll go back with you.

222
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:55,839
Go.

223
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,839
First time here?

224
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,680
I had a visit once

225
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,640
when I was very young.

226
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,119
But it seemed

227
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,079
that this building didn't exist then.

228
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,239
Yiyang has returned.

229
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:57,959
Who else came back?

230
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,239
Not many. They all go out for a meal.

231
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,999
I hurried back to send some parcels

232
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,200
to the visa agency.

233
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,079
So I'm back first.

234
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
I'll be off, Yiyang.

235
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,560
Goodbye.

236
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,536
Bye-bye.

237
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,320
Bye-bye.

238
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,944
Bye-bye.

239
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:16,920
Yiyang.

240
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Yiyang.

241
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:21,480
Yiyang.

242
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,200
Are you okay?

243
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:27,479
I'm fine.

244
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,040
She holds a high status in Dongxin City,

245
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
calling you Yiyang.

246
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,440
Yes, she came in

247
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,600
about the same time as Lin Lin.

248
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,559
Of course she calls me that.

249
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:24,920
You must be thinking

250
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,759
that after I got back,

251
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,719
I'd come here every day,

252
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:32,519
so I get to see her every day.

253
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,559
Training, competitions,

254
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:40,999
seeing each other every day.

255
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,239
But the two of us

256
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:45,880
don't see each other much.

257
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,519
Before I returned to the country,

258
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,880
we really had little time together.

259
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,200
But I'm still yours.

260
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,559
Last night,

261
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,999
you all stayed here?

262
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,120
Right.

263
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,959
No one could sleep.

264
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,559
We gathered in the office

265
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,479
until morning.

266
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,680
I'm not feeling well.

267
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,200
Take a nap.

268
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,999
Take a nap then.

269
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,799
It wasn't until last night

270
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,239
that I decided to take it over.

271
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,799
My stuff

272
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,160
is still in my club.

273
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,719
The dormitory here

274
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,120
hasn't been tidied up yet.

275
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,519
I can only

276
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,039
sleep here these days.

277
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,080
But it seems

278
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,999
I can only rest assured

279
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,479
after I come back.

280
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,999
Get some rest.

281
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,319
Brother, find a home.

282
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,479
You suffered

283
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,479
too much for me in the past.

284
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,719
Later on, I was adopted.

285
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,680
The prize money I won

286
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,279
was all spent on food

287
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,160
and practice books.

288
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,360
Now, you see,

289
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,160
I've settled down.

290
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,120
Isn't it time you

291
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,920
got your own home?

292
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,920
Meng Xiaodong called Jiang Yang.

293
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,120
Jiang Yang asked me

294
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,319
to wake you up

295
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,600
and tell you not to be late.

296
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:58,999
You've just returned,

297
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,799
the family is waiting for you.

298
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,039
Got it.

299
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,080
What's up?

300
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,479
It's hard to order delivery
after the rain.

301
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
We can order together

302
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,719
if Yiyang wants.

303
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,120
Yin Guo is here.

304
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,479
Still here?

305
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,999
It's almost ten o'clock.

306
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,160
They're hiding this

307
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,759
from families,

308
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,600
aren't they?

309
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,239
Aren't they

310
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,519
afraid of getting caught?

311
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,080
What's it to you?

312
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,200
Let's go.

313
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,999
Order more, I'm hungry too.

314
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,440
Thought I'd wake up in the afternoon,

315
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,880
now I slept through the night.

316
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,880
You guys are exhausted.

317
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,080
Your place here

318
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,959
is much bigger than the old Bei City.

319
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,719
At the beginning,

320
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,559
we only had this office

321
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,200
and a few pool tables.

322
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
The year I left the club,

323
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,080
Jiang Yang took over.

324
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,600
Everything that followed

325
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,080
was all thanks to him.

326
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,519
My brother mentioned this.

327
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:29,959
What did he say?

328
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,840
He said

329
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,999
Jiang Yang was young

330
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,999
when he took over,

331
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,319
just over twenty.

332
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,999
He was the leader of Dongxin City
for over a decade.

333
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,920
In fact, there wasn't much money made.

334
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
It was all out of passion,

335
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,920
and genuine love.

336
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,039
His arm surgery should have

337
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,799
been done long ago.

338
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,160
It's been delayed because of the club.

339
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,640
His best decade

340
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,479
has been devoted

341
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:05,920
to the Dongxin City.

342
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,840
Otherwise, he'd have

343
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,759
a better personal record.

344
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,959
Hopefully

345
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,039
he can have years of freedom,

346
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,719
just playing games,

347
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,799
as my way of compensating him.

348
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,360
Why

349
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,360
suddenly decided to
take over Dongxin City?

350
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,319
At first, I didn't want to take it.

351
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,519
One reason is

352
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,920
I felt bad for Mr. He.

353
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,600
And because my philosophy was different.

354
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,519
Jiang wanted to leverage
the star players

355
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,479
to strengthen industry.

356
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,640
But I want to

357
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,319
cultivate a cultural atmosphere
similar to snooker's origins.

358
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,880
So originally, my plan
was to go solo when I got home.

359
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,999
But after talking with Mr. He,

360
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,519
I found that he,

361
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,799
in fact, he was supporting me.

362
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,479
It's late.

363
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,080
Let's go.

364
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,440
When we came over during the day,

365
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,840
I saw some kids coming over to practice.

366
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,840
Does Dongxin City recruit

367
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,880
such young players now?

368
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:10,279
No,

369
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,799
it's a hobby class.

370
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,360
The club opens for a few days each week

371
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,279
to the public.

372
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,799
Players from less affluent families act

373
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:18,999
as sparring partners

374
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,479
to earn some extra money.

375
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,440
We do this in Bei City too.

376
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:24,719
But

377
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,640
we don't run hobby classes

378
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,319
in the club.

379
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,279
The players

380
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,200
would go out to work.

381
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,799
Xiran.

382
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,120
You're here.

383
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,160
- You...
- Haven't gone back yet?

384
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:40,840
I had a class today,

385
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:42,880
teaching children.

386
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,440
Grab a bite before you go.

387
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,959
Mr. Meng is still waiting.

388
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,039
Shall we wait?

389
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,400
No need. I won't be back soon.

390
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,160
But I remember Xiran

391
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:12,959
never had a club,

392
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,959
she always competed independently.

393
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,319
She used to be with Dongxin City.

394
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Then she retired.

395
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,959
Recently, someone in her family was sick

396
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,200
so she had to come back for money.

397
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
Jiang Yang let her train in the club

398
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,840
for free,

399
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,360
and be a sparring partner.

400
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,959
But technically,

401
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,880
she's not a member of Dongxin City.

402
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,799
There is no need

403
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:38,840
to share the prize money

404
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,440
with the club.

405
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:41,640
No wonder,

406
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,479
her registration information

407
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,519
for the tournaments

408
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,039
always left

409
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:46,999
the club field blank.

410
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,200
She was the last person
Jiang Yang took in

411
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,680
before stepping down.

412
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,279
He made me promise

413
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,959
to take good care of her.

414
00:30:58,479 --> 00:30:59,999
The dedication Jiang Yang

415
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,600
showed to Dongxin City for over a decade

416
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:03,880
is not something

417
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,600
just anyone could achieve.

418
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,440
Morality and loyalty,

419
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,279
that's all I can think of.

420
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,120
Every time I see

421
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,239
people from Dongxin City,

422
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,440
I get this feeling.

423
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,799
You read too many martial arts novels.

424
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,559
No.

425
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:27,784
Let's go.

426
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,160
I got to go back to where I'm staying

427
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,239
to get something.

428
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,400
It's okay. It's fine
if the dorm is not ready,

429
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,840
I'll make do in the office
few more days.

430
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,479
Luckily,
you're taking over Dongxin City.

431
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,400
You know everyone.

432
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,759
Some of them have watched you grow up.

433
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,279
Though inherent impressions
might be hard to change,

434
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,360
they won't give you hard time.

435
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,584
Understood.

436
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,039
I am well-versed

437
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:07,279
in Dongxin City.

438
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,039
You don't need to

439
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,640
tell me anything.

440
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,840
It's you I'm worried about.

441
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,239
I'll be doing fine.

442
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,519
I want you to worry less

443
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:16,600
and rest more.

444
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:18,880
If you're not fine,

445
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,680
my efforts would be wasted,
wouldn't they?

446
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,160
Yiyang,

447
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,719
don't talk like that.

448
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,279
Mr. He really had

449
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,279
high hopes for you.

450
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:32,999
He hoped that Dongxin City

451
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,920
could be reformed.

452
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,200
In the past,

453
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,680
Dongxin City was a pioneer.

454
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:40,640
And in the future,

455
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,319
he hoped that it can be

456
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,319
more than a club, but also

457
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,719
a contributor to the industry.

458
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,360
Understood.

459
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:52,712
Well,

460
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,239
the nurse just came over.

461
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,039
I have a bit of a fever.

462
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,200
Need to sleep now.

463
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,600
Go ahead.

464
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,759
See you once things settle down.

465
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,319
Bye.

466
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:12,552
(Mr. Chen)

467
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,840
Coach of the club.

468
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:16,719
Hello, Mr. Chen.

469
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,479
No, go ahead.

470
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,112
Right.

471
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,880
No problem.

472
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,999
Let's do it tomorrow morning.

473
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,360
The intersection just now,

474
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:46,880
the house on the very edge

475
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,719
is my house.

476
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:52,232
Got it.

477
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,920
You've been on the phone the whole way

478
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,959
and hardly spoke to me.

479
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,360
I just took it over,

480
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,120
it's all work.

481
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:21,160
I know.

482
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,319
I'm not complaining.

483
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,759
I just

484
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,479
feel bad for you.

485
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:34,999
Be good.

486
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,719
I don't think

487
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,559
I can be with you these days.

488
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,840
It's not that I want you to be with me.

489
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:52,640
Actually, I want to be with you.

490
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,400
But

491
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:57,640
I am not

492
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,640
very good at comforting people.

493
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,440
I don't know what to say.

494
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:04,200
It's just

495
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:07,920
having you here is enough.

496
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,759
You've only been back for three days.

497
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,680
Feels like you've lost a lot of weight,

498
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,160
and your clothes don't fit anymore.

499
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,959
Not really.

500
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:33,239
It's just I haven't had

501
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,680
much rest lately.

502
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,559
When you go back later,

503
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,440
drive slowly.

504
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,680
I've been so nervous watching out

505
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,680
for you all along.

506
00:35:58,959 --> 00:35:59,519
Okay.

507
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:01,999
Understood.

508
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,279
I gotta go.

509
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,120
Go ahead.

510
00:37:58,439 --> 00:37:59,120
Grandma.

511
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
You've finally come back.

512
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,080
Why are you still up?

513
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,279
How could I

514
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:07,319
sleep tonight?

515
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,279
I was waiting for you to come back
so we could chat.

516
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:11,919
Where's my mom?

517
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:16,919
Your mom and Xiaodong
are talking upstairs.

518
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:18,719
Let them be,

519
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:19,919
we'll have our own chat.

520
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,799
Have a seat.

521
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,040
Okay.

522
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:26,680
You missed me, right?

523
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,984
Brother.

524
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,359
You lured me here.

525
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:37,719
Now you don't need me?

526
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,000
Don't be silly.

527
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,879
Isn't it nice to manage
this billiard room?

528
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm also in charge of that

529
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,640
billiard room by myself.

530
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:46,719
What about your dreams?

531
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,919
Your ambitions? Your plans?

532
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:49,759
We agreed to
strive for success together.

533
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,319
But now you chose to

534
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,200
work with your old pals.

535
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,439
Jiang Yang was injured

536
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,439
and needs some rest.

537
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,919
Take my return

538
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,439
as a temporary relief.

539
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Be sensible, got it?

540
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:03,496
Careful with the renovation,

541
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,239
I'll come back to check when it opens.

542
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,319
If there's anything

543
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,239
that you can't decide on,

544
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:09,640
call me anytime,

545
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,279
just like before.

546
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:13,839
From now on,

547
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,160
you'll be in charge of this place.

548
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,319
I'll do the real work.

549
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,319
So this isn't a real work?

550
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:21,879
This is a family matter.

551
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,839
Want some chicken wings?

552
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,759
I can get some.

553
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:27,919
Don't bother.

554
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:28,879
I'm leaving.

555
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,600
Anyway,

556
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,640
if you ever miss my cooking,

557
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:33,640
feel free to come back.

558
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:34,919
This is home.

559
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:50,319
Yiyang.

560
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:52,040
I think

561
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,799
you and Yin Guo are doing well.

562
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,520
How about settling down?

563
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,839
I have

564
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,600
decided she's the one for me.

565
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,040
Being together

566
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
for two years and four months,

567
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,160
we haven't spent much time together.

568
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,879
We need more time.

569
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:25,480
What I've shown her

570
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,839
has always been my best self.

571
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:32,000
She rarely sees me in bad moods,

572
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,399
feeling annoyed, discouraged,

573
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:36,799
depressed,

574
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,239
and lacking confidence.

575
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,200
I fear she'll be disappointed once

576
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,439
she knows me better.

577
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,600
And also

578
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,080
she has just graduated.

579
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,279
I think neither she

580
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,279
nor her parents would

581
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,080
want us to get married so soon.

582
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:34,960
Haven't I told you all

583
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,560
that we can talk tomorrow?

584
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,319
Go back to rest first.

585
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,239
You young folks

586
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,839
talk about stepping down

587
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,279
and taking over like it's nothing,

588
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,719
leaving us old folks

589
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
feeling pretty anxious.

590
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,239
We've invited all the coaches

591
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,399
here today,

592
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,600
along with the leaders of each group,

593
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,319
plus the folks from

594
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:55,799
accounting, logistics,

595
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,520
canteen,

596
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:57,359
and dorms.

597
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,680
All the department heads

598
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,279
are gathered

599
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:00,560
in the meeting room.

600
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:11,640
Take these to the dorm.

601
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,600
Let's start.

602
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,759
Okay, let's go.

603
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,439
What time is it now?

604
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:28,560
What is this?

605
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,000
Having a meeting.

606
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,520
The saying goes
"new broom sweeps clean",

607
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:34,799
now Yiyang has to face a mess

608
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,200
as soon as he took office.

609
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:39,560
It's actually quite amusing.

610
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,680
He never yielded to anyone
since childhood.

611
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,480
Now,

612
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:43,359
as a leader,

613
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,319
with the responsibility on his shoulders

614
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,000
he has to soften up.

615
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,799
Still laughing?

616
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,080
Rest assured,

617
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,000
these guys are trouble-shooters,

618
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:54,040
they'll be fine.

619
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,719
This is just the beginning.

620
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,560
If he wants to make a difference

621
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,480
in Dongxin City,

622
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:01,160
this is inevitable.

623
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,680
Don't worry.

624
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,560
They are all people who get things done.

625
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,040
The main thing is,

626
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,160
they love Dongxin City too much.

627
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,680
They're worried about the change

628
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:13,520
in leadership disrupting the work.

629
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:15,319
I agree.

630
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,759
Plus,

631
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:18,680
Lin Lin is in charge of Nine-Ball.

632
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,640
She won't let Duncuo
be at a disadvantage.

633
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,560
This is the Lin Duo of Dongxin City,

634
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,359
the toughest back in the day.
