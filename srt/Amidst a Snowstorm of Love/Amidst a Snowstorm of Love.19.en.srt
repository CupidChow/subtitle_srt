=Episode 19=

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,039
I was too busy to eat lunch.

26
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:06,719
Have some.

27
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:09,672
Thank you.

28
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:16,879
I didn't dare ask you this
with my dad's around.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,320
Did your injury really need the surgery?

30
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,360
Yes, but it can be delayed.

31
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,760
Why? Have the surgery earlier,
you can recover sooner.

32
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,599
The club's got too much to do.

33
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,440
I am thinking I could talk to Yiyang

34
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,080
after the China Open.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
I didn't ask you just now,
how's Mr. He's check-up?

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,200
Same as usual.

37
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,320
I'll make you a fermented egg.
You need some nourishment.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,439
No, I'll be going now.

39
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,719
Already?

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,840
Wait. My mom wants
to give some stuff for Yiyang.

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,200
You take it over. I'm afraid
he won't accept it if I'll do it.

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,919
No, you keep it for Mr. He.

43
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,079
He's already got it. Just do as I say.
Hold it tight.

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,919
Take this too.

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,400
Enough.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,040
That's all.

47
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,240
My mom would have loved to see you

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,439
bring all this.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,680
Lin Yiyang has grown up in our family,
and they treat him like their son.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,159
You know it.

51
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,600
Okay, then you tell your mom
that I'll definitely take it to him

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,359
and make sure he eats it all, okay?

53
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:55,960
Okay.

54
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm leaving.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,719
Be careful, let me know when you arrive.

56
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,328
Okay.

57
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,919
You brought this?

58
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,200
Someone else gave it to me.
Share some with you.

59
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,119
Don't waste it,
eat it all up or I'll beat you.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,560
Got it.

61
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,399
I'm not a food waster anyway.

62
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,919
That's true.

63
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,600
When are you going to see Mr. He?

64
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,639
He's in poor health.

65
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,079
It would just make him
worse talking with me.

66
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,612
(What are you doing?)

67
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,039
This is the Nine-Ball table
you asked for.

68
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,920
I know you've prepared it for Yin Guo,

69
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,000
so I chose the best one.

70
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,360
You look bothered.

71
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:35,599
When are you going back?

72
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,680
It's obvious that you fought.

73
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,399
You are not
experienced in relationships.

74
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,240
Look how troubled you are.

75
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,839
When I had my first fight
with my first girlfriend,

76
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,159
I was pretty troubled too.

77
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
At that time, I thought
we were about to break up.

78
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,519
But later, I realized

79
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,039
that two can't be together
without fighting.

80
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,279
A relationship without fights
is not healthy.

81
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,680
The more you fight,
the better the relationship.

82
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:25,560
I had a few drinks.

83
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,360
I don't want to drive you,
get you a designated driver.

84
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
I'll sleep at your place.

85
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,599
No one comes to you anyway.

86
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,160
(Voice Call)

87
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:38,348
(Zheng Yi)

88
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,936
(Zheng Yi)

89
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,039
Hello.

90
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:00,039
What's the matter? You're not happy
to have your boyfriend back?

91
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:02,680
Have you two fought?

92
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,640
Really? Didn't he just arrive
on the flight last night?

93
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,599
You two are fighting so fast.

94
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,760
I'm not in the mood to joke.

95
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,920
I went out to sweep the tombs
with my family today.

96
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,920
I ran into him, and he greeted my mom.

97
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,680
He got upset, and then...

98
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,320
I've waited all night
for him to call me back.

99
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,760
Why don't you call him?

100
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,760
I don't want to.
I'm still upset and angry.

101
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Why can't he say sorry first?

102
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,240
And now you two are at loggerheads.

103
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,719
I'm going to the training camp tomorrow.

104
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,680
I was thinking of having dinner
with him tonight.

105
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,279
That's all gone.

106
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,760
Isn't he going to
participate in the China Open?

107
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,399
You have to train and he has to compete,

108
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,240
then you two won't see each other
for at least two months.

109
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,360
Isn't it like
a long-distance relationship?

110
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,000
If you two can't see
and touch each other,

111
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,440
it's like talking
to the air every day, boring.

112
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,239
Say something.

113
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,479
What should I say?
You're encouraging me to break up.

114
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:44,359
Well, I'm angry,
but it's not a big conflict.

115
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,479
Alright, I get it. Keep fighting, Guo.

116
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,999
I'm not going to talk anymore.
I need to sleep.

117
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:59,200
Alright, stop thinking wild.
Go to sleep.

118
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,160
Bye.

119
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,776
Good night.

120
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,359
What time is it?

121
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,200
Half past five.

122
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,479
Half past five? It's time to get up.

123
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,400
Wait downstairs for her
if you can't sleep.

124
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,359
Buy some breakfast
and say something sweet.

125
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,599
You know the men.

126
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,999
I'll get the bed if you don't sleep.

127
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,119
Ling, I'll put it here.

128
00:12:59,119 --> 00:12:59,688
Okay.

129
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,839
Why the rush?

130
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,400
I have to go.

131
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,239
Training matters,
but your health matters too.

132
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,320
Got it.

133
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,079
See you in two months.

134
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,959
I'll miss you.

135
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,759
Wait for me.

136
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:21,719
I'm off.

137
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,280
Take care.

138
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,448
Did you call a cab?

139
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,359
The club car will pick me up.

140
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,359
Why isn't Guo here yet?

141
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,400
She should be here soon.

142
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:35,920
Guo is here.

143
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,079
Guo.

144
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,920
Didn't you say your boyfriend
has returned, so you'd get there later?

145
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,719
Why did you ask us to pick you up?

146
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,440
Something came up.

147
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,239
Doesn't he know
your training camp lasts for two months?

148
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,999
Hold it for me.

149
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,759
(Bei City)
Okay, take it easy.

150
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:57,959
Good morning, Guo.

151
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,200
- Morning.
- Morning.

152
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,200
Hello, could you please open the door?

153
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,759
This is delicious, try some.

154
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,280
Wen Xiao.

155
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,160
Thank you.

156
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,119
Guo.

157
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,200
No, thank you.

158
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,239
This time our training coincides
with the Snooker China Open,

159
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,599
so we can't watch the competition.

160
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,200
Why didn't Lin Yiyang
participate in last year's China Open?

161
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,160
He didn't mention it.

162
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,160
What a shame. If he did it last year,

163
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,879
his ranking would be
higher than Jiang Yang's.

164
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:37,759
Not really. Jiang Yang
has always been in good condition.

165
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,560
I'll have another one.

166
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,239
Thank you.

167
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,999
(Are you awake? I want to talk to you.)

168
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,120
We've arrived.

169
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,879
We've reached the service area.
You can get off and take a walk.

170
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,599
I'll stay.

171
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,400
You can go to restaurant
to have breakfast.

172
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,239
(Bei City)
Sir, when do we leave?

173
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,359
In thirty minutes.

174
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,160
Okay.

175
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:50,959
Why don't you get off?

176
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,359
I ate at home
and I don't want to get off.

177
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,320
Then I leave the door open.

178
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,479
Just keep an eye on it
and I'll be right back.

179
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,128
Okay.

180
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,032
Hello.

181
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,400
Still mad at me?

182
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,040
I'm in your community
and brought you breakfast.

183
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,680
If you wake up, come out and have some.

184
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:30,079
But don't rush. I'll wait for you.

185
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,560
I-I'm not home anymore.

186
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,440
I am out of province
for closed training.

187
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:46,640
You didn't call me last night.

188
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,759
I got mad today
and decided to leave this morning.

189
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,560
Otherwise, we could have met.

190
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,640
Say something.

191
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,959
Someone's coming soon,
then I can't talk on the phone.

192
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,999
Let me know if you're back.

193
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,360
I miss you. Then that's it.

No big deal. I had a little fight
with your mom yesterday,

219
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,120
and she ignored me all night.

220
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:35,039
I'm just worried she might be still mad.

221
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:39,239
So I want you to call her
and take her out shopping.

222
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,600
I'll pay and you'll treat her

I washed them every day, but I just
didn't want to wash them yesterday.

227
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,200
So I got scolded by my wife.

228
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,959
I couldn't resist talking back to her.

229
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,559
Thinking back, it's just washing socks

230
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,400
and for my own grandson.
I lost my temper for a moment.

231
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,680
Right.

232
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,600
Your training camp is so long,

233
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,640
why don't you stay home

Being an athlete is so tough,
it's rare to have a holiday.

235
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,120
Sir, I just remembered
I left something at home.

236

I need to go get it. Just have Wen Xiao

00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:01,840
How are you going back?

241
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,559
I'll take a cab.

242
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,360
I need to borrow a suit,
have to meet someone today.

243
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,200
To meet a girl?

244
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,200
We met through a blind date.
A girl who just got divorced last year.

245
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,279
She's quite nice, met her twice.

246
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,640
If things go well,
I'll get married before you.

247
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,200
I don't want to date anymore,
it's tiring.

248
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,200
Seeing you like that last night,
I felt tired for you.

249
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,796
(2021 Harley-Davidson Motorbike)

250
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,160
This is for the girl?

251
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:46,479
Hurry up and go.
It's not good to keep the girl waiting.

252
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm not done.

253
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,616
In the relationship,

254
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:57,519
at first, everything looks good,

255
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,200
but everything turns wrong over time.

256
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,239
You have to adapt
to the good and the bad.

257
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,999
I have experience in this,
I'll tell you more when I get back.

258
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,880
Seeing you like that last night,
I knew you're really not good at this.

259
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,319
You were so restless,
kept me up all night.

260
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
Look at these dark circles
under my eyes.

261
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
I'll never sleep here anymore.
I'm leaving.

262
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,160
Off you go.

263
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,239
Sun Yao.

264
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,400
Keep an eye on the renovation.
I'll sleep.

265
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,600
Okay.

266
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,279
Catch up to me.

267
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:00,880
Caught you.

268
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,440

269

270

271
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
Yes, I got home yesterday.

272
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,840
Dad, play with me.

273
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,440
You want to play this? I will
play with you after finishing the call.

274
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
Then hurry up
and play on the slide with me.

275
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,920
Okay, I'll be there soon.

276
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,680
Where were we just now?

277
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,640
If you don't have time
to take care of your daughter lately,

278
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,719
you can bring her to me.

279
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,120
Oh no, she's too much trouble.

280
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,559
Besides, didn't you just
get back from abroad?

281
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,400
Are you that free?

282
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,559
My girlfriend likes Yo.

283
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,600
Just bring her over if you want.

284
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
To make my girlfriend happy.

285
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,559
So you want to use my daughter?

286
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,719
Why don't you two
just have one of your own?

287
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,239
Got stood up?

288
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:08,440
I got them up,
letting them to go ahead first.

289
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,239
Say hi to your daughter. Bye.

290
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,719
Aren't you in training?

291
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:27,880
I don't want you to feel bad
and affect the competition.

292
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,039
I just come to see you
and then I'll leave.

293
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:49,959
Do you feel sorry for me?

294
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:56,160
I feel sorry for you, but you don't.

295
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,039
Even if you don't come to me,

296
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,519
I will still drive to see you tonight.

297
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,880
Sweet-talker.

298
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,416
I can't stand fighting with you,

299
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,840
so I didn't sleep last night.

300
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:21,319
I was going to go see you last night,

301
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,640
but I was afraid I'd say something wrong
and make you unhappy.

302
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,319
That's why I decided

303
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,039
to apologize this morning.

304
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,360
I argued with my sister twice yesterday.

305
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:48,479
It's all about you,
yet you still yelled at me,

306
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
for no reason.

307
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,160
It's annoying to see
that disciple of Meng Xiaodong.

308
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,039
I have nothing to do with him,
and you know it.

309
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:08,840
Chengyan didn't even
talk to me in front of you.

310
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,912
Yet you keep mentioning it.

311
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,920
I-I... You...

312
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,072
When do you need to go back?

313
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,999
There's no specific time, just tonight.

314
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,239
We still have time.

315
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:38,640
I have a question.

316
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,200
Who told me she is so easy to coax?

317
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,239
Just some tasty treats will do.

318
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,896
Just wanted to get you cherries,

319
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,039
you didn't even look back
even I called you. Quite the temper.

320
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,519
The door is unlocked.

321
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,600
No one will come in.

322
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,880
You'd do so every time we meet.

323
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:44,160
Haven't seen you over two months,

324
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,239
if I don't do so,

325
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,360
then you should consider
changing a boyfriend.

326
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,160
Right, I have something to show you.

328
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,039
Fruit.

329
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:24,160
Little fruit, Little Guo, Guo,
they're all you.

330
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,719
You didn't even tell me.

331
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,880
Now I do.

332
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,680
I wore it because I was always floating,

333
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:42,959
without any direction,
so there's no pointer.

334
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,279

even made a joke about it.

00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,759
I've never been polite to you.

358
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,624
♪Ever did I think, to ever have you♪

359
00:32:19,624 --> 00:32:23,016
♪And kiss you♪

360
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,600
So that's why you were
upset with me yesterday?

361
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,519
What? Why?

362
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,479
You don't remember
your ex-boyfriend's name?

363
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,799
He's not my ex-boyfriend, really.

364
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,160
He really isn't my ex-boyfriend.
I am not lying.

365
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,160
Alright, I get it.

366
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,160
Where are you off to?

367
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:06,719
Get you something delicious.

368
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,400
Lin Yiyang, do you have any creativity?
Always the same old trick.

369
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,400
Had a dream?

370
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,719
How do you know?

371
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,840
I saw you smiling.

372
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,840
I can't believe I've been dreaming
about your little apartment in Helsin.

373
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,360
That apartment's been vacated.

374
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,759
I'll have to stay in the hotel
when I go there.

375
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,479
Actually,

376
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,360
you were relaxed there, weren't you?

377
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:29,239
I didn't feel like you
when I saw you offering tea yesterday.

378
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,600
Actually, that wasn't
really me there either.

379
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:44,908
I went abroad to study

380
00:34:46,824 --> 00:34:49,999
because I felt that my work was boring
and there's nothing to pursue,

381
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,360
and I thought study
might open up my horizon.

382
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,279
Actually, I've always wanted to compete,

383
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,400
just can't get past my pride,

384
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,600
so just kept floating.

385
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,479
Alright, time to get up.

386
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,120
No, I want to hold you more.

387
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,160
Yin Guo, it's been a long time.

388
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:56,400
Why don't you guys talk
and I'll meet you downstairs? Bye.

389
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:03,120
You got her back yourself?
You catch on fast.

390
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,000
Mind your own business.
I have to drive her back.

391
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,080
You ungrateful punk.

392
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,319
I drove your car back
from the blind date without a break.

393
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,279
Key. It's a good sign
to give your girlfriend the first ride.

394
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,839
Thanks. How's your blind date?

395
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,439
Just wanted to tell you.

396
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:31,319
Hold on. Tell me when I get back.

397
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:33,239
I need to take her first, wait for me.

398
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:33,919
When?

399
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:36,000
Seven or eight hours for a round trip.

400
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:41,000
2 AM then? Come back early.

401
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,719
Why bother to ask
if you don't have time?

402
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,040
Yin Guo.

403
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,960
I just looked over there,
this place of yours is quite big.

404
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,640
Yes, it's much bigger than
the one in the basement.

405
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Have you been to Bei City?
That's where I train.

406
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,080
I think this might be
even bigger than Bei City.

407
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,279
No, I've been here all day
since I got back with Yiyang.

408
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,839
Yiyang didn't say he'd take me,
and I didn't dare to ask.

409
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,200
You've worked hard. I'll take you
to visit Bei City if I can.

410
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,784
Okay.

411
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,359
Yiyang.

412
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,120
Let's go.

413
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,960
Okay, goodbye, Yin Guo.

414
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,576
I'm off.

415
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,839
A new car?

416
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:56,759
I don't think you know the way.
It's quite a change from the past.

417
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,759
There's GPS.

418
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,640
Then I wish you get the championship.

419
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,359
Thank you.

420
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,680
But still, be careful.
My brother and Jiang Yang are there.

421
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:16,200
We're all old rivals,
there's nothing to fear.

422
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:29,560
I'll reply this.

423
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,680
What time is it now? It's already dark.

424
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,640
So what if it's dark?
You still have to go.

425
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:42,359
It seems to be Lin Lin.
She's just arrived too.

426
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,799
I've been waiting for you for two hours.

427
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,439
I was in training.

428
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,359
You said you were training.

429
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,879
You told me to bring you something.

430
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:51,000
You're training and
not answering the phone.

431
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,960
I think you guys
in Dongxin City are so close,

432
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,399
like brothers and sisters.

433
00:38:57,439 --> 00:39:00,960
Not like us in Bei City,
where everything is managed strictly.

434
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:05,480
Survival of the fittest applies
to both the students and the coaches.

435
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,120
Can you apologize today?

436
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:26,092
Well,

437
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:32,719
are there many fighting
after getting married?

438
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:38,000
I have a sister-in-law.

439
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,000
She was in confinement
just in time for my winter break.

440
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,560
So I spent a lot of time at their house.

441
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,520
During that time, I watched
them fighting every day,

442
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:53,279
from whom should change the diapers,
what kind of formula to feed,

443
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:55,160
to if my sister-in-law
has to work in the future.

444
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:58,799
My sister-in-law is so independent

445
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,520
that she prepared the divorce agreement
during her confinement.

446
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,839
She left with the baby.

447
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,839
So is my family.
When I was little, my sister told me

448
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,919
my mom and her ex-husband
were always fighting.

449
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:21,359
So I find marriage so scary.

450
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,279
Everyone is different.

451
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,799
But why does one have to get married?

452
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,759
Just be together if two are in a good
relationship without getting married.

453
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:44,359
There's no point in getting married
if two are in a bad relationship, right?

454
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:46,520
Have you ever thought about this?

455
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,439
Yes. For me,

456
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,319
as long as it's you.

457
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:14,480
And I've said it,

458
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,480
we'll go at your pace,
I will adapt to you.

459
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,359
Head coach.

460
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:35,976
You are here.

461
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:38,000
I got held up at home.

462
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,520
Xiaodong sent Nine-Ball players
from their club to come over.

463
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,759
He talked to me for a while.

464
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,600
Don't you two know each other?
Have a chat.

465
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:52,040
This time, Lin Lin is in charge
of the women's Nine-Ball.

466
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,160
I know.

467
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,879
I know all of you from Bei City.

468
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:59,480
Have them come to me
if they need anything.

469
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,024
Okay.

470
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:05,640
I'll be going then.
I have a meeting in a bit.

471
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,280
Go ahead.

472
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:14,319
You've known her since you were a kid.
Just rest assured.

473
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,319
She's experienced and responsible.
Just let her do it.

474
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:18,536
I'm rest assured.

475
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,839
I'll be going then.
I also have a meeting.

476
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,160
I'll come again next time.

477
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,359
Alright, goodbye.

478
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,080
(What's Jiang Yang's
license plate number?)

479
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,752
Hello.

480
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,719
What happened?
Did you run into Jiang Yang?

481
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,359
I-I think I saw his car here
at the training camp.

482
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:14,919
Okay. I thought
something had happened to you.

483
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,160
You've never cared about others.

484
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,359
