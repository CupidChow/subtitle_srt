but didn't know what to say.

185
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,840
Everything seemed casual.

186
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,719
I sat on the chair
and waited for the time to pass

187
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,519
so that I could leave on time.

188
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,440
But only when I stepped out
of the door with my luggage

189
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,519
and sat in the car

190
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,920
did I feel sad about the fact

191
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,400
that I was leaving.

192
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,959
I want to take a photo.

193
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,440
Just a second.

194
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,440
It's blurry. I was in a rush.

195
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:18,959
It's okay. I'll send you an HD photo
once I come back.

196
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:21,576
Let's go.

197
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,400
Give it to me.

198
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,039
I got this.

199
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,519
Your luggage is broken.

200
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,559
It may break if we don't wrap it up.

201
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,680
Let me. Hold this.

202
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,040
Passport.

203
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,976
Let's go.

204
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,640
You should get going.

205
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,759
One more minute.

206
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,080
Do you regret

207
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,519
starting a relationship overseas?

208
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,200
Yeah.

209
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,999
Y-You should have pursued me
after you returned to China.

210
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:15,120
So I should just
keep texting you until I return?

211
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
Wouldn't you be scared

212
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,920
that I was only teasing you?

213
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,120
Alright.

214
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,120
Alright.

215
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,519
Take it.

216
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:13,600
There will be more on the plane.

217
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,279
I don't have so many tears.

218
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,400
Let's not change a flight.

219
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,440
I'm going.

220
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,104

223
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,719

Six years older than me, right?

274
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,719
My brother and I
are both in our senior year.

275
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,080
I've been here on a trip before.

276
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,759
And I've signed up
for the Nine-Ball Open.

277
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:33,799
So I came two months early with him.

278
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,640
Finally, you're back.

279
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
Why is your phone off?

280
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:03,759
The battery died.

281
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm leaving. I was worried
I wouldn't see you.

282
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,239
Want a taxi?

283
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,000
No need. I got one.

284
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,520
I just saw her off. It's a bad time.

285
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,520
I have nothing against you.

286
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:20,000
Tell me what you need.

287
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,680
Nothing, I just realized that
I still don't have you on WeChat.

288
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,520
I'm not forcing you. Think about it.

289
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,520
This is Mr. He's number.

290
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,279
He rarely contacts anyone these years
and his health condition

291
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:46,160
is getting worse.

292
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:51,239
Call him and say hi.

293
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,279
I've got to go.

294
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,279
Stay in touch.
I hope you'll change your mind.

295
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,680
(Since you're sober,
I have something to tell you.)

296
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I'm going to have surgery on my arm.

297
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,520
It's an old problem.

298
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:38,680
I haven't arranged for it.

299
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:41,560
I'm just worried about Dongxin City.

300
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,560
I've been working relentlessly

301
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:46,799
ever since Mr. He
entrusted the club to me.

302
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,640
Dongxin City has a long history,
unlike Bei City,

303
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,359
which is held up by Meng Xiaodong.

304
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,839
If you want to take a break for a year,

305
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,640
it should be fine.

306
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,680
You think that's fine?

307
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,719
The only problem is

308
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,160
that the new leader may adopt
a different ideology.

309
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,080
After all, you're...

310
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:19,839
You're Mr. He's disciple.

311
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,600
Mr. He set up the club from scratch.

312
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,120
The members respect you
and you're able to mediate conflicts.

313
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,879
Has he retired?

314
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,976
It's been a long time.

315
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,520
In that case, you need to find someone

316
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:44,120
senior enough

317
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,719
to take over.

318
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,799
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

319
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:54,279
This person must have authority,

320
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,640
agree on your plans for the club,

321
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,439
and know the rules
and the training programs.

322
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:05,000
After all, these things...

323
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:12,799
I've talked to Mr. He.

324
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:17,960
We'd like you
to take over while I'm gone.

325
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,239
That's partly why I'm here.

326
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,120
Do me a favor.
The surgery can't wait anymore.

327
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,759
There must be someone better than me.

328
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:38,520
That's only a secondary option.

329
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,200
You're our best choice.

330
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:56,296
(Laundry room)

331
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:20,399
Did you see Jiang Yang?
He came to see you.

332
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,560
It's like how it was a few months ago

333
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,160
when no one was here.

334
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,919
Not Guo, not the club members.

335
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,480
Yeah, everybody left.

336
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,040
Now I feel lost.

337
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:55,600
Sometimes, I wake up
in the middle of the night,

338
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:57,279
looking at

339
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,359
the trees outside
and wondering where I am.

340
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,279
I feel like a wanderer.

341
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:07,399
But it always

342
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,919
makes me feel better to call my parents.

343
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:21,279
I have a cousin just like you.

344
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,560
Her parents died early.

345
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,719
She said that she became an orphan
once her parents passed away.

346
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:31,879
Her home ceased to exist.

347
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,160
I guess only those who've
been through it would get it.

348
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,919
The endless winter

349
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,879

350
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,560
