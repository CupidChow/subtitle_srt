=Episode 18=

25
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,799
You're finally back,

26
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,239
and will meet your future mother-in-law.

27
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,319
Are you nervous?

28
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:11,000
Not much, it's all in the plan.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,520
You have to pay the price
for the trouble caused

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,960
when you were young.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,520
Go get it, kid! I'm off.

32
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,160
By the way, have you
and Meng Xiaodong made up again?

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,640
What? We've been over for a long time.

34
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:28,840
Really?

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,319
You stay out of my business.

36
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,480
I would. But I'm afraid
you would mess with him,

37
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:37,239
affecting me and Guo.

38
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,919
No way. We won't be together again.

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,599
Back in the country,
you are exciting, right?

40
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,480
It has changed a lot.

41
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,439
But it seems like not much has changed.

42
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:16,880
(Where are you going to sleep tonight?)

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,439
(I rented a place,
but haven't cleaned it up yet.)

44
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,559
(Just make do for one night.)

45
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,639
(Everyone's there,
probably won't sleep.)

46
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,760
(Do you have to drink?)

47
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:34,999
(Maybe.)

48
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,400
(Don't overdrink.)

49
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,639
(Okay.)

50
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:56,320
(Seeing you just now, I was so nervous,
as if we've just started dating.)

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,639
(Same.)

52
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,519
Has Zongzong ever mentioned me to you?

53
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,280
Zongzong?

54
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,119
Are you talking about Lin Lin?

55
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,239
Zongzong is her nickname.

56
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,919
Never.

57
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,239
You look curious.

58
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,480
Why didn't you fancy her before?

59
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,280
They told me about it.

60
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,760
I didn't even know this part
if they didn't tell me.

61
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,359
Not just this part, I've had three.

62
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:13,639
You've had three relationships?
You've had three girlfriends?

63
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,200
Wait, you've had three girlfriends,

64
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,040
but no one in the family knows,
and you never tell.

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Why?

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Not three girlfriends.

67
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,919
It's always Zongzong.

68
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,600
Always...

69
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,079
Your first love was Lin Lin,

70
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,560
and you two broke up
and made up three times?

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm driving, don't bother me.

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,079
Do you want to ask Lin Yiyang?
He probably doesn't know either.

73
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:55,320
I don't think anyone
in Dongxin City knows.

74
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,480
No, I-I was just checking the time.

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,839
Check the time.

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,399
I'll handle it.

77
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,560
I won't walk you in,
there's a meeting early tomorrow.

78
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,399
Okay, you better head back, bye.

79
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:39,959
I'm leaving.

80
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,560
Be careful.

81
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,320
(I'm home, have you arrived?)

82
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,680
(Almost.)

83
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,320
(Do you know? My brother just told me
he and Lin Lin had a relationship.)

84
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,719
(I know.)

85
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,360
(My brother said you might not know.)

86
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,320
(I saw them together once.)

87
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,960
Saw...

88
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,560
(I think I heard you
talked about it to Wu Wei before,)

89
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,920
(I wonder if my brother likes Lin Lin.)

90
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,800
(You seem very interested
in their relationship.)

91
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,800
(After all, he's my brother.)

92
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,839
(He told me about himself
for the first time.)

93
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,880
(I was a bit upset hearing it.)

94
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,120
(Meng Xiaodong has his own life.)

95
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,639
(Keep your focus on me.)

96
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,920
(I don't like it
that my honey cares about others.)

97
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,079
Jealous.

98
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:55,948
(Impression Water Street Vitality Mall)

99
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,279
It's on the second floor of this mall.

100
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,240
This place is prime location,
even better than Dongxin City,

101
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,560
but just a bit small.

102
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,719
Let's go.

103
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:24,479
What? Do you want to change your mind
and take over Dongxin City?

104
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,360
That's a lot bigger than this.
Go check it out.

105
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,599
We'll talk about it sometime.

106
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,599
You are great, Yiyang.
Start a big business once you return.

107
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,200
I just rented it.

108
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,959
This used to be a hot pot restaurant.

109
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,880
A lot of stuff hasn't been
moved out yet.

110
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,680
Maybe we should just
open a hot pot restaurant.

111
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,959
These things are available anyway.

112
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,839
Call over all the brothers you can call,

113
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,000
who aren't doing well.

114
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,039
You mean those from our time?

115
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,040
Right, not many of the talented ones
really made it.

116
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,359
As long as they still like billiards

117
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,400
and want to run a billiard room,
then call them all over.

118
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
I do know a few.

119
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,040
Then thank you.

120
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,160
I'll put my room over there.

121
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,920
I don't want it to be big,
with one restroom is okay.

122
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,999
Okay.

123
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,560
You really don't have many demands.

124
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,599
I do not have many demands on life.

125
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:00,119
I have lived in a small place
all these years abroad.

126
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,999
Yiyang, where do we stay now?

127
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,119
Fresh off the plane,
I want to get some sleep.

128
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,999
Didn't you and Wu Wei
sleep all the way here?

129
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:08,584
Me?

130
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,520
Let's go to the third floor.

131
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,959
The renovation was finished last month,
just before you guys return.

132
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,520
The renovation of the second floor was
delayed because of the hot pot restaurant.

133
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,800
There are two rooms with a restroom.

134
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,239
And I stuffed you with some furniture.

135
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,280
It's kind of a small home now.

136
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:08,999
Let's go.

137
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,040
Maybe we should get an aunt who cooks.

138
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,839
It's not good for you
to eat take-out every day.

139
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,599
Maybe later. I'll meet my brother today.

140
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,759
Is he back?

141
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,839
To visit my parents' grave.

142
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,040
You should.

143
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,759
Okay, then I'm off.
Come find me if you need anything.

144
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,040
Come in.

145
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,648
Yiyang.

146
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,440
Jiang Yang has good taste.
The accessories are all quite stylish.

147
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,280
Yiyang, why are you up so early?
Why don't you sleep a little longer?

148
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,359
No, I have things to do.

149
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,879
Alright then, I'm going.

150
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,119
Keep an eye on the renovation,
I won't be back until tonight.

151
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,440
Okay.

152
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,479
Xiaodong.

153
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,472
Brother.

154
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,320
Where are you going?

155
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,520
I'm finally back.

156
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,200
Nice, you. You've worked out, right?

157
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,879
Being a dad is different now,
you even know to work out.

158
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,759
My wife told me to strengthen my body,

159
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,839
so they can feel safe.

160
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:12,552
Where's she?

161
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,719
No parking here,

162
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:18,119
so I let her stay in the car
with the kid.

163
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:20,640
We got up too early this morning
and the kid fell asleep.

164
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,879
Today is Qingming Festival,
there will be a traffic jam on the road.

165
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,200
And Yin Guo?

166
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,640
She went home last night.

167
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,800
I'll introduce her to you
when I get a chance.

168
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,920
You mean introduce me to her.

169
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,520
I've been watching her play.

170
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,239
She's famous,
I've known her for a while.

171
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,472
Let's go.

172
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,640
Sorry, she came back at the late night,
probably overslept.

173
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,040
No problem, let her sleep a bit longer.

174
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,119
She just won a championship.

175
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,920
Don't be so harsh on her.

176
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,560
Exactly.

177
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,959
She's here.

178
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,160
We are all waiting for you.

179
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,400
Uncles and aunts, sorry.

180
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,160
We've been waiting.

181
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,640
Congratulations on another championship.

182
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,040
Congratulations
on moving up the rankings.

183
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,959
Is it time to depart?

184
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,008
Yes.

185
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:16,920
Just waiting for you.

186
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,640
Let's go.

187
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,839
Let's go.

188
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:19,680
Let's go.

189
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,719
Li, you'd take our car.

190
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:35,272
Okay, fine.

191
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,512
Okay?

192
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,560
Guo, move over.

193
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,719
I'll just take your car.

194
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:59,040
How come you grew up together
and suddenly don't talk? Hurry up.

195
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:00,320
Move over.

196
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,359
Lin Yiyang has returned?

197
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:37,800
How do you know?

198
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,599
For someone so notable returns,
of course I know it.

199
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:52,759
As for me, I've been beaten
by him this year, completely.

200
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,800
No wonder Xiaodong has been
looking forward to his return.

201
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,920
There are really many people today.

202
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,800
It's lucky we made a reservation.

203
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,520
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able
to find a place to eat at this hour.

204
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Yes, people are paying
a lot of attention to it now.

205
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,400
Pretty good.

206
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,479
Yes.

207
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,088
Mom.

208
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:19,999
Where's my dad?

209
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,879
Your dad had to leave for work.

210
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,879
Let's go, we'll eat first.

211
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,040
I forgot to tell you
not to tell your parents about me.

212
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,359
He's ranked so high in the world,
what are you afraid of?

213
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,520
It's a long story. Let's go then.

214
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm asking for your opinion,

215
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,400
but you didn't respond at all.

216
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,280
I don't understand anyway.

217
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,759
What? You don't even understand food?

218
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,640
Waiter, bring me a menu.

219
00:17:59,368 --> 00:17:59,959
Okay.

220
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:00,719
Thank you.

221
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:01,719
- Brother.
- Take a look.

222
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,719
Auntie, Xiaodong.

223
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:03,359
Auntie.

224
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,440
Qingyan, you are here.

225
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,200
We got here a little earlier than you
and ordered some food.

226
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,160
You can take a look.

227
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,759
All are fine.

228
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,160
Get to business.

229
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,680
Okay. I wanted to talk to you.

230
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,680
How can we talk about work while eating?

231
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,200
It's urgent.

232
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,959
Auntie, my brother hates ordering food.
You are making it difficult for him.

233
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,999
If he becomes angry,
our entire club will have to suffer.

234
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,359
I'm not making it difficult for him.

235
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:33,520
Look at him, he's not relaxed at all.

236
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,999
Work matters, but so does life.

237
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,879
Aside from billiards,

238
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,680
he has no interest in girls.

239
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,599
So now I have to start cultivating him

240
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,879
and brainwashing him, to make him aware

241
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:54,520
that the world is vast except billiards.

242
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,959
Maybe my brother is secretly dating,

243
00:18:58,959 --> 00:18:59,839
just that you don't know.

244
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,519
He's almost thirty now.

245
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,600
Why doesn't he want me to know it?

246
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,200
He's just a grumpy guy.

247
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,279
Alright, I'll go order a few more.

248
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,160
Just order whatever you like to eat.

249
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,759
I'll go take a look.

250
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:17,896
Okay.

251
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,440
Who are you?

252
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,999
Why are you alone? How cute!

253
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,840
Where are your parents?
Why did they let you run out alone?

254
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,959
Where are your parents?

255
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,319
Here.

256
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,360
You... why are you here?

257
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,200
Is this your relative's child?

258
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,239
My brother's. I let her look for
the one she likes best here,

259
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,999
and she headed straight for you.

260
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,080
Guo, is this your classmate?

261
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,080
Yes, my classmate.

262
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,559
This is my auntie.

263
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,239
Hello.

264
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:16,776
Hello, Auntie.

265
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,719
Okay, you two chat.
I'll find the waiter.

266
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,759
Miss, I would like to order something.

267
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,080
Okay, just a moment please.

268
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,319
Why are you here? Just passing by?

269
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,648
Visit my parents' grave.

270
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,160
Then how did you find this place?

271
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,360
Your brother.

272
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,640
You should have told me earlier,

273
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,239
so I could have bought
a bunch of flowers for your parents.

274
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:53,479
Never mind, I've told them
I will take you to see them next year.

275
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:58,039
Hug.

276
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,479
Give me a hug.

277
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,279
Me or her?

278
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,959
Keep in touch, classmate.

279
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
I hope you still have my number.

280
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,680
I think I do.

281
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,239
We'll hug her next time. We're leaving.

282
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:36,616
Let's go.

283
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,120
He's really nice, that's his child?

284
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,160
No, that's his brother's child.
He just graduated.

285
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,559
Look, that child is crying.

286
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,600
He doesn't know
how to take care of the child.

287
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,239
People might think
he stole someone's child.

288
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,688
Okay.

289
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,600
How is it? All dishes are served?
Guo, go sit inside.

290
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,640
Sit.

291
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,319
Go inside.

292
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,400
Let's eat.

293
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,160
Mom, I also ordered
that chicken soup you love.

294
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,360
She's so considerate.

295
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,039
Let's eat.

296
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Come on, mom.

297
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:17,880
Let's eat.

298
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:22,440
Nice, it's blanched in saltwater.

299
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:26,360
Pretty good.

300
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,080
Here, mom, I'll get you some.

301
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,719
Come on.

302
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:30,239
Here.

303
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,479
- I love eating this chicken.
- Right?

304
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,999
It smells good.

305
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:36,200
Yes, this is also tasty.
Auntie, this one you can chew.

306
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,319
(What did you say to the child
to make her cry so hard?)

307
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,440
(I said you don't like her
and told me to take her away.)

308
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,400
(Just like you, so serious.)

309
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,600
Another one.

310
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,160
Here it is.

311
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,279
Hot dish is here.

312
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,200
It took ten minutes
for the hot dishes to arrive.

313
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,959
You cooks are too slow.

314
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:03,999
Please be quicker.

315
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:08,840
There are many people visiting the grave
these days and we are busy.

316
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,959
Sorry. We will speed up right away.

317
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,559
Okay.

318
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,400
Qingyan, do you know him?

319
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,400
Yes. He's very familiar with Xiaodong,
so we've met.

320
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,999
Yes, we are quite familiar.

321
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,799
So, he's not Guo's classmate.

322
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,400
He talked to Guo downstairs just now.

323
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,640
I-I met him when I went to Hel.

324
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,200
H-He went to see a match.

325
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,039
Right, I introduced them.

326
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,239
You know that table over there?

327
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,519
My girlfriend is over there.

328
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,880
I didn't see her just now.

329
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,360
Don't look.
I've said hi to her downstairs.

330
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,799
Well, since we are here,
shouldn't I go greet her?

331
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,479
Maybe next time, not today.

332
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,536
Okay.

333
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:10,120
Have a seat.

334
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,760
Okay.

335
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,759
Alright.

336
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,640
Miss Wu, I saw you here,

337
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,080
so I thought I should
come over to greet you.

338
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:40,200
It's a family thing today.
No need to stop by and greet me.

339
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,680
I should.

340
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,559
I made quite a few mistakes

341
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,239
back then on the field.

342
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,799
I have to thank you for being forgiving,

343
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,039
giving me another chance.

344
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,719
You shouldn't thank me, Lin.

345
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,319
The one you should thank most
is your teacher, Mr. He.

346
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,279
He's almost seventy, and
came to the council to plead for you.

347
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,680
It's hard for us to watch.

348
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,519
And Mr. Wang has never
had a dispute with anyone at work,

349
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,360
but he had cried backstage that day.

350
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,160
Later, Mr. Wang also pled for you

351
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,319
and felt pity for your retirement.

352
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,840
You're right.

353
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,319
I drive today, so I don't drink wine.

354
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,519
Now that you're back, just develop well
and set a good example for the youngers.

355
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,279
Come on, let's continue.

356
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:31,944
Brother.

357
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,799
What's wrong?

358
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,200
I noticed things didn't
go well over there.

359
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,360
It's for the past.

360
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,799
Help me take this upstairs.

361
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,799
I-I'll go get something.

362
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,319
Then I'll go upstairs first.

363
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:51,840
Go ahead.

364
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,360
Everyone, all dishes are served.
Please enjoy your meal.

365
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,640
That must be Jiang Yang's junior, right?

366
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,232
Right.

367
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:19,799
I was the referee for his match
before he retired, at the next table.

368
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,559
Later, he had already left
after I was called over.

369
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,160
He would have been
banned for three years

370
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,559
under the current rules for what he did.

371
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,999
Your uncle Wang is a man
who cherishes talents.

372
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:37,080
He's quite glad to hear he's back.

373
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
So he did fix the match?

374
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,880
No, he was banned back then
for disrespecting the referee.

375
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,239
He Wenfeng's disciples
won't play match-fixing.

376
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,759
Is Xiaodong close to him?

377
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,600
Not really, just peers.

378
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,519
We are buddies.

379
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,559
In fact, he's playing by the rules now,

380
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,999
there's not much negative news.

381
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,600
It's none of our business. Enough.

382
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,479
And I talked to him about billiards
once when I was abroad,

383
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,440
I found that he really liked it.

384
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,799
Didn't we say to stop?

385
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:22,519
Alright, let's stop.

386
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,479
It's my fault.

387
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:24,840
Come on.

388
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,959
- Let's eat.
- Come on, let's eat.

389
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,279
Guo, let's eat. Have the fish.

390
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,584
Let's eat.

391
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,799
Duo, let's eat.

392
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,959
Here, your favorite.

393
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:41,319
Thank you.

394
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,279
Have you noticed?
As long as we eat together,

395
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:49,519
if there are crabs on the table,
Qingyan is always the first to give Guo.

396
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:53,320
Go ahead and eat.

397
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,840
Qingyan, eat some more.

398
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:15,559
Hello.

399
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,400
Hello.

400
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,239
Any crabs left?

401
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,120
Yes, there are two left.

402
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,080
Make them all for table two-five.

403
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,319
Okay, I'll bring them over in a bit.

404
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,640
Table two-five, plus two crabs.

405
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,080
All these are nice.

406
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,959
This one is good, quite authentic.

407
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:37,719
Let me try.

408
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,080
Authentic home-style cooking.

409
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,920
Qingyan, let's eat.

410
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,640
I just remembered I left something
in the car and I need to go get it.

411
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,440
Can you do it?

412
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:49,759
Do you want me?

413
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,440
No.

414
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,920
How's our new coach?

415
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,759
Which group's?

416
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,319
Coach Yu and Coach Huang.

417
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:58,719
Pretty good.

418
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:27,400
You are here.

419
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,519
Looking for me?

420
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:41,400
You know the answer.

421
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,400
For what?

422
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,719
Why don't you reply to my messages?

423
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,400
There are people, Lin Yiyang.

424
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:26,080
Do you miss me or come to comfort me?

425
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,440
Do you have a problem with me
because of what my mom said?

426
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,784
No.

427
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,400
I don't think so.

428
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,640
Stop pretending to look for something.

429
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,239
I'm not.

430
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:01,319
The answers to those two questions
are no. I am not looking for you.

431
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:12,799
Then go back. I'll be leaving soon.

432
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,040
I need to drive my brother back.

433
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,239
They live far away
and it'll take a long time.

434
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,759
No.

435
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,080
Let me go.

436
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,239
Wait.

437
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,920
Guo. Yin Guo.

438
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,440
Boss, how much are these cherries?

439
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,200
45 yuan per basket.

440
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,719
I'll take two.

441
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,239
Okay.

442
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,200
Pick two.

443
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,039
Keep one basket
and give another one to the child.

444
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:57,479
Keep it?

445
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:02,200
Right, keep it. Someone likes it.

446
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,080
What are you doing?

447
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,400
I've finished eating. I'll go get...

448
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,080
My mom got it.

449
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,279
I get it for you.
No need to go upstairs.

450
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,840
Thank you, auntie.

451
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,600
Still mad at your sister?

452
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,160
No.

453
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:38,999
Then what have you been
looking for so long?

454
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,680
I didn't find it. It might be at home.

455
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:49,559
Hello, your child is quite funny.

456
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,640
Just came to our table looking for Guo.

457
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:55,519
She is ignorant, sorry about that.

458
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,680
It's fine.

459
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,120
Leaving?

460
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,279
Yes.

461
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:03,880
I'm leaving.

462
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,239
Let's go.

463
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,000
Come on, have one.

464
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I want my big sister.

465
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,120
Which one?

466
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,399
Sister, sister.

467
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:37,439
Just now, You kept saying
she wants to find her sister.

468
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:38,640
I wonder which one.

469
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:45,120
You, shall we go find her next time?

470
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,879
Okay.

471
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,000
Let's eat. We've been waiting for you.

472
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,160
You guys eat. I'm not hungry.

473
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,960
You haven't eaten much all morning.
Eat something.

474
00:36:58,279 --> 00:36:59,520
Hello, here's the crabs you ordered.

475
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,072
Okay.

476
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,136
Have this.

477
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:08,759
Thank you.

478
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:09,319
Okay, enjoy.

479
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,239
Great, crabs.

480
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,480
Go ahead, eat more.

481
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,200
Do you want this?

482
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:36,960
Guo.

483
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
About that Lin Yiyang, tell me more.

484
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:54,960
I'll tell you when I get home.
I'm feeling a bit car sick.

485
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:58,239
Are you okay?

486
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:58,799
Nothing.

487
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Take a rest.

488
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,919
Are you close to that Lin Yiyang?

489
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,399
Quite. We get along well.

490
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,319
Doesn't Meng Xiaodong care about you?

491
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,319
Xiaodong is even closer to him.

492
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,480
Didn't Meng Xiaodong tell you?

493
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:26,200
Lin Lin beat him with a brick
when he was young.

494
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:29,439
It's this Lin Yiyang who came with her
to deliver the medical fees.

495
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,399
It's him?

496
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,719
Yes, grandma.

497
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,919
That thing really scared me.

498
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,160
I thought Xiaodong had offended someone.

499
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,080
But those were things from childhood.

500
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,120
And Xiaodong is quite good with Lin Lin.

501
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,759
Not just this one, there are many more.

502
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,120
You seem to have
a pretty good impression of him.

503
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,200
I've told you not to argue
in front of grandma.

504
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:00,279
We are not, just discussing.

505
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,160
I'm not.

506
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,200
I saw Lin Yiyang sincerely
offering you tea today,

507
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:17,960
and just tried to defend him.

508
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,520
Both you and my sister
are from the sports bureau.

509
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,919
If both of you have a problem with him,

510
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,359
wouldn't that be unfair to him?

511
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,680
I don't know him,
and have no personal favor or hatred.

512
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,239
But I don't like him.

513
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,319
Not to mention Xiaodong.

514
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,919
I was a referee before,

515
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,439
so I don't like someone
who disrespected referees.

516
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:44,919
I don't judge your friends
because I love you,

517
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,879
but nothing will change inside of me.

518
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:55,120
Guo, you are old enough to accept
that there are no people in this world

519
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,680
who think the same way
and stand the same way with you.

520
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:02,200
Everyone acts
from their own point of view,

521
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,040
and has their own character
and life experiences.

522
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,839
Even the closest ones to you.

523
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:15,680
And, Tongtong,

524
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:19,319
you can say so here,

525
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:22,399
but don't say so in the bureau,
at the association, or at public events.

526
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,439
I'm telling you this very seriously,
you must remember it.

527
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,239
We cannot work because of
our personal feelings and judgments.

528
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,919
Your words

529
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:34,879
might affect
people's attitude toward him.

530
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,319
It is unfair to an athlete
who has just returned home to develop.

531
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,600
I got it.

532
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Is the China Open about to start?

533
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,279
Yes, next week.

534
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:11,048
(Certificate of Honor)

535
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,799
My dad's been looking at
pictures of you guys lately.

536
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:20,799
He's been talking about it.

537
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,640
You know what I'm going to ask.

538
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,200
Jiajia.

539
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,799
Go take a seat.

540
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,839
Dad, everyone knows you miss Yiyang.

541
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,960
What? Can't I say it?

542
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,640
I didn't mean that.

543
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,279
Then what?

544
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:41,439
You are this old,
but still refuse to admit defeat.

545
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:45,520
That's not right.
He, it's time to let go.

546
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,839
I've let go a long time ago.

547
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,439
Why would I be mad at a kid?

548
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:57,600
The age difference between me
and Yiyang is several generations apart.

549
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,919
Can a grandfather
be mad at his grandson?

550
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,960
He's back. He just arrived last night.

551
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,359
Who?

552
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,719
Yiyang.

553
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,399
H-He's back?

554
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,480
Don't look at me.
I don't know either, dad.

555
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,839
W-Where is he staying now?

556
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:30,640
He has a place to stay.
I didn't tell you before because

557
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,719
he wasn't sure when he'd return.

558
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,279
He rented a two-story building
and is renovating it,

559
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:36,600
preparing to open a new billiard room.

560
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:39,719
For now, he's living there
with an assistant.

561
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,120
What about the renovations?
Is it suitable for living?

562
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,728
Yes. The second floor is being renovated,
but I've cleared out the third floor.

563
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:48,279
He has a place to stay,

564
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,160
so he doesn't bother to visit me, does he?

565
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,080
Give me the address.
I'll go take a look.

566
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
You don't need to go.

567
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,960
Dad, I won't say a word.

568
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,799
I'll just drop off something, okay?

569
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,560
You just said you had let go.

570
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
What are you saying now?

571
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,080
I didn't mean it.

572
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,000
I understand Yiyang.

573
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:16,759
He returns before the China Open,

574
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,279
there must be something he wants to do.

575
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:23,160
We should give him some time

576
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,239
and respect him.
