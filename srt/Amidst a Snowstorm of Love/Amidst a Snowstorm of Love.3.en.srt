25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,296
Here.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,559
We meet again.

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,808
Yes.

28
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,920
I want to go to the restroom first.

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,936
Over there.

30
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:13,800
Okay.

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,919
I took off my clothes

32
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,104
and my hair was lathered up,
but you pulled me out

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
just for a bowl of ramen?

34
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:25,640
Since you're here, just be it.

35
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,679
Sit over there.

36
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,959
Enough. She will get embarrassed.

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,800
Get us a pot of wine.

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,760
Alright.

39
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,440
Please bring out that menu.

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,144
Okay.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,840
What is it?

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
They have a menu for regular customers,

43
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,576
not available to walk-ins.

44
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:56,919
How did you meet her?

45
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,008
Billiard room.

46
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,359
There's a gathering there today,

47
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:03,600
with quite many professional players.

48
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,880
She's here for the Nine-Ball Open.

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,416
Really? What a coincidence.

50
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,600
He said you're here for the Open too.

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,680
Right.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,719
I'm on the list too.

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,120
What a coincidence, let's shake hands.

54
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,216
What a coincidence.

55
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,208
Here is the menu.

56
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,517
I forgot to ask,

57
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,556
did you two go to college together?

58
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:45,036
We grew up together.
He came here first, then

59
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:46,676
helped me prepare
my study abroad materials.

60
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,684
He came here one year before me,
but graduated one year after me.

61
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:49,756
Why?

62
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:50,797
Different majors.

63
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:53,116
He's a three-year major
and mine only needs one.

64
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,756
Then why don't you leave
after you graduated?

65
00:03:58,396 --> 00:03:59,196
Waiting for him.

66
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:02,317
If he chooses
to pursue a PhD or work here,

67
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:03,396
I'll return home first.

68
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:04,916
If he fails,

69
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:06,117
then we can return together.

70
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:09,157
You two are so close.

71
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:10,236
You even stay behind for him.

72
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:12,796
Of course, we are best buddies.

73
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:13,837
Right?

74
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:23,317
Have you participated in
competitions in China before?

75
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:24,597
I haven't seen you before.

76
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:26,796
I'm actually
an average nine-ball player.

77
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:28,397
I practiced for a while as a kid.

78
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:30,717
I just want to participate,
and don't think about winning.

79
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:31,956
I play snooker.

80
00:04:33,636 --> 00:04:35,036
Let's order before we talk.

81
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,076
Maybe you order,
this is my first time here.

82
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:39,117
Never mind.

83
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,117
Thank you.

84
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,117
This one.

85
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:54,597
Same here.

86
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:04,117
If you come for competition,
then you'll stay for over three months.

87
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:05,117
Right.

88
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,036
I didn't want to be here that early,

89
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,360
but I have to be with my brother.

90
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,437
His mom wants him
here early to get adapted.

91
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,277
So you'll stay in a hotel
for three months?

92
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:15,677
We haven't decided yet.

93
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,476
My friend did suggest

94
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,397
that I find a short-term rental
near the university.

95
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:22,277
Me. I can rent you my place.

96
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:23,636
You have a house here?

97
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:25,317
I rent it too.

98
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:26,956
But, coincidentally,

99
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,157
it has three bedrooms.

100
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,636
Two rooms will be vacant

101
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:30,317
next week.

102
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:33,557
Where is your house?
Is it far from here?

103
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:35,157
It's right down the street.

104
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:36,597
It's only a five-minute walk.

105
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,717
It's close to the metro station,
very convenient.

106
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:40,677
When I came,

107
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,717
I did find this location quite good.

108
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:44,036
If you're interested,

109
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:45,277
I'll ask the landlord for you.

110
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:51,277
What? Are you afraid we're the bad guys?

111
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,117
No, I'm not.

112
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,677
I mean, I need to practice every day.

113
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:57,516
I wonder
if there's a billiard room nearby.

114
00:05:58,557 --> 00:05:59,076
Yes.

115
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,756
Well, how about
we add contacts on WeChat?

116
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:05,877
You can think it over.

117
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:06,877
I'll ask the landlord.

118
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:07,997
Let's keep moving.

119
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:08,597
Keep in touch.

120
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:10,277
Okay.

121
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,237
I'll scan you.

122
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,076
Okay.

123
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:26,076
Doesn't Matter.

124
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,117
Your name is quite funny.

125
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:30,917
A childhood nickname.

126
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:32,808
Lin Yiyang has one too.

127
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:38,037
What's his?

128
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,048
Duncuo.

129
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:40,196
Duncuo?

130
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,677
Yiyang Duncuo.
[*Cadence in Chinese.]

131
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:47,716
Thank you.

132
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:54,516
What's up?

133
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:16,797
It's that building over there.

134
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:18,156
The location is pretty good.

135
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:19,076
Think it over.

136
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:20,677
Indeed quite nice.

137
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:23,716
Then please ask the landlord for me.

138
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,516
And I'll discuss it with my brother.

139
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:26,276
No problem.

140
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,117
It's so late, you send her home.

141
00:07:29,357 --> 00:07:30,797
I get going. See you.

142
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:38,472
Are you cold?

143
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:41,037
How about I buy you
a cup of milk tea to warm you up?

144
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:42,152
No.

145
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,636
Didn't we just finish dinner?

146
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:44,997
I still feel warm.

147
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:47,117
Let's go.

148
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:08,756
That hot dog I said tasted bad

149
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,836
was bought at that gas station.

150
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:13,596
We just passed it, did you see it?

151
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:20,196
I wonder how bad it tasted

152
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:22,217
that it's so memorable for you.

153
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:23,596
Really bad.

154
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:25,677
Only bread and ham,

155
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:27,237
no lettuce or sauce either.

156
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,557
Have you eaten it?

157
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:32,936
I have.

158
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,357
Were you also tricked

159
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,716
into buying such bad food?

160
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:38,357
I wanted to.

161
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:40,797
Why?

162
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:58,437
Thanks for sending me back.

163
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:03,596
Is there any metro for you to get back?

164
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:06,076
Yes, it's 24-hour.

165
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:15,276
Your brother is here.

166
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:20,756
Then good-bye.

167
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,437
Thank you for taking my sister home.

168
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:37,512
It's nothing.

169
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm leaving.

170
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:52,716
Why did you come down?

171
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:54,396
Yiyang said you'd arrive,

172
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:55,237
so he asked me to come.

173
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,516
I told him there's a bar downstairs,

174
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:58,357
maybe he's worried.

175
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,317
What is he worried about?

176
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,917
Drunks downstairs?

177
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:09,797
Haven't you always called him Lin?

178
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:11,037
Why did you change?

179
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,557
He asked us to call him that,

180
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:14,997
saying that's how people call him.

181
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:18,636
Yiyang.

182
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:22,317
Right, I've bought a lot of snacks.

183
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,437
I'll get them to you.

184
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:24,904
Okay.

185
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:26,836
I'll take a shower,
you'd come in half an hour.

186
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:28,037
I have something to talk to you.

187
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:28,776
Okay.

188
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:52,517
This one, please.

189
00:10:53,437 --> 00:10:54,236
It's awful.

190
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,196
There are better choices inside.

191
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:57,917
It's okay.

192
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:00,917
Bad taste.

193
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,037
Do you need any toppings?

194
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:11,677
No. Sausage is fine.

195
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:17,076
Thanks.

196
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:28,476
Cheers.

197
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:41,437
(Doesn't Matter: Lin has a crush on someone.)

198
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,236
(Lin?)

199
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:47,076
(Lin Yiyang?)

200
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:34,917
(The busier, the messier.)

201
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:22,059
(Lin commented on Doesn't Matter:
Delete it. She can see it.)

202
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,397
(As expected, it's about him.)

203
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:40,996
(He deleted it?)

204
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:49,596
Coming.

205
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:09,196
These nachos taste so good.

206
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,076
I also bought cookies and potato chips.

207
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,517
(Did it hurt your ear?)

208
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:24,996
(No.)

209
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:28,236
(Just a bit of touch.)

210
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:49,956
(I thought it was serious.)

211
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:18,716
I posted that on purpose.

212
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:51,116
Why did you buy this?

213
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:52,517
It's so awful.

214
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:57,236
I think it's fine.

215
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:03,356
You're generous to buy her ramen,

216
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:05,437
yet you are eating a cheap hot dog here.

217
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:07,917
Someone told me

218
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:10,757
this hot dog tastes really bad.

219
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:13,637
I just wanted to try

220
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:15,476
and see

221
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:18,517
how bad taste it is.

222
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:24,757
Let me tell you, poop tastes bad,

223
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:25,996
do you want to try?

224
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:27,996
What? Have you tried it?

225
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,596
Do you have a crush on that beauty?

226
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:50,716
Where are you going?

227
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:52,437
To do the laundry.

228
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:26,952
(Desks and chairs donated to Mingde Primary School)

229
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,317
I talked to Zheng Yi.

230
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:42,956
She said renting is nice.

231
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:45,196
Firstly, we can save money,

232
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:47,037
it's cheaper than staying in a hotel.

233
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:48,917
Secondly,

234
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:51,277
they are quite nice to share rent with.

235
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:53,517
Thirdly, it's for your future.

236
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:54,956
Even if you don't rent a house now,

237
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:56,996
you'll have to find a house
when school opens.

238
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:58,836
Renting is cheaper
than staying in a hotel,

239
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,277
and free.

240
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:09,596
(Haven't you slept yet?)

241
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,596
(I can't sleep.)

242
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:24,557
(Jet lag?)

243
00:19:27,277 --> 00:19:29,477
(Jet lag is long gone after
having been here for so many days.)

244
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:33,037
(Probably because
the ramen was too delicious.)

245
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:40,916
(Just average)

246
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:42,636
(in taste.)

247
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:45,797
(It's pretty good.)

248
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:48,596
(At least I'm satisfied.)

249
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:57,957
(This chicken soup base tonight was)

250
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,356
(inferior over the traditional one.)

251
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,836
(I couldn't even tell it.)

252
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:10,717
(It was.)

253
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,876
(You seem so familiar with ramen.)

254
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:25,836
Who's texting you so late at night?

255
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:27,797
Mr. Chen.

256
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,116
Continue, back to the renting matter.

257
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:34,076
How?

258
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:35,237
I'm okay with anything.

259
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:37,197
If you and Zheng Yi are okay, me too.

260
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:47,596
Mr. Chen again?

261
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:51,636
Yes, he recommended food to me.

262
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:02,957
(Thank you.)

263
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:04,477
(Thank you.)

264
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:07,957
I'll treat you.

265
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:25,636
(I'll treat you.)

266
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:36,717
(You really like
treating people to meals.)

267
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,317
(This emoji again.)

268
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:06,356
Did you change your coach?

269
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:09,197
No.

270
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,797
I'll talk to Wu Wei if you are okay.

271
00:22:17,477 --> 00:22:18,184
Okay.

272
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:25,116
I'll go pack up now.

273
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:26,676
We can move as soon as possible.

274
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:29,197
Hold on, I haven't finished yet.

275
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:30,356
Isn't that it?

276
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,197
What else?

277
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,517
I'm thinking...

278
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:36,356
What if...

279
00:22:37,477 --> 00:22:39,076
What if Wu Wei has a girlfriend.

280
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:41,037
Will we bother them by moving over?

281
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:42,596
Girlfriend?

282
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:43,916
Impossible.

283
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,076
Both are bachelors.

284
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:47,037
He and Yiyang are both lonely.

285
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,277
Why did you run so fast just now?

286
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:57,757
I wanted to wash some clothes.

287
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:11,517
What?

288
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,757
I've been thinking

289
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:17,277
why you had to have ramen today.

290
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:20,116
I finally figured it out.

291
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:22,156
Twenty-seven years ago today

292
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:24,797
was your big day.

293
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,116
Stop being sentimental.

294
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,676
Why didn't you tell me
today was your birthday?

295
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:32,957
I didn't plan to celebrate it.

296
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:34,757
That's just the way you are.

297
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:36,596
You care the least about yourself.

298
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:39,076
At least have a big meal.

299
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:40,277
Didn't we have one?

300
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:41,757
Ramen?

301
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:42,997
Yes, ramen.

302
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:45,237
I've loved ramen on my birthday

303
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:46,596
since I was a kid.

304
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:49,277
It's your birthday,

305
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,076
at least add half a lobster.

306
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:55,317
Yin Guo, I've found a secret.

307
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:57,517
Just now,

308
00:23:57,957 --> 00:23:59,356
Wu Wei posted something on his Moments

309
00:23:59,596 --> 00:24:00,277
and deleted it.

310
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:01,636
Guess what he posted.

311
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,104
What is it?

312
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:05,636
He said Yiyang has a crush on someone.

313
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:10,636
Well,

314
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,517
has Yiyang found his Miss Right?

315
00:24:15,477 --> 00:24:16,717
How would I know?

316
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:19,277
I wonder

317
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:21,197
what type Yiyang likes.

318
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:23,356
How would I know?

319
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,356
What are you doing?

320
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:42,197
Alright, go back to sleep, I'm tired.

321
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:43,477
Yin Guo.

322
00:24:44,636 --> 00:24:46,317
Yiyang is quite nice.

323
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,757
Talk to him more while he's single.

324
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:53,396
You'd better sleep.

325
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:54,436
- Grab your phone.
- Phone.

326
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:56,156
Go, go, go. Take the food.

327
00:24:58,596 --> 00:24:59,717
Yiyang is really nice.

328
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:00,636
You go to sleep.

329
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:01,596
Then I'm leaving.

330
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:13,717
Beauty replied to me.

331
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,477
She said everything is okay
and agreed to share the rent.

332
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:19,237
But

333
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:21,436
the landlord is still thinking.

334
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,477
He used to rent the rooms to students,

335
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,317
while the siblings are not ones.

336
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:36,116
Where are you going?

337
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,176
Give the landlord a call.

338
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,116
It'd be best if you could ask.

339
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:43,356
You helped the landlord's son
revise his papers,

340
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:44,517
so he owed you a favor.

341
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:50,237
Just pretend.

342
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:08,116
This one is so tall!

343
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:10,356
Who is he?

344
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:11,517
Junior Master.

345
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:13,596
Whom we can't mention in Dongxin City,

346
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:14,797
Lin Yiyang.

347
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:19,557
They came to see you last week,

348
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:21,277
but failed in the end.

349
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:24,557
I thought you were going to
run away again.

350
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:37,957
For the competition?

351
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:40,277
I brought them here

352
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:41,997
for the Youth Competition.

353
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:44,757
They are my disciples.

354
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:48,237
- Junior Master.
- Junior Master.

355
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,156
I quit the club long ago.

356
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:52,636
No Junior Master here.

357
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:54,856
You can either

358
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:55,957
call me Yiyang,

359
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:57,396
or

360
00:27:58,037 --> 00:27:58,836
call me Mr. Lin.

361
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:04,436
If they call you Yiyang,

362
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:05,836
what about me?

363
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:09,237
Suit yourself.

364
00:28:24,197 --> 00:28:25,076
I'm going out to eat.

365
00:28:37,037 --> 00:28:37,636
Bye-bye.

366
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:03,336
You are here.

367
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:05,396
Same as usual?

368
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:08,636
No, I have no appetite.

369
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,676
Beer.

370
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:10,916
Alright.

371
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,836
The girl last night was pretty.

372
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:28,317
Is she the one you wanted to know

373
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:29,517
the first time you met her?

374
00:29:35,237 --> 00:29:35,797
Which day?

375
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:37,836
Which day did you meet her?

376
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:40,076
That night...

377
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:44,436
That night I slept here.

378
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:46,557
On the snowstorm day.

379
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:47,752
Right.

380
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:51,237
Last night,

381
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:52,997
you barely talked to her.

382
00:29:57,277 --> 00:29:58,596
I used to talk mean

383
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:00,676
and hurt a lot of people,

384
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:03,557
especially over the phone.

385
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,496
Not seeing faces
causes misunderstandings.

386
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:09,237
But for girls,

387
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:10,997
she won't know how you feel

388
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,156
if you don't tell her.

389
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:20,757
We just met,
so we don't know each other well.

390
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:26,408
Instead of chatting,

391
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:29,797
it feels easier to treat her meals.

392
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,596
Say what's in your mind,

393
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,237
and she will feel it.

394
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:49,517
I'll have a bowl of ramen.

395
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:50,717

Lin.

439
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:17,997
Is he looking for you?

440
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:41,237
Wu Wei said,

441
00:34:41,836 --> 00:34:43,517
there's a decent billiard room nearby.

442
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:50,717
It's rare

443
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,477
that you and I meet.

444
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:54,356
Let's play.

445
00:35:00,424 --> 00:35:01,037
This way.

446
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:08,477
It's raining.

447
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:13,116
This is the weather here.

448
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:24,076
At your age,
you are still trying to be cool.

449
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:28,356
At your age,

450
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:30,037
you start nagging.

451
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:35,076
I am getting old now.

452
00:35:37,557 --> 00:35:38,517
Anyway,

453
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,317
I've always admired you
since I was a kid.

454
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,277
Among us,

455
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:45,317
only Wu Wei can study.

456
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:47,396
It's not surprised

457
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:48,836
he could make it.

458
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:51,957
But it's such a surprise

459
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:53,997
that you make it this far.

460
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,876
Both of us were
at the bottom of the class, right?

461
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:00,076
A class of forty,

462
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,156
could you rank thirtieth?

463
00:36:03,464 --> 00:36:04,436
More or less.

464
00:36:07,237 --> 00:36:08,597
Everyone said

465
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:11,277
I was nothing without the club

466
00:36:12,264 --> 00:36:13,516
or the cue.

467
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,916
And now I'm standing here.

468
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:19,396
I can do whatever I want.

469
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,797
I can hold the cue or put it down.

470
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:25,436
I can survive either way.

471
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:33,036
Didn't Jiang Yang tell you that?

472
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:36,637
Sixth Junior Master

473
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:38,677
is rather a taboo in the club.

474
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:39,956
Nobody mentions it.

475
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:42,757
Right, the old coaches don't mention it.

476
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:43,876
I asked the teachers,

477
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:45,356
and they don't let us mention it.

478
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:48,436
Alright, I'll tell you.

479
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:50,956
Well,

480
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:53,677
Lin Yiyang and Jiang Yang
were apprenticed in the same year,

481
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:54,956
not even a week apart.

482
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:56,277
But they're six years apart.

483
00:36:56,744 --> 00:36:58,637
They are
the last two disciples of Mr. He.

484
00:36:58,996 --> 00:37:00,317
Lin Yiyang is the closed-door disciple.

485
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:01,476
You're not taught by Mr. He?

486
00:37:02,396 --> 00:37:03,556
I'm not that lucky.

487
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:05,077
Mr. He has only six disciples.

488
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:07,077
Back then, everyone said

489
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:08,637
Mr. He finally took in

490
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:10,396
two talented kids before retiring.

491
00:37:11,117 --> 00:37:12,797
Among them,
Lin Yiyang had the highest aptitude,

492
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,556
and he even came on his own.

493
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:17,157
I want to learn billiards.

494
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:19,157
Which teacher?

495
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:22,317
He Wenfeng, Mr. He.

496
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:23,637
Quite confident.

497
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,876
You want to learn from the best teacher?

498
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:29,876
You are this short.

499
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:31,757
Do your parents agree?

500
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:32,996
Go bring your parents here.

501
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:35,197
The parents have to agree first.

502
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:37,277
I don't have parents.

503
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,396
Jiang Yang.

504
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:42,677
Are you bullying the newcomer again?

505
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:44,197
Mr. He, he...

506
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:45,476
I heard it all.

507
00:37:45,836 --> 00:37:46,677
You want a teacher?

508
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:49,717
What's your name?

509
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:50,916
Lin Yiyang.

510
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,717
Lin Yiyang.

511
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,312
My teacher said

512
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:56,237
he has won the championship
when he's just thirteen.

513
00:37:56,717 --> 00:37:58,117
Yes, he won the national champion.

514
00:37:59,157 --> 00:37:59,876
Amazing.

515
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:02,157
In those days,

516
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:03,597
anyone who wins the first or second

517
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:05,077
should be respectfully addressed.

518
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:07,157
Jiang Yang got the champion first.

519
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:09,036
So Lin Yiyang

520
00:38:09,476 --> 00:38:11,396
had to rank after Jiang Yang.

521
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:15,597
You've been living a tough life, right?

522
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:16,956
For me,

523
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,117
nothing is tough.

524
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,436
That's true.

525
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:24,797
For our Duncuo,

526
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:26,556
nothing is difficult.

527
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:38,717
It's here, right?

528
00:38:40,648 --> 00:38:41,317
Let's go.

529
00:38:47,944 --> 00:38:48,597
Bro.

530
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:51,956
Lin, what's up?

531
00:38:52,136 --> 00:38:53,197
Nothing much.

532
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:54,077
What can I get you?

533
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:55,476
Soda water.

534
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,197
Lin.

535
00:38:58,476 --> 00:38:59,197
What's up, Chris?

536
00:38:59,197 --> 00:38:59,720
Fine. You?

537
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,436
This looks like
where we played when we were kids.

538
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:18,077
It's really nice and quiet.

539
00:39:26,717 --> 00:39:27,396
Pick your cue.

540
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:39,237
I saw Wu Wei post something yesterday.

541
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:43,836
Who's she?

542
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:45,637
From which country?

543
00:39:46,077 --> 00:39:47,597
What's her race?

544
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:52,356
We've just met. Chinese.

545
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:54,237
It's not as mysterious as Wu Wei said.

546
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:55,476
Moreover,

547
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,637
she might not be into me.

548
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:00,956
Aren't you confident?

549
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:05,237
My experience tells me,

550
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:07,597
one must know and play

551
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:09,277
to his strengths.

552
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:10,836
Someone like you,

553
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:13,876
of course, handsome is your strength.

554
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:24,717
Looks like I got lucky today.

555
00:40:26,117 --> 00:40:26,836
Not bad.

556
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,237
Got the first round in one stroke.

557
00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:33,836
You're best at relationships.

558
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:35,876
Generally,

559
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:38,516
before chatting with a girl,

560
00:40:40,277 --> 00:40:41,436
should I get an emoji pack?

561
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:42,996
What's the use of an emoji pack?

562
00:40:43,956 --> 00:40:44,717
Again,

563
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,157
don't waste your handsome face.

564
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:49,757
I shouldn't ask you.

565
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,556
I do have something to ask you.

566
00:40:54,856 --> 00:40:55,516
Say it.

567
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,876
Wu Wei said

568
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,597
you applied for a PhD, right?

569
00:41:00,436 --> 00:41:01,096
Yeah.

570
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:02,476
What about a comeback?

571
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:08,356
What?

572
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,036
Then why do you practice every day?

573
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:10,836
It's a habit.

574
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:12,996
A habit that runs through
your entire life

575
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:14,677
must carry its meaning, right?

576
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:17,516
I'm too bored living here,

577
00:41:18,797 --> 00:41:19,996
and this is my only recreation.

578
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:25,996
You win this time.

579
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:28,077
Maybe not next time.

580
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:29,556
Then, next time.

581
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:31,556
You'd try again next time.

582
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:37,637
You might not believe it.

583
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,476
I still remember
your first day in the club.

584
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:45,516
On a rainy day,

585
00:41:46,277 --> 00:41:47,956
about six or seven in the evening.

586
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:01,036
I ate two bowls of ramen that night,

587
00:42:02,516 --> 00:42:04,117
put on all the warm clothes I could

588
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:05,277
and rode my bike to the club.

589
00:42:12,757 --> 00:42:13,556
Once I entered the yard,

590
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:16,717
on one side is

591
00:42:17,637 --> 00:42:18,277
a hair wash salon.

592
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:21,077
Another side is a restaurant.

593
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:26,996
It took one turn to find out

594
00:42:28,077 --> 00:42:29,956
the famous Dongxin City

595
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:32,757
was hidden in a shabby factory.

596
00:42:34,996 --> 00:42:36,157
It's different now.

597
00:42:37,436 --> 00:42:38,197
The entire yard

598
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:39,876
belongs to us now.

599
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:43,436
Congratulations on
your great career.

600
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:56,836
Grab the cue.

601
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:58,237
Are we playing or not?

602
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,396
