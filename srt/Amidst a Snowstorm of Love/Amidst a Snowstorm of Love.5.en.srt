25
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,279
Bro, I'm going to bed. See you later.

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
Go ahead.

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,759
You're up so early?

28
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,440
Routine of the school days.

29
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,696
What's wrong? You look bothered.

30
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,800
It didn't go well last night?

31
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,200
Her big brother is Meng Xiaodong.

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,879
That guy is her big brother?

33
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,728
You're doomed.

34
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,439
You're so doomed.

35
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:16,571
I thought you were going out.

36
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:17,896
Yeah, we're waiting for you.

37
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:19,571
For me?

38
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,092
I'll be fine alone.

39
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:28,691
Why would you stay alone?

40
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,372
You won't even have a decent meal.

41
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:31,931
Come with us.

42
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:34,532
- You...
- When is the training?

43
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,812
Around three or four.

44
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:43,012
Want to get changed?

45
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,972
No, I can go out like this.

46
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,812
Let's go then. It's getting late.

47
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:51,732
Let me get changed.

48
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,972
Wait. Let me grab my phone and bag.

49
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,252
Alright, man.

50
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,332
Straight to the point.

51
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,732
Well, are we going far?

52
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:09,491
Should I wear sneakers?

53
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:11,811
There won't be
much walking. I got a taxi.

54
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:13,640
Okay.

55
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:18,412
Thank you.

56
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,971
The scallops are quite good.

57
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:22,152
Right?

58
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:22,692
Indeed.

59
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:45,852
Is it nice?

60
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:46,572
Yeah.

61
00:04:46,572 --> 00:04:47,132
Right?

62
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:57,371
This is a local specialty.

63
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:58,811
Salmon soup.

64
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:02,760
Okay.

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,531
Yours are coming soon.

66
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:13,892
Is it nice?

67
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:15,811
Yeah.

68
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:20,732
Thank you.

69
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:22,292
Thank you.

70
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:30,088
Want to see a nice place?

71
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:33,892
Yeah, let's go.

72
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:36,251
That's it. We're done.

73
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:37,292
Enjoy the food.

74
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:39,452
Don't make them go to waste.

75
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,931
Yin Guo, I'm going with him.

76
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:43,976
Okay.

77
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,448
See you.

78
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:54,440
Want some more scallops?

79
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:55,732
No, no, thanks.

80
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:57,412
I'm getting stuffed.

81
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:07,912
(I got the third wheel away.)

82
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:09,371
(Here's a useful tip.)

83
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,292
(This is a place for dating.)

84
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:34,052
S-Something came up?
You're rushing to leave?

85
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:36,171
Almost done.

86
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:47,720
Done.

87
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,132
You...

88
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:56,211
(What happened? He looks so serious.)

89
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:58,892
(The metro stopped? So we need a cab?)

90
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,452
(Or do we have to walk home?)

91
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:02,731
(Or did the landlord change his mind)

92
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:04,411
(about renting me the room?)

93
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:05,812
Do you want an ice cream?

94
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:08,372
Ice cream?

95
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:09,512
Yeah.

96
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,171
There is

97
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,091
a DIY ice cream shop

98
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:14,952
nearby.

99
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:22,091
Okay.

100
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:36,132
Let me ask Wu Wei.

101
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:45,411
Why is it closed?

102
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:47,091
I forgot.

103
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:48,851
It closed down in October.

104
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:50,171
Sorry.

105
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:53,052
Where are you? We'll find you.

106
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,064
I'll send you the address.

107
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:05,052
It closed down.

108
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:07,880
What...

109
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:13,052
What do we do?

110
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,492
I know another place. Let's go.

111
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:51,016
There.

112
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:53,971
Food again?

113
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:56,851
Freaking out?

114
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,012
A little bit.

115
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:01,291
Let's go.

116
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,531
We're closed. Sorry.

117
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:17,512
Turn around.

118
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:21,452
Look who's here!

119
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:22,171
Ping.

120
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,892
What would you like? Here.

121
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:27,932
Take a look. The chef is not here.

122
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,651
I'll cook for you.

123
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:31,812
Make an ice cream.

124
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,211
Make it...

125
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:38,291
No problem.

126
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:40,611
Sit wherever you want. Be right there.

127
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,372
Go get some
dried rose petals and berries.

128
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:05,651
What?

129
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:07,531
What's the matter with you?

130
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:09,651
You've brought a girl here for a date

131
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:10,888
without doing some research.

132
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:12,572
We're not on a date.

133
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:14,692
We are roommates.

134
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:15,611
Roommates.

135
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:16,648
Yeah.

136
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,332
We share an apartment.

137
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,332
What should I get? Come again.

138
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:27,971
Topping for the ice cream.

139
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:29,932
Dried rose petals and berries.

140
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:31,371
Right on that street.

141
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,971
That's the new term for living together?

142
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:35,731
Be serious.

143
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:47,011
First time.

144
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:49,211
What?

145
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,491
It's his first time bringing a girl.

146
00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:53,172
I've known him for two years.

147
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:58,891
W-We were just passing by.

148
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:01,131
Passing by?

149
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:06,652
Did he work here part-time?

150
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:08,412
We met at the billiard room.

151
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,452
And we became friends.

152
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:12,491
He came by to help

153
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:13,891
when he was free.

154
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:17,172
He surely has a lot of friends.

155
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:21,452
He's a nice guy and he's handsome.

156
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:23,772
Who wouldn't like him, right?

157
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,131
Keep the rest.

158
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,652
I'm not taking advantage of you.
You'll have it all.

159
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:31,692
Isn't it too much?

160
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:33,412
It will be a waste.

161
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:35,211
Fine, I'll do as you say

162
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:38,332
to show respect for
Lin Yiyang's roommate.

163
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:42,611
We met at the billiard room.

164
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:44,211
He's a retired baseball player

165
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,292
who also knows billiards.

166
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:12,452
Here you are.

167
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,851
So pretty. Thank you.

168
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:19,731
Don't mention it.

169
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,091
He's going to pay, anyway.

170
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:31,971
I'll watch my game.

171
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,292
Come to me if you need anything.

172
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:35,412
Okay.

173
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:50,491
You're graduating soon.

174
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:51,731
Aren't you busy?

175
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:55,091
Not so much now.

176
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:01,932
Are you planning

177
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:04,371
to stay here or go back home?

178
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:09,572
I haven't decided.

179
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:12,292
Have you considered going pro?

180
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:17,851
- Me?
- Yeah.

181
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:21,211
No.

182
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,532
I think you should think about it.

183
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:26,172
I mean it.

184
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:32,491
Many players never
attend world tournaments

185
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:33,960
and focus on regional ones.

186
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:35,772
Do you know why?

187
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,532
Some of them are not interested
in the world ranking.

188
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:43,211
Some of them

189
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:45,731
can't adapt to the greater contests

190
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:48,131
due to their weak minds.

191
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:50,412
That's me.

192
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:52,491
What?

193
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:54,131
No way!

194
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:55,091
Why would you

195
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:56,572
say that?

196
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:08,891
Ever tried sweet liquor?

197
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:12,776
Is it nice?

198
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:16,572
It's just liquor as a dessert.

199
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:18,971
It's not bad.

200
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:20,968
Want to try?

201
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:23,560
Wait for me.

202
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:30,891
Ping.

203
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,052
Do you have any of that

204
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:34,011
aged liquor left?

205
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:35,211
Just a little bit.

206
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:37,292
Pour me a glass.

207
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:39,532
She may not like it.

208
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:42,491
Let me get you something the girls like.

209
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:43,211
No.

210
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:45,172
I want that one.

211
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:47,412
What for?

212
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:49,851
Is that how you run a business?

213
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:53,011
But it's unnecessary.

214
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:55,731
She may not like it.

215
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:58,332
You can't tell her how pricy it is.

216
00:14:58,971 --> 00:14:59,731
It's awkward.

217
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,251
But it doesn't show your sincerity

218
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,172
unless you tell her the price.

219
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:07,251
Just stop it.
You're giving me a headache.

220
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,851
Fine, I'll stop.

221
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,891
Hurry up.

222
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:34,251
Just end it. You're not
going to sell the residual.

223
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:41,332
Other customers don't get so much.

224
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:46,812
Thanks.

225
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:50,011
Why did he insist on this one?

226
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:51,611
I don't get it.

227
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,891
Is it sweet?

228
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:02,452
Try it.

229
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,371
It's a tasty aged sweet liquor.

230
00:16:05,851 --> 00:16:06,371
It's rare.

231
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:08,211
Have you tried it?

232
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:10,412
I had a glass
when it was opened last month.

233
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,172
Wines and liquor

234
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,052
are highly unique,

235
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:16,891
especially the aged ones.

236
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:18,652
Only the lucky ones

237
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,491
get to taste them.

238
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,131
You're holding

239
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:26,491
the last glass.

240
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,412
Then I have to savor it.

241
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:41,452
So strong. It burns a bit.

242
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:48,971
It's a bit sweet indeed.

243
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:57,011
It's nice.

244
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:02,292
Hello, Ping.

245
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:14,172
Nice liquor. It's one of a kind.

246
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,652
You devour hotdogs and pizza

247
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,011
but you serve her fine liquor.

248
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,572
Stop telling me
that you're not into her.

249
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:27,731
You know what?

250
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,971
It warms my stomach after the seafood.

251
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:44,532
I'll get her back.

252
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:46,572
No need.

253
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,971
Have fun. I can go back alone.

254
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:49,851
I got the cab.

255
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:55,772
Again? It's so pricy.

256
00:17:58,891 --> 00:17:59,652
Bro, what's wrong?

257
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:04,572
I got something in my eyes.

258
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:06,572
Let's go.

259
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:08,491
See you.

260
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:09,371
Bye, Yin Guo.

261
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:13,412
Thanks.

262
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:24,652
Bro, where are we going?

263
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,332
Nowhere. We're just
taking a walk to save money.

264
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:35,731
They know it's my table.

265
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:37,412
Call me if you need me.

266
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:41,172
Okay.

Hey, Milo.

Thank you.

272
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:26,252
You should have told me.

273
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:27,772
I would have paid.

274
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,131
I wanted coffee and got you one, too.

275
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:33,171

Coach, have you heard of Wu Wei?

329
00:23:14,212 --> 00:23:16,171
He's a contestant of the championship.

330
00:23:16,532 --> 00:23:19,091
Wu Wei, I've seen his name on the list.

331
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,411
But he hasn't played the Nine-Ball.

332
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:22,611
I don't know him.

333
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:24,052
Just a second.

334
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:26,532
Ms. Yang.

335
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:28,451
Have you heard of Wu Wei?

336
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:31,972
Wu Wei?
He's from Dongxin City. Talented kid.

337
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:34,212
But he hasn't played much these years.

338
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,368
So he's not on the world ranking.

339
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:37,252
Then

340
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:40,611
what about Lin Yiyang?

341
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:42,691
Lin Yiyang. I know that kid.

342
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:43,891
He plays snooker.

343
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:46,252
When he won the championship,

344
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:47,931
my wife was his coach.

345
00:23:48,371 --> 00:23:49,371
He was a pro player?

346
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:51,131
Yeah.

347
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:53,332
But that was several years ago.

348
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:55,691
At which contest did he make his debut?

349
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:56,851
What's his best achievement?

350
00:23:57,451 --> 00:24:00,012
Champion. He won on his debut.

351
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:02,572
Your brother is his peer.

352
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:04,532
Why don't you ask your brother?

353
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:07,371
Ask my brother?

354
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:11,772
He was just a teenager back then.

355
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:13,131
He wouldn't remember it.

356
00:24:14,332 --> 00:24:15,332
Which club is he with?

357
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:19,131
I haven't heard of him.
Is he still playing?

358
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:21,292
He quit a dozen years ago.

359
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:22,851
He was from Dongxin City.

360
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:25,411
We have a new coach

361
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:27,292
from that club.

362
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,012
Wait. Let me ask him.

363
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:30,371
Mr. Xu.

364
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:32,171
Do you know Lin Yiyang?

365
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:33,812
He's from Dongxin City.

366
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:36,972
That's it. Clean up.

367
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:39,972
Of course, I know him.

368
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:43,492
Do you know He Wenfeng, Mr. He?

369
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:45,171
Of course.

370
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:46,732
But I bet you don't know

371
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,212
that Lin Yiyang was
Mr. He's favorite disciple.

372
00:24:49,332 --> 00:24:50,931
That kid Lin Yiyang

373
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,052
is a genius indeed.

374
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,451
But he's also wild.

375
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:54,732
It's like

376
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:57,252
nobody can contain him.

377
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,931
Back then, he was so undisciplined.

378
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:01,492
Mr. He was so mad at him.

379
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:05,012
In the end, he got kicked out.

380
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:07,691
But then, Jiang Yang and the others

381
00:25:07,732 --> 00:25:09,052
are really close to him.

382
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:10,611
Before Mr. He retired,

383
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:11,772
nobody

384
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:14,371
dared to bring up
his name in Dongxin City.

385
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:16,891
But after Mr. He retired,

386
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,091
Jiang Yang took over.

387
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,572
Who's Jiang Yang?

388
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:22,371
Lin Yiyang's senior.

389
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,091
Therefore, no one dares
to say anything bad

390
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,411
about Lin in the club.

391
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:28,532
So

392
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:31,451
he's a junior of Jiang Yang.

393
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:33,732
- Yeah.
- That's right.

394
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:36,451
Jiang Yang and the others
call him the Sixth.

395
00:25:36,532 --> 00:25:39,212
It's because
he was Mr. He's sixth disciple.

396
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:43,292
You're so curious about him.

397
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,131
I can ask Jiang Yang about him/

398
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,091
No need.

399
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,572
You don't have to.

400
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:50,451
My brother hates Jiang Yang.
I don't want to get scolded.

401
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:51,411
Also,

402
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:53,371
don't tell my brother
that I've asked about them.

403
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:55,332
Your brother is coming soon.

404
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,611
Please don't mention me.

405
00:25:58,171 --> 00:25:59,691
That's it. I have the training to do.

406
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:00,812
See you, coach.

407
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,691
What a kid.

408
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:10,131
That kid was such a genius.

409
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:11,171
What a pity.

410
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:16,371
You're a bit late today.

411
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:17,492
There was a meeting.

412
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:19,931
- See you.
- See you.

413
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:20,744
Off work.

414
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:21,931
We fixed the schedule.

415
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:24,371
We're all flying next Wednesday.

416
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:26,292
The passports are ready. Rest assured.

417
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,052
Change the schedule.

418
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:30,371
Visit Yin Guo first for the Nine-Ball.

419
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:32,891
Nine-Ball?

420
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:34,931
But it has nothing to do with us.

421
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:38,012
I'm meeting someone.

422
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:43,012
Don't you want to meet my sister?

423
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:48,371
I don't want to disrupt her training.

424
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:50,572
Rest assured.

425
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:52,732
You're not important enough

426
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:55,292
to be able to disrupt her.

427
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:02,651
What do you feel about Yin Guo?

428
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:07,272
No idea.

429
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,252
No idea?

430
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:12,292
You still haven't figured out
whether you like her?

431
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:13,451
I like her.

432
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:15,772
Just say it then.

433
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:21,972
I don't think Guo is so insensitive.

434
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:23,052
She knows.

435
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:25,691
She didn't say anything

436
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:27,492
because she didn't like me.

437
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,012
Why would I say it out loud
and make her awkward?

438
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,572
She may know about it.

439
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:36,212
But you still have to tell her.

440
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,091
If she turns you down,

441
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:41,931
you can focus on your career.

442
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,332
(You used to...)

443
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:04,840
(Forgot to ask which year it was.)

444
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:22,451
(I don't get it.)

445
00:29:22,812 --> 00:29:24,091
(The liquor you had this afternoon?)

446
00:29:28,264 --> 00:29:30,440
(I don't know which year it's from.)

447
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,131
(The year you were born.)

448
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:38,024
(I mean the liquor.)

449
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:01,451
You've been biting on this cup
for ten minutes.

450
00:30:01,891 --> 00:30:03,012
Are you trying to eat it?

451
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:19,052
Sun Zhou.

452
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:21,332
Am I

453
00:30:23,732 --> 00:30:24,851
quite boring?

454
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,292
No.

455
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:28,012
Why?

456
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:32,691
Someone told me these days,

457
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,371
that when I'm with her,

458
00:30:37,012 --> 00:30:38,332
all we do is eating.

459
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,492
There's no other activity.

460
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:46,012
Maybe it's because I was poor as a kid.

461
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:48,732
So poor

462
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:51,651
that I had no zest for life.

463
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,411
And even now, I feel

464
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:56,651
that being able

465
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:59,252
to be fed in various ways

466
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:02,772
is the happiest thing in the world.

467
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:05,532
Who is it?

468
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,732
May I ask

469
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,052
who managed to...

470
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:09,651
No.

471
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:11,691
Fine.

472
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:14,131
Didn't you just use me as a tree hole?

473
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:16,532
A tree hole makes echoes, okay?

474
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:26,931
You're so busy this semester

475
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:29,252
but you keep traveling.
Can you manage it?

476
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:30,492
I got this.

477
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:32,851
Come on, look at you.

478
00:31:33,451 --> 00:31:35,091
You're getting sick like this.

479
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:37,252
I won't.

480
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:38,972
I won't come next week.

481
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:42,131
I have tons of things to do.
I'm definitely not coming.

482
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:43,891
Definitely?

483
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:46,851
For sure.

484
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:51,411
I think someone said that last week.

485
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:53,091
We came back this week.

486
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:54,851
So I'm totally swamped next week.

487
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:57,171
I can't spare even a second.

488
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:59,212
I'll believe you one more time.

489
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:16,131
(Have you tried this restaurant?)

490
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,572
(No. Are you interested?)

491
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:40,532
Let me take you there next time.

492
00:32:41,052 --> 00:32:42,572
My bestie loves pasta.

493
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:43,972
She tried many places

494
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:46,691
and said they had
the best lobster pasta.

495
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,332
Don't turn me down or offer to pay.

496
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:51,891
Friends treat each other in turns.

497
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:10,131
Let me take you there next time.

498
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:12,012
My bestie loves pasta.

499
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:13,411
She tried many places

500
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:16,091
and said they had
the best lobster pasta.

501
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:18,732
Don't turn me down or offer to pay.

502
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,332
Friends treat each other in turns.

503
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:27,332
(Okay.)

504
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:00,732
Happy Friday.

505
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,052
Hey, Happy Friday, Milo.

506
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,052
When will Lin come back?

507
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,812
He won't be back this week.

508
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,171
But next week.

509
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:12,052
It's soon. Seven days to count down.

510
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:13,572
A week?

511
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,371
If you're bored,

512
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,532
I can be your company
for these two days.

513
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:20,812
Deal?

514
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:22,696
Deal.

515
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:31,131
Wait a minute, my mother
made some rice pirog for you.

516
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:35,891
Some what?

517
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:37,732
Yeah, it's a pie.

518
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,292
Oh, it's a pie.

519
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:41,292
Yeah, Lin made a lot of them.
He likes it.

520
00:34:42,052 --> 00:34:43,732
I hope you'll like it.

521
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:47,052
Thank you.
Say thanks to your mom for me.

522
00:34:47,131 --> 00:34:47,691
I will.

523
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,891
(Isn't that my brother's
arch-enemy Jiang Yang?)

524
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:39,691
Hi.

525
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:43,492
Hi.

526
00:35:45,171 --> 00:35:46,131
Hi, everyone.

527
00:36:04,652 --> 00:36:06,252
(Isn't he a snooker player?)

528
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,451
(Why did he come for Nine-Ball?)

529
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:12,931
(I'd better hide until they leave.)

530
00:36:15,332 --> 00:36:16,692
(Otherwise,)

531
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:18,371
(it's too awkward.)

532
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:21,931
Bro, who is she?

533
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:26,252
Meng Xiaodong's little sister.

534
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:27,772
Meng Xiaodong?

535
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:41,812
Explain it.

536
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:44,851
What's going on? You're living together?

537
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:46,252
It has nothing to do with me.

538
00:36:50,212 --> 00:36:51,172
She's with our guy.

539
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:54,732
Who?

540
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:56,571
Lin Yiyang.

541
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,051
Is it going to work?

542
00:37:00,812 --> 00:37:02,891
Are you serious? Of course.

543
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,011
Our guy never chickens out.

544
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:13,491
That junior of mine

545
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:15,652
has such a taste.

546
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:50,571
(They must be gone.)

547
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:57,292
You woke up?

548
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:02,212
I-I didn't sleep.

549
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:11,371
(I thought he wasn't
coming back this week.)

550
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:19,812
I'll get a shower.

551
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,531
Lin Yiyang came back

552
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:29,051
and told us to stay quiet

553
00:39:29,224 --> 00:39:30,491
so that you could sleep.

554
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:37,652
An'an.

555
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,692
Check where the takeout is.

556
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:40,971
What takeout?

557
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:43,971
I told you to get a takeout.
Didn't you hear me?

558
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:45,652
Y-You did?

559
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:48,051
Never mind.

560
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:49,512
Get something. I'm hungry.

561
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:50,332
Fan.

562
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:51,720
Do it.

563
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:52,571
Alright.

564
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:54,971
How do I do that?

565
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:57,692
Look online.

566
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:00,891
She's awake.

567
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:02,571
Feel free to make noises.

568
00:40:02,571 --> 00:40:03,531
We can talk now.

569
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:04,252
Come on.

570
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,051
Want some?

571
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:20,172
No, thanks. My stomach
can't handle cold things.

572
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:55,772
So fast?

573
00:40:55,772 --> 00:40:57,172
You just dipped yourself in the water?

574
00:40:57,411 --> 00:40:58,120
Mind your business.

575
00:40:58,571 --> 00:40:59,336
Want something to eat?

576
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:00,172
I had food.

577
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:21,212
(What are you doing?)

578
00:41:34,568 --> 00:41:35,772
(Having an ice cream.)

579
00:41:39,848 --> 00:41:40,971
(See you in the laundry room.)

580
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:51,732
(Okay.)

581
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:54,212
(I happen to have clothes to wash.)

582
00:41:57,172 --> 00:41:59,292
(You go first. I'll be there.)

583
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,092
(Okay.)

584
00:42:42,652 --> 00:42:43,491
Where are you going?

585
00:42:44,252 --> 00:42:44,931
Out.

586
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:46,732
Out where?

587
00:42:56,851 --> 00:42:57,411
Lin Yiyang.

588
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:00,252
I saw her in the Youth Competition
a few years ago.

589
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:03,092
Do you know who her brother is?

590
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:15,891
You guys.

591
00:43:17,051 --> 00:43:18,411
Show some respect in front of the kids.

592
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:21,011
Fan.

593
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:23,172
You have potential.

594
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:24,612
Thanks, bro.
