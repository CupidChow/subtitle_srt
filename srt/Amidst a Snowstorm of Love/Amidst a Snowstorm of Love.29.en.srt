=Episode 29=

25
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,200
What's wrong?

26
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,360
Are you angry?

27
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,680
What do you think?

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,680
You just said
you've been keeping your temper.

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,520
Is it because of me?

30
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,319
Or else what?

31
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,200
Need I I remind you
someone else is chasing you?

32
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,559
And she even works with you.

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,240
You can stay with me.

34
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,320
My parents won't allow that.

35
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,079
Let me think.

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
We can't live together for a long time.

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,719
But a day or two should be fine.

38
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,639
I mean, we get married.

39
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,960
So, neither of us will have concerns.

40
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,079
And we can keep suitors away from us.

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,559
After all, people judge.

42
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,639
Does it make a difference,
getting married?

43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,399
Well,

44
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
are you scared?

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,600
I just stopped by to see you.

46
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,000
I didn't expect you to ask me that.

47
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,239
So, what do you say?

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,600
I...

49
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:47,880
Well,

50
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,160
now, you...

51
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,519
I get it.

52
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,919
I'll get you water.

53
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,200
Whose guitar it is?

54
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,839
Jiang Yang's.

55
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,040
His blind date likes artistic youths.

56
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,480
He used to know how to play it,
and he picked it up again recently.

57
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,560
It's just to charm the girl.

58
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,679
Xiaodong learned to play the piano
when he was little.

59
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,359
Yes, piano is perfect for him

60
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,600
Jiang Yang taught himself
to play guitar.

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,959
What about you?

62
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,160
I have no hobbies.

63
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,359
Seems like I've always been boring.

64
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,280
Practicing
and competitions are full of my life.

65
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,760
That's why you're my type.

66
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:18,764
(Indoor Arena)

67
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:21,760
(First Day of the Tournament)

68
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,039
Attention, guys.

69
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,240
The game is about to start.

70
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,240
All of you used to win championships.

71
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,159
I don't want to affect your mentality,

72
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,959
so I won't say much
before the competition.

73
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,920
Do you have anything to say?

74
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,360
You all are top players in the world.

75
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,039
It's normal for you to compete and win.

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,320
But I still have to warn you guys today.

77
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,639
China has always been first in medals
and gold medals at the Asian Games.

78
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,079
Today's match is open to Asia.

79
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,000
We must not fall behind in that case.

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,039
Understood.

81
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,639
Come on.

82
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,880
Keep it up.

83
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,079
Wuhan has hosted many competitions.

84
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,440
(Live. Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games)
But it never hosted the Snooker Open.

85
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,000
The 9-Ball match was only held once
in the past decade.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Today the auditorium is full.

87
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,880
It means
they're looking forward to this match.

88
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:53,399
- Yiyang.
- In the multi-sport event,

89
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,639
the billiard event appeared
in the Asian Games a decade ago.

90
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,320
This time, the Team China

91
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,920
has star players
in snooker and Women's 9-Ball.

92
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,839
Many fans came for them.

93
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,079
Get ready? Just relax.

94
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,320
You used to defeat those players.

95
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,920
So, relax and get your minds right.

96
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,479
The first to advance
in the match will be either you or you.

97
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,200
The most suspense is which of you two
will win the 9-Ball game.

98
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,079
Coach, you're too direct.

99
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,320
What if we get snooty?

100
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,560
You should be proud of yourself.

101
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,599
I don't have any advice for you two.

102
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,519
Just remember to conserve your energy.

103
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
The match is long and energy-consuming.

104
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,240
Especially to you, you'll have to play
from start to finish.

105
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,279
Don't worry, coach, I will do my best.

106
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,279
I have confidence in you.

107
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,639
The finals are your battleground.

108
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,039
Don't worry.

109
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,688
Go for it.

110
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,959
Why don't you watch the group match?

111
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,680
There are too many events to follow.

112
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,959
I'm asking about the billiards
that you're most focused on.

113
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,719
I have faith in them.

114
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,519
No suspense in the group matches.
I'll only watch the finals.

115
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,336
(Day 3 of the Competition)

116
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:04,640
It's the first gold medal in billiards.

117
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,920
Chinese player Lin Yiyang

118
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,879
won the first gold medal in billiards.

119
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,992
(Day 4 of the Competition)

120
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,999
Congratulations to Team China
for the silver medal

121
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:32,079
in Women's 8-Ball.

122
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,960
(Day 5 of the Competition)

123
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,280
Lin Yiyang won the fifth gold medal
for Team China.

124
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,879
The gold medal in Men's 8-Ball
belongs to Team China.

125
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,320
You did a good job.

126
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,759
I'm lucky.
I can't play in my main event,

127
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,640
but at least I won a medal
in the 8-Ball event.

128
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,999
Congrats.

129
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:26,520
Well done.

130
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,136
Well done.

131
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:30,759
Good for you.

132
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,680
Pretty good.

133
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,040
This is the Men's 9-Ball gold medal.

134
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:52,680
Take it. When you win
the Women's 9-Ball gold tomorrow,

135
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,640
you will be the king of 9-Ball.

136
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,079
Are you in the mood for a joke?

137
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,239
I'm worried about your shoulder injury.
Doesn't it hurt?

138
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:14,824
It's okay.

139
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,424
(Day 6 of the Competition)

140
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,280
If they never retire,

141
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,200
does it mean we will never get a chance
to win glory for our country?

142
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,599
Don't worry. They're getting older,
so we will have opportunities.

143
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,839
I can hear you guys.

144
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,839
Billiards players have a long career.

145
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,239
I think you three stand no chance.

146
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,640
Watch the game.

147
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,239
His shoulder injury.

148
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,079
He looked fine this morning.

149
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,479
The team doctor treated his injury
last night.

150
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:11,800
Last night?

151
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:16,560
I heard it from Jiang Yang.
He told me not to tell you.

152
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,599
But he still completed nine frames
with Xiaodong.

153
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,479
Yes, it's energy-consuming.

154
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,359
Congratulations to Meng Xiaodong
for winning the gold medal

155
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,360
in Men's Single.

156
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,904
Congratulations.

157
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:29,992
Come on.

158
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:33,800
Lin Yiyang won the silver medal.

159
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,800
Are you okay?

160
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,560
Give him the ice pack.

161
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,280
Here.

162
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,856
Thanks.

163
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:47,640
Relax.

164
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,359
I'm expecting your medal.

165
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,959
The Women's Six-Red snooker quarterfinal
is about to start.

166
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,800
It will be a best of five.

167
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,200
Well done.
We can't lose to the men's team.

168
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,320
Hey, you three. Do you concede?

169
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,079
Look at her.
Coach, please say something.

170
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,200
The women's team has the strength.

171
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,239
Think about their world ranking.

172
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,200
Coach, you didn't help.

173
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
Among the three of us,
there are two with serious injuries.

174
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
You should be encouraging us.

175
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,759
Okay, you guys will have a good lunch.

176
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:10,680
Play your match after that.

177
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,839
Are you done?

178
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,440
Yes.

179
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:32,320
How come he
and the team doctor haven't come to eat?

180
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,280
I guess they're eating
in the treatment room.

181
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,920
Alright, don't worry.
Have a chicken leg.

182
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,040
You eat it.

183
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
I didn't touch it. It's yours.

184
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,039
Given your current condition,
you'll need to ice it again.

185
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:08,999
How is he?

186
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,239
He's good.
Just apply ice for a few minutes.

187
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,519
How was the match?

188
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,440
I made it to the semifinal.

189
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,799
Good for you. Keep it up.

190
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,719
Lin Lin made it too.
The women's snooker starts tonight.

191
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:35,759
We'll try to win a gold medal.

192
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,840
If so, we'll be first
on the gold medal tally.

193
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,479
It will take the pressure
off the men's team.

194
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,959
Great, we'll depend on you.

195
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,959
The gold medal will definitely be ours.

196
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:57,519
Haven't you had lunch yet?

197
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,999
No, not yet.

198
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,400
Eat some. I'll help you.

199
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,319
I'll do it myself. I can still move.

200
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,319
Eat more. Have more meat.

201
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,080
Here's the champion
of the Women's Six-Red.

202
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,680
Lin Lin won her first
individual gold medal in this match.

203
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,759
Congratulations
to the two Chinese players

204
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,360
for winning the gold
and silver medals in this event.

205
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,039
Well done.

206
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:36,520
(Lin's Guo)

207
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,959
(I won it today.
I'll definitely win a gold tomorrow.)

208
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,840
Alright, I'm looking forward to it.

209
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,144
(Lin. To my coach He Wenfeng.)

210
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,080
Are you envious?

211
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,360
If I hadn't had surgery, these medals...

212
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,920
You're older now.
Just take care of yourself.

213
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,200
You're so direct.

214
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:46,200
Tao, will his shoulder injury
affect his tomorrow's match?

215
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,799
His shoulder injury...

216
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,440
I'm good.

217
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,519
You know your injury best.

218
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,880
No matter what,

219
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,600
we must fight through
tomorrow's snooker team event

220
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,920
We all need to do our best.

221
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,680
I have reported your old injury
to the organizing committee.

222
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:10,600
Just play normally in tomorrow's match.

223
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:11,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

224
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,584
(Day 8 of the Competition)

225
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,519
Guo, well done.

226
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,912
Thanks.

227
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,799
Congratulations to Yin Guo
for winning the Women's 9-Ball.

228
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:07,880
Thank you.

229
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,680
Everyone, look at the chess team.

230
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,999
They've swept all the gold medals.
They did better than us.

231
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,959
Look at the aerobic gymnastics team.

232
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:34,400
They won all golds and stunned people
with perfect scores.

233
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,999
We should praise the women's team
for two golds and three silvers.

234
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,279
They secured the top spot on the medal
and gold medal tallies in advance.

235
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,920
That's true. They took our pressure off.

236
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,840
Otherwise, you three would be tense
in the team competition

237
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,799
Thank you all.

238
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,160
Take the medicine.

239
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,719
Okay, thank you.

240
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,360
So, can you make it through the match?

241
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,360
I think I can. It's not a distraction.

242
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,640
I think I can too.

243
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,360
Lin Yiyang and I have physical injuries.

244
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,239
And you have mental issues.

245
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,880
You need to overcome it.
We'll depend on you to win.

246
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,160
(He has played for just over a year.
I don't think he has old injuries.)

247
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,840
(He lied. Is he afraid of losing?)

248
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,880
(Quitting sounds better than losing.)

249
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,999
(He competed abroad last year.)

250
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:32,920
(He look down on Chinese competitions.)

251
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,840
(Who knows why he came back?)

252
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,519
(I cannot agree more.)

253
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,479
What's your plan after the match?

254
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,319
Let's talk about it after the match.

255
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:49,039
Okay, go for it.

256
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,600
Go for it.

257
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,640
The last match tonight

258
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,400
is the last billiards match.

259
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,759
The Men's Snooker Team Event
is about to start.

260
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,280
Let's go.

261
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,672
Lin Yiyang.

262
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:22,600
Good luck, Yiyang.

263
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,112
Thanks.

264
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,039
The entrant is Lin Yiyang from China.

265
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,440
His opponent is Ayif from India.

266
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Lin Yiyang won this frame
in just 20 minutes.

267
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,920
Jiang Yang and Meng Xiaodong

268
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,840
won the second men's doubles.

269
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,559
Team China leads by two to zero.

270
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:47,680
India pulled back two games.
The total score is now two to two.

271
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,319
Next, a tie-breaker is about to start.

272
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,160
Is your shoulder okay?

273
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:02,559
You looks fine.

274
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,959
Of course.

275
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,719
Go for it.

276
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,600
After tonight,
you will miss the open next month.

277
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,479
You take this chance
to overtake his ranking points.

278
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,200
It's the most frustrating night for us.

279
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,239
We took great effort to be tied.

280
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,080
Can you do it?

281
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,519
Sure.

282
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,519
Foul and a miss. China four.

283
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,160
Foul and a miss. China four.

in the Men's Snooker Team Event.
Congratulations.

294

Their success did not come easy.

295
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:35,600
Female players worked hard
in this match.

296
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,120
And male players also did a great job,
though two of them have old injuries.

297
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Eventually, they won the last gold,

I really envy you all.
You guys never left the course.

309
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,439
I've been envious of your talent
since I was little.

310
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,160
You geniuses stop flattering each other.

311
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,439
You guys started competing
and winning championships at 12 or 13.

312
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,719
I joined the club at 14.

313
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,560
I studied with Lin Yiyang.

314
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,000
And I won a championship at 18.

315
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,080
Others see me as a diligent
and hardworking player.

316
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,319
What do you want to say?

317
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Actually, I also had surgery
at the end of last year.

318
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,759
No one knew except for my dad.

319
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,080
No wonder you stayed overseas
for a year.

320
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,200
Turns out you were in recovery.

321
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:38,319
Look how proud he is.

322
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,680
I know I can't be friends with you.

323
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,600
You always piss me off.

324
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,439
You guys haven't left yet?
We are about to turn out the lights.

325
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,439
Some fans are still waiting outside.

326
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,520
Buddy, could you take a picture for us?

327
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,040
Okay.

328
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:06,399
Sit down.

329
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,879
Listen to me, guys.

330
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:38,480
The organizers just called
and asked us not to go out.

331
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,200
Too many spectators outside.
They are afraid of causing a stampede.

332
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,719
Let's leave
after the fans are dispersed.

333
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:45,319
Okay.

334
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:46,344
You guys take a rest.

335
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:46,856
