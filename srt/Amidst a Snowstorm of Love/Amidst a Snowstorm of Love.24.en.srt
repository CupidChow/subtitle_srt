=Episode 24=

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,479
Many people came to Hel for me.

26
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,959
My mind is all mixed up.

27
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,559
So, I wanted to drink.

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,360
I just walked over there,

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,320
and saw an Asian girl standing in there.

30
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,720
I thought you are Chinese.

31
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,319
Back then, I just stood here,

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,999
watching you for several minutes.

33
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,720
What was I doing at that time?

34
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,560
What?

35
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,480
At that time, I wanted
to open the door and tell you,

36
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,040
"It's okay.
There's nothing to worry about.

37
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,359
We will get through the snowstorm".

38
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,280
We will get through the snowstorm.

39
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,239
I was really desperate at that time.

40
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,440
If you really said that to me,

41
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,359
I would definitely think
this man is really not empathetic.

42
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,440
Can't you sleep?

43
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,592
She's asleep?

44
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:27,160
With different strength,
everyone's mentality varies.

45
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,399
Ever since I made it to the final four,
it still feels like a dream to me.

46
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,639
But I can't see her being excited,

47
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,519
probably she got used to it.

48
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,160
She's also happy.

49
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,679
Take a look for me.

50
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,744
It's a call from Jiang Yang.

51
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
I guess he's so glad
you made it to the final four,

52
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,519
even forgot the time here.

53
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,919
It's late night here.

54
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,919
You don't check the time to call.

55

(Passport)

56
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,839
What are you doing?

57
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,760
I have plans tomorrow,

58
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,159
need to go back to Helsin,

59
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,560
so I can't watch your game.

60
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,680
In our first semi-final,
the two players are both from China.

61
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,440
On the world ranking,
Yin Guo is at the 3rd position.

62
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,320
While her opponent is at the 7th.

63
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,336
Where are people from Dongxin City?

64
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,639
They've returned.

65
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,519
That fast?

66
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,800
Maybe it's time she comes back.

67
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,480
Soon.

68
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,096
Guo.

69
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,160
Guo, congratulations.

70
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,719
Congratulations!

71
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,640
Come on, eat something.

72
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:15,879
There's one more game tomorrow.
Don't rush.

73
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,959
What about the men's group?

74
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,879
Chen An'an has left.

75
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,359
What?

76
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,759
Dongxin City only has Liu Xiran now.

77
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,440
Everyone else has returned.
I don't know why.

78
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I-I want to make a phone call.

79
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,432
Go ahead.

80
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,079
Why is that?

81
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:49,879
I have no idea.

82
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,980
(What happened?)

83
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,124
(Chen An'an has left,
so have all the people of Dongxin City.)

84
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,079
(The game is over?)

85
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:24,520
(Yes. I made it to the finals.
Have you arrived?)

86
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,879
(Do you know why they all have left?)

87
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,160
(Yes, Mr. He has passed away.)

88
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:42,759
(I'm on the plane.
You focus on the competition.)

89
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:48,959
(I'm about to take off.
See you back in China.)

90
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:35,800
Hello.

91
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,640
You know it.

92
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,200
I know.

93
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,999
They said he's chatting
with family in the morning,

94
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,959
but he has passed away when
someone called him to have the meal.

95
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:54,359
That's why he suddenly had to leave.

96
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,719
I got you a ticket for tomorrow at 2 PM.

97
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,479
There are no tickets left today.

98
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,959
Even if you get the first flight
back tomorrow,

99
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,359
it's only three hours earlier.

100
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,119
Even if you really do come back,
he will not have time for you.

101
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,040
Guo.

102
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,759
Focus on the competition.
Don't cry at the event,

103
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,839
or it will affect other's game.
I am here.

104
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,280
(Yiyang, what's wrong?)

105
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:55,208

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,239
Mr. He, are you looking for me?

108
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,520
Yiyang is always late these days.

109
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,440
He didn't say a word when I ask why.

110
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,959
Has something happened to his family?

111
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,400
I don't know.
He doesn't talk about his family.

112
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,119
But I know he has
a younger brother in kindergarten.

113
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,479
He didn't tell me himself.

114
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,560
Last time I saw him riding
his younger brother to kindergarten,

115
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,280
so I asked him.

116
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,440
He has a younger brother?

117
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,879
Whose parent is that?

118
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,160
He said to pick up Lin Yidong.

119
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,040
Doesn't he have the plastic tag
for picking up the kids?

120
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,320
No, if he had it, I wouldn't stop him.

122
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,239
Why are you here?

123
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,440
I wanted to help you pick up Yidong.

124
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,800
I didn't expect them
to be so responsible

125
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
that wouldn't let me pick him up.

126
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,560
It's good you're here.

127
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Come on, go find
your grandpa and brother.

128
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,520
Yidong.

129
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Are you hiding from grandpa
because you're scared of him?

130
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,879
Let's go, master.

131
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,879
Goodbye, thank you.

132
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:10,800
It's our job.

133
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,520
From now on, we will eat
hot pot on weekends.

134
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,680
Can I come?

135
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,040
Yes.

136
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,719
From now on, you'll eat at home
every day and your brother will train.

137
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:27,160
Once I've made the meal,
I'll deliver it to him at the club.

138
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,959
Your brother will be back
by the end of the week.

139
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:32,479
Thank you, master.

140
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,040
This is yours, Yidong.

141
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,479
Thank you.

142
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:43,479
Have some cakes.

143
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,239
Don't let him eat cakes first.

144
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:50,359
Right, he'll be full
after eating the cakes.

145
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,440
Come on, eat meat first.

146
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,920
Eat meat.

147
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,640
You'd stop too, have meat instead.

148
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:02,920
Okay.

149
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,079

152

He's been sent away.

153
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,839
To where?

154
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,839
One relative has no children,

155
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,400
and he wanted to take him in long ago.

156
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:30,560
He picked Xiaodong up
during this summer vacation.

157
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,320
What? Then he'll be
someone else's child forever.

158
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,119
I can't afford to support him on my own.

159
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,879
And they are right.

160
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,280
A child at this age needs parental love,
otherwise it's bad for his development.

take care of Yidong for you.

162

Can you take care of him for a lifetime?

Why not? I take care of you all.

You're such a rash child.

You don't even consult with
adults on such a big matter.

think you can handle everything?

No, I...

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,479
I'm not good at comforting,
I can only be by your side.

174
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,880
Did you drink?

Go ahead.

182
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,880
Grandma, did someone
important pass away?

183
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,319
Why are so many people from
Sports Bureau visiting his families?

184
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,519
A quite prestigious person.

185
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:44,039
Didn't Xiaodong mention him?
He's the founder of Dongxin City.

186
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,759
Mr. He? He Wenfeng?

187
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:57,840
Yiyang's master, oh my.

188
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,959
The doctor let you leave
just after surgery?

189
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,519
I have to come, no matter he let or not.

190
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,719
You should take some rest anyway.

191
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,319
Take good care of your mom.

192
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,559
We're leaving.

193
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,160
Yiyang is here.

194
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,120
Ms. Wu.

195
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:10,120
Today is the day
for your family to meet,

196
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,999
we won't stay long. My condolences.

197
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,080
Mrs. He.

198
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,999
Mrs. He.

199
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,840
I should've come back earlier.

200
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,440
Come on, let's go see your master.

201
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,200
Yiyang.

202
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,160
Senior.

203
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:38,160
Yiyang, Mr. He didn't blame you.

204
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,039
Alone? Where's Lin?

205
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,319
He had to return earlier.

206
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,999
Isn't your final tomorrow?

207
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,999
He left without watching your game?

208
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,440
He...

209
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,880
He has something important to deal with.

210
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:55,319
Same as usual?

211
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,080
Okay.

212
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:16,968
(Time is merciless)

213
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:48,920
Sit down.

214
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,719
I'll go sleep with my mom. You two...

215
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:00,600
I'm not leaving tonight.
I'll stay here with him.

216
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,400
Don't stay up too late.

217
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:24,759
Talk to me if you feel upset.

218
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,999
Pretend Mr. He is still here.

219
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,759
Tonight it's just the three of us.

220
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,080
I don't know what to say.

221
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,519
Then I'll do it.

222
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,239
The day before Mr. He died,
he came to see me in the hospital

223
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,600
and talked to me a lot

224
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,519
about my past, your past,

225
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,959
my future, your future,

226
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,279
and Dongxin City's future.

227
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,920
I told him what you thought.

228
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,799
He told me to tell you,

229
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,360
"Yiyang, just do it".

230
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:58,880
You were the first person I saw

231
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,039
at the club that year.

232
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,239
Back then, I looked at you and said,

233
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,880
"You look so arrogant,

234
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,719
are you here to play
or to cause trouble?"

235
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,239
Later, he asked me

236
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,640
what I thought of you.
Do you know what I said?

237
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,200
What?

238
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:35,279
I said being stubborn and reluctant
to admit defeat is your advantage.

239
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,479
A guy like you should be on the field.

240
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:54,319
Do you really think so?

241
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,759
Of course.

242
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,479
The day I left the club,

243
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,479
I felt I was abandoned.

244
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,680
I felt the same way on the flight back.

245
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,120
Mr. He has completely abandoned me.

246
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,999
Dongxin City has always
been a light in my heart,

247
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,039
but that light is gone forever.

248
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,239
Just do it.

249
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,160
But when I think of Mr. He, I feel like

250
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,519
I'm still a teenager.

251
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:24,799
I'm afraid I can't do it well.

252
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,360
Fifth.

253
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,559
I'm afraid of letting you down.

254
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:00,640
What happened to Mr. He
is too sudden, right?

255
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,160
Yes.

256
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:04,999
Coach.

257
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:06,920
Are you feeling okay?

258
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,472
Yes.

259
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,080
We all knew about
what happened to Mr. He last night.

260
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,840
Go straight to the airport later?

261
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,160
I'll head back first.

262
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:28,719
Go ahead. I thought
we could stay a few more days,

263
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:33,440
but you should return.

264
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,640
Have you booked the cab?

265
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,680
Yes, don't worry. I'll go change first.

266
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,216
Go ahead.

267
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:53,080
Wait a moment.

268
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,160
Didn't you sleep well?

269
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:04,719
I fell asleep at first,

270
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,799
later my mind was racing
with many things,

271
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:11,160
then I couldn't fall back asleep.

272
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,319
So did I.

273
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:21,279
To us from Dongxin City, Mr. He

274
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,360
is a teacher, and more like a parent.

275
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:30,680
Last night, I talked with a senior

276
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,080
about the difficulties
in the Dongxin City.

277
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,640
I'm okay.

278
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:46,519
The Women Nine-Ball final
will start first.

279
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,319
Let's welcome our players
entering the course.

280
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:52,319
Please.

281
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:52,936
Okay.

282
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,024
Let's go.

283
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:10,759
I believe everybody
is familiar with these two players.

284
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:14,120
They both have extraordinary moments
in this previous arena.

285
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,480
One of them, Yin Guo, is called
the dark horse in recent years.

286
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,239
Another is a veteran who is back
from her retirement, Liu Xiran.

287
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,200
Now, they are ready to play.

288
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:41,359
Ladies and gentlemen, the final
of Women's Nine-Ball is about to start.

289
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:52,399
Get ready.

290
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,200
Get set, three, two, one, go.

291
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,719
Yin Guo to break.

292
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,239
Yin Guo to break.

293
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,399
It's so close. What a pity.

294
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,799
(A single mistake would probably
lead to the failure of one round.)

295
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:34,919
(That is what happens in the game
between two professionals.)

296
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,520
(What a match!)

297
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,040
(You can never know
who'd win till the last minute.)

298
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,000
(Liu Xiran made a mistake.)

299
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,960
(If Yin Guo can seize the chance
and keep her cool,)

300
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,680
(then that's high likely
that she'll be the champion.)

301
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,799
(As we mentioned in the previous games,)

302
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:14,680
(Yin Guo is well known for her
spectacular ability on emotional control.)

303
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,319
(The advantage could be more obvious)

304
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:19,520
(when she is facing a greater pressure.)

305
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,040
(This could be the last shot
that decides who would be the champion)

306
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,480
(of Women Nine-Ball.)

307
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,839
(I think I'm now even
more nervous than the players.)

308
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:55,560
Nice.

309
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,000
Congratulations!

310
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,160
Thank you.

311
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:03,839
Ladies and gentlemen,

312
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,919
the champion of this year's
Women Nine-Ball Open,

313
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:10,879
Yin Guo from China.

314
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,640
Congratulation to Yin Guo.

315
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,919
(I'll pick you up
for the memorial service when you land.)

316
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,439
(Jiang Yang took a big hit this time.)

317
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:55,239
(Moreover, Lin Yiyang
took over Dongxin City today.)

318
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,452
(Dongxin City Billiards Club)

319
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:11,319
Do you still remember?

320
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,640
That old restaurant is now our canteen.

321
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:23,839
The hair salon here has
also been expanded into our dorm.

322
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,439
And two new billiard rooms
in that building.

323
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:39,680
You've spent all your youth here.

324
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,640
Yes, ever since Mr. He retired,

325
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:50,359
I don't dare to slack off
for even a moment.

326
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:59,399
I don't want others to say the one
Mr. He chose can't run it well.

327
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:07,960
Let's go in.

328
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:25,512
(Obituary. Mr. He passed away and the memorial
service will be held at 10:30 AM on 29th.)
