25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,160
(He came here
even without any dirty clothes?)

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
Jiang Yang said

27
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,879
he met you before.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,719
Yeah.

29
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,079
When he took part in contests
with my brother back in China,

30
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,320
we met twice.

31
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,864
How has your brother been

32
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,400
these years?

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,239
Pretty good.

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,279
My brother thought
the club's location wasn't good.

35
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,440
So he opened a new club.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
My uncle retired

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,160
and invested in his club.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,279
My brother is in charge.

39
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,200
Let me tell you.

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,800
It's such a bother doing laundry here.

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,120
Clothes should be air-dried.

42
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,679
The wool sweater I washed yesterday

43
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,520
came out all fuzzy from the dryer.

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,999
Alright, I'm waiting for my clothes.

45
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,680
I'll call you back later.

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,096
Okay.

47
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:47,320
(It takes an hour just to wash and dry.)

48
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,159
(Are we going)

49
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,079
(to be sitting here doing nothing?)

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,719
(Why are you so quiet?)

51
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,880
(So are you.)

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,848
(I'm listening to you.)

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,519
(I'm done talking.)

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,799
(I don't know what you want to know.)

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,639
(Anything.)

56
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,720
(Just small talk.)

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
(You're making it so serious.)

58
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,000
(It's making me nervous.)

59
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,799
(I give up.)

60
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,519
(Can we talk now?)

61
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,839
(We've been playing dumb up until now.)

62
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,440
(Maybe it's better to keep doing it.)

63
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,359
(Let's go upstairs?)

64
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,192
(We still have an hour to wait.)

65
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,080
(There's nothing to do here.)

66
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,679
(Others are upstairs.)

67
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,720
(Not a good place.)

68
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,799
(You're not talking here, either.)

69
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,399
(Isn't it the same?)

70
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,839
(Can I ask you something?)

71
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,440
(Go ahead.)

72
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,440
(What is it?)

73
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,959
(Why so secretive?)

74
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,399
(Do you have a boyfriend?)

75
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,360
(Or)

76
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,200
(do you know)

77
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,079
(I want to pursue you?)

78
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,639
Bad signal?

79
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,120
Bad signal here.

80
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
I'm going out to get some air.

81
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,560
Young girl,

82
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,279
you two were so quiet just now.

83
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,208
I thought you two were not Chinese.

84
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,440
Are you two quarreling?

85
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,479
I was having an embarrassing time.

86
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
I wanted to break the ice by humming.

87
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,560
(Was he kidding?)

88
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,944
(But no one jokes like that.)

89
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,112
(Awkwardly,)

90
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,352
(it was face-to-face.)

91
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Hey,

92
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,399
take a step back.

93
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,599
Have a conversation with him.

94
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,088
We aren't...

95
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,159
I understand.

96
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,000
A quarrel is inevitable

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,719
- between young lovers,
- No, I...

98
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,760
especially for people like you

99
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,120
being in a foreign country.

100
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,680
All parents are very protective
towards their children.

101
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:36,424
But, a word of advice.

102
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,680
If you truly like each other,

103
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,880
you must learn to understand each other.

104
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:45,800
No, you're taking this wrong. I...

105
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,880
I understand.

106
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:50,560
-I'm leaving.
-You...

107
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,279
What do you understand?

108
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,760
Be good.

109
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,479
Thanks.

110
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:01,532
Ask An'an to bring a coat down.

111
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:39,171
You're even more bored than I am.

112
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:43,652
It's been over a decade.

113
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:46,652
You have nothing to say?

114
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,532
You called me here

115
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,091
because you didn't want me
to hear them joke about you.

116
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,171
Even though I don't say anything,

117
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,132
I am aware of that.

118
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:07,412
You're sensible now.

119
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,652
And you've grown taller.

120
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:17,772
Almost taller than me.

121
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:22,331
Why didn't you contact us?

122
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:27,892
We took different paths.

123
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,292
I don't know what to say.

124
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:33,772
It'd be embarrassing.

125
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:47,372
Stop it. Look at you.

126
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,252
If others see us like this,

127
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:52,171
can I find a girlfriend?

128
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:53,652
Come on.

129
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:58,252
An'an.

130
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:00,691
How do you win people over

131
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:02,171
in Dongxin City?

132
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:03,464
I'm not Jiang Yang.

133
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:04,971
I don't need to do that.

134
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,292
That's not true.

135
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,451
Jiang Yang is the top seed
in Dongxin City.

136
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:11,412
As his backup,

137
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,292
you need to hold the fort.

138
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:19,012
A word of advice. For the kids upstairs,

139
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,051
you must be responsible.

140
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:22,331
I know.

141
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,492
I am coaching more students
than you ever did.

142
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:39,412
What about her?

143
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:41,252
Who?

144
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:43,331
Meng Xiaodong's sister.

145
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:46,691
Her name is Yin Guo.

146
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,091
She's doing laundry.

147
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:56,331
Will her brother stop you two
from seeing each other?

148
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:04,211
Maybe you could be
in a secret relationship

149
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:05,532
without letting him know.

150
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:06,892
What do you mean?

151
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:08,532
We haven't started dating.

152
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:10,691
I've seen how she looks at you.

153
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,652
Just a matter of time.

154
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:18,931
You are really sensible now.

155
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:30,571
Bye, we're leaving.

156
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,051
Goodbye.

157
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:33,571
Bye.

158
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:34,252
Bye.

159
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:35,211
Goodbye, Mrs. Lin.

160
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:36,532
Naughty.

161
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:40,492
Sorry to disturb you.

162
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:43,612
Not at all. Feel free to come.

163
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,571
Lin Yiyang is upstairs.
I'll see them out.

164
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:48,451
Let's go.

165
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:51,091
- Bye.
- Bye.

166
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:51,912
Bye.

167
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,652
Feel free to come? What am I saying?

168
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:23,652
When you left last week,

169
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,732
I promised I would treat you to a meal.

170
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:27,132
Are you free?

171
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,252
It's okay if you're not.
I'm just asking.

172
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:36,292
Next week also works. No problem.

173
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,532
(It's just a meal. Why did I panic?)

174
00:15:58,571 --> 00:15:59,292
No need to open.

175
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:02,331
Let's set up a date.

176
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:10,892
10:00 AM tomorrow.

177
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:12,931
Is that okay?

178
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,171
Or 10:30 AM?

179
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:18,772
10:00 AM.

180
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:22,171
See you tomorrow.

181
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:27,971
See you tomorrow.

182
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,892
What were you doing?
An aftertaste by the door?

183
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,331
You're making quick progress.

184
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,851
You started dating in the laundry room
not long ago, didn't you?

185
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:14,931
Shut up.

186
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,892
I should have gone down
to deliver the coat just now.

187
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:21,492
Chen An'an

188
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,571
is so bored.

189
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:25,051
He didn't pass any information.

190
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:28,132
Instead of him,
I should peek at your date.

191
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,571
If you keep blabbering,
you'll sleep on the couch tonight.

192
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,012
I have an appointment.

193
00:17:39,612 --> 00:17:41,612
Going out at this hour. Is it safe?

194
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:42,811
It's fine.

195
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:00,532
Zheng Yi, help!

196
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:02,851
Well,

197
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:04,892
well,

198
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:09,160
when someone confessed
their feelings to you,

199
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:10,652
what would you say?

200
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:14,732
Lin Yiyang?

201
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:17,091
Can you keep it down?

202
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,571
You have the opposite personality to me.

203
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:23,688
Maybe you can help me clear my head.

204
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:25,811
Tell me about it.

205
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:27,331
What did he say to you?

206
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:28,892
How did he confess to you?

207
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:35,931
"Do you know I want to pursue you?"

208
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:40,252
That doesn't sound very serious.

209
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,171
Really?

210
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:46,132
Well, hypothetically, he was serious.

211
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:47,091
What would you say?

212
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:52,051
Well, it depends on the situation.

213
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:55,532
If I like him,

214
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,051
I will say something like this.

215
00:18:59,211 --> 00:18:59,892
"Really?"

216
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:02,888
"How come I didn't know?"

217
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:06,091
Maybe you should make it more obvious.

218
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:08,932
If I don't like him,

219
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:12,212
I will just ignore him.

220
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,331
I'd let him off the hook

221
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:15,611
and let it go.

222
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:17,932
I won't take it seriously.

223
00:19:18,972 --> 00:19:21,252
Tell me right now.

224
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:22,772
How did he confess to you?

225
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:27,331
Well,

226
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,972
bad signal. I can't hear you.

227
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:30,932
I gotta go.

You are like my mom.

254
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,611
She used to wait for me
in the living room.

255
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:50,972
If I don't return, she won't sleep.

256
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,371
It's midnight.

257
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:58,091
Aren't you afraid of cavities?

258
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,932
You were waiting for her. Was she moved?

259
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:12,651
Aren't you going to sleep?

260
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:15,371
(What am I supposed to do?)

261
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:38,772
(Do you have a boyfriend?)

262
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,012
(Or,)

263
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:41,692
(do you know)

264
00:24:42,492 --> 00:24:43,371
(I want to pursue you?)

265
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:12,611
I got up early because I had a plan.

266
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,811
Why don't you sleep a bit longer?

267
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:17,131
I have an appointment
for a meal at 10:00 AM.

268
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:20,131
Buddy,

269
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,091
have you misread the time?

270
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:23,492
It's so early now.

271
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:28,732
I haven't slept much this week.
I'm too tired.

272
00:25:29,172 --> 00:25:30,692
So I'm afraid I will oversleep.

273
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,611
Taking a shower can sober me up.

274
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:38,411
Is it an interview?

275
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,051
Are you nervous?

276
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:44,932
Relax. No need to be scared of this.

277
00:25:46,252 --> 00:25:48,732
If you really pass it,

278
00:25:49,212 --> 00:25:50,571
will you have to work here

279
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:51,651
for at least five years?

280
00:25:56,891 --> 00:25:57,811
I'm leaving.

281
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:07,611
You want to use the bathroom?

282
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:12,611
Have you finished?

283
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:22,972
How about

284
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:25,452
I tidy it up first,
and then you wash up?

285
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:27,811
No need. I'm not taking a shower.

286
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:29,932
I did it last night.

287
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:52,772
(He uses a razor blade.)

288
00:27:53,411 --> 00:27:54,411
(It's not electric.)

289
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:00,012
(If his hand shakes,)

290
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:01,772
(won't it scratch him?)

291
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:53,571
Breakfast together?

292
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:56,932
Sure.

293
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:02,172
Thank you.

294
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:12,611
Ham.

295
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:17,732
Thank you.

296
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,091
(Amazing.)

297
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:29,452
Thank you.

298
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,411
I asked my bestie.

299
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:50,932
She recommended the lobster pasta here.

300
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:10,611
Seems like

301
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,371
we had two meals together today.

302
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:16,172
Yeah, right.

303
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:22,252
(Looks like I'm pursuing you.)

304
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:23,411
(He's so quiet.)

305
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:26,732
After lunch,

306
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:28,811
I'll head to the station.

307
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:31,172
Are you leaving today?

308
00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:33,532
Yes, I have an appointment
with a professor tonight.

309
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,932
Let's finish this quickly and not talk.

310
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:38,212
It's okay, no rush.

311
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:40,492
There's still enough time to eat.

312
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:42,331
Take your time.

313
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:44,131
No need to hurry.

314
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:57,811
(Not talking again.)

315
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:15,772
What's up?

316
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:21,851
We've got a new coach.

317
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:23,772
He's from Dongxin City.

318
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:25,292
His surname is Xu.

319
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,611
He said he knows you.

320
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:34,452
Did he talk to you about me?

321
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:38,292
So,

322
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:40,452
what do you want to ask?

323
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:45,371
Back then,

324
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,651
why did you retire?

325
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:51,411
Didn't he tell you why?

326
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:55,811
No, we didn't talk much.

327
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,172
I'm just curious.

328
00:31:58,411 --> 00:31:59,651
When you left Dongxin City,

329
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:01,371
why not switch to another club?

330
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:03,972
I found out you had such good results.

331
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:05,692
It's a pity to give up.

332
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:12,891
At the time,

333
00:32:16,008 --> 00:32:17,331
I just suddenly wanted to study.

334
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:22,012
I knew two friends when I was a child.

335
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:22,811
Female athletes.

336
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,331
They also decided to study
and then retired.

337
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:27,692
Actually, I think that's good.

338
00:32:57,371 --> 00:32:59,692
Excuse me,
could you take a photo for us?

339
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:01,051
Sure, of course.

340
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,532
Thank you.

341
00:33:09,692 --> 00:33:10,411
Thank you.

342
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:12,932
Do you like me to take a picture of you?

343
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:17,851
Yeah, sure.

344
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:30,732
Be closer.

345
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:38,692
Okay.

346
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:41,012
Thank you.

347
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,012
Thank you.

348
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:44,091
Let me see.

349
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:49,736
I'll send it to you.

350
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:58,972
I'm going to the station by that tram.

351
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,120
Okay.

00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:03,252
