25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,999
I'm leaving. Take care.

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,000
Be safe.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,239
Okay, don't worry.

28
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,679
It's okay if they don't want to.

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
Tomorrow, take that boy around

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,319
and introduce our school.

31
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,559
He is interested in our school.

32
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:47,919
Yin Guo.

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,279
You got up early.

34
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,679
Guess why.

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,200
Your mom called you?

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,336
No.

37
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,760
This morning, Lin's classmate called me.

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,799
He insisted on taking me
around his school.

39
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,079
I refused many times but failed.

40
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,880
Then I went there.

41
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,999
Lin Yiyang's classmate?

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,960
You even troubled his classmate.

43
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:15,559
- I...
- Did you thank him?

44
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,079
Of course, I did.

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,320
I treated him to lunch.

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
This is for you.

47
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,040
I must say

48
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
he is good to you.

49
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,079
Don't forget his help.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,960
I won't.

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,919
You eat first.

52
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,600
I'll go back and pack up.

53
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,359
I'll be back.

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,919
- Okay.
- I'm off.

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,024
(Thank you for taking my brother
to visit the school.)

56
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:10,720
(No problem.)

57
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,160
(Coffee?)

58
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,839
(What does he mean?)

59
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:32,840
(One week later)

60
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,939
(Hel)

61
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,720
Yin Guo.

62
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,760
You've been training for a week.

63
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,639
We barely met.

64
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,959
I feel lonely.

65
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,239
You're heartless.

66
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,639
If you bother me again,

67
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,000
I will tell our brother.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,560
Don't.

69
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,560
I'll tell him you disturb my training

70
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,440
and bother me.

71
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,480
I'm trying to be cute.

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
A cute boy.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,160
Come on, you don't have to.

74
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,720
I planned to accompany you
this afternoon anyway.

75
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:12,720
Really?

76
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:13,560
Yes.

77
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
But only this afternoon.

78
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
I will meet Su Wei tonight.

79
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,519
It's okay.

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,119
Perfect.

81
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:21,679
This place?

82
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,639
Why does it look a bit familiar?

83
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,399
Is it near the Red Fish Bar?

84
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,424
Red Fish Bar?

85
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,496
It's where we avoided the blizzard
on the first day.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,440
The bar where we met Lin Yiyang.

87
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,320
Yes, it's nearby.

88
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,440
Do you like that place?

89
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,239
Yes.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,359
There are so many fun things there.

91
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,040
Who doesn't love it?

92
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,160
It's a deal.

93
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,440
Let's go there.

94
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,320
Deal.

95
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,560
Alright. It's up to you.

96
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,399
I'll go get my bag.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,320
You change clothes.

98
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,280
We go immediately.

99
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,719
Yin Guo, here we are.

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,279
It's crowded.

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,959
No available seats, I guess.

102
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,719
Lin has made a reservation.

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,279
Lin?

104
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,880
Lin Yiyang?

105
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,159
Yes, he told me not to tell you.

106
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,399
If he can make it,

107
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:37,320
he will meet us.

108
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,120
If he can't,

109
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,800
just the two of us will have fun.

110
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:41,760
Let's go.

111
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,599
Lin.

112
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,360
It's so cold.

113
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,599
What do you want to eat?

114
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,839
What do you recommend?

115
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,959
We are not familiar with this place.

116
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,079
Excuse me.

117
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,839
Can we have two Paninis,

118
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,880
two Tiramisu,

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,120
and an Americano, please?

120
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
Thank you.

121
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,120
Lin.

122
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,639
By my calculations,

123
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,639
your round trip from Helsin

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,159
will take about seven hours.

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,039
Did you come here for something?

126
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,200
I came here

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,240
for a friend.

128
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
To handle a little issue.

129
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,680
Lin.

130
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,159
So how often do you come here
when you're not busy?

131
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,320
Two or three months.

132
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,719
This place looks quite special.

133
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,120
It must be old, right?

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,760
It was built in the early 20th century.

135
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,279
It's over a hundred years old.

136
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,800
It used to be a gathering place
for artists and writers.

137
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,800
It's yours.

138
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,000
Thank you.

139
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,120
And yours.

140
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,819
Thank you.

141
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,639
And yours.

142
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,599
You haven't had lunch?

143
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,440
I came straight here.

144
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,639
We have a date.

145
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,680
Can't be late.

146
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,680
The tiramisu is quite good.

147
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,320
Lin.

148
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,120
Are there any interesting places?

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,079
There's a hot pot restaurant
in the city center.

150
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,399
You can have a try.

151
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,240
Let's try next time.

152
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,560
Lin, what is that place
across the street?

153
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,120
The municipal center.

154
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,159
Guo.

155
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,959
There's a small coffee shop

156
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,599
nearby Angel Cafe.

157
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
You buy me two bags of coffee beans.

158
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
It's just a bit hard to find the shop.

159
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,560
But you can ask someone.

160
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a famous supplier.

161
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,120
I have a friend.

162
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,240
She says there's a shop
that sells coffee beans.

163
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,760
It's a famous supplier.

164
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,399
The origin of the coffee is on the sign.

165
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,839
It just isn't easy to find the shop.

166
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,399
Do you know that shop?

167
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,120
Let me take you there.

168
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,360
Don't bother.

169
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,599
Just tell me the shop's name.

170
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,039
On my way.

171
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,279
We're short on time.

172
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
We need to go soon.

173
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,160
I'm ready.

174
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,239
Me too.

175
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,280
Let's go.

176
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:18,640
This way.

177
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
(They suddenly become so familiar.)

178
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,879
(I feel like I'm the third wheel.)

179
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,040
Red Fish Bar.

180
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,239
Want to go in?

181
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,479
No, maybe another day.

182
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,999
Aren't you in a hurry to leave?

183
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,879
Alright.

184
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,040
Yin Guo, see?

185
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,479
Wait for me.

186
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:05,400
We're here.

187
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,440
I'm going over there to take a look.

188
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,200
Don't get lost.

189
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:09,999
Got it.

190
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,359
Thank you.

191
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,780
Try it.

192
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,479
It's raspberry-flavored.

193
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,320
What's wrong?

194
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm a bit embarrassed.

195
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,560
Feels like I'm taking advantage.

196
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,440
What do you want to buy?

197
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,079
My friend sent me this.

198
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,239
Excuse me.

199
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,479
Could I have half a pound
of each kind of these, please?

200
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,160
Thank you.

201
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,680
Thank you.

202
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,160
If you're in a hurry,

203
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,239
you can go.

204
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,759
Okay.

205
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:06,879
Let's meet up another time.

206
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:25,660
Yin Guo.

207
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:27,959
Where's Lin?

208
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,359
He has something else to do.

209
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,160
So he left.

210
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:32,599
What did you buy?

211
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,339
Coasters.

212
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,160
They look nice.

213
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,959
What beans did you get?

214
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,479
They're for Zheng Yi.

215
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,520
OK. You can come.

216
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,079
Sorry.

217
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,999
Could you take this back for me?

218
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,359
I'm going straight to find Su Wei.

219
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,119
Alright.

220
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,680
I need to buy something for a classmate.

221
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,999
There's a limited-edition sneaker shop.

222
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:26,959
Okay.

223
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,280
Keep an eye on your phone

224
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,160
and wallet.

225
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,900
Okay.

226
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,839
I have to go.

227
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,440
If you come back late, I'll pick you up.

228
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:45,420
Okay.

229
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:56,920
Have a seat.

230
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,759
Berry is an old friend of mine.

231
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,839
It's an opportunity
to introduce him to you.

232
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:04,759
Thank you.

233
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,479
Hello, your spicy chicken.

234
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,959
Thank you.

235
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:07,440
Alright.

236
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:07,999
Please.

237
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,520
This is Yin Guo.

238
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,800
She beat me in the Youth Competition.

239
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,839
I've heard you a lot from Su Wei.

240
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,200
I finally met you today.

241
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:18,479
Let's eat.

242
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:19,879
Let's eat and talk.

243
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,800
Go ahead.

244
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,400
Thank you.

245
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,400
Delicious.

246
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,879
Which dish is the most delicious?

247
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,359
I haven't tried them all yet.

248
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,440
I'll vote for the beef.

249
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,339
Alright.

250
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,560
Can't you eat spicy food?

251
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,479
Well, I just crave spicy.

252
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,759
But I can't handle spicy food.

253
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,119
Your boyfriend's restaurant

254
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,719
has a good cook.

255
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,239
Then I'll ask them

256
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,160
to make you fried rice.

257
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,479
Don't bother. I have enough food.

258
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,759
I'll eat later.

259
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,839
I'm just worried about getting heaty.

260
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,999
Okay, drink some water.

261
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:10,959
I have no idea.

262
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
Are there many Chinese restaurants
in Hel?

263
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,520
Not many.

264
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,479
But if you want to eat Chinese food,

265
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,479
you can find something.

266
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,400
That's pretty good.

267
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,440
There's a Chinese billiard room.

268
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,680
The owner used to be a snooker player.

269
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,079
He retired and settled here.

270
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,400
He opened this billiard room.

271
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,079
There are many veteran players.

272
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,640
Chinese professional players
frequently go there.

273
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,640
The owner used to play snooker?

274
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,959
My brother plays snooker.

275
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,239
Perhaps he knows this person.

276
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:42,079
What's your brother's name?

277
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:44,999
My brother...

278
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
He is Meng Xiaodong.

279
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,280
What?

280
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,080
How come you never told me?

281
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,599
I didn't mean to.

282
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,640
Every time you complimented him,

283
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,279
I got goosebumps all over.

284
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,360
I really didn't know how to tell you.

285
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,279
Come on.

286
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,239
You should tell me.

287
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:06,559
Sorry.

288
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,400
I didn't expect you
to be Meng Xiaodong's sister.

289
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,160
- Yeah.
- I'm surprised.

290
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,239
So back to the billiard room,

291
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,479
there is a gathering every Saturday.

292
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,239
Professional players will come.

293
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,799
Today is Saturday.

294
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,559
I'll take you over for a look

295
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,959
and introduce my friends to you.

296
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:24,880
You interested?

297
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,680
Let's go.

298
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,239
Didn't you finish your recent training?

299
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,319
Don't be so tense.

300
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:39,400
Okay.

301
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,559
I'll go with you.

302
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:42,719
Let's eat.

303
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,519
We'll go later.

304
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,319
Take your time. It's nearby.

305
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,600
Help yourself.

306
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,640
I will eat later.

307
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,400
My stomach's feeling a bit upset.

308
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:53,640
I am not hungry.

309
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
Is this number 24?

310
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:04,239
Yeah.

311
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,840
I'm here for Mark.

312
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,680
Come in. They are waiting
for you for a long time.

313
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:12,959
Come on, guys.

314
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,464
Hurry. The game is about to start.

315
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,600
Who's in there?

316
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,880
Come in, and you will see.

317
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,579
Okay.

318
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,600
Let's go.

319
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,120
Who's playing?

320
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,992
Our regional champion.

321
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:50,880
(It's him.)

322
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,600
Guo, come on.

323
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,799
I'm here for my friend.

324
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,200
The game he owed

325
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,000
should be settled up after this round.

326
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,400
(It's really him.)

327
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,479
(Thinking back to this night later,)

328
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,680
(I always thought)

329
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,239
(this was the moment)

330
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,799
(when I got to know Lin Yiyang.)

331
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,239
(Here,)

332
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,479
(the guy in this Chinese billiard room)

333
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,400
(is the real him.)

334
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,319
(He's indolent,)

335
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,360
(talented,)

336
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,239
(and unrestricted by rules.)

337
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,479
(He doesn't care about results,)

338
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:31,160
(winning or losing)

339
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,360
(in front of the opponent.)

340
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,160
(A Chinese man.)

341
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,880
He is a billiards enthusiast.

342
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,279
The person he's challenging

343
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,719
is the best player in the billiard room.

344
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,239
Better than you?

345
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,392
Much stronger.

346
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,479
He's a regional champion.

347
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,559
He's never lost in this billiard room.

348
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,600
This place is definitely his lucky spot.

349
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Show me what you got.

350
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,279
Pretty boy.

351
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
You're gonna cry to lose today.

352
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:02,640
Who do you think will get the break?

353
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:04,759
The orange ball.

354
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Who's the referee today?

355
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,279
I'll do it.

356
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:01,080
Nice fast shot!

357
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,799
Clearance.

358
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
Beautiful!

359
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,479
Okay, guys.

360
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,519
Who do you think is gonna win?

361
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,519
Who do you think is gonna lose?

362
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,440
You do not want to miss out, guys.

363
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,680
So what do you think?

364
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,519
The game is over.

365
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:40,479
Our new friend

366
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,080
won the regional champion.

367
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,360
Congrats, man.

368
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,200
My pleasure.

369
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,400
Are you gonna play
in this year's Nine-Ball Open or not?

370
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,640
No, I'm just an amateur.

371
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,039
Yeah, right.

372
00:24:57,781 --> 00:24:58,452
Hi.

373
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:02,356
Hi.

374
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:04,959
You know each other?

375
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,319
You know each other?

376
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,680
Yeah, we just knew each other.

377
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,959
Is she your friend?

378
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,519
Well,

379
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,719
I do hope so.

380
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,999
Of course.

381
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,840
We are friends.

382
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Okay, guys.

383
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,039
Let's head off and let these friends catch up.

384
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,279
Guo, let's go over there.

385
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,880
My bag.

386
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,680
That's so cool.

387
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,759
Let's play.

388
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,880
You go first.

389
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:07,880
This is my friend's number.

390
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,600
He said if you lost,

391
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,959
buy him a shot.

392
00:26:12,296 --> 00:26:12,920
What's your name?

393
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,899
Lin.

394
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,200
All the drinks
on Lin's tab today, alright?

395
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,239
You don't worry at all. I'll pay.

396
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,640
Thanks, man.

397
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,999
See you next time.

398
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,999
Get them two cocktails, please.

399
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,619
Yeah sure.

400
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,080
Thank you.

401
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,120
Adjust to number one.

402
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:46,719
Hello.

403
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,160
It's ordered for you by today's winner.

404
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:50,319
- I don't...
- I won today.

405
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:51,719
All drinks on me.

406
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,360
Non-alcoholic.

407
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,680
Thank you.

408
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:00,999
Which one?

409
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:01,799
This one.

410
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,360
Thanks. Nice play.

411
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,339
Su Wei.

412
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,080
Coming.

413
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:18,479
I'll go over.

414
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:33,799
What?

415
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,559
Don't you think
you're being a third wheel?

416
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,880
Why did you come?

417
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,959
I had dinner nearby with friends.

418
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,039
I heard many contestants

419
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,759
would come over tonight.

420
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,200
I wanted to take a look.

421
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,959
I've signed up for the Nine-Ball Open.

422
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,080
For professionals?

423
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
So, should I go in or not?

424
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,559
She came with me.

425
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,519
Tell her you have to leave.

426
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,479
Is it okay?

427
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,840
What if Guo is not interested in him?

428
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,519
I'm 30. Trust me.

429
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,400
You are the third wheel.

430
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,360
Did you come here with friends?

431
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,799
Yes.

432
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,039
It's that girl.

433
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:50,719
You live together?

434
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,200
No, we're not at the same hotel.

435
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:55,479
It's not far away.

436
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:58,840
Well,

437
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,880
will you go back with her later?

438
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,880
My friend.

439
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,080
She...

440
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,339
Guo.

441
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,600
I have to leave first.

442
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,039
I'll hail a car for you.

443
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,959
No, I can do it myself.

444
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,840
I'll call you tomorrow.

445
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:34,600
She has something else to do
and has to go.

446
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,160
I'll take you back.

447
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,440
You're taking me back?

448
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,200
Is it on your way?

449
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,959
I can go back late.

450
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,160
But you can't.

451
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,440
Are you worried?

452
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,559
No, I'm not.

453
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,200
I just don't want to trouble you.

454
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,360
- I don't want to.
- Not at all.

455
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,759
As long as you are fine with it.

456
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:33,360
Let's go.

457
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,680
Is it beautiful?

458
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,319
It's completely different
from the other day.

459
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,080
I'll get a cab.

460
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,559
Are you still used to taking cabs?

461
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:13,840
Why not take the subway?

462
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,039
I'd like to.

463
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,880
After all, taking a cab is expensive.

464
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,600
But I often missed the stop.

465
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:23,999
How could you?

466
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,479
I don't understand the announcements.

467
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,200
And there are no electronic displays.

468
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,440
If I'm not careful, I'll miss my stop.

469
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:37,479
Put it on.

470
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,959
We'll walk through three blocks.

471
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:42,360
It takes 15 minutes
to get to the subway station.

472
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:45,759
Follow me.

473
00:31:46,312 --> 00:31:47,144
You won't get lost.

(We're so quiet.)

(It's too awkward.)

483
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,999
(I must break the ice.)

484
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,120
So you like to go there to play pool.

485
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,719
It's my first time going there.

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,759
My classmate lost a game last month.

489
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,319
He asked me to win back the game.

490
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,440
He has been pleading with me.

I think

494
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,440
he must be your good friend.

495
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,920
You came all the way to help him.

496
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:41,840
Not really.

497
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,600
Well,

498
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,640
I wanted to treat someone to a meal.

499
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,959
But I had no time or money.

500
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,120

There are few people at this time.

514
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,440
This line has fewer people.

515
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,400
We...

516
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,239
We haven't formally met yet.

517
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,600
So

518
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,352
how would you like to meet?

519
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,039
My name is Yin Guo.

520
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:00,999
And...

521
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,080
I know.

522
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,560
You told me that

523
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,272
in your first message.

524
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,040
Right.

525
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,560
(Okay, I forgot.)

526
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:17,799
My brother and I go to the same school.

527
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:18,919
We are both seniors.

528
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:20,480
I have no classes this semester.

529
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,600
Neither does my brother.

530
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:22,960
We came here

531
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,319
because he applied for a university.

532
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
So he wanted to come early
to get used to the life here.

533
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,000
He has never been here.

534
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,680
So his parents are a bit worried.

535
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,319
I've been here on a trip before.

536
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,879
And I've signed up
for the Nine-Ball Open.

537
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,239
So I came two months early with him.

538
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,120
You've seen all my valid documents.

539
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,640
Is there anything else you want to know?

540
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,600
Birthplace, date of birth, school,

541
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,640
and the home address, you know it all.

542
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,000
Apart from my major,

543
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,879
I can't think of anything else.

544
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,279
Well,

545
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:06,719
that day, I didn't mean

546
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:07,879
to see your privacy.

547
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,919
I didn't read carefully.

548
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,919
I just...

549
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,839
I only know you're 27 years old.

550
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:14,040
Six years older than me.

551
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:14,879
Right?

552
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,080
Yes.

553
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:30,200
I finished my bachelor's degree at home.

554
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,759
After that, I worked for two years
and felt it was meaningless.

555
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:34,439
So, I came here.

556
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,080
I'm studying communications here.

557
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:39,319
Part-time, three years.
I'll graduate this year.

558
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,399
Normally,

559
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:43,759
I'm mostly in Helsin.

560
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,839
Occasionally, I come to Hel.

561
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:53,960
Is there anything else

562
00:37:55,336 --> 00:37:56,200
that you want to know?

563
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:58,520
Just ask me.

564
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,520
That's all.

565
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,319
Nothing I want to know.

566
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,160
(So awkward.)

567
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,239
(Like a self-introduction
on a blind date.)

568
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
(I'm starving.)

569
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,680
(Any instant noodles?)

570
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,719
(If not,)

571
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:49,919
(go out and buy me a pizza)

572
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:51,640
(while it's still available.)

573
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:53,040
(It'll be closed when I get back.)

574
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,799
No signal?

575
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,919
Yes, no bars.

576
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,953
(I'm starving. Buy me a pizza.)

577
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,000
Is it because
I'm using a domestic number?

578
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
It's hard to get a connection?

579
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:35,919
Perhaps.

580
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,000
You can send it during the transfer

581
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,960
or after you get off.

582
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,040
Okay.

583
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,304
(Reserve a table for four
at the ramen shop.)

584
00:39:55,432 --> 00:39:56,040
(Be there soon.)

585
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,000
Now?

586
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:08,839
Are you hungry?

587
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:12,919
I'm fine.

588
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:15,359
Really?

589
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:17,560
Are you

590
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,480
going back for pizza?

591
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,520
I saw it just now.

592
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:35,399
Actually,

593
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:37,120
I didn't eat much for dinner.

594
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,839
And my hotel is remote.

595
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,680
At this late hour,

596
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,919
I can only buy pizza
at the gas station supermarket.

597
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,600
Or hot dogs.

598
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,080
But hot dogs are terrible.

599
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:50,839
Wu Wei.

600
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:52,839
The guy

601
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:54,600
with the glasses.

602
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,520
He asked me to eat ramen.

603
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,000
Will you go?

604
00:40:58,879 --> 00:40:59,759
Now?

605
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,680
Yes.

606
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,239
Isn't it too late?

607
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:10,200
Just walk there from the subway station.

608
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,120
It takes a few minutes.

609
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:15,799
We can finish the ramen

610
00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:17,680
and take the subway again.

611
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:19,319
Well,

612
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:21,239
I haven't had dinner either.

613
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,560
You haven't had dinner?

614
00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:25,600
Yeah.

615
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:28,359
I planned to eat after winning the game.

616
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:31,279
