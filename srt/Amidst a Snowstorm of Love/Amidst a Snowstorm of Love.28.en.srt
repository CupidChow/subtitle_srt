25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,039
I'll play snooker.

00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,320
Wu Wei, Fan Wencong,

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,480
keep an eye on Men's 8-Ball and 9-Ball.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,639
An'an, help them with that.

29
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,512
Okay.

30
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,760
Dongxin City does not have
women's snooker.

31
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:08,760
Lin Lin,

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,959
let's add one.

33
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,399
No problem.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,800
If this project is assigned to me,

35
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:14,640
I'll go.

36
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,680
Take a look yourself.

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,279
Just get ready for those

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,000
you're eligible.

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,408
Okay.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,919
- Xiran.
- You were looking for me?

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,559
You are no longer in Dongxin City,

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,559
but still, we'd prepare together.

43
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:33,959
You are included.

44
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,528
Thank you.

45
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,239
Xiran, you're being too formal.

46
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,728
We all grew up together.

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,879
We are each in charge of a project.

48
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,319
We must follow up

49
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:42,879
on this,

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,679
until the final list comes out.

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,840
In this indoor sports event,

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,239
we must be in our best condition.

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,760
Okay.

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,639
Can you do it?

55
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,159
Have you ever seen me say I can't?

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,120
Thanks, Tao.

57
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,919
Ice it a bit more.

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,192
Okay.

59
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,840
Actually, it's okay to
skip one or two events.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,919
Men's snooker is our strong point.

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,040
You're our safety net, no matter what.

62
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,519
But we might be weak on some events.

63
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,120
If someone is truly better than me,

64
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,439
I don't mind skipping a few events.

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,559
I don't care about
the individual medal count.

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,639
But the total medal count for our team

67
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,359
cannot be less than others.

68
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,519
Tell me if you need help.

69
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,079
I will.

70
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,680
The official list

71
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,768
is out.

72
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:07,368
(Pre-Game Mobilization Meeting
of China National Billiards Team)

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
I see many new faces.

74
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,919
For many of you present,

75
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,600
I am also a new face.

76
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,600
Simply put,

77
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:20,440
I am the current head coach
of the national billiards team,

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,960
Zhou Bin.

79
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:29,000
I hereby announce the list of players

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,839
qualified for the event.

81
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,839
I'll start with the girls.

82
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,799

and Zhang Danyang.

86
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,720
Go for it.

87

88
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,399

and Yao Qingzhu.

91
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,959
Come on, Guo.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,544
We'll fight together.

93
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,040
Go for it!

94
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480

Wen Xiao,

97
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,079
and Lv Haocheng.

98
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:02,880
Go for it!

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,519
Now for the boys.

100
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,839
Men's snooker singles,

101
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,399
Lin Yiyang,

102
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,480
Meng Xiaodong,

103
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,359
and Yang An.

104
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,639
Men's 9-Ball,

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,119
Lin Yiyang,

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,519
Wu Wei, and Chen An'an.

107
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,399
Men's 8-Ball,

108
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,720
Lin Yiyang,

109
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,079
Li Qingyan,

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,200
and Jiang Han.

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,919
Men's snooker team,

112
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,239
Lin Yiyang,

113
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,679
Meng Xiaodong,

114
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,839
and Jiang Yang.

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,160
It's been years

116
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,919
since our last participation

117
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,399
in the billiards events

118
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,720
of a convention

119
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,160
of comprehensive sports.

120
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,600
In the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games,

121
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,560
I was there.

122
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,040
I am very happy

123
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,160
that today

124
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,000
I can be

125
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,079
with all our billiards players

126
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,239
here

127
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,399
to train together.

128
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
Next, I will announce

129
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,119
the captain of this year's
national billiards team.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,679
Lin Yiyang.

131
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Hello, everyone.

132
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,864
I am the captain
of this year's national billiards team,

133
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,639
Lin Yiyang.

134
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
That's really concise.

135
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:30,760
But he participated

136
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,719
in all the men's events.

137
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,560
Everyone knows him.

138
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,039
The people on the official list

139
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,120
will have targeted training

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,599
based on their events.

141
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,680
And the others

142
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,560
will train

143
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,440
with the competitors

144
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,719
in three days.

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
Those who didn't get elected

146
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
can get prepared for the future.

147
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,599
In a while, we will share
some notes with all of you.

148
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,719
Take a look.

149
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,616
Alright.

150
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,680
That's all.

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Let's meet at the training ground.

152
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,079
The base will be bustling.

153
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,000
We have eight out of the top 20

154
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,320
in the women's world rankings.

155
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,479
It's even more exciting
than the world competition.

156
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,479
For this shot,

157
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,479
it's about the top spin.

158
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,000
Lighter.

159
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,624
Hello?

160
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,519
Okay.

161
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,528
Try it one more time.

162
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,240
Yiyang, cover for me for two minutes.

163
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,416
Just go.

164
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,000
An'an. Pay attention to
the angle of your arms.

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,519
Thank you.

166
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:58,560
Your elbows.

167
00:07:59,039 --> 00:07:59,599
Watch this.

168
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,560
Keep your arms vertical.

169
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,280
That way,
your stroke will be more stable.

170
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,399
Does your shoulder not feel well?

171
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,552
It's not like that.

172
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,768
I'm fine.

173
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,120
Have you eaten?

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,904
Yiyang,

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,800
give it to me.

176
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,384
Let's go to my office.

177
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,159
Okay.

178
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:45,768
I'll come back to check on you in a bit.

179
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,599
My mom has heard

180
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,880
that you secured all the spots
in the competition.

181
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,544
And she is especially happy.

182
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,200
I've already promised your mom.

183
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,416
I've definitely got to do it.

184
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,079
Captain Lin,

185
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,279
you've already become a person of renown

186
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,560
before getting
into the training camp yet.

187
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
I'm flattered,

188
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,079
the most popular

189
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,479
women's 9-ball top player.

190
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,360
Then,

191
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,120
how do you plan to reward me?

192
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,680
What reward do you want?

193
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,680
I'd like

194
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,440
to see something.

195
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,120
I'd like to see your competition files.

196
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
Just the ones from before,
when you competed.

197
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:50,320
I mean when you were young.

198
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,200
About this tall, I guess.

199
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,479
When I was little,
I was already this tall.

200
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,680
What?

201
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,519
Show me.

202
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,000
Show me. Please.

203
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,680
Show me.

204
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,064
If you can't find them, leave them.

205
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,000
I will find them.

206
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,639
Mr. He has organized everything here
in particularly good order.

207
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,920
Could it be

208
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:21,959
in another box?

209
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,120
I don't think so.

210
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,039
All of Mr. He's materials
are right here.

211
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,200
What are you doing?

212
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,248
Have you seen the training materials
from when Duncuo was young?

213
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,599
Before Mr. He left, he...

214
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,239
He came to look at them himself.

215
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,079
Where are they?

216
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:21,320
He couldn't handle this at that time.

217
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,160
I helped to open it.

218
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
He must have forgotten
to take it out back then.

219
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,032
Do you want to replace it?

220
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,079
This one is good.

221
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,160
You were really cute

222
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,879
when you were little.

223
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,079
Are you happy now?

224
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,040
Sit.

225
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,879
Just sit.

226
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,560
I asked you to sit.

227
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,759
Wait for me.

228
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,479
I will be going back tonight

229
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,800
to attend a meeting in Bei City.

230
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,280
We'll have to be at the base tomorrow

231
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,920
before we can meet.

232
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,920
To celebrate our entrance

233
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,079
to the training camp tomorrow,

234
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm going to give you

235
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,359
a good tidy-up today.

236
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,759
Tidy-up?

237
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,712
I haven't offended you, have I?

238
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
I'm giving you a good sorting.

239
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,320
I'm going to tidy up your face for you.

240
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:06,839
Can you do it?

241
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:08,999
Teach me, then.

242
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Is it like this?

243
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,520
I'm starting.

244
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,040
Does it hurt?

245
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,119
No, it doesn't.

246
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:29,864
Use some strength.

247
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:39,119
Congratulations
on defeating all your opponents

248
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,200
and securing
all the competition qualifications.

249
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,839
Don't move or talk.

250
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,839
Or I will cut you.

251
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,759
We'll be entering
the training camp tomorrow,

252
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,879
and you will be my captain.

253
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,800
Today, you should listen to me.

254
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,719
On the team,

255
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,320
I'll listen to you.

256
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:34,772
(Training Camp
of National Billiards Team)

257
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,640
Yin Guo has also arrived.

258
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:37,800
Let's get started.

259
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,040
Li Qingyan,
I'll practice with you today.

260
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,376
Okay.

261
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,200
I still can't hold the cue stick.

262
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,320
I will watch you play.

263
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,040
But the head coach gave me a task

264
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,839
to give you a qualitative leap

265
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,839
within 70 days.

266
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,160
In other words,

267
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,360
if there comes a day
when I really can't make it,

268
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,560
you will have to coordinate well
with Yiyang and Xiaodong.

269
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,280
Don't worry.

270
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,520
I'll treat it as an official match.

271
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,479
You're Meng Xiaodong's best disciple.

272
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,720
Relax.

273
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:05,640
Lin Lin.

274
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,664
You are with me.

275
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,400
Are you really letting my brother
play against Lin Lin?

276
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:16,879
Worry about yourself.

277
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,959
Meng Xiaodong taught you
how to play snooker.

278
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:32,920
You are not bad.

279
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,599
Let's just start.

280
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,599
If you practice with me,

281
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,280
won't it affect your own training?

282
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,600
Not at all.

283
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,608
I will spar separately
with your brother and Jiang Yang.

284
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,320
Don't worry.

285
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,479
Alright.

286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,239
It's up to you to manage.

287
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,568
You have four events.
Your pressure is greater than mine.

288
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,280
Miss,

289
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,239
look at me.

290
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,952
Let's start the game.

291
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,680
Am I playing

292
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,440
against a robot?

293
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,624
You...

294
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,119
You play quite well.

295
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,079
You're right.

296
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,200
It means I have a big problem.

297
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,079
No.

298
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,319
You've played
in women's snooker competitions.

299
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,600
You have a better foundation than Guo.

300
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,120
Compared to them,

301
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,160
you did play well.

302
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,799
Who asked you to praise me?

303
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,279
Can you give me

304
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:11,999
some useful advice?

305
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,559
I'm observing.

306
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,719
It's my habit.

307
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,888
I need to first identify your problems
and then provide solutions.

308
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,880
Is this the first time you've known me?

309
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,152
Am I the kind of person
who jokes about this matter?

310
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,920
It's not that I doubt it.

311
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,360
It's just

312
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,400
that you never say anything.

313
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,239
And I can't guess what you're thinking.

314
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,080
I always get anxious.

315
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,200
Don't.

316
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,120
I'll tell you.

317
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,584
Come on.

318
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,704
Please the crowd.

319
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,440
How many types can you play?

320
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:13,440
I...

321
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,959
I did the math.
It's probably around six types.

322
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,759
But it's not certain

323
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,519
that all of them
will successfully pocket.

324
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,120
It demands too much precision.

325
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,039
Alright. That's about it.

326
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,680
There's a welcome banquet later.

327
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,999
Go back and have a rest. Take a bath.

328
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:01,880
And don't be late.

329
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,536
Let's go.

330
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,472
I have something to show you.

331
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:34,661

Tell me.

341
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,880
Who else have you shown this to?

342
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,344
No one else has seen it.

343
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,400
I practiced it for you.

350
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,120
Yiyang, the head coach wants to see you.

351
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
What's going on with you two?

352
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:45,160
It's like puppy love,
with all the secrecy.

353
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,559
But once your relationship

354
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,479
spreads in the two clubs,

355
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,239
plus the international games
which you are going to join,

356
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,760
there will be no secret any more.

357
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,080
We have discussed it
in advance and agreed on this.

358
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,959
He is the team captain,

359
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,880
and he cannot openly date,

360
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,440
so we have to keep it low-key.

361
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,120
Do you know

362
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,840
that your brother forfeited a game

363
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,680
when he was 13?

364
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,280
But there's something
you definitely don't know.

365
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,519
They both

366
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,056
participated in the competition
when they were 13.

367
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,519
But

368
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,959
your brother lost to Lin Yiyang

369
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,400
in the group stage
and directly forfeited the game.

370
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,200
In the following year,

371
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,440
he worked up his energy

372
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,408
to win the championship.
And that's how he became famous.

373
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,880
No wonder

374
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,279
my brother harbors special feelings

375
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,360
for Lin Yiyang.

376
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,080
Tell you what.

377
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:56,680
When my brother went to Hull,
as soon as he saw Lin Yiyang,

378
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,440
he asked me to persuade him
to return to China.

379
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,519
Jiang Yang seemed
to have also participated

380
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,208
in the national competition back then.

381
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,680
During those years
when their paths crossed,

382
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,696
your brother forfeited a game
in the first year,

383
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,600
and Lin Yiyang forfeited a game

384
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,479
in the last year.

385
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,200
It's quite interesting.

386
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,880
Your brother and Lin Yiyang

387
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,039
were born in the same year,

388
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,600
with Lin Yiyang
being a few months older.

389
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,840
Both of them are sixth
in their family ranking

390
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,479
as well as genius players.

391
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,600
They are also good friends.

392
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,239
They are brothers

393
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,479
who strive to win against each other.

394
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,239
Yin Guo.

395
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,319
I'll be leaving first. Bye-bye.

396
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,400
When we were eating,

397
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
Lin Lin said

398
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,360
that my brother once forfeited a game
when he was younger

399
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,039
because of you.

400
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:27,479
Alright.

401
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,519
I admit

402
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:33,719
that you are better than my brother.

403
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,768
It also depends on the condition.

404
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:41,519
However, he had already admitted

405
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,944
the fact that I was better than him

406
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,360
when he was 13.

407
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,080
Look at you.

408
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,360
Can you be a little more humble?

409
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,080
There is no humility on the field.

410
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,759
I think

411
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,120
you will be cuter while
being a little more humble.

412
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,039
Actually, Meng Xiaodong

413
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
has his own merits.

414
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,200
For example?

415
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,319
I'll say when I think of them.

416
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,360
I knew it.

417
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,864
You are back.

418
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Are you going to sleep?

419
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,759
No.

420
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,279
I'm reading the head coach's rules.

421
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:02,160
We are treated like children.

422
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,799
Once it hits 11 PM,
the lights will be out.

423
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,360
It's like boarding in high school, huh?

424
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,248
We've got to get used to it.

425
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,384
I need to blow-dry my hair.

426
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,792
Give me two minutes. It'll be quick.

427
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,424
It's alright. I'm not sleeping yet.

428
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,352
Go ahead.

429
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,440
Slow down. This bed isn't very stable.

430
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,719
Lin Lin,

431
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,959
when you were younger,

432
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,039
who led the team

433
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:54,024
during the national competitions?

434
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,440
Well,

435
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,360
it depends.

436
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,360
Anyway, Mr. He was old.

437
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,039
So he seldom led the team.

438
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,400
Usually it would be

439
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,360
either my coach

440
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,920
or Fan Wencong's.

441
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Before they left each time,

442
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,600
they would tell Mr. He,

443
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,279
"Don't worry. We will definitely
not bully Lin Yiyang."

444
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,039
Then Mr. He would say,

445
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,479
"You can 'bully' him as you wish
and take the heat out of him."

446
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,799
But the truth is,

447
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,719
at that time,

448
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
everyone seemed to fear Yiyang

449
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,519
and nobody dared provoke him.

450
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,920
But in reality,

451
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,240
he was someone everyone cherished.

452
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:36,959
For example, my coach

453
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:40,039
felt sorry for him
while knowing his pride.

454
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,279
He couldn't provide for him directly.

455
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,200
Whenever he wanted to buy him some food,

456
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,120
he would

457
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,719
buy an extra portion for me

458
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:49,719
and then tell me,

459
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:52,160
"If you can't finish it,

460
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,960
just share with him."

461
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,200
Your coach

462
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,759
is really too kind.

463
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,160
They all are.

464
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,200
Other coaches have also
had their own ways to be nice to him.

465
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,239
It's good
to share a room with me, right?

466
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:06,600
Later,

467
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,200
I will tell you everything slowly.

468
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Actually,

469
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,239
I do want to know

470
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,680
the stories about his past.

471
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,279
But every time I hear them,

472
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,999
it just breaks my heart.

473
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,039
He has you now, doesn't he?

474
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,768
It's all in the past.

475
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,048
Things will get better.

476
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,479
By the way, I wonder

477
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,992
whether

478
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,559
something happened

479
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:36,559
to your brother

480
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
during his training

481
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,600
when he was abroad.

482
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,759
My brother?

483
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,752
Yes.

484
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,759
It's just that...

485
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,160
Don't tell him I'm the one who asked.

486
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,600
This is our little secret.

487
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,440
You mustn't tell him.

488
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,039
Got it.

489
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,719
Forget it.
I guess you don't know either.

490
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,456
Hurry up and go to sleep.
We have training tomorrow.

491
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:02,959
- Good night.
- Good night.

492
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,600
(Enough chatting?)

493
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,360
(How did you know we were chatting?)

494
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,239
(I could guess.)

495
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,999
(Then, can you guess
what the chat was about?)

496
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,279
(It's most likely)

497
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,239
(that she made me sound pitiful.)

498
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,719
(Well done on guessing.)

499
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,519
(Open your window.)

500
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,160
(You wouldn't be)

501
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,880
(outside my window, would you?)

502
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,799
(This is against the team rules.)

503
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,279
(When did you leave it?)

504
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:48,160
(Before I left.)

505
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,279
(I stood on the terrace)

506
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,039
(for two minutes.)

507
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,440
(If you wanted
to suit someone in the past,)

508
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,920
(I guess they would fall for you
in no time.)

509
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:26,024
(You should ask Lin Lin more)

510
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,719
(about what I was like in the past.)

511
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,616
(I couldn't possibly)

512
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:34,559
(suit anyone except for you.)

513
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,008
Lin Yiyang, are you playing?

514
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,504
(Go to bed quickly.)

515
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:03,559
(Good night.)

516
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,279
How did you

517
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:07,440
put up with him all these years?

518
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,352
I didn't.

519
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,880
I just yield.

520
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,440
Young Master Meng,

521
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,600
now is the time to rest.

522
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,160
He's got an old injury.

523
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,152
And I don't have a good arm.

524
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,799
You're the only one here

525
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
whose physical indicators

526
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:26,680
are all perfectly normal.

527
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,519
It's tough on the two of us.

528
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,440
Besides,

529
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,239
I think for billiards,

530
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:36,440
the most important thing
is to meet your match.

531
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
With Lin Yiyang around,

532
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,328
of course you can get back.

533
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,680
He's better than those disciples
of yours from Bei City,

534
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,759
isn't he?

535
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,999
I just can't stand you guys.

536
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,999
You are never serious.

537
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,999
Especially in the locker room.

538
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,816
Your attitude is not proper at all.

539
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:57,448
Come on.

540
00:35:58,279 --> 00:35:59,464
Show him some attitude.

541
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,848
It's no fun training like this.

542
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,128
What?

543
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:07,160
Let's do it a bit faster.

544
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,840
Sure. Why not?

545
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,239
Don't think I can't do it

546
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,072
since I've never played.

547
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,919
Let's wait and see.

548
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,040
Let's take a break.

549
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,680
and have some tea.

550
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,319
Bro,

551
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,359
it's one o'clock a.m.,
and you're drinking tea?

552
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:17,576
I've done this for over 20 years.

553
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,208
I've become immune to tea long ago.

554
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,799
I'm not used to water
with no taste anymore.

555
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:33,520
Speaking of which,

556
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,040
the last time the three of us

557
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,120
gathered like this,

558
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,879
we were all still young.

559
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:43,080
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

560
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,120
To have the bosses
of the two major clubs

561
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,600
fly to Hull,

562
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,960
it could only be you.

563
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:53,839
Among the three of us,

564
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,352
I'm the least

565
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,040
talker.

566
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,160
Not anymore.

567
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:03,919
Now

568
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
you're the best at making small talk.

569
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:07,919
That's different.

570
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,279
Thank you both

571
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:19,432
for coming to me.

572
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,600
Thank you.

573
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:35,816
(Two months later)

574
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,824
Zhou.

575
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,160
There is a problem with the luggage.

576
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,000
You'd better deal with it quickly.

577
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:52,040
Yiyang, there's a problem
with the luggage.

578
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,872
Let's wait.

579
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,040
There's a problem with the luggage.

580
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,480
Let's pull over and wait a moment.

581
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:58,919
Look.

582
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:01,719
Is today your birthday?

583
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,319
No, it's not.

584
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:09,399
Yiyang, is this your surprise
for your girlfriend?

585
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:14,399
How could it be?

586
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,439
We are here for the competition.
It's not proper to do this.

587
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,560
Then it's just fans.

588
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,904
They put a lot of effort into it.

589
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,480
Yin Guo, go for it!

590
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:33,919
Yin Guo, go for it!

591
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,120
Thank you.

592
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,480
Guo, good luck with the gold medal.

593
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:38,640
I have faith in you.

594
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,239
Thank you all.

595
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:39,799
Thank you.

596
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:40,936
Thank you.

597
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,200
That guy

598
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:52,040
seems to have been pursuing Guo
for years, right?

599
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,719
Last time,

600
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,919
he contacted Yin Guo's father,

601
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,792
asking if he could introduce
him to officially meet her.

602
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,759
Hey, sunshine.

603
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,480
Judging by your look,

604
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,160
are you worried about Lin Yiyang

605
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,759
or thinking about the young guy
at the airport

606
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:26,640
who has been pursuing you?

607
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:28,480
What are you talking about?

608
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:30,160
It's not like that.

609
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,160
Nobody's pursuing me.

610
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:32,520
That's not pursuing at all.

611
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,719
Listen.

612
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:36,879
You'd better

613
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,680
check on your boyfriend.

614
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,160
He's probably sulking and jealous
right now.

615
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,960
He can't be, can he?

616
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,879
Well, he has a lot of fans too.

617
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:47,839
And I'm not jealous.

618
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,399
He can't be?

619
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,240
Then you should go and see.

620
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:52,919
The free time

621
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:53,879
is limited.

622
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,040
If you don't go now, it'll be too late.

623
00:40:58,759 --> 00:40:59,359
Besides,

624
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,520
before the match,

625
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,080
you must comfort our captain

626
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,200
and put his mind at ease.

627
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:06,439
Then I'll go take a look.

628
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,360
Go ahead.

629
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,919
If you need anything, just call me.

630
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,160
- Okay.
- I'm off.

631
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,719
Well...

632
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,359
Is he

633
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:33,560
available?

634
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:37,759
Yes, he is.

635
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:38,600
I'm heading out.

636
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,799
Why are you back?

637
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:06,759
I'm feeling frustrated inside.

638
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,000
And I haven't eaten anything since noon.

639
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:31,719
Just speak up.
