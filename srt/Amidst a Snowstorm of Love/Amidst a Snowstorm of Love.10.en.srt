or taken some medicine?

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,359
Don't talk. I know your throat hurts.

53
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,399
Well, you can type.

54
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,679

00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,399
No worries. I...

60
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,360
I haven't been looking well lately.

61
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm afraid

62
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:53,360
it will affect your mood

64
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,719
and how you got sick.

65
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,239
You still have nothing
to talk about while resting.

187
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,920
I guess
your throat won't get better soon.

188
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:31,920
After one week?

194

What's wrong?

195
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,279
My hands are too cold.

196
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm afraid to chill you.

197
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,959
So why don't you wear more clothes?

198
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,519
When I received your message,

199
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,920
I was dumping the trash downstairs.

200
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,959
I had no time to go back to get a coat.

201
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,999
I couldn't get lost
at the train station.

202
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,120
What's the rush?

203
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,120
I can't keep you waiting.

204
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,279
Wait.

205
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,719
I better book a hotel room now.

206
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,120
I'm afraid
there will be no empty rooms later.

207
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,600
You don't have to.

208
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,840
We'll do nothing.

209
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,279
I just want to stay here with you.

210
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
I'll go find a movie.

211
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:33,360
Shall we watch it together, okay?

212
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
I bumped into something again
when I came out of the bathroom.

213
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,479
Why are there boxes everywhere
in your house?

214
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,920
It's fine.

215
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,400
Wait a moment.

216
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:16,640
Does it hurt?

217
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,479
What did you do? A cold compress?

218
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,200
Turn off the music.

219
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,680
Ice pack.

220
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,400
What did your roommate say?

221
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,319
He asked

222
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,959
what we would have
for breakfast tomorrow.

223
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,959
No wonder he is your roommate.

224
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,600
I'll do it myself.

225
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,279
It's okay.

226
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,112
You sleep on the outside side,
and I'll sleep inside.

227
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,400
It'll be more convenient for you
to go to the restroom at night.

228
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,759
Okay.

229
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,719
Good night.

230
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,600
(Good night?)

231
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,120
(Pondering his actions facing the wall?)

232
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,200
Good night.

233
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,216
(Hey.)

234
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,328
(Hey.)

235
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,600
(I have something to tell you.)

236
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,319
(I'm staying at Lin Yiyang's place.)

237
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,239
Lin Yiyang's place?

238
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
(He's lying right behind me.)

239
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,719
(I haven't told you yet.)

240
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:32,880
What does she mean?

241
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,319
(He pursued me, and I accepted.)

242
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,880
(I came to see him
and didn't stay at a hotel.)

243
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,799
(I ended up sleeping at his place.)

244
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,360
Good for you, Guo.

245
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:52,840
(Awesome!)

246
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:01,039
(I'm just telling you
I have a boyfriend now.)

247
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,440
(If he's your boyfriend,)

248
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,360
(stop talking, turn off your phone,
pull away his cover,)

249
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,719
(and throw yourself at him.)

250
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,080
(Be serious.)

251
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,640
(Okay, seriously speaking,)

252
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,799
(protect yourself anyway.)

253
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,999
(Goodbye.)

254
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:03,240
(Alarm)

255
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,519
Wen Xiao, your alarm?

256
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,360
What time did you set?
It's so early now.

257
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,479
Did you sleep well?

258
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,279
What time is it?

259
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,360
8:00 A.M.

260
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,880
Sleep more.

261
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,319
Okay.

262
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:38,560
Are you awake?

263
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,319
Yes.

264
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,000
Get up and wash up.

265
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,279
I've bought you toiletries.
They're put on the washing machine.

266
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,680
Okay.

267
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:07,600
What's the matter?

268
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,319
I fear your roommate is out there.

269
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,239
I'm going to wash up.

270
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:17,799
Just do your usual routine with me.

271
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,600
Don't waste your money
on something unimportant.

272
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,319
Save your money. Got it?

273
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,719
Yeah.

274
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,359
Could you help me find a billiard room?

275
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,879
I want to practice for four hours first.

276
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,640
No problem.

277
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:06,439
Here we are.

278
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,120
Isn't this a hostel?
Is there a billiard room?

279
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,279
Yes.

280
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,759
Hi.

281
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:27,336
Hi, Gareth.

282
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,439
So, when will you come to me
and sign the contract for next year?

283
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:35,160
How about noon?
I need to practice with her first.

284
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,640
See you later.

285
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,640
It's large.

286
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:02,520
I'm surprised.

287
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:04,960
Yiyang.

288
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,759
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

289
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,640
Yiyang.

290
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:11,560
Yiyang, long time.

291
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,712
Yiyang.

292
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,359
- Yiyang.
- Long time no see.

293
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,719
Yiyang.

294
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,919
Are you a regular here?

295
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:22,279
It seems like everyone knows you.

296
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:24,560
Pretty much.

297
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:26,560
Yiyang.

298
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,648
Tidy up the back room.

299
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:29,160
Okay.

300
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,279
Buy breakfast for my girlfriend.

301
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,520
Well,

302
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,960
you haven't had breakfast yet.

303
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,719
I'll go upstairs
and buy you something good.

304
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,040
Yiyang, will you eat?

305
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,759
I'm fine.

306
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,239
Alright, I'll go.

307
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,680
Hello, I'm Sun Yao.

308
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,680
Hello, I'm Yin Guo.

309
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,360
Be careful.

310
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,799
Yiyang, I'll go and tidy up.

311
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,080
Are you upset?

312
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,279
You shook your head.
Does it mean you're happy or not?

313
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:43,200
You have this billiard room, huh?

314
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,520
You lied that you were a regular.

315
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,239
The owner of this hostel
owned this place before.

316
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,200
Later, it was rented out.

317
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:01,359
But it wasn't managed well,
so I rented this place.

318
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,319
When I'm not here, the guy

319
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:06,399
who went
to buy you breakfast manages it.

320
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,799
His name is Sun Zhou. And Sun Yao is

321
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,279
his younger brother.

322
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,040
When I rented this place,

323
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,520
six months' rent was paid in one go.

324
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:24,399
As a result, there were power outages
due to the snowstorms.

325
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,799
We had no customers,
causing a great loss of money.

326
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,000
But I met you

327
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:33,759
in my hardiest time.

328
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:42,560
So, Wu Wei scoffed you were poor.

329
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,200
Didn't he know you own this place?

330
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,879
How could he not? He knows.

331
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,000
When we lost the most money,

332
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,120
he even helped me financially.

333
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,839
But it's all right.

334
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,759
Basically, it's suffering a small loss.

335
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:00,799
I can manage by myself.

336
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,319
So, you went to play
at the Chinese billiard room before.

337
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,160
Did you do that
to treat someone to dinner?

338
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,480
Yes, that's true.

339
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,160
Your good friend?

340
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,399
It's my privacy.

341
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:40,080
Never mind.

342
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,480
(Silly girl, I did that for you.)

343
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,600
The food is here.

344
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,839
When did you finish breakfast?

345
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,239
I ate something
on the way to the market.

346
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:09,520
Yin Guo.

347
00:43:11,279 --> 00:43:13,600
I just got you something to eat.

348
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,279
I hope you'll enjoy it.

349
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:17,759
Oh, it's good. Thanks.

350
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,640
It's alright. We're friends now.

351
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,399
I'll go back to work.

352
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,120
Thank you.
