=Episode 23=

25
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,672
(Suzhou Science & Technology
Town Hospital)

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
Alright, don't worry about me.
I'm not alone.

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm with many other patients,
waiting for surgery. Don't worry,

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm glad you stay calm.

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,079
It's time to go. Leave your phone here.

30
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,320
Take off the clothes inside.
Just wear the hospital gown.

31
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,200
Okay, thank you.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,879
Alright, I gotta go.

33
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,679
After the surgery, Wu Wei will tell you.

34
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,679
Don't worry. I will accompany him.

35
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,440
Okay, good luck.

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,279
Gotta go, bye.

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,999
Blueberry juice.

38
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,160
I'm going back to Helsin.

39
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,800
But I'll come back to see your final.

40
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,679
My final? You're more confident than me.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,040
I bet you have a chance
to win the championship.

42
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,840
You bet? Don't put pressure on me.

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Okay, I won't do it.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,719
Ladies and gentlemen, the next game

45
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,680
of the Women's Nine-Ball Open
is about to begin.

46
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,279
First of all, let's welcome Yin Guo.
Last time in this game,

47
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,600
she has defeated
many veteran young players

48
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,760
and finished the runner-up.
She's definitely a dark horse.

49
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,272
This year, she's back
and currently shining

50
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:33,359
in the top five in the world ranking.

51
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,079
As a talented young player,

52
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,999
she's the new hope of the Chinese team
to win the championship this year.

53
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,919
And her opponent is Ashly,

54
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,760
who has won two championships

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,439
and three runner-ups
in her professional career.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,200
We didn't expect
the last game in this stage

57
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,400
would be just as exciting as the final.

58
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,929
What a pity that only one
of these two great players

59
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,639
will advance to the
next stage of the tournament.

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,839
Ladies and gentlemen, the next game

61
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:12,760
of the Women's Nine-Ball Open
begins now.

62
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,040
Banking, please.

63
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,799
Ready, three, two, one, go.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,760
Ashly, the breaker.

65
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,239
We apply the rules of winner-breaks
in this tournament.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,560
Ashly, break.

67
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,880
(It's her home court)

68
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,320
(as Ashly wins the first rack.)

69
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,920
(Ashly is doing
a really great job today.)

70
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,440
(We're at the ninth rack,)

71
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,560
(and she's still the breaker.)

72
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,800
Ashly is the most popular player here.

73
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,039
She has the home advantage.

74
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,519
Yin Guo can stay calm.

75
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,800
If I were her,
I would be collapsed mentally.

76
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,839
She has no emotions in the match.
That's her biggest strength.

77
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,839
(Eight versus eight.)

78
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
(From zero to eight, Yin Guo
has turned the table. That's amazing.)

79
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,039
You don't watch the deciding game?

80
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,200
She has ball control
and won't make mistakes.

81
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,839
She will definitely win.

82
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,279
Yiyang has better mental strength
than Guo.

83
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,360
He even skips the deciding game.

84
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,360
That's not true. He's too scared
to watch. He's nervous.

85
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:00,719
Then let's watch.

86
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Yiyang, you're not watching?

87
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,599
The guests will arrive in ten minutes.
Get ready.

88
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,279
- Drop the act.
- Drop the act.

89
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,400
(On competitor for the championship,)

90
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,520
(Live)
(no matter who's out in this round.)

91
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,640
(Although she's at a very young age,)

92
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,119
(her mentality is
at the very top compared to her peers.)

93
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:55,200
The two commentators just keep talking.

94
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,759
Will it affect her mentality?

95
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,719
Commentators aren't on-site.

96
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,800
But, they face a lot of pressure
on their home ground.

97
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,440
The audience applauded
whenever Ashly scored.

98
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,200
But they didn't if Yin Guo scored.

99
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,800
You don't understand.
I'm asking Xiaodong.

100
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,400
No worries. No matter the environment,
it won't affect her.

101
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,640
Good.

102
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:33,999
You are so great.

103
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,400
Not bad.

104
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,640
Can't even compliment me.

105
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:45,920
She kept practicing when others fought,
and even the police came.

106
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,079
The away-game disadvantage
can't affect her.

107
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,879
I have faith in her.

108
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,959
That's true. Yin Guo looks normal.

109
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,560
But she's like a robot in the match.

110
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,680
She will be expressionless.
Unbelievable.

111
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:05,800
Yiyang.

112
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:07,759
Long time no see.

113
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,400
Long time no see.

114
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,400
Come on in.

115
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,040
We can talk about nothing but work, huh?

116
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,879
How have you been?

117
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,280
Not bad.

118
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,999
Come, have a seat.

119
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,640
Come on.

120
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,959
You have a good love life and career.
I really envy you.

121
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Look, here's the information
on my clubs.

122
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,119
The new one at home is under renovation.

123
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,479
(Ashly is worried now.)

124
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:55,309
(If Yin Guo wins this rack,
it'll put an end)

125
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,759
(to Ashly's journey in this tournament.)

126
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,479
(The last ball if she misses this.)

127
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,079
(That means it shoots all the chance
to Ashly.)

128
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:17,560
She won.

129
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,040
Congratulations.

130
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,040
You played so good.

131
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,359
Thank you.

132
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,999
Nine to eight.
The winner is Yin Guo from China.

133
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,359
Fantastic! Yin Guo won.

134
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,479
She didn't lose any balls
and got qualified.

135
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:42,920
Got it.

136
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,999
Are you worried about your girlfriend?

137
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,160
No, I'm sure she will win the match.

138
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,999
And she also can rank first
in the future.

139
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:02,640
Congratulations.

140
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,040
(Next, Yin Guo will get into
the last sixteen.)

141
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,800
(She and other 15 players will compete
and fight for the champion title)

142
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,160
(of the Women's Nine-ball Open
this year.)

143
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,680
Xiaotian.

144
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
You rarely come back.
Spend more time with Grandma at home.

145
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:32,599
Okay.

146
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,119
Grandma, I'm leaving.

147
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,359
Are you?

148
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,200
Yes. I gotta go.

149
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:39,640
I'll walk you out.

150
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,280
Okay.

151
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:03,599
You know what to say to Grandma, right?

152
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,280
Of course. I'll say good things
about Yiyang.

153
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,359
You're usually not serious,
but you know what to do in this matter.

154
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,839
Yiyang is such a good person.

155
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,400
He took care of Guo and me
when we lived abroad.

156
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,896
It's getting late.
You take care of Grandma.

157
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:19,320
She should go to sleep now. I gotta go.

158
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,599
Okay, bye.

159
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,479
Visiting hours are over.
How did you get in?

160
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,119
I told the nurse
that we're blood brothers.

161
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,920
She was considerate and let me in.

162
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,479
Blood brothers?

163
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,160
Just an excuse. Don't take it seriously.

164
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:01,719
A rare visitor.

165
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,336
Try one.

166
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,160
Since you look fine, I should go.

167
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,879
You just got here. What's the rush?

168
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,879
You look better now.
Shouldn't I leave after a visit?

169
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,119
Go.

170
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,888
You see you out.

171
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,879
No need. I can leave myself.

172
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,680
I happened to have time to visit him.

173
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,440
Lin Lin.

174
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:47,320
I've talked with his attending doctor.

175
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,640
He said the surgery went very smoothly.

176
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,119
As long as he rests well,
he can still play.

177
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,400
I'll go make a call. You two talk.

178
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,079
There's fruit inside. Help yourself.

179
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,640
What about you?
Are you leaving or staying?

180
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:15,200
Since you're here, I can stay longer.

181
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,599
You look better now.

182
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,560
Do you still need company?

183
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:33,800
Yes, Meng Xiaodong will talk more
if you're here.

184
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,359
Please. Say something.

185
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,959
Thank you.

186
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,680
Eat it, not take it.

187
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,200
Do you want more?

188
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,759
Sure.

189
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,119
You still love oranges.

190
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,280
Thank you.

191
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,599
I have something else to do,
so I gotta go.

192
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,800
Let me walk you out.

193
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,280
You came to visit my player.

194
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,560
I should walk you out. Come on.

195
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,264
Okay.

196
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,600
Close the door.

197
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,279
Lin Lin, do you have anything to say?

198
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,279
What happened to you?

199
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,719
I'm not at my best?

200
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:51,080
You seem off since coming back
from training abroad.

201
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,239
What happened?

202
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,920
No, nothing.

203
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,519
Alright, I must be overthinking.

204
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,519
Anyway, I hope
you can lift your psychological burden

205
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,039
and move on.

206
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,239
I will.

207
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,920
You are Meng Xiaodong.
Many people are watching you.

208
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
But they have nothing to do with me.

209
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,640
What about me?

210
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:40,400
Maybe I've been used
to watching your match.

211
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,759
I don't want to see you retire so soon.

212
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,600
You have things to do, right? Go ahead.

213
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,279
I won't leave the field.
I'll always be there.

214
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,880
You seem distracted.
What's in your mind?

215
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:28,719
I'll play against Su Wei soon.

216
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,080
I have this feeling for the first time.

217
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,600
I'll compete against a good friend.

218
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:41,479
It's so hard for me. And she's injured.

219
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,519
It's inevitable. On the court,
there are only opponents.

220
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,319
Sounds reasonable but cold.

221
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,519
Let me put it this way.
Off the table, we're still friends.

222
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:06,479
Good luck.

223
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,479
Good luck.

224
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,600
This's what I'm afraid of.
I have to play against you.

225
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,920
It doesn't matter.
The day will come sooner or later.

226
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,799
By the way, where's your boyfriend?
Is he coming today?

227
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,704
He said he would come.
Besides my match today,

228
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,719
his good friend will also have a match.
Two matches, in fact.

229
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,959
I'm not sure if he can make it.

230
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,830
(Attention, please.
All players please get prepared.)

231
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,959
(The competition is about to begin.)

232
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,680
They gather us so early.

233
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,319
The coach just said
that the organizing committee

234
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,360
requires all participants
to enter the venue early.

235
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:51,680
It's because you're star players.
They want to see you all in advance.

236
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,400
Of course, I'm not included.

237
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,959
Come on, you're the top player
in your region, alright?

238
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:57,576
Yin Guo.

239
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:58,840
An'an.

240
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,360
I just saw Yiyang outside.

241
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,880
He's arrived?

242
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,160
That's great.

243
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,799
Let's go. Enter the venue.

244
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,440
Let's go.

245
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:19,319
Ladies and gentlemen. First, let's
welcome our players entering the course.

246
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Wanna be exposed?

247
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:58,319
It's my first time seeing him interact
with fans.

248
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,680
It seems pretty fun.

249
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:04,479
Fun? Who showed me the chat logs

250
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,279
and denied a relationship before?

251
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,120
We were not in a relationship back then.

252
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,999
To everyone who's now
watching our live broadcasting,

253
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,120
as reminded by my colleague,

254
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,640
there's one important guest here.

255
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,479
Let's welcome Lin Yiyang.

256
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,039
Hello, Lin,
don't you want to say hello to us?

257
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,759
Lin, I suppose you're here today
to see your old friends.

258
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,679
Everyone, you might not know that

259
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,719
almost all the male players here
have played with Lin.

260
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,419
They must be disappointed this time

261
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,680
that they have no chance
to play with Lin again.

262
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,664
Maybe not, Berry just posted one
of updates on social media,

263
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,920
saying thank you, Lin,
for not signing up for the tournament.

264
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,039
No single player wants
to see him not at all.

265
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
Berry is a funny guy.

266
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,519
Berry just posted another one.

267
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,184
Please look for the video
from last year's tournament.

268
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:23,239
The game in the last sixteen will ensure
you'll discover a huge secret.

269
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,400
Oh no, it's going to be exposed.

270
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,360
We have two Chinese players
in the audience.

271
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,200
It seems our female players
will celebrate with them.

272
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,519
We can find Lin appearing
in the audience.

273
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,640
Are we discovered?

274
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,440
Just one shot is enough.

275
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,959
Who knew they would play the video?

276
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,200
We do realize

277
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,160
the lady in the playback is now
in our tournament.

278
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,400
She's about to start her quarterfinal.

279
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,880
The day before, this lady played
an extraordinary game against her opponent.

280
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,640
And she defeated the champion
of the last tournament.

281
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,759
You're on camera.

282
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,640
Yin Guo?

283
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:30,840
So, Lin, who did you come here for
last year?

284
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,880
Let me rephrase that. For whom?

285
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,920
Let me rephrase the question.

286
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,640
Who are you here for today?

287
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,880
You guys also saw that already.

288
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,239
Do I still need to clarify anything?

289
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,039
Oh, sure. You should definitely
give us your answer.

290
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,120
Last year, I was at a small bar.

291
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,959
That was the first time I saw her.

292
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,799
I didn't go inside. Instead,

293
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,719
I stood outside and watched her

294
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:46,799
for about five minutes.

295
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,559
Of course, she didn't know this.

296
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,680
I can still recall my thoughts
at that moment. I have to meet her.

297
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,479
I have to go inside, buy her a drink

298
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,799
and get her number tonight.

299
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,400
I knew exactly what I was thinking.

300
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,719
I knew she's the one.

301
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:27,239
But I have no idea how to approach her

302
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:33,200
or what to say to impress her.

303
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,400
She's so pretty.

304
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,680
I was scared to make any mistakes.

305
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:52,040
Trust me. I was really afraid
of screwing it all up.

306
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,400
I get it. So, today, you did it.

307
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,120
Yeah, I hope so.

308
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
I think I will make it.

309
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,600
What? Is he saying
he hasn't made it yet?

310
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,999
Lin, you've really disappointed us.

311
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,319
You're the most outstanding star player,

312
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:24,519
and you haven't won your love?
Unbelievable.

313
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:27,319
It's heartbreaking to know that.

314
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,319
Just tell us the truth.

315
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,080
Clearly, they're not going to let it go.

316
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,719
If things go on like this,
I guess the audience will go crazy.

317
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,440
To be honest,
tonight's rating is all relying on you.

318
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,920
Yes, you left us cruelly that time.

319
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,519
Now, you must give us something
for everyone here.

320
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,840
- Tell her.
- Tell her.

321
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,200
- Tell her.
- Tell her.

322

- Tell her.
- Tell her.

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,479
- Tell her.
- Tell her.

324
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:13,080
- Tell her.
- Tell her.

325
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,479
What can I even say? She's so perfect.

326
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:28,520
And I might need to spend

327
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,504
the rest of my life
seeking for her love.

328
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:42,799
So, I'm not in a hurry.

329
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,360

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,880
Oh, my gosh, I'm so touched.
I'm about to cry.

333
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:23,799
Alright.

334
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,600
Don't cry.

335
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,640
Alright, okay. Now, let's give our girls
some privacy because after all,

336
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,319
our game is about to begin.

337
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,600

We will compete soon.

I'll have to work harder.

Though it's more romantic.

347
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,400
This is a live broadcast.
It can be watched at home.

348
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,640
So what?

349
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,880
Her family doesn't know
we're dating yet.

350
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,200
Didn't you meet her parents

Everyone, our women's quarterfinals
is about to start.

355
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,880
Now entering the stadium is Yin Guo
from China

356
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,039
and Su Wei from Singapore.

The first winner of the quarterfinal is

375
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,200
Yin Guo from China.

376
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:32,120
She won.

377
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,559
Congratulations.

378
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,319
Thank you, and you too.
See you at the finals.

379
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,464
Go for it.

380
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,840
Next is the first quarterfinal
of the Men's Nine-Ball.

381
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,200
Let's welcome the male players.

382
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:27,080
Come on, An'an,
you're already doing great.

383
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,880
You're the only Chinese
in the men's quarterfinals.

384
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,559
I'll do my best.
Since you won, I can't lose, right?

385
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,992
Alex is considered a local player
from the previous generation.

386
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,400
Coincidentally, his opponent,
Chen An'an, is also a veteran.

387
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,970
(Both of them have participated
in the Nine-Ball games)

388
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,279
(for more than ten years.)

389
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:51,920
(The personal best for Alex is a champion
of a tournament from three years ago.)

390
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:55,200
(He has not been performing
so well these years.)

391
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,239
(Chen An'an has not been a star player
this year.)

392
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,600
(He did reach his personal best
in this tournament.)

393
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,040
It's time to take your medicine.
Go to sleep early.

394
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,799
I'll sleep after watching
a good buddy's retirement match.

395
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,799
Get some rest as early as possible.

396
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,180
(Live)

397
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,200
Your friend? Why are you more nervous
than when you're playing?

398
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,319
He's quite a good friend.

399
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,480
He looks unfamiliar. I guess
he doesn't often make it to the finals.

400
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,080
He's retiring after this tournament.

401
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,359
If he can make it to the quarterfinal,
it will be his personal best.

402
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:44,439
The quarterfinal lists
an international tournament.

403
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:47,799
This is Chen An'an's personal best
in his career.

404
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:51,480
He demonstrated his strength and talent
through personal experience.

405
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,839
Wish him all the best
in the following matches.

406
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,759
Congratulations!

407
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,960
Congratulations.
You made it to the quarterfinal.

408
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,799
Eight players are in the quarterfinal,
and half are from Team China.

409
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:11,399
An'an is the only Chinese male player.

410
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:12,879
Tomorrow, you must play well.

411
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,399
Okay.

412
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,359
The three of you are on the same team.

413
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:18,480
At least,
you should win the first two places.

414
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,640
Coach, please don't put pressure on us.

415
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,719
Three against one. Any pressure?

416
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,719
I think An'an is under pressure.

417
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,160
Alright, take a rest.

418
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,040
Let's celebrate
after tomorrow's match. Dismissed.

419
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,640
Okay.

420
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,879
Go for it.

421
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:34,440
Come on.

422
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,759
Let's go.

423
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:36,359
- Let's go.
- Go.

424
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:38,120
Got a date?

425
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,879
I will let you go.

426
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,399
Come on.

427
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:56,439
Tian.

428
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,480
Yin Guo.

429
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,680
Isn't it almost dawn at home now?

430
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:06,719
Luckily, I didn't sleep.
Yiyang is so manly.

431
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,600
I was so excited.

432
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:13,239
It was so romantic that he confessed
in front of the audience.

433
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:19,799
Anyone else watched the live broadcast?

434
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:21,520
I mean my parents and Grandma.

435
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,480
Don't worry. Only I watched it.

436
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:27,960
That's good.

437
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,719
Yin Guo, you were awesome today.

438
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,839
I know. Alright, I gotta go.

439
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,520
You go to sleep.

440
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:42,480
Alright, you guys have fun.
I'm going to sleep. Bye.

441
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,680
Okay, bye.

442
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,736
Outside the door.

443
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,239
I'll go find him.

444
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:52,744
Go ahead.

445
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,080
It's the semifinals.

446
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,160
Yes.

447
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,279
An'an has made it to the quarterfinal.

448
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:21,560
Good things come in pairs.

449
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,319
I've reserved a nice place.
Let's celebrate.

450
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,200
Nice place?

451
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,680
Here's your drink.

452
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,120
