=Episode 17=

25
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:35,639
Don't you know me?

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,359
Kind of.

27
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:54,999
Don't we video call every day?

28
00:02:56,559 --> 00:03:00,960
It's not the same. You're real now.

29
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,079
Give it to me.

30
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,519
It's rare to see you in a dress.

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,439
That's because we met in winter.
Does it look good on me?

32
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,079
Of course.

33
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:33,760
If you like, after you return home,

34
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,200
I'll buy all kinds of nice dresses

35
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,120
and wear them for you all year round.

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,104
Okay.

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,279
Feels like we're less close.

38
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,440
Really?

39
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes.

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,000
You just hugged me briefly

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,239
and then let me go.

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,119
I'm having a cold.
You could be infected.

43
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:48,799
It doesn't matter.

44
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,880
Wait a second.

45
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,760
Look at the present first.

46
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,320
Isn't today your birthday?

47
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,320
I bought it for you in advance.

48
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,519
I brought it here,
so I don't need to send it to you.

49
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,359
Then look at mine first.

50
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,480
No, look at mine first.

51
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,639
I wore your black T-shirt
when I went back home.

52
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,440
So I bought an identical white one

53
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,519
for lovers.

54
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,880
Looks nice.

55
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,359
Now let's see yours.

56
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,480
What is it?

57
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:58,639
A necklace?

58
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:00,799
Earrings?

59
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,880
It's the prize money
from my first champion.

60
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,680
It's not much.
Just spend it as you like.

61
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,920
How could I?

62
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,719
It's memorable.
I can't spend it recklessly.

63
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:26,560
You need to save it.

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,599
I'll have more in the future.

65
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,760
Did you get any sleep
after a long flight?

66
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,079
I came straight here after I landed.

67
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,039
You must be exhausted.
Hurry and get in bed.

68
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,599
Lie down and have a nap. Come on.

69
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,880
Shoes off.

70
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,760
Actually, I'm a bit scared
of seeing you.

71
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,519
Why?

72
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,039
I fear your feelings for me will fade,

73
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,000
and we'll become strangers.

74
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,399
I'm scared

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,320
that when I come back,

76
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,839
you're seeing someone else.

77
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,399
I'm afraid too.

78
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,479
I'm afraid your fame will keep growing

79
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,839
and you'll be stolen by someone else.

80
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,560
I told you. I'm having a cold.

81
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,719
Our takeout.
I ordered food. I'll go get it.

82
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,920
Don't move. I'll go get it.

83
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,416
Lie back. Have more rest.

84
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,112
I'll get it. Be good.

85
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:53,680
I'll be back soon. Gotta go.

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,639
Take your time.

87
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,096
Don't worry.

88
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,959
Hello, I would like to buy a plaster.

89
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,719
On the shelf over there.

90
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,928
Okay.

91
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,719
What kind do you need?

92
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,479
Something to activate blood circulation
and remove stasis.

93
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll recommend some to you.

94
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,176
Alright.

95
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,959
What took you so long?

96
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,560
I went to buy the plaster for you.

97
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,800
Your shoulder hurt just now
when you were holding me.

98
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,440
Is it an old injury?

99
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
I'll help you apply it.

100
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:53,640
Careful.

101
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:00,800
Here?

102
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,560
I bought the plaster you often use.

103
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,560
But I know a more effective one.

104
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,879
This pharmacy doesn't sell it.

105
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,839
When you go back, I'll send some to you.

106
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,999
I almost forgot.

107
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,479
You won the open competition again,
didn't you?

108
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,839
Congratulations.

109
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,119
Right, I'll show you something.

110
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,719
Guess how much savings I have.

111
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,944
Look.

112
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,280
You see, these are financial products.

113
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,400
The money can be withdrawn anytime.

114
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,800
See?

115
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,040
They are short-term.

116
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,959
You stay at home

117
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,599
with no other expenses.

118
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,839
And you don't need a car or a house.

119
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,119
So, you should buy long-term products.

120
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I know.

121
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,400
But what if you need money someday?

122
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,999
All this money is for emergencies.

123
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,719
If you're short of money, just tell me.

124
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,719
What are you thinking about?

125
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,680
I am thinking

126
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,640
this sweater looks nice on you.

127
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,479
You like my sweater?

128
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
After meeting you,

129
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,040
I found many of your clothes, shoes,

130
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,719
and bags looked nice.

131
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:11,759
Sadly,

132
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,599
none of them was bought by me for you.

133
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,040
It seems that after we got together,

134
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,320
I really haven't given you much.

135
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,359
On second thoughts,

136
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,759
I'm not sure

137
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,280
how I managed to win you over.

138
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,320
By sweet talk? Not really.

139
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,959
Some meals or drinks? Nothing special.

140
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,680
I did it by my appearance?

141
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:02,440
What am I saying?

142
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,839
I'm just reflecting.

143
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,879
Indeed, I just fell for your face.

144
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:32,040
If it's well-kept,

145
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,759
I could look at it for 20 years,

146
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:40,079
30 years, 40 years, or 50 years.

147
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:50,359
It's my mom.

148
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,200
Answer it.

149
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,599
Hello, mom.

150
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,560
Yin Guo, are you having fun?

151
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,759
Will you come back late?

152
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,079
No, I won't.

153
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,719
What time will be back?

154
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,400
I'll ask Xiaodong to pick you up.

155
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,119
No need.

156
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:16,079
I will take a cab home.

157
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,239
Stay safe.

158
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,560
I know.

159
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,479
Don't stay out too late
and go home early.

160
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,119
Bye.

161
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:24,680
Bye.

162
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:29,800
What's wrong?

163
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,680
I have a curfew.

164
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,959
I have to be home by 11:00 PM
when I don't play matches.

165
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,119
I'll take you back before 11:00 PM.

166
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,800
You've come back
to celebrate my birthday.

167
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,479
But we have to part soon.

168
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,280
Go inside.

169
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,680
It's already past 11:00 PM.

170
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,079
I don't want to go in.

171
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,520
I'm not crying. I'm holding back tears.

172
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,119
I'm afraid my mom will find out later.

173
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,400
What time is your flight?

174
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,320
4:30 AM.

175
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:28,119
Why don't you get some more sleep
before you leave?

176
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,119
Red-eye flights are cheap.

177
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,119
Guo.

178
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,839
Xiaodong.

179
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,079
Come with me to Bei City for a meeting.

180
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:49,759
It's late.

181
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:50,999
I've told your mom.

182
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,520
I'll take you back later.

183
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,879
I'll also give my old friend a ride.

184
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,800
Haven't been to the new Bei City, right?

185
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,479
I'll take you to see it.

186
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,839
I haven't visited the old one either.

187
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,160
Yes, my dad doesn't like you.

188
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,160
He won't see you in Bei City.

189
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,320
I came from Dongxin City.

190
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,040
I have no reason to go to Bei City.

191
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,800
Yet you're
with a new Nine-Ball star of Bei City.

192
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,768
Let's go.

193
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:45,400
Go.

194
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
This is the cafeteria.

195
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,440
If I practice late

196
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,040
and I miss the meal at home,
I'll eat here.

197
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,680
Sometimes, I even cook for myself.

198
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,320
Are you hungry?
Let me make you something to eat.

199
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,959
You used to cook for me before.

200
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,680
This time, I'll cook for you.

201
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,600
For the record,
I only can do a simple meal.

202
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,319
I'll have noodles.
It's your birthday after all.

203
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:15,880
What noodles?

204
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:20,680
Beef noodles, spicy.

205
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,479
Alright, I'll cook.

206
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,759
Why beef noodles?

207
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,640
When I first won a match,
my coach's wife made it.

208
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,279
Her cooking skills are indeed good.

209
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,360
Have you eaten it?

210
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,479
During a competition
at the suburban stadium,

211
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,759
she brought over box lunches.

212
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,080
Bei City only had two contestants,

213
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,039
including me.

214
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,440
She made two extra box lunches,
so I got to eat it.

215
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,279
She is indeed a thoughtful person.

216
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,479
She did that on purpose.

217
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:03,360
(Peace and Joy)

218
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,880
There are no dried noodles.
I only found spaghetti. Is that okay?

219
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,120
It's fine. I'll help you.

220
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
Make some for me. I also want to eat.

221
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:16,428
(Billiards Club)

222
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,799
Here, young master.

223
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,799
Have a try.

224
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,080
I've never made beef noodles before.

225
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,080
Not bad. You should make it more often.

226
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,880
She doesn't have time to cook.
She needs to practice.

227
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Before you return home,

228
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,400
you can't step into Bei City's business.

229
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,959
Is there only one person in this world
who can deal with you?

230
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,039
Mind your own business.

231
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:45,999
Wait a moment.

232
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,160
Lin Yiyang.

233
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,600
More than one guy has been chasing Guo.

234
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,479
Xiaodong.

235
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,424
Really?

236
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,880
Of course,
one of them is even a super fan.

237
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,960
He attends her every match.

238
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,719
He comes from a decent family
with a listed company, I think.

239
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,319
Don't listen to his nonsense.
Just a fan.

240
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,640
She's a good girl.

241
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,880
I won't be surprised
if she has many suitors.

242
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,568
I'm off.

243
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,680

You're clever.

283
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,840
You cried in front of him to soften him
and get him back sooner.

284
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,239
I did not.

285
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:39,920
I know he'll be back
after saving enough money.

286
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,840
He thinks too much
and is used to relying on himself.

287
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,376
Go home.

288
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:22,792

you know I love you so.)

00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,799
(It's still early.)

291
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,239
Bye, Yin Guo. We're leaving now.

292
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,239
- Bye.
- Bye.

293
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,600
Are you an athlete, a billiards player?

294
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,048
Yes.

295
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:30,559
I've always thought
female billiards players are cool.

296
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,840
Really? Thank you.

297
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,120
Good luck, bye.

298
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,680
Thank you.

299
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,319
You may go.
I have to pick up someone else.

300
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,400
Long time no see.

301
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,360
Miss Lin, we've met in Hangzhou.

302
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,840
That doesn't count.
I was a referee at the competition.

303
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,039
It's been a long time
since we've met privately.

304
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,680
I heard you just had a major surgery.

305
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,999
Are you okay to work
on such a big competition now?

306
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:20,239
It's okay,
I planned to rest for another month.

307
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:23,840
But it's an important competition.
They couldn't let me rest.

308
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,920
But if you insisted on it,

309
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,279
they wouldn't force you to work, right?

310
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,719
That's true. But we are short-staffed.

311
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:33,239
Someone is going to have a baby.

312
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,759
And someone is on maternity leave.

313
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,680
I will be embarrassed

314
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,640
if anyone can't be on leave
because of me.

315
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,279
So, I got back to work.

316
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,920
Right, can I ask you something?

317
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,840
Did Lin Yiyang borrow money
from a loan shark?

318
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,759
He's been on fire since his comeback.

319
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,840
His ranking has been skyrocketing.

320
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,160
His ability
to win prize money is impressive.

321
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,840
Somebody has calculated his prize money
from various matches.

322
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,920
In pounds and dollars,

323
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,319
he must have earned over a million.

324
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,440
Since his comeback last year
as a solo player,

325
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,959
he's been present
at international games,

326
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,799
including snooker competitions,

327
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,759
Eight-Ball, and Nine-Ball games,

328
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,239
as long as his schedules don't clash.

329
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,959
What is he trying to do?
Is he a money-making machine?

330
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:37,160
Not like that, he wants to return home
and open a billiard room.

331
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,239
He didn't save much money
while he was studying.

332
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,360
Now he's anxious to come back,
so he's going all out.

333
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,559
Relax. No need to explain.

334
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,880
I'm kidding. I can guess his thoughts.

335
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,239
He can't return home penniless.

336
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,840
After all, he is Yiyang
from Dongxin City.

337
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,039
Miss, here are the blanket and slippers.

338
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,719
If you need anything else,
ring the bell anytime.

339
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:02,719
- Thank you.
- Yiyang.

340
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,440
Guo will pick you up, right?

341
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,400
I saw her at the open tournament.

342
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,759
I almost forgot what she looks like.

343
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,999
She might not make it.

344
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:16,039
She was still competing in Hangzhou
before we boarded the plane.

345
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,799
I called her, but she didn't answer it.

346
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,559
I follow her every match.

347
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,400
I missed it this time,
but I'll watch the replay back home.

348
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,120
No need to watch.
She will definitely win.

349
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,880
Be modest, alright?

350
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,080
I am very modest.

351
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,559
You're always boasting about Yin Guo.

352
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,799
I don't need to boast about her.

353
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:58,840
When did you last come back?

354
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,799
I came back last year.

355
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,160
What took them so long?

356
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,799
Unbelievable.

357
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,440
I doubt if they can make it
before Yiyang arrives.

358
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,759
You two are quick.

359
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:29,080
It's all your fault.
You had to take a shower before leaving.

360
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,360
I've been in charge of the renovation
and not been home for days.

361
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,559
Can't I even take a shower?

362
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,880
Has Jiang Yang arrived?

363
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,640
Jiang Yang...

364
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,944
Yeah, he has.

365
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,799
Sorry, guys. The flight was delayed.

366
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:53,160
Awesome. Congratulations
on winning another world championship.

367
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:54,400
Thank you.

368
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,920
You're friends with her.
You talk with her.

369
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,840
Does your family know about Lin Yiyang?

370
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:13,120
Xiaodong told me not to mention it
before Lin Yiyang came back

371
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,680
to avoid unnecessary troubles.

372
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,160
Once Yiyang comes back,
Xiaodong will find an opportunity

373
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,200
to intercede with the help of his dad.

374
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,360
You know it, right?

375
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,640
Back then, your mom was a referee
and a leader in the association.

376
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:37,680
I also know that Mr. He argued
with my mom because of him.

377
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Without Mr. He's help,

378
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,959
Lin Yiyang might have been suspended
for a year instead of half a year.

379
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:43,479
Really?

380
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,039
You didn't know that?

381
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,319
How should I know?

382
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,120
One of them is a leader
in the association;

383
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,640
the other is a highly respected elder
in the sports club.

384
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,519
How would they let outsiders know
if they quarreled?

385
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,519
Indeed, I heard it
from my parents' conversation.

386
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,519
There was lots of news
about Lin Yiyang's comeback this year.

387
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:08,920
My parents often talked about him.

388
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,719
My dad used to work in sports.

389
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,600
So, he also knows about Lin Yiyang.

390
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,999
Thinking about what he talked
about Lin Yiyang,

391
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,080
if I didn't know Lin Yiyang,

392
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,479
I would think

393
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:25,319
he's arrogant, loves nothing but money,
and has no competitive spirit.

394
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,479
He's in a tough spot.

395
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:33,400
Anyway, Yiyang has been working hard
in the competitions

396
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:36,640
just to avoid direct conflicts
before getting good results

397
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,719
and earning money, right?

398
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,120
I guessed it,
even though he didn't tell me.

399
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,959
But you know what?

400
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,799
My family doesn't value good results.

401
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,519
In particular, my mom

402
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,080
has many relatives involved in sports.

403
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,680
And some of them
have achieved great results.

404
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,600
So, my family is used to it.

405
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,479
I just don't want Lin Yiyang
to face such huge pressure

406
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,719
as soon as he returns home.

407
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:12,920
Alright, forget it.
I think I will sort it out

408
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,640
when I have to.

409
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,360
The plane has been landed, right?

410
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,319
It has arrived.
They're probably getting luggage.

411
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,279
They're coming out soon.

412
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,479
Put it here.

413
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,200

Yes, there are lots of people.

But I didn't remember any of them,
because none are as handsome as you.

Alright, I've met you. You two go on.

452
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:25,279
You had a tight competition schedule.

453
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:26,560
You haven't seen Guo for a long time.

454
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,439
That's true.

455
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,200
Even Xiaodong has seen him
more times than I have.

456
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,960
Enough. We should go.

- Go.

458
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,799
My luggage is over there.

459
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:44,319
I'll go get it.

460
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,799
I have to say goodbye now.

461
00:37:49,879 --> 00:37:55,480
The club's bus is waiting for me
in zone E.

462
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:00,680
I'll walk you there.

463
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,560
Let's go.

464
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:07,600
Wait for me here.

465
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,680
I'm off.

466
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:11,319
Okay, bye.

467
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,319
But guys from the club are on the bus.

468
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,239
Xiaodong, how come you're here?

469
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:28,839
To pick you up.

470
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,120
You pick me up? But you never...

471
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,919
You pick up Guo?

472
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,239
How are you?

473
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,719
Pretty good.

474
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,399
Hurry up,
or your mom will call me again.

475
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,239
Originally, the driver
was supposed to be here.

476
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,279
But I was afraid
he would be doubtful about the flight.

477
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:05,160
To avoid any slip-ups, I came instead.

478
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,279
As a cousin, it's not surprising
that you came to pick her up.

479
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:11,480
That's right.

480
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,600
Give it to me.

481
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:24,040
We'll leave.

482
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,759
What's going on?
Why did you pull on my coat?

483
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,016
By the way,

484
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,680
have you mentioned me to your family?

485
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,919
Not yet.

486
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Xiaodong advised me to keep it secret.

487
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,799
I didn't tell you
because I feared you would be mad. So...

488
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,799
Don't be angry.

489
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,839
Can I see you tomorrow?

490
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,120
No, my family is going
to visit the grave.

491
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,120
Many people will come.

492
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,200
I miss you so much.

493
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:29,439
How long has it been?

494
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,799
Can't remember.

495
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:36,399
Really? You can't remember?

496
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,719
Let's have a small talk.

497
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:47,000
It's more awkward if we don't talk.

498
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:53,839
I bought you some tonics.

499
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,640
Well, send it to my house.

500
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,272
Okay.

501
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,239
That's all?

502
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:08,600
Old address?

503
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:12,759
Yeah, you remember it?

504
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:13,960
Yeah.

505
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,000

Bye.

507
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:27,719
Why do I feel like
I'm having an affair with you?

508
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,120
But I'm your girlfriend.

509
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:39,960
Take it slow.

510
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:47,839

511
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,160
