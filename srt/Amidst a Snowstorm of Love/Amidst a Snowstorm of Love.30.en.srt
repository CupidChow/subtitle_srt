76
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,279

put themselves in other...

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,800

I'm not talking about it.

81
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,839
Lin Yiyang gets the trending topic.

82
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,399
I know. So as Xiaodong
and Jiang Yang, right?

83
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,599
Did you really see it? Did you see
his posts from burner account?

84
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,959
Burner account? I think he doesn't use
Weibo, does he have a burner account?

85
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,360
These were all dug up
by netizens after the game.

86
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,079
His fans wanted to go and comfort him,

87
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,639
but he doesn't even
have a Weibo account.

88
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,200
So they searched

89
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,120
and noticed us from Dongxin City
are following this account,

90
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,039
so they dug it out.

91
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,479
We have all followed
this burner account.

92
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,479
But there's nothing on it,

93
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,039
only has forwarded news and videos
about a female player's games.

94
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,356
(Forwarded Weibo)

95
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:20,044
(I love this couple.)

96
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:21,920
(Did he get her or not?)

97
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,159
You must be so happy.

98
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,599
No one would have thought

99
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,360
that the man
who is so popular on the court

100
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,920
would be like a little fan,

101
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,120
using his Weibo burner account

102
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,519
to keep forwarding your videos and news.

103
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,880
And he even saved screenshots
of your videos on Weibo.

104
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,079
No matter who,

105
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,760
would have been very moved.

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
But everyone still thinks

107
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,959
that this man has not yet succeeded
and is still struggling to pursue.

108
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,120
It's really enviable.

109
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,120
What did you say?

110
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,880
Nothing much.

111
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,839

112
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,479

letting our Chinese team take the lead,

113
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:17,599

who have been waiting.

120
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,079
I'll do it myself.

121
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,760
Don't move. Do you still
want to play in the future?

122
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,880

Yes, I usually use it to save stuff.

126
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,079
Some videos, news, things like that.

127
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,719
It's convenient to save things on Weibo.

128
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,759
I didn't tell you

129
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,599

132
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,119
I didn't think you'd save up my videos.

133
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:04,599
Of course. When I can't see you,
watching your videos makes me happy too.

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,440
Thank you for the gift
you gave me after the competition.

181
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,200
Not at all. I should do so anyway.

182
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
What do you mean?

183
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
The women's team
took the important gold medal

184
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,959
at a time when the men's team

185
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,920
was under the most pressure.

186
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,680
Alright, I'll accept this thanks
on behalf of everyone.

187
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,119
What else?

188
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,280
What?

189
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,640
Nothing else?

190
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,160
To celebrate the first time
we represented our country together.

191
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,759
This is indeed worth celebrating.

192
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,959
What else?

193
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,759
Anything else? Anything else?

194
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:40,800
Please enjoy.

195
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,560
Okay, thank you.

196
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,999
This is too sweet.

197
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,839
Too sweet?

198
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,560
I didn't expect it to be this sweet.

199
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,640
Then order a new one.

200
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,640
Never mind. I don't want to waste it.

201
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,719
It's okay. I'll drink it. You'd order.

202
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,599
Alright, you never let others
touch your stuff when you were a kid,

203
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,079
so it was all an act. You are not fair.

204
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,440
Now, you share a drink
with your girlfriend.

205
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,599
Don't you always eat food I don't like?

206
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:34,680
Is there a problem?

207
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,719
Fireworks.

208
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,239
We'd gather later, don't forget it.

209
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:53,520
So beautiful, there are even fireworks.

210
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:02,479
So beautiful, there are even fireworks.

211
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,279
Did the hotel do this?

212
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,039
So beautiful.

213
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,440
What's wrong?

214
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,479
You're not right, really.

215
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,840
It must be because it's too hot here.

216
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,759
I think it's over.

217
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,959
Let's go over,
your friend should have arrived.

218
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,360
Okay, but you have to promise me
not to drink too much.

219
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,680
What makes you think we'd drink?

220
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,559
I bet you would, we're all having fun.

221
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,559
We still have a few days,

222
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,680
don't knock yourself out
drinking on the first day,

223
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,519
and spend the next few days sober up.

224
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:44,600
Rest assured, not tonight.

225
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,400
Alright, let's go.

226
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,600
Wu Wei?

227
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,400
You are Zheng Yi?

228
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,640
Who else would you expect?

229
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,840
Why are you alone?

230
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,319
They said to have a lot of people?

231
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:29,160
They'll be here soon.

232
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,799
I'd like to have a drink alone first.

233
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,880
Do you want it?

234
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,400
Aren't we supposed to be drinking wine?

235
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,239
Yes.

236
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,999
I had a drink before I came.

237
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:43,440
You take a look.

238
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,440
Zheng Yi.

239
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:50,719
You're here.

240
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,319
Be careful.

241
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,479
You arrive early.

242
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,080
You look amazing today.

243
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,039
Lin Yiyang.

244
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,600
Zheng Yi.

245
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,959
Hello, alumnus.

246
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,512
Hello.

247
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:10,519
You got my best friend,

248
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,559
and I can't believe
I only met you today.

249
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:15,680
Alright, take a seat.

250
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,360
Lin Yiyang, sit down.
I have something to ask you.

251
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,120
When you first saw her comment
about you on her Moments

252
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,600
that you are not that handsome,
what did you think?

253
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,920
What are you doing?

254
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,880
Don't you want to know?

255
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,368
That question is really quite old.

256
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,959
Come on, I really want to know.

257
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:38,719
Don't you?

258
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,360
To be honest, nothing.

259
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,799
My first thought was

260
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:53,999
that you came to Hursin.

261
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,200
You'd get the point, amazing.

262
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,959
I can't believe you ever hated him.

263
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,680
No.

264
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,160
Girl, you are good.

265
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,959
Indeed, someone who could
win over our Duncuo is not ordinary.

266
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,880
No, I want to explain.

267
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,279
I was just joking at that time, really.

268
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,360
What?

269
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,240
What?

270
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,360
Let's order something.

271
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,239
Why did you ask that, Zheng Yi?

272
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,120
What's wrong?
I wanted to liven things up.

273
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,519
No one would do so.

274
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,080
Do you care I asked him that?

275
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,039
No, it made me embarrassed.

276
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,999
Tuning it for you took me a few minutes.

277
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:49,999
Annoying.

278
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,120
Don't be nervous.

279
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,840
What?

280
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,160
D-Didn't you say you don't know
how to play guitar?

281
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,279
Right, but he learned
from me for 70 days.

282
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,680

(I will protect you today.)

322
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:02,039
That's my home, my place.

323
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:29,479
There's a movie called The Truman Show.

324
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,080
Truman lives in a false world,

325
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,360
being watched by everyone every day.

326
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,120
Everyone knows his world
is a sham except himself.

327
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,719
Until one day,

328
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
a girl appeared in his world

329
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,840
and told him the truth,

330
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,840
letting him know
that his world is a sham.

331
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,024
I've been creating a false world
for myself for over a decade.

332
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:22,279
It looks nice
but that's not what I want.

333
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,959
Later, in my world,

334
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:34,920
a girl also appeared.

335
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,640
She brought me out.

336
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,360
When I first added you on Wechat,
I read your Moments

337
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,559
at the train station
for more than an hour.

338
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,880
In your Moments,

339
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,279
there's a lot of
my previous life and socials.

340
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,039
Thank you.

341
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,640
Thank you.

342
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:27,400
Actually, actually I haven't...

343
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,519
You've given me so much.

344
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:43,759
I've seen every one of your games
more than once.

345
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:53,519
It's you who helped me get over
the hurdle and get me back on the court.

346
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,759
It's you who gave me the courage
to return to reality.

347
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,920
That day, when you won the game,

348
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,160
you've crossed half the court
to hold my hand

349
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,680
and shared the joy of victory with me.

350
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,559
Do you know? What you gave me

351
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,479
not only joy,
but also a crazy love of a sport

352
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,519
and the pride
of being a king of the game.

353
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,680
These are things
I've lost and couldn't get back

354
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,959
for a long time.

355
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,479
Thank you.

356
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,239
Thank you.

357
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:34,759
You...

358
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,080
Yin Guo, I like you.

359
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:44,799
I love you.

360
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,400
I want to marry you.

361
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,080
You...

362
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,039

Be happy, Lin Yiyang.

371
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,999
I'm a terrible guitar player

372
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,400
and a terrible singer.

373
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:38,559
No.

374
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,239
I've been practicing all day, but...

375
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,479
It's good.
If I say it's good, it's good.

376
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,920
I really like it.

(Three years later)

382
00:34:27,596 --> 00:34:30,380
(Dongxin City Billiards Club)

383
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,600
I didn't retire to come back
to take over Dongxin City.

384
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,200
Everyone respects you
after so many years.

385
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,279
Why do you leave at this time?

386
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,759
I was called to take over temporarily.

387
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,680
Back then, Mr. He had just passed away,
and you had to undergo surgery.

388
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,799
Later, new management
and operation models were proposed,

389
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,959
I've been through
the first few tough years for you.

390
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,920
Now it's time for me to rest.

391
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,519
Now you said so.

392
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,719
I've worked much harder than you.

393
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:09,080
You know me.

394
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,999
I like to be free and easy.

395
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:21,719
Alright, but you have
to agree to one condition.

396
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,408
Say it.

397
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,920
Take care of my kid
for a winter vacation.

398
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,759
Otherwise, I'd be too busy.

399
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,080
Fine, okay.

400
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,440
Thanks, I appreciate it.

401
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:42,080
I want a teacher to learn billiards.

402
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,239
The one there, your son?

403
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,040
No, I'm his godfather.

404
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,640
Okay.

405
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,560
Yiyang, Yin Guo is still asleep?

406
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,399
Dealing with jet lag,
she probably just woke up.

407
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:54,000
Where's the kid?

408
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Practicing inside.

409
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,919
He's that little.
Don't you let him rest?

410
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,520
I asked him what he wants to do,
he said he just wants to practice.

411
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:05,680
I'll go check on him.

412
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,080
Little Stone.

413
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,279
Is he here? Has your brother come?

414
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,839
Yes, he's on the way for you.

415
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,600
I've been waiting for him.

416
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,000
You can't beat him anyway.

417
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,719
I've been growing and developing.

418
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,120
I'll win it all back when I grow up.

419
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:34,680
Then keep your voice down,
don't let my brother hear you.

420
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,160
He just said it to me on purpose.

421
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:45,839
Uncle Meng, I send you WeChat messages,
but you never replies.

422
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,799
If you want me to reply, beat me.

423
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:52,000
Sooner or later, it will happen.

424
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,719
If not for knowing
he's Jiang Yang's son,

425
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,560
I'd have thought Xiaodong
was his real dad.

426
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,120
Your turn.

427
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,680
Alright.

428
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,520
9-Ball in, awesome.

429
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,480
Yin Guo, have some coffee
to warm your hands.

430
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,000
Thank you.

431
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:36,319
My wife, gorgeous, huh?

432
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,960
Beautiful.

433
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,919
Take you to some nice food.

434
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:51,879
Then I'll call them both out.

435
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,759
Sun Zhou is here.

436
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:55,960
If they get hungry, he'll order
some pizza and pasta for them.

437
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,000
It's rare for Xiaodong to come,
keep me company.

438
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:07,839
If Jiang Yang knows it,

439
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:08,839
he'd be upset for his son.

440
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,399
We didn't have such conditions
when we were kids.

441
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,600
Let's go.

442
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,120
Bye.

443
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,120
Bye, boss.

444
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,560
- Bye bye.
- Good night.

445
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:46,680
Go inside.

446
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,919
Thank you.

447
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,359
Thank you.

448
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,040
Are you hungry?

449
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,200
No.

450
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,759
I'll buy you a milk tea to drink.

451
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:05,799
No, we're going to eat soon.

452
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,399
Where are we going now?

453
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,919
Now...

454
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:39,752

00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:43,040
