=Episode 11=

25
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,280
I was wondering how you managed
to stay at the top level.

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,520
So you've been secretly practicing here.

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,680
How is it a "secret"?

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,599
It's such a huge place
with so many people.

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,079
Here.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
Thanks.

31
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,080
Why did you take over
this billiard room?

32
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,239
I made that decision on a whim.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,760
Perhaps, I'm just used to it.

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,840
Sometimes, I may be too tired to train.

35
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,919
Just sitting here,

36
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,639
listening to the sound of cues
striking the balls

37
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,160
makes me feel at ease.

38
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,999
Want some?

39
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,079
I'll be chubby.

40
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,439
No, you won't. It's dark chocolate.

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,680
One bite?

42
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,119
You're stuffed?

43
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

44
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,320
Don't eat my leftovers.

45
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,959
(And he finished it.)

46
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,000
What's wrong?

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,064
(Even my parents
wouldn't eat my leftovers.)

48
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,040
What's on your mind?

49
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,839
I'm thinking about

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,720
the game.

51
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,119
I don't know the local players.

52
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,040
I don't know what to do.

53
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,959
There's nothing fancy about them.

54
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,519
I'll show you the way they play.

55
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,160
Really?

56
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,079
Of course, I was planning to come back

57
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,119
and practice with you this week.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,880
But I fell sick.

59
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,799
I know the local players.

60
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,239
You're so smart.

61
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,320
I bet you'll get it very fast.

62
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,239
Okay.

63
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:38,160
Yiyang, we ran out of water.
Can you put us some?

64
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, we're thirsty.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,760
Yiyang, should we call her
sister-in-law?

66
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,639
I'm Yin Guo. Just call me Yin Guo.

67
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,359
Hello, I'm Zhou Wei.

68
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,919
Hello, I'm Li Qing.

69
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,216
Nice to meet you.

70
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,359
So pretty.

71
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,840
Are you also here for the contest?

72
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,984
Yeah, I play the Nine-Ball.

73
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,320
Nine-Ball?

74
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,239
- I also play Nine-Ball.
- Really?

75
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,519
I'm Xie Yaoyao.

76
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,200
Me too.

77
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,592
This is Mr. Qian.
He also plays Nine-Ball.

78
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:06,720
Hi, how should I address you?

79
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,480
Yiyang is my coach.

80
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,239
I'm older than the others.

81
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,000
So they call me Mr. Qian.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,760
That will do.

83
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,680
Mr. Qian.

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,920
Sister-in-law, how did you know Yiyang?

85
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,320
Yeah.

86
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,399
I...I...

87
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,360
Tell us.

88
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,399
Let's play Nine-Ball.

89
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,560
Alright, I'll train a bit.

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,079
If you're available...

91
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,959
Don't you want water?

92
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,200
I filled it up. Come here.

93
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,772
(Storage)

94
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,399
- See you.
- See you.

95
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,639
- Bye.
- Bye.

96
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,599
- See you.
- See you.

97
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:42,440
Bye, sister-in-law.

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,839
Let's go.

99
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,719
Sis, here's your water.

100
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,440
Thank you.

101
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,479
Yiyang is very thrifty.

102
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,279
He always looks
for the chalk that's ending.

103
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,839
But he's putting new ones for you.

104
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Alright, I'll leave you
to train. Go ahead.

105
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,639
The Chinese female players
are the best in Nine-Ball.

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,959
When you play games at home,

107
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,440
you're facing the top players.

108
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,079
So don't be afraid of the local players.

109
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,760
They're the ones who should study you.

110
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,279
I know, but it's my first time here.
I just want to play it safe.

111
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,039
I'd prefer to know every contestant
to secure my victory.

112
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,560
Right, there's a senior player
Liu Xiran. Do you know her?

113
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,360
I heard she was from Dongxin City.

114
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
I know her.

115
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:45,920
She's back this year.

116
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,680
You'd better be careful.
She's highly experienced.

117
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't underestimate
your girlfriend, okay?

118
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,680
I know.

119
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,000
I've watched all your video clips.

120
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,039
Keep practicing.
I'll come back and pick you up.

121
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,680
Let's have something nice.
What would you like?

122
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,279
No need. Anything will do.

123
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:38,880
Aren't you hungry?

124
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,240
Just a little bit.

125
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,440
What's wrong?

126
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,560
I want to save you some money.

127
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,399
You're under financial pressure
in business.

128
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,880
Don't be silly.

129
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,839
We can't save money on food.

130
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,760
It's close by. Let's walk there.

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,680
Another dish?

132
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:32,719
I told you not to get
so many dishes. It's too much.

133
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,280
I can't finish my food.

134
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,560
Alright, leave the rest.

135
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,079
Have the lobster.

136
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,079
I'll have the rest.

137
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,479
You're eating my leftovers.
Don't you feel awkward?

138
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,359
Why would I? We're family.

139
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,520
You're just like my brother on that.

140
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,160
He can never finish his food.

141
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,680
I have a small appetite.

142
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,640
Didn't your little brother get adopted?

143
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,400
I kept him for two years before that.

144
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,079
He was in kindergarten
and I was in primary school.

145
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,160
He was such a nice kid.

146
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,040
They often gave out snacks
in the afternoon.

147
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:46,560
He would always keep
the nice things for me.

148
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,839
He would get a bag

149
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,599
and pack the snacks for me.

150
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,359
The teacher found out

151
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:57,839
that my brother never finished his food
and would always pack it for home

152
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,839
even though he needed to eat.

153
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,239
So he called his parents.

154
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,599
So you went there.

155
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,160
Who else did he have?

156
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,040
The teacher was startled
when he first saw me.

157
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:27,879
You must have missed him a lot
after the adoption.

158
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,560
There was no other way. Back then,

159
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,800
I couldn't support him.

160
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,400
Right, I have an interview
in the afternoon.

161
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,280
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

162
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,879
I'll walk around a bit and wait for you

163
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,200
in the billiard room once I'm tired.

164
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,999
Let me take you somewhere.

165
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,400
Wait for me there.

166
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,239
Okay.

167
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,759
Why are we here?
Aren't you going to the university?

168
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,280
I booked you a hotel room for tonight.

169
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,680
My place is tiny.

170
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,239
You didn't sleep well last night.

171
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,440
That's not true. I slept just fine.

172
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,479
No need. It's such a waste.

173
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,440
- Let's go.
- I've paid.

174
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,879
It's under your name.

175
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,800
You check in on your own, okay?

176
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,999
Okay, but no need...

177
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,079
I'll pick you up at seven.

178
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,040
Wait for me.

179
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,640
Is everyone from your billiard club?

180
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,800
Not really.

181
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,359
We're not a developed billiard room.

182
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,599
Yiyang doesn't draw
a percentage of our prize money.

183
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,719
It's our second home.

184
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,160
He's a free coach for us.

185
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,359
So it's profiting from
the external business?

186
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,839
Yeah, from the tenants
of the youth hostels

187
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,040
and some amateurs nearby.

188
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,520
But few and few people
are interested in billiards nowadays.

189
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,040
Ever since he took over this place,

190
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,879
he's been losing money every month.

191
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:53,079
That's the situation.

192
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,200
(You didn't sleep enough. Take a nap.)

193
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,560
I was still talking and you took off.

194
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,160
Can we go Dutch?

195
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,959
I can't make you pay for everything.

196
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,800
Can we go Dutch?

197
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,599
I can't make you pay for everything.

198
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,599
The society values gender equality.

199
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,800
You're giving me pressure.

200
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,200
You're just a student.

201
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,640
And Sun Zhou told me that

202
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:46,160
you've been digging into your pocket
for the billiard room.

203
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:53,680
You've been digging into your pocket
for the billiard room.

204
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,400
(Do you regret dating a poor student?)

205
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,400
(Are you serious?)

206
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,119
I've been a poor student too.

207
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,759
I only managed to win prize money

208
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,959
because of my occupation.

209
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,959
Otherwise, I'd be a poor student, too.

210
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,359
I've been a poor student too.

211
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,879
I only managed to win prize money

212
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,079

213
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,079

I hate to leave you alone.

Why do you smell so nice?

260
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,712
I had a shower before I went to sleep.

261
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Didn't you...

262
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,840
(You're a grown man. Don't you know)

263
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,200

264
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,160

265
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,440
Not telling me?

266
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,400
Didn't you...

267
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,920
Why are you smiling?

268
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,719
What did you do

269
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,319
to be so pretty?

270
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,239
Sweet-talker.

271
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,959
Tell me, did you have many admirers?

272
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,239
Xiaodong had many disciples
in my secondary school

273
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,880
and forbade them from pursuing me.

274
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:26,239
So most of them
didn't even dare to talk to me.

275
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
I guess I have to thank him for that.

276
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,799
There was only once

277
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,999
that I got scolded for nothing.

278
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:43,600
An international student had my name

279
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,096
written on the back of his uniform.

280
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,959
I had no idea about it.

281
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,352
But the teacher called me there

282
00:21:49,928 --> 00:21:51,976
and asked to see my parents for that.

283
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,400
My brother went there.

284
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,039
He looked at the group photo
of our class and said,

285
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,360
"He doesn't stand a chance."

286
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,632
"My sister has no taste."

287
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,799
"She only likes good-looking guys."

288
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,319
Thankfully, I look fine.

289
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,008
Or I may not win you over.

290
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,840
So narcissistic.

291
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,519
You know, I'm from
the Seventh Secondary School.

292
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,680
Really?

293
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,880
It's only five minutes' walk
from our school.

294
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,279
Tell me more. I'm curious.

295
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,160
About what?

296
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,319
Your past.

297
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,360
I told you.

298
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
Feel free to ask me anything.

299
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,239
I'll answer as much

300
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,440
as I remember.

301
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,400
My parents passed away together.

302
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:02,759
On a business trip,

303
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,559
a car accident happened on the freeway.

304
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
They worked in two departments
of the same company.

305
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,360
My mom would usually stay home
with me and my brother.

306
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,440
But that day,

307
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,880
she decided to go with my dad.

308
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,432
Since you're talking about it,
you've let it go, right?

309
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,640
What else?

310
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,719
Nothing. No more questions.

311
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,559
I was sleeping.

312
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,288
You woke me up. I'm still sleepy.

313
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:10,959
Let me carry you to the bed.

314
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,039
Compass.

315
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,400
Yeah.

316
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,719
Why are you wearing this?

317
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,799
I was lost after I graduated
from the university.

318
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,640
(I didn't know what I should do.)

319
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,400
(I traveled to an island,)

320
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,920
(passed by a necklace store,)

321
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,680
(and saw this.)

322
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,200
Then why doesn't it have a needle?

323
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,360
Because there's no direction.

324
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,840
I talked to the craftsman.

325
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,440
He said that

326
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,519
once I found the direction,

327
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,680
I could install the needle.

328
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:39,559
Your phone is ringing.

329
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,600

332
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:53,039
Stay put. Let me see.

333
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,759
It's yours. Stop lying.

334
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,120
Talk.

335
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,959
Your PhD application is almost approved.

336
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,559
I changed my mind.

337
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,200
Why? What's wrong?

338
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,559
It's a great opportunity.

339
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,279
It's a pity to give up on it.

340
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,519
Did anything happen to you?

341
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,039
I never decided on it.

342
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,680
That's it. My girlfriend is here.

343

Why are you changing your mind?

344
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,959
Like I said, I never decided on it.

345
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,239
Are you planning to go back for me?

346
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
How do you know?

347
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,719
Don't be impulsive. It's serious.

348
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,799
I know.

349
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,400

So I contacted him when you were asleep

406
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,039
to take the shift tonight.

407
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:31,440
