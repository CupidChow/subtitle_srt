No need, I'm used to being
in a wheelchair.

27
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,520
Alright.

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,239
Just stop here.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Happy?
The most cherished student has returned.

30
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,279
Come on. I'm not a cherished one?

31
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,879
He's being jealous.

32
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,800
You know what?

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,160
The youngest one
is always the most favored.

34
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,679
Alright, go inside. Come on.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,120
To my surprise, you got a perfect score.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,879
Mrs. He, let me help.

37
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,120
You sit and chat.

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,919
Yeah, you don't need to help.

39
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,160
You stay at home tonight.

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
Your room has already been cleaned up.

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,999
It's the one you often slept in
when you were little.

42
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:55,848
Okay.

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,679
Come on. Let's eat
in the courtyard, okay?

44
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,359
My dad is happy.

45
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,040
You take that table out later.

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,656
Okay.

47
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,096
Mom.

48
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,079
This is my first championship trophy.

49
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:30,840
Yes, it's a pity
you don't have many trophies.

50
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,120
You didn't join many games
before you retired.

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,919
If you persisted like Jiang Yang,

52
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,680
you might have needed
to buy a cabinet for your trophies.

53
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:47,919
- Drink.
- Drink.

54
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,960
Come on.

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,639
Take a look.

56
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,999
Here is the soup.

57
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,320
You're all there. I'm so sad.

58
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,600
Have a reunion dinner without me?

59
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,359
Right, we ate it for you.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,320
Mrs. He made many good dishes.

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,359
You're driving me crazy
on purpose, right?

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,760
Guo, come here.

63
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:10,880
Put Mr. He on the phone.

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,799
- Okay.
- Guo, come here.

65
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,160
What's up, Lin Lin?

66
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,239
Let me drink with you.

67
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,000
Mr. He, someone wants to see you.

68
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,160
Hello.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,959
Mr. He.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,480
Do you remember this girl?

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,799
She went to the competition
with Meng Xiaodong when she was a child.

72
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,239
I can't remember clearly.

73
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:43,560
With Xiaodong? So, she's a child
of the Meng family, right?

74
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes, she is Meng Xiaodong's cousin,
Yin Guo.

75
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,119
Hello.

76
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,519
How are you, Mr. He? I am Yin Guo.

77
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,839
Your cousin performed well

78
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,480
on the field. Say hello to him for me.

79
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,760
Alright, I will.

80
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,720
Mr. He, how's your health?

81
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,399
My mom has been asking about you.

82
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,239
Thanks for asking.
I'm in good health. And your mom is...?

83
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,959
Ms. Wu from the Sports Bureau.

84
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,079
Wu Qian?

85
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,639
Yes.

86
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,679
Wu Qian is your mom?

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,320
Your mom is a very nice person.

88
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
She works hard.

89
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,959
I worked with her
when she just acted as a referee.

90
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,239
Your mom worked so hard.

91
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,320
She was career-oriented.

92
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,519
So as her daughter,
you should be more considerate.

93
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:49,919
I will. I've been used to it.

94
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,040
Take care, please

95
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,799
I will visit you
with my mom if possible.

96
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,560
Okay, thank you.

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,519
Mr. He, we have to go to training now.

98
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,359
Okay, go ahead.

99
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:08,440
Train hard and bring honor
to our country. Bye.

100
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,719
Look how nervous you are.

101
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,159
That's Mr. He.

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,159
You have met his coach.

103
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,959
How could you not tell me in advance?

104
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,240
So, I didn't tell Mr. He who you are.

105
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,240
But I wonder what Lin Yiyang will say.

106
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
Who knows?

107
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:36,360
The girl you just talked to
is my girlfriend.

108
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,479
I didn't know she was on the line.

109
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,560
So, I wasn't prepared mentally.

110
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,839
Your girlfriend?

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,839
Good news.

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,719
I can tell she's a good girl.

113
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,519
She's a Nine-Ball player. Remember?
She just won the championship.

114
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:02,959
Nine-Ball...

115
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,639
It was the month when Yiyang came back.

116
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
I watched that competition.

117
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,479
She was impressive.

118
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,200
I forgot.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,800
Did I say anything wrong just now?

120
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,479
No worries. You're a good grandpa.

121
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,599
You behaved well.

122
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,800
Good.

123
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,639
Yiyang, I have to say something.

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,440
Go ahead, Mrs. He. I'm listening.

125
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,399
Just tell me what you want to say.

126
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,240
Now you have a girlfriend.

127
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:51,240
I don't know what stage you're at
in your relationship now.

128
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,560
But you'll have to
meet each other's parents someday.

129
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,639
You have no parents. How about
your coach and I meet her parents?

130
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,519
Now is the right time.
Yiyang is a serious man.

131
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,519
I think his girlfriend is the same.

132
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,800
Since the two of you are
in a romantic relationship,

133
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,079
we should interact more with her family.

134
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,039
Exactly. You invite your girlfriend over
for a meal.

135
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,159
Remember to invite Wu Qian too.

136
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah.

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,839
I remember she greeted you
during the Chinese New Year.

138
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,839
But you declined her visit.

139
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,399
Let's invite her over now.

140
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,479
Yes, let's invite Wu Qian over.

141
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:56,440
Actually, we haven't told her parents
about our relationship.

142
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,880
Really?

143
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,639
Yeah.

144
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,920
Why not?

145
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,240
Are you afraid they will disturb you?

146
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,800
Her family doesn't like me

147
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,839
due to my retirement.

148
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,440
Who hasn't been reckless in their youth?

149
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,959
It's all in the past. Take it slow.

150
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,399
That's true.
Yiyang, you just made a comeback.

151
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,320
I believe that over time,
they will see you differently.

152
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,440
Time will tell if you're reliable.

153
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,440
Don't worry about it. Let's drink.

154
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
Come on.

155
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Cheers. Drink up.

156
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,200
You got a girlfriend, congrats.

157
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:55,560
Come on.

158
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,079
Yiyang, everything will be fine. Cheers.

You wanna call Wu Qian?

161
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,800
Yiyang has his plans.

162
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,279
You can't publicize it.

163
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,399
I know.

Excuse me, I need to take a call.

Okay.

168
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,560
Hello, Mr. He.

169
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,640
Wu, I'm calling you
for nothing important.

170
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,640
When I watched the snooker match,
I thought of you.

171
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,359
Mr. He, I also thought of you.

172
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,759
I planned to visit you

173
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,119

174
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,239
Thank you for thinking of me.

175
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:03,560
Wu, you're welcome to my home anytime.

176
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:07,440
Mr. He, are you sure
you don't need me for anything?

177
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,879
If there's anything I can do for you,
just let me know.

178
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,879
Well, here's one thing.

179
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,879
Have you seen the results?

180
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,719
Yes, I have.
You have two excellent students.

181
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,839
Indeed. Yiyang is very impressive.

182
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,239
He's changed.

183
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:32,200
He's grown up
and become mature and calm.

184
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,959
He made a mistake in the past.

185
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,040
Please be more forgiving towards him.

186
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,239
Mr. He, if you're worried

187
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:44,520
that I'll give him a hard time
on the field because of the past,

188
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,640
I promise that will never happen.

189
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,040
I believe in you.

190
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,680
Anyway, Wu, I know about you.

191
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,879
You were there when I started my career.

192
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,440
I didn't give up
because of your support.

193
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,119
You know me very well.

194
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:09,520
Yes. Wu, no matter how old you are,

195
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,079
in my eyes,
you're always a kind-hearted girl.

196
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:17,599
Mr. He, only you see me
as a little girl.

197
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,879
Actually, I just want

198
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,239
to give Yiyang a chance to start over.

199
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,359
Who doesn't make mistakes?
It's all in the past.

200
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,839
I've left the association.

201
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,200
As his elder, I wish him well.

202
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,160
I hope he can train hard,
enjoy his game, and live well.

203
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,680
Wu, you're a leader
in the Sports Bureau.

204
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,959
You should take more care of him.

205
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,119
He's a good kid. I know him very well.

206
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,119
Mr. He, rest assured,
as long as he's a good athlete,

207
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,400
we won't have any prejudice.

208
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,839
The past is already the past.

209
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,839
He's young and talented.

210
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,359
I'm optimistic about his future.

211
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,560
Wu, I'm glad to hear that.

212
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,640
Alright, I won't disturb you.
You do your things.

213
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,040
Let's get together another day.

214
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,280
Sure. Take care, Mr. He. Bye.

215
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,959
Alright. Goodbye.

216
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,160
Mr. He called me for his student.

217
00:13:55,119 --> 00:14:00,119
Lin Yiyang, right?
He's now the most popular player.

218
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,599
His performance is good,
and he's become steadier than before.

219
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,759
I've seen his post-game interviews.

220
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,839
He had a point.

221
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,879
Mr. He called you too early.

222
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,239
So many people have high hopes
for him now.

223
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,680
If he wins the championship,

224
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,160
Mr. He will get many calls
to congratulate him.

225
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,959
I hope he can win.

226
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,280
140.

227
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,239
It's only been five days.

228
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:06,440
Lin Yiyang has scored another 147,
a perfect break.

229
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,680
Yes, returning to the local competition
for the first year,

230
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,719
(Live Snooker China Open)
he's breaking records with good results.

231
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:17,680
Also, Jiang Yang
is advancing victoriously,

232
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,640
leading new Chinese players
to achieve the best results

233
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,280
(Jiang Yang)
in the open competition.

234
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,239
At the home ground,
he presented spectacular moments

235
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,599
for the Chinese audience.

236
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,144
(1/32 Li Qingyan)

237
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,036
(1/32 Lin Yiyang)

238
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:37,256
(1/16 Li Qingyan)

239
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:40,808
(1/16 Lin Yiyang)

240
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:43,976
(1/16 Jiang Yang)

241
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:45,800
(1/8 Li Qingyan)

242
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:47,080
(1/8 Jiang Yang)

243
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,792
(1/8 Lin Yiyang)

244
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,400
Guo.

245
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,359
Lin Lin.

246
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,160
See? He made it to the finals.

247
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,200
I know.

248
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,759
Fantastic.

249
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,768
Look how excited you are.

250
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,359
That's great.

251
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,520
People are watching.

252
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
There's no one around,
and even if someone sees,

253
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,079
it's normal to see me with you.
After all, you're my coach.

254
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,599
Yes, it's my honor to be your coach.

255
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,239
By the way, there's a pep meeting
tomorrow afternoon.

256
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,719
Tomorrow afternoon?
But he'll be in his final.

257
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,928
Yes.

258
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,879
I missed his semi-final,
and now I'm going to miss his final.

259
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,719
He's already back.
You will watch his matches more often.

260
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:54,119
Besides, it's his turn
to watch you win the championship.

261
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,839
I can't say for sure that I'll win.

262
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,839
But I'll give it my all
to win the first place.

263
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:03,599
Good.

264
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,368
Hello, dear audience

265
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,879
and online viewers,

266
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:22,640
welcome
to watch the Snooker China Open finals.

267
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,680
Now,

268
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,400
the Chinese player Lin Yiyang enters.

269
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,584
Come on.

270
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,900
(Live Snooker China Open)

271
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:29,100
(2023 Hel 9-Ball Open Pre-Game Rally)

272
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,999
Quiet, please.
Welcome Deputy Director Wu.

273
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,680
Hello, everyone.

274
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,079
I hold this pre-game pep meeting

275
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,879
on behalf of the Sports Bureau.

276
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Nine-ball game is our strong point,
but do not be complacent.

277
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,479
(Okay, now, it's a tie-breaker.)

278
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,999
(Every point is critical.)

279
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,559
(Garroselvin is down by 30 points.)

280
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,759
(His points are not enough.)

281
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,799
(He needs a snooker)

282
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,279
(to overtake.)

283
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,719
(Garroselvin excels at playing a snooker.)

284
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,999
It's tough.

285
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,239
(Lin Yiyang has escaped the yellow ball.)

286
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,640
(So, Garroselvin has to continue.)

287
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,999
(He successfully blocked the yellow ball
with the black one.)

288
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,559
It will not be an issue for Lin Yiyang.

289
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,319
(This snooker shot is difficult.)

290
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,239
(Yes, he looks very careful.)

291
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,519
(I wonder what he will do.)

292
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,840
(Garroselvin's defensive play is good.)

293
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,880
(Lin Yiyang is struggling
to escape from the snooker.)

294
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,759
(But he hasn't had the chance
to go on the offensive.)

295
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:32,319
(Garroselvin has made seven attempts
in a row without success.)

296
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,680
(Lin Yiyang has responded
to his opponent with composure.)

297
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,319
(He did it and played one shot.)

298
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,160
(Under great pressure,)

299
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
(he played such a high-quality snooker.)

300
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,360
(Touching ball.)

301
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,880
(Yes. Seems like
Garroselvin always faces difficult shots)

302
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,559
(in this open competition.)

303
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,279
(And even in the final,)

304
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,479
(he still has to face a tough situation.)

305
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,959
(Garroselvin is feeling helpless now.)

Congratulations
to the Chinese player Lin Yiyang.

324
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,440
Finally.

325
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,360
They did it.

326
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:09,896
Here.

327
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,400
Great.

328
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:23,200
I hope you can play in your own way

329
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,319
with good results. I'll look forward
to your triumphant return. Go for it.

330
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,600
Okay, you'll be heading to the airport.

331
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,999
I won't take up your time.

332
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,640
Thanks for the encouragement. Dismissed.

333
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,292
(WeChat)

334
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,519
(Miss you.)

335
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,920
Lin Yiyang just won the championship.

336
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,160
Good for him.

337
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,479
Really?

338
00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:45,559
I haven't received the news.

339
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,560
Check the news on your phone.

340
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,400
It's all about him.

341
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,559
Champion, why are you sitting alone?

342
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,120
Tired,

343
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,759
Don't you call your girlfriend?

344
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,479
She has a pep rally this afternoon.

345
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,479
You're the champion,
and she is the Rookie of the Year

346
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,360
going for the championship.

347
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,279
You two are a perfect match.

348
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,920
(I didn't expect you to win.)

349
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,880
(You are the best. It's like a dream.)

350
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:53,999
(I'm so happy for you.)

351
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Yiyang.

352
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

353
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,999
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

354
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:04,759
Yiyang.

355
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,319
Yiyang.

356
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,640
Yiyang.

357
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,368
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

358
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,680
Congratulations, Duncuo.

359
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:16,719
Take it back for me.

360
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,080
He won his first national championship

361
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,600
at 13. Feels like he never changed.

362
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,200
He went over the stand,
took off the vest,

363
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,719
and walked through the court,

364
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,880
wearing a shirt and ill-fitting pants.

365
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,400
Lin Yiyang has finally come back,
completely.

366
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,440
Guo.

367
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,479
You are in a secret relationship.

368
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:09,840
We're keeping it a secret for you.

369
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,360
Just don't give yourself away.

370
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,360
Is it better now like this?

371
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,239
What should I do?
I can't go out like this.

372
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,799
Wait a moment.

373
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,640
Put it on.

374
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,319
It works?

375
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,920
Yeah, give it a try.

376
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,120
Okay?

377
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,344
Okay.

378
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:46,880
Come on.

379
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,440
I gotta go, coach.

380
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,640
Get in.

381
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:58,920
Thank you.

382
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,999
Come on.

383
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,600
We're leaving.

384
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,440
Come on.

385
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,880
Here you are.

386
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,559
What's the matter?

387
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,200
If you agree,
it will be settled quickly.

388
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,479
Otherwise, I'll have to waste my breath.

389
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,559
Forget it.

390
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,799
That's it?

391
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:10,039
We both have different plans.

392
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,799
Tell me about your plan.

393
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,959
I plan to open a billiards club,

394
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,959
just like the one at Helsin,
not for competitions.

395
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:22,959
It's to foster the public's interest.

396
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:25,799
Snooker, after all, is a niche sport.

397
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:29,239
With a small base,
I'll start by building the foundation.

398
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,840
And clubs like Dongxin City and Bei City

399
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,279
mainly focus on training professionals.

400
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,799
It's different from what I want to do.

401
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,999
Our coach and I will support you.

402
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,600
I can't take risks with Dongxin City.

403
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,200
And Dongxin City has a huge business.

404
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,640
So many coaches won't work with me.

405
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,400
Alright, I'm done. I gotta go.

406
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,759
Not even giving me a chance
for a rebuttal?

407
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,479
You'll have a lot to say.
It's a waste of time.

408
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,440
By the way, I'm going to go have a date.

409
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,400
During the off-season,
I don't need the cue stick.

410
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,640
Hold it for me until I return.

411
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,600
He looks so cool.

412
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,360
Guo, do you want something to drink?

413
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,680
No, thanks.

414
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,160
Okay, please watch our luggage for us.

415
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,039
Alright, go ahead.

416
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:22,600
Let's go.

417
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,880
(Your boyfriend is awesome.
It's all about his news.)

418
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,479
Why are you wearing a hat?

419
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:50,840
Shocked?

420
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,039
What are you doing here?

421
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,519
I'll take you to the match
and swing by the billiard room.

422
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,959
And I'll do something else.

423
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,799
Sit down. Don't let others see you.

424
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:15,319
Come on.

425
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:16,559
Why?

426
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:19,519
Many peers will be on this flight.

427
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,360
They are going to the Nine-Ball Open.

428
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,680
You just won the game today,
and it's trending news.

429
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,239
Don't let others see you. Put it on.

430
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,519
Come on.

431
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,479
Right, my mom told me

432
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,200
Mr. He gave her many calls for you.

433
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,519
My coach was very happy
when he learned about our relationship.

434
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,640
He asked me to invite you over.

435
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:04,440
To your coach's home?

436
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,640
Yes, it's convenient for him.

437
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
After all, he's too old to move around.

438
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,319
No, that's not what I mean. I...

439
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,959
Since I started practicing at 10,

440
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,920
I've heard a lot about your coach.

441
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,200
I never thought
that one day I could meet him.

442
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,680
You are his student's girlfriend.

443
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,799
It's proper to meet him.

444
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:43,759
I know. But you know what?

445
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,080
Before I knew you, I thought

446
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,279
Mr. He's students were all much older
than me.

447
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:52,999
Even the youngest Jiang Yang
is six years older than Xiaodong.

448
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,920
I never thought
Mr. He had a student like you.

449
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,039
I'm indeed his student.

450
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:05,200
But I don't think
I'm too much older than you.

451
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,359
Nice try.

452
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:15,200
Your coach is coming.

453
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,040
Is he your company?

454
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,439
He will accompany me

455
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,359
and go to see his old friends.

456
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,719
He's good.
Right after winning the championship,

457
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,000
he directly came here for you.

458
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,399
Don't they have a celebration party?

459
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,879
I don't know.

460
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:17,960
When you two met,
you're better than him, right?

461
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:22,399
How did you know
he would have a promising future?

462
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,879
Maybe I fell for his appearance.

463
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,799
It's him.

464
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:47,439
Hello, Yiyang.

465
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,319
Go ahead.

466
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:58,088
Let's go.

467
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:00,808
Take care of your stuff.

468
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,520
Where's your suitcase?

469
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,319
I'll go get it.

470
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:06,120
No need to take them to say hi to me.

471
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:09,480
Why not? Our team respects coaches

472
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,632
and seniors. Let's go.

473
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,560
You guys go first. I'll join you later.

474
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:18,319
Aren't you coming with us?

475
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:20,960
Guo is shy and afraid of being seen.

476
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,120
I'll walk alone behind you guys.

477
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,080
Okay, I'm off.

478
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,719
Okay.

479
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,160
Sorry, someone in the restroom.

480
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,879
I'll wait a moment.

481
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,879
Lin Yiyang is up ahead. He's handsome.

482
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:49,399
He's better than his pictures.

483
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:51,799
Really? Can I take a photo with him?

484
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:54,719
I don't think so,
but an autograph should be fine.

485
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,960
I tried, but he just refused me.

486
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,359
I guess he doesn't want to take a photo.

487
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,359
What a pity.

488
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,520
Someone in the restroom?

489
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,359
I hear the attendant talking about you.

490
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,239
I hear you don't like to take photos.

491
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,399
How about an autograph?
Right here, okay?

492
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,520
I'm going to kiss you.

493
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:33,064
Be careful.

494
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,799
I even forgot to go to the restroom.

495
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:09,200
Hello, would you like something
to drink?

496
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,239
No, thank you.

497
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,759
Ma'am, would you like something
to drink?

498
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,520
Why are you still up?

499
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,839
I'm not sleepy.

500
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,200
I won the match for you.

501
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,000
Little queen.

502
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:22,719
You actually remember?

503
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:24,640
Of course.

504
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:33,759
I remember when a girl
won her first professional match,

505
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:37,839
she ran to the stands
with all eyes on her.

506
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,080
Regardless of the live camera
and what the future holds,

507
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,960
she took a spectator's hand,

508
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:53,000
hoping to share his most precious thing

509
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:59,439
and the most glorious moment
with that spectator.

510
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,000
The spectator always remembers.

511
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,600
My heart is beating a bit fast.

512
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:29,439
Are you moved?

513
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:32,480
I have always been moved by you.

514
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,480
My world champion.

515
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:50,359
Yes?

516
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,399
We are about to arrive
at the place where we met.

517
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,799
This time, I'll win the championship.
