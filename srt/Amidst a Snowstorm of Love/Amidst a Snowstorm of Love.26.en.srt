=Episode 26=

25
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,999
One or two days later, I guess.

26
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,799
This is not enough.

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,239
Follow this schedule.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,879
It's already 1 AM.

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,559
Well,

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,200
that's all for now.

31
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,239
Well,

32
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,120
about the food pricing

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,680
and the next season's

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,399
training plans,

35
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,960
I'll reply to that tomorrow.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,800
You guys go back and get some rest.

37
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:24,840
See you

38
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,360
tomorrow.

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,919
We must be patient.

40
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,639
Yiyang just took it over.

41
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:32,919
Let's give him some time

42
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,840
to know more about it.

43
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,999
No need to finish it all today.

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,279
But we have to

45
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,200
go through these files.

46
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,160
Jiang Yang is hospitalized.

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,480
So, many files need

48
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,760
to be signed now.

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,720
They're piled up.

50
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,200
You'll have to read them.

51
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,376
I will.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,080
That's all.

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,599
Without reading the files,

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,879
it will be pointless.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,080
Meeting adjourned.

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,576
Okay.

57
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,720
Alright. You guys rest early.

58
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,544
Okay.

59
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:58,879
Head back early.

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,400
2 PM tomorrow,

61
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,200
I will meet with each group's leader.

62
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:07,480
Thank you all.

63
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,744
See you.

64
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,280
I'm off.

65
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,880
Okay, take care.

66
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,368
Take care.

67
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,079
Take care.

68
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,808
Take care.

69
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,880
Are you making fun of me?

70
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,079
No.

71
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,320
I'm worried about you.

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,999
What else can I do?

73
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
It's serious business.

74
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,616
I must deal with it.

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,919
After I take a shower,

76
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
let's have a brief meeting.

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,240
Are you serious?

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,680
Of course.

79
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,999
How did you get here?

80
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:55,799
By bike.

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,639
Arrange a car for me.

82
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,952
No need.

83
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,320
It's not safe late at night.

84
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,719
You do it.

85
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,760
Okay.

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,079
Your room was just renovated.

87
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
The water heater doesn't work.

88
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,160
Well, I can at least wash my face.

89
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
See you in the billiard room.

90
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,368
The meeting room is stuffy.

91
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,200
Look.

92
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,359
When it was renovated,

93
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:01,560
Jiang Yang didn't

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,679
repaint it.

95
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:03,560
Previously,

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,560
we engraved our names on it

97
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,280
when we won.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,919
During the day,

99
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
you'll see it more clearly.

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,440
Who called you back?

101
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,560
Wu Wei.

102
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,679
He told me we would

103
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,320
have a meeting

104
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,799
and asked where I was.

105
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Come on.

106
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,519
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

107
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,519
The gas is costly.

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,200
Here he is.

109
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,440
I just took it over.

110
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,720
I don't want big changes.

111
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,760
I have a few plans.

112
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,760
I'll tell you guys.

113
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,000
And we discuss it.

114
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,919
First, starting today,

115
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,839
the snooker group
will have 30 spots each year

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,799
for closed training in the UK.

117
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,239
That's the home of this sport.

118
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,000
Its cultural atmosphere

119
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,239
and training

120
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,799
are cutting-edge.

121
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,480
Star players trained

122
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,560
at their own expense before.

123
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,839
Starting now,

124
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,560
I want

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,479
to take this as a benefit

126
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,959
and promote it.

127
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,120
Got it.

128
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,719
It costs money.

129
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,440
Second,

130
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,959
I want to host a new event

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
starting in this city.

132
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
It still costs money.

133
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,479
You got a point.

134
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,000
Duncuo.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,719
Hosting a competition

136
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,399
is no small matter.

137
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,920
Sponsors often withdraw their funds

138
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,920
or even disappear

139
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:37,880
before the competition.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,079
Since you want to host it,

141
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:40,839
I know

142
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,200
you will keep doing it.

143
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,880
You want

144
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,279
to expand the influence
of this industry.

145
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,920
Indeed, it's a good idea

146
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,760
to attract people.

147
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,039
But at the same time, you need

148
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,440
to consider the risk
of the funding pulling.

149
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,839
In other words,

150
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,360
it will cost our own money.

151
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,800
So, at least we need

152
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,560
to get money

153
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,519
for a rainy day.

154
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,519
Since it's all understood,

155
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,120
I'll go to the third plan.

156
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
I'll systematically

157
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,839
create star players

158
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,240
and star coaches.

159
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,479
For example,

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,479
Xin, coach Xin.

161
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,279
He really needs to be promoted.

162
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,560
He graduated from elementary school.

163
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,079
He used to be a farmer,

164
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,959
a miner, and a small store owner.

165
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,800
He systematically

166
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,839
learned billiards at 22.

167
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,639
But among his students,

168
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,320
one ranked second in the world

169
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,479
and won three tournaments

170
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,519
within a year.

171
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,959
That's Lin Lin.

172
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,440
And your junior.

173
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,399
She ranked first in the world, right?

174
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,440
My coach

175
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,719
indeed has a knack for teaching.

176
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,839
His personal best

177
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,320
is a national champion,

178
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,200
but it doesn't mean

179
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,440
he can have excellent students.

180
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,880
I'm afraid

181
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,279
that some coaches don't want
to be promoted.

182
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,760
The talent

183
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,240
deserves to be promoted

184
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,839
and known by more people.

185
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,959
This can motivate more people.

186
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,560
If we need people

187
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,680
to pay attention to our project,

188
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,839
we need to share legendary stories.

189
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,639
In this way will
many teenagers get interested

190
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,079
and join us.

191
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:16,880
I know

192
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:19,680
it's a long way to go.

193
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360
And we must do it step by step.

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,279
But perhaps after decades,

195
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:26,880
billiards may

196
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
become as popular

197
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,639
as other sports.

198
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,479
Our club is willing

199
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,519
to contribute to this industry

200
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,959
without seeking profit.

201
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,560
Why did you stop?

202
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,120
I've finished.

203
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,719
You don't get it?

204
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,920
It is very simple.

205
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,360
It still costs money.

206
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,159
Buddy, who will
promote your people for free?

207
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,839
It will cost a fortune.

208
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,760
Some players and coaches

209
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,079
could be famous in this circle,

210
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,279
but others didn't know them.

211
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,880
Now, it's lucky

212
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,760
to have a famous player

213
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,440
outside this circle.

214
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,760
In a word, they are money-burning
plans for the next three years.

215
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,639
But where do we get the money?

216
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,128
Check your phone.

217
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,079
You guys will get a competition plan.

218
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,928
Each has a different plan.

219
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
Take a close look at the games

220
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:56,839
at home and abroad.

221
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,560
I know some of them you
didn't participate in before.

222
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,719
But, many event organizers
hold new competitions.

223
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,560
To attract well-known players,

224
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,440
the bonus is high.

225
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,000
But they don't count

226
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,800
for world ranking points.

227
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,760
You guys work hard

228
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,719
and join more games.

229
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,824
More games, more money.

230
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,279
Don't look at me.

231
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,279
My schedule is tighter.

232
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,920
I was worried just now
that you had a hard time

233
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,879
in the meeting room.

234
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:33,959
Why did I wait for you for a year?

235
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Turns out you're a troublemaker.

236
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,320
He's a game troublemaker.

237
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,119
I'm fine.

238
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,320
Just for fun.

239
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,800
Glad to earn some money.

240
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,320
But,

241
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,440
I have retired.

242
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,119
So what?

243
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,400
We make money, and you enjoy it?

244
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:19,280
Wu Wei, get me one.

245
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,920
(My Grandma invites you)

246
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,119
(over for dinner this weekend.)

247
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,640
(Will he think)

248
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
(I am forcing him to marry me?)

249
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,479
(I just chatted with my Grandma.)

250
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,119
(She praised you.)

251
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,719
(I guess she was just saying.)

252
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,800
(Grandma heard)

253
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,599
(that you took care of Xiaotian in Hel,)

254
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,800
(so, she wanted to thank you.)

255
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,999
(Don't overthink it.)

256
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,400
(If you don't want to come,)

257
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,879
(I'll let my Grandma know tomorrow.)

258
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,239
(It's alright.)

259
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,560
(Let's go over this weekend.)

260
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,479
(Saturday, Sunday,)

261
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,680
(or Friday night works.)

262
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,359
(I'm available.)

263
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,079
(Any time is fine.)

264
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,560
That's all.

265
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,200
Anything else?

266
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,920
You called us here

267
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:08,959
for a meeting.

268
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,680
Here's one thing.

269
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,080
The Nine-Ball World Championship
is approaching.

270
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:16,648
We're leaving on Thursday.

271
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,640
A week in advance.

272
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:21,896
Got it.

273
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,040
Dismissed.

274
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,800
What's wrong with you?

275
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,239
Not sleepy?

276
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:45,920
Do you want

277
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,079
to play?

278
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,680
You kidding?

279
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,280
Come on.

280
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,440
Go home.

281
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:51,624
Let's go.

282
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,560
We're leaving.

283
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,719
- I gotta go.
- I'm also leaving.

284
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,640
We're leaving this Thursday, right?

285
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,400
Yes, this Thursday.

286
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,184
See you.

287
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,160
(This Thursday?)

288
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,800
(So,)

289
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,040
(I can't visit Guo's family.)

290
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,599
(Grandma has been living with us.)

291
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,719
(And she doesn't go out.)

292
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,320
(Let me know when you're free.)

293
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,160
(Is he busy?)

294
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,440
(Let's talk after you're done.)

295
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
(I just heard)

296
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,759
(that you're leaving for a match.)

297
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,200
(Lin Lin told you?)

298
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,560
(She's from the coaching team.)

299
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,680
(So she must know it in advance.)

300
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,440
(Yeah.)

301
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,520
(Thursday?)

302
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,160
(Today is Monday.)

303
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,680
(It's okay to have a dinner)

304
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,479
(with my Grandma before I leave.)

305
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,599
(But,)

306
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,479
(you are in your lowest spirits.)

307
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,599
(I don't want to make you socialize.)

308
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,839
(Let's have dinner after I come back.)

309
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,479
(In two weeks.)

310
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,160
Hello.

311
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:53,560
Do you want me to talk with you?

312
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,040
Or

313
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:57,999
you want me

314
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,200
to stay on the line?

315
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,599
Just say something.

316
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,479
Anything is okay.

317
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,119
Hold on.

318
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,800
I guess you just took a shower

319
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,359
and finished your skincare.

320
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Now,

321
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,759
you'll brush your teeth

322
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
and then get into bed.

323
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,479
You guessed wrong.

324
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,560
Well,

325
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,599
I remembered

326
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,640
that I haven't packed.

327
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,320
So, I am about

328
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,440
to pack.

329
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,359
I'm going back to the club tomorrow.

330
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:43,359
And

331
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,999
I will

332
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,400
stop by the dry cleaner.

333
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,560
If you're too tired to talk,

334
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,400
just listen to me.

335
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,079
Okay.

336
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,479
You know what?

337
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,440
I was neck and neck

338
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,359
with my rival in this competition.

339
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,040
I almost lost.

340
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,160
I could win this time

341
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,560
thanks to Liu Xiran's mistake.

342
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,640
If there is a next time,

343
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,440
I must compete seriously.

344
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,999
However, Xiaodong has always told me

345
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
that luck is also a kind of strength.

346
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,759
What do you say?

347
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,800
I can't believe

348
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,599
that's what he said.

349
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,719
He

350
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,320
relies on nothing

351
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,479
but hard work.

352
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,800
There's more than you'd expect.

353
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,719
Xiaodong

354
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:50,239
has many sides.

355
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,719
Well, I had no idea

356
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,680
that he had dated someone.

357
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,400
But you've seen

358
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,440
this side of him.

359
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,279
Yiyang.

360
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,239
You have to learn

361
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,319
how to interact with others.

362
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,559
Don't try to argue.

363
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,479
You should be modest

364
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:25,880
and tolerant.

365
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,920
People talk.

366
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,759
Public opinion can be daunting.

367
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,799
The day my parents passed away,

368
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,120
at their funeral,

369
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,200
I didn't cry.

370
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,680
I don't know why.

371
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,200
I just didn't want to shed tears.

372
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,039
My younger brother cried miserably.

373
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,360
Because of this,

374
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,120
my relatives complained about me.

375
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,559
Today when you saw me,

376
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:47,840
you think I was strange?

377
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,680
Today,

378
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,519
I noticed it.

379
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,840
All of them were crying

380
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,519
when shaking hands,

381
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,479
except for you.

382
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:15,880
Yes,

383
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:20,640
except for me,

384
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,920
the most favored student.

385
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,239
You notice it.

386
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,120
And so did others.

387
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,519
To put it nicely,

388
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,200
I was overly sad.

389
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,440
But put it unkindly,

390
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,999
I was overly cold.

391
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,319
No.

392
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
I don't think so.

393
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,440
Moreover,
my mom cares a lot about this stuff.

394
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,400
She's particular about it.

395
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,559
She never talked about it.

396
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,039
Go to sleep.

397
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,239
I'll see you off.

398
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,568
Okay.

399
00:22:32,328 --> 00:22:35,144
(Lin)

400
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,600
Good night.

401
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,624
(Lin)

402
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,400
Lin Yiyang.

403
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:13,680
Are you awake?

404
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll hang up.

405
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,559
You get more sleep.

406
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,120
Hold on.

407
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,680
I miss you.

408
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,360
Kiss me.

409
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,799
I kissed.

431
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,440
Breakfast?

432
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Have a seat.

433
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,184
Sit.

434
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,440
I think

435
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,160
you are

436
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,160
oversimplifying things.

437
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,239
30 spots.

438
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:55,519
That's too much.

439
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,440
Only three of our players

440
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,920
can enter the snooker world rankings.

441
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,600
Sending 30 players abroad

442
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,880
is simply burning money.

443
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,519
That's right.

444
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:11,279
But if you worry too much

445
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,160
about it,

446
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
back then, our club

447
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,880
wouldn't rise, right?

448
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:20,640
Initially,

449
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,680
none of the first players

450
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
in our club was famous.

451
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:24,880
What's worse,

452
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
my coach just got

453
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,400
two talented students

454
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,360
at over 60.

455
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,799
He often said

456
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,559
cultivating talent

457
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,160
must spare no expense.

458
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,519
Let's talk about the contest.

459
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,360
Yiyang, I know

460
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,239
you have great ambitions,

461
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,360
like your coach.

462
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,200
But I think we should first

463
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,880
take care of internal affairs, right?

464
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,160
Yes, you are right.

465
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,640
Our club always comes first.

466
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,039
But holding games

467
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,519
is beneficial for us.

468
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,928
As the industry takes off,

469
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,999
everyone's status will be

470
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,080
significantly different.

471
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,360
I am old.

472
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,664
I don't care about that.

473
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,719
Your coach is there.

474
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,400
Let's not go over.

475
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,920
Don't let them see us.

476
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,880
You don't care,

477
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,840
but please think about our players.

478
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Let's not talk about snooker.

479
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,519
Among the players

480
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,200
on the Women's Nine-Ball list,

481
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,360
Chinese girls are the majority.

482
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,200
We're proud.

483
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,239
But few people know about it.

484
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,799
And even fewer want to know

485
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,400
or pay attention.

486
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,880
I don't hope that no one

487
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:43,920
cares about our players

488
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,279
when they compete.

489
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,920
I hope that one day

490
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,080
when our players compete,
the stadium will be full,

491
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,479
and people will cheer for their winning.

492
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Instead of how it is now,

493
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,360
in many events,

494
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,959
many coaches but few spectators are

495
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,600
in the audience.

496
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,440
This sport

497
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:12,920
lacks popularity.

498
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,440
Well,

499
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,039
it's not an Olympic event,

500
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,160
not even in the Asian Games.

501
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:21,920
Well...

502
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:25,840
You're right.

503
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,080
Yiyang.

504
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,319
Just tell us

505
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:30,360
about your idea.

506
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,600
Let's be straightforward.

507
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,160
Okay.

508
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,759
What's going on?

509
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:39,920
Can you hear them?

510
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,680
I can guess

511
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,759
what they're saying.

512
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,840
A new leader applies new stuff.

513
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,559
I guess Lin Yiyang is trying

514
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:47,759
to make them

515
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,600
accept new stuff.

516
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,120
In 1896,

517
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,120
the first Olympic Game was held.

518
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,959
In 1988, table tennis was included

519
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,200
in the Olympics.

520
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,080
Many events

521
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,279
have to start gradually.

522
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,120
Now, billiards associations

523
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,239
are submitting applications.

524
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,200
Our club is willing to do it.

525
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,640
Also,

526
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,680
I believe

527
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,519
that we can earn bread

528
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,479
and buns.

529
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,200
Have you had breakfast?

530
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,600
Yes, we have.

531
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,239
I gotta go.

532
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:50,984
Okay.

533
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,559
- Well...
- Let's go.

534
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Is he the unruly, arrogant boy

535
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,999
I knew before?

536
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,239
I'm confused.

537
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,920
Don't get up.

538
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,640
No.

539
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,319
Lie down and talk.

540
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,719
You're here.

541
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,080
How can I stay in bed?

542
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:07,600
Slow down.

543
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
- Slow down.
- Sit here.

544
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,519
It's alright.

545
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,279
It's okay.

546
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,200
Slow down.

547
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,799
I'm fine.

548
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,239
Sit.

549
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,239
Sit.

550
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,920
Slow down.

551
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,440
Coaches,

552
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,719
you all know

553
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,959
about Yiyang pretty well.

554
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,680
Well,

555
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,080
he is a

556
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,799
highly-ranked player.

557
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,640
And he has

558
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,039
earned much more money than me.

559
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,080
He was living a carefree life.

560
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,840
If I didn't play a family card
before him,

561
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:47,920
he would not be back.

562
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
I'll get you some tea.

563
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,559
Don't be mad.

564
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,319
It's okay.

565
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,640
Jiang Yang. Let me do it.

566
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,080
It's okay. I can do it.

567
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,239
Alright.

568
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:06,959
I'll do it myself.

569
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,559
Stop it. Your hands are shaking.

570
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,479
Listen to me.

571
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,160
Let me do it.

572
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,440
I'm covered in injuries.

573
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,479
I really can't lead the team.

574
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,799
(Dongxin City Billiards Club)
You two. Say something.

575
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,880
What should we do?

576
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,279
What do you think?

577
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,719
He is Mr. He's top student,

578
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:30,880
the right person

579
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,559
to take over the club.

580
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,880
I am worried.

581
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,559
He's going to make the business bigger.

582
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,200
What if he fails?

583
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,039
Well, we're too old

584
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,519
to play matches.

585
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,120
We can't earn prize money.

586
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,680
That's your concern?

587
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,719
Looks like you disagree,

588
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,080
but you agree inside.

589
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,559
According to what he said,

590
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,239
I've thought it over carefully.

591
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,640
I think what he said

592
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
does make sense.

593
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,999
Listen. When the club

594
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,319
was first established,

595
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,719
we had nothing.

596
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,319
But we, along with Mr. He,

597
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,360
did what we thought was right.

598
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,039
We were quick

599
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,759
in action.

600
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,279
We supported each other.

601
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:19,547
(Inpatient Department)

602
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,559
Have you nailed it?

603
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,120
Over the past week,

604
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,039
the young backbones have taken

605
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,519
a stand through actions.

606
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,279
And those top earners will

607
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,959
offer a bigger share of their bonus,

608
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,120
from 20 percent

609
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,120
to 40 percent.

610
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,999
Me included.

611
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,640
So, no one will complain

612
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,120
for now.

613
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,440
Okay.

614
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,440
I have good news for you.

615
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
I can be discharged.

616
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,080
So soon?

617
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,360
- How...?
- Don't get any wrong ideas.

618
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:00,200
I'm starting to rest.

619
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,959
And to be

620
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:02,920
your strongest support,

621
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,959
I must disappear

622
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,080
for a while.

623
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,799
So,

624
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,080
find a place for me.

625
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,959
Which place?

626
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:13,600
Billiard room?

627
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,160
Sure.

628
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:16,039
I'm not picky.

629
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,160
Jiang Yang.

630
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,400
Just feel free to stay.

631
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:26,559
Finally, I have a company.

632
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:28,552
Thank you.

633
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:38,039
Older people prefer to play safe moves.

634
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,920
After you come back,

635
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,319
you've scared those old coaches.

636
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,600
Recently,

637
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,759
I feel like I've said all the things

638
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,959
I didn't say before.

639
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,840
The World Championship ended today.

640
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,360
Yin Guo will return.

641
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,880
Go and pick her up.

642
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,239
Do you think I can't tell the time?

643
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,920
Then let's be serious.

644
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,600
This year's indoor sports meeting

645
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,648
has a billiards event.

646
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,640
Remember what we said
when we were kids?

647
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,880
Of course.

648
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,559
I'm envious.

649
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:33,160
I'm envious of those who play sports
from a young age,

650
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:36,279
and of those who can

651
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,279
watch their sports on TV.

652
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,160
At the Asian Games

653
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,519
and the Olympics,

654
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,719
they win gold medals.

655
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,239
We watched the Asian Games

656
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:47,920
on TV. Remember?

657
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,799
Back then, billiards was its event.

658
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,600
We both promised

659
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:58,440
to win gold medals
and watch the national flag rise.

660
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,279
This year's sports meeting
is open to Asian players.

661
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,000
You can't miss it.

662
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,600
I just returned home.

663
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:14,680
I'm not a national player.

664
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,319
I believe

665
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,000
you're qualified.

666
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:23,680
I hope so.

667
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:27,759
Help yourself.

668
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,560
I have to go.

669
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,919
Take care.

670
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,719
Yin Guo.

671
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,359
(Billiard Room)
Let me cut the fruit for you.

672
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:39,239
No need.

673
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:40,600
No full name.

674
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,520
Call her Guo.

675
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:43,680
How dare you. She's Yiyang's girlfriend.

676
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,640
You can't blame me.

677
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,600
Who knew Yiyang

678
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,560
would get a girlfriend?

679
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:48,480
What do you say?

680
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,160
What's going on?

681
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,080
Behave.

682
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:53,960
Dismissed.

683
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:01,879
You're acquainted

684
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,200
with them so soon.

685
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,359
Since you're so popular,

686
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,799
how about I sign you?

687
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,359
If so,

688
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,759
you should sign her instead.

689
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,680
She just won the World Championship

690
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,680
Honestly speaking,

691
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,799
I genuinely like her.

692
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:23,919
Well,

693
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,640
she just won the championship,

694
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,960
put away the gold medal,

695
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,359
and came here to practice.

696
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:29,879
As for me, the runner-up,

697
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,359
I'm just sitting here,

698
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,080
enjoying the summer breeze,

699
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:33,879
and drinking tea.

700
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,839
Even the strongest players

701
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,799
can't always win.

702
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,239
A runner-up?

703
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,879
A runner-up in the world.

704
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:45,919
That's pretty good.

705
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,160
Xiran.

706
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,160
Tomorrow night,

707
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,239
there will be a party

708
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,799
for the World Championship winner.

709
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,160
Thanks. But I'm not one of your club.

710
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:07,520
You don't have to do this for me.

711
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:09,919
See you there.

712
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,680
Thanks.

713
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:14,824
Not at all.

714
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,919
This morning,

715
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,439
I ironed my shirt and trousers.

716
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,359
I even did my hair.

717
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,359
Your parents

718
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,719
will like me, I guess

719
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,799
If only my parents

720
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:28,919
could judge by appearance,

721
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,680
like me.

722
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,040
If so, you'll pass immediately.

723
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,480
Sadly,

724
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:37,680
all you like about me is my face.

725
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:40,759
You have countless merits.

726
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:41,839
Otherwise, I won't let you

727
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:42,799
meet my parents.

728
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,839
Hello, Yiyang.

729
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,719
Yiyang.

730
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,080
This is the dormitory.

731
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,088
Boys on the second floor.
Girls on the third floor.

732
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:56,279
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

733
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:57,064
Hi.

734
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:06,239
I got up too early.

735
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:07,560
I had no time to open the windows.

736
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,919
I feel like the places you live in

737
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,399
look quite similar.

738
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,919
Did you miss me?

739
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,719
I missed you.

740
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,120
I...

741
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,439
Tell you something funny.

742
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,200
Actually, my dad didn't want

743
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:49,160
to meet you.

744
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:51,000
But he didn't say it directly

745
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,839
in case my Grandma would be upset.

746
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,200
He just said

747
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,239
we just started dating.

748
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,160
It's too early

749
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:01,759
to meet you.

750
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,879
It's hard.

751
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,120
But then,

752
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:12,640
during my competition,

753
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:13,719
my dad called me.

754
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,600
He suddenly mentioned you.

755
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,960
I didn't mention you.

756
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,080
He did it first.

757
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,879
He said

758
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,120
he knew how hard it was

759
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,680
to develop niche sports.

760
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,719
But few successful players ever tried

761
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,520
to do something for it.

762
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:30,839
But you did it.

763
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,600
He praised you.

764
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:34,799
He thinks

765
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,719
you're good,

766
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,680
and Dongxin City is lucky to have you.

767
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,879
So it seems your dad

768
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:42,839
has accepted me.

769
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Then he asked me

770
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,120
when you were free.

771
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,000
He wants to talk with you.

772
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:55,359
Glad to hear that.

773
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,399
Later, I'll think

774
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,839
about what to say

775
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,480
to your dad.

776
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,239
I...

777
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:09,839
Here's one more thing.

778
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,719
What is it?

779
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:21,439
Well...

780
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,799
I...

781
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Well...

782
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:33,879
I mean...

783
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,560
My period is late for one week.

784
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:41,359
Well...

785
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:44,160
After the competition in Shenyang,

786
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,759
everyone was talking

787
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:46,879
about the indoor sports meeting.

788
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,239
But my mind was full of worries.

789
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,239
It's okay.

790
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,239
No worries.

791
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,520
I am here.

792
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:30,439
I am with you.

793
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:42,960
Anyway,

794
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,919
we need to confirm it.

795
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,000
We go to the hospital.

796
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:49,040
It's not too late.

797
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,879
We don't need to go to the hospital.

798
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
Should we go to the pharmacy?

799
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,640
I can test it at home.

800
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,760
Yes.

801
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,600
I'll go buy it.

802
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,888
Wait for me.

803
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,560
Be back soon.
