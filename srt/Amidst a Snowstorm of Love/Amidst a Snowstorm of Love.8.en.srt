(I haven't said good night yet.)

26
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,879
(Are you going back tomorrow?)

27
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,320
(Yes.)

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,320
(Tomorrow morning or afternoon?)

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,040
(The same as last week.)

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,879
(That's good.
At least I can see him when I wake up.)

31
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,599
(Good night.)

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,520
(See you tomorrow.)

33
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,560
(Good night.)

34
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,999
I've subtly inquired for you.

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,120
Bei City Club is gathering all members
this weekend and will stay

36
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,320
at the hotel.

37
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,079
You take this chance
to make a good impression.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,359
Good impression?

39
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,760
Li Qingyan

40
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,760
is your love rival.

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,279
He also plays snooker.

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,919
He's Meng Xiaodong's favorite.

43
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,719
I've been watching snooker competitions.

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,656
I know him.

45
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,159
His playing style is exactly
like Meng Xiaodong's.

46
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:53,279
I'm impressed.

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,439
I guess

48
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:58,600
you don't take it seriously.

49
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,519
Meng Xiaodong also mostly lost
when playing against me back in the day.

50
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,720
He's coached by Meng Xiaodong.

51
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,320
How strong can he be?

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,839
Your judgment is wrong.

53
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,799
Yin Guo is not looking for a boyfriend

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,959
by ranking of skills.

55
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:19,639
I know

56
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,448
that judged by appearance,

57
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:22,888
you will win too.

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,119
Wu Wei.

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,760
Don't drink the beverage you bought.
It's expired.

60
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,608
This is vinegar.

61
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,799
I got it
from the noodle shop downstairs.

62
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,336
Whisky, please.

63
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,320
- Yes.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,119
What's up?

65
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,480
I met Lin Yiyang today.

66
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,399
I thought

67
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,079
I saw a stranger.

68
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:45,399
Well,

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,839
he hasn't changed much.

70
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:49,399
Not a total stranger.

71
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:52,200
Thank you.

72
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,600
Lin Yiyang

73
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,079
was not so amiable before.

74
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,959
He has learned to save face for others.

75
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,000
He knows how to deal with people.

76
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,959
He's like a plucked eagle

77
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,920
that used to soar high in the sky.

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,440
Now, he became a turtledove
hiding in the big city.

79
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,279
You came for him, right?

80
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:30,120
Have you tried?

81
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,248
Yeah, I have.

82
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,712
He hasn't lost his basic skills.

83
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,760
Also, he's at his best.

84
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,560
I also tested him today.

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,399
I bet

86
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:47,680
he is still the same as before.

87
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,240
He's been training hard.

88
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,039
If he slacks off even a bit,

89
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,039
I will tell.

90
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,336
Just as I judged.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,440
So, have you had a serious talk
with him?

92
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,440
He refused to talk.

93
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,800
After all, it's been many years.

94
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,479
It takes time

95
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,479
to open up

96
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,719
like we did before.

97
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,912
(Who is in the living room?)

98
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,719
(Are you asleep?)

99
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,240
(I just saw it.)

100
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,240
(So you're outside the door?)

101
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:45,864
(Yes.)

102
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,200
(In the living room. Will you come out?)

103
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,680
Xiaotian.

104
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,640
The lights on?

105
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,560
Why are you still up?

106
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,400
To get meds.

107
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,079
Are you sick?

108
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,280
A minor injury.

109
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,992
Is it convenient?

110
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,200
Sit over there.

111
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,920
What happened?

112
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,088
I got hurt on the train.

113
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,680
On the train?

114
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,408
You just noticed?

115
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,800
It didn't hurt, so I forgot about it.

116
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,872
It hurts just looking at it.

117
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:54,759
You've applied medicine yourself, right?

118
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,400
Yes, I just dealt with it
in the bathroom.

119
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,640
Let me help you.

120
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,479
Is something wrong?

121
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,200
Very few people say that to me.

122
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,160
Perhaps it's

123
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,599
because you don't seem approachable.

124
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,079
Really?

125
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,599
Not really.

126
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,440
Sometimes, you look a bit severe.

127
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,119
But you're still a very good person.

128
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,920
It seems too short.

129
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,520
Maybe I should get some gauze.

130
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,119
I fear

131
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,280
it might stick to the wound.

132
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:11,959
Wait. I'll go get it.

133
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,560
Come closer.

134
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:25,640
Are you sleepy?

135
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,560
Well,

136
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,920
can we chat?

137
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,600
I...

138
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:49,800
I don't have a big family.

139
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,440
My parents died early.

140
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,072
I have a brother,
six years younger than me.

141
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,800
He got married last year.

142
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,359
He got married so early.

143
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,544
When my parents passed away,

144
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,719
one of my relatives adopted him.

145
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,920
A family with no children.

146
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,376
They treated my brother

147
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,359
as their own son.

148
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,224
When he got married last year,

149
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,999
I gave him some money.

150
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,280
But he returned it to me.

151
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,584
I guess he didn't want

152
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:35,959
to trouble me.

153
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,959
You have a good brother.

154
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
So, I want to say I'm not

155
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,680
from a well-off family.

156
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,312
But I am

157
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,839
unburdened.

158
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,760
(Looks like we're
on a blind date again.)

159
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,479
(And he's even introducing his family.)

160
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,280
If there's anything

161
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,839
you want to know,

162
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,759
feel free to ask.

163
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,079
There's nothing I want to ask.

164
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:47,359
I'm leaving.

165
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:18,759
Well, good night.

166
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,840
Good night.

167
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I thought you had gone back.

168
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,640
What are you doing here?

169
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
Maybe we should go to my room.

170
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,360
Are the two coffee beans

171
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,120

182
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,200
I guess you're outside.

Get me some coffee.

Lin Lin always

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,519
Hello, you go on. I'm listening.

186
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:09,440
Yes.

187
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,640
Understood.

188
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,680
Let's listen together.

189
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,759
Since you've decided to play snooker,

190
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,904
hurry back and keep training.

191
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:31,680
Why did you sign up
for the Nine-Ball Open?

192
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,200
If you want to try everything,

193
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,160
you'll mess it all up.

194
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,920
Listen,

195
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,640
you're from a well-off family.

196
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,440
You feel less stressed

197
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,440
and persistent.

198
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,759
I'm really curious.

199
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,080
How did she
and Meng Xiaodong get together?

200
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,360
Meng Xiaodong is like this.

201
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,759
And Lin Lin looks like this.

202
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:58,519
You tell me.

203
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,519
Who can hold the other down?

204
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,239
Are you listening?

205
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,680
Speak up. Are you there?

206
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,840
- Turn the volume down.
- Wu Wei.

207
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:09,920
Hey.

208
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,999
Duncuo is there?

209
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,319
Yeah.

210
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,920
But he's a little drunk.

211
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,959
You go on.
He might understand more or less.

212
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,680
Jiang Yang and Fan Wencong will

213
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,672
compete in the Netherlands next month.

214
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,368
They went there in advance

215
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,160
to see you.

216
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,759
Duncuo.

217
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,999
You don't need to act
like we were strangers.

218
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:39,240
When they returned to the hotel,

219
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,680
they were very sad.

220
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,360
Duncuo.

221
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,832
He has slept?

222
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,840
Not yet, he has drunk too much.

223
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,719
He is taking a shower.

224
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,039
You talk to me.

225
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,239
My head is clear.

226
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,759
(Have you been disturbed?)

227
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,519
(Can't hear you clearly.)

228
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:36,328
(Aren't you going to sleep?)

229
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,360
(I wait for the day.)

230
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,559
(Why?)

231
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:35,304
(Did you not get the message?)

232
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:37,600
(I got it.)

233
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,680
(Why didn't you reply?)

234
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,239
(For what?)

235
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,279
(Why do I wait for the day?)

236
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,488
(I can't sleep)

237
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,376
(because of you.)

238
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,319
I'm addicted to his face.

239
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,120
(If you're awake, come out.
I'm in the living room.)

240
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,840
Did you sleep well?

241
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,680
Newly bought beans.

242
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,999
Want to try it?

243
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,719
Well,

244
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,600
we used to visit

245
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,840
this coffee bean shop, right?

246
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,880
When did you go again?

247
00:28:58,759 --> 00:28:59,880
When I was returning yesterday,

248
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,239
I took a little detour to go there.

249
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:07,999
You liar.

250
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,160
Why?

251
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,999
Going there from the station,

252
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,600
and then back to the apartment.

253
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,799
It's more than just a little detour.

254
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,840
You took the long way.

255
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,120
I bought several flavors.

256
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:29,840
You can try them all

257
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,999
to see which one you like.

258
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:33,880
If you like, I'll get more for you.

259
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,440
Why did you buy so much?

260
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,279
Don't keep staring at me.

261
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,640
Morning.

262
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,440
Your mango isn't easy to cut, is it?

263
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,840
Yes.

264
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,519
Leave it there.

265
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,319
Did I disturb you last night?

266
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,600
My sister called me.

267
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:53,239
No, I actually didn't hear much.

268
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,759
You've heard of Lin Lin, right?
She also plays Nine-Ball.

269
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,104
I know her.

270
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,719
I have a competition in Hangzhou
at the end of April.

271
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,640
She might be the referee.

272
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,719
She was the top seed.

273
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,999
According to her age,
she could have played for more years.

274
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:16,160
My seniors have told me about it.

275
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,200
They said

276
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:20,400
she won the championship
of three major games within one year.

277
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,319
And she said her wish was fulfilled.

278
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,799
After that, she announced her retirement
and became a referee.

279
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,759
She's a cool girl.

280
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,440
She's not in very good condition.

281
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,640
It's one of the reasons for retirement.

282
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,920
But it's normal for athletes.

283
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,360
Who doesn't have injuries?

284
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,559
(Why did he suddenly mention her?)

285
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,719
(Are Lin Lin and Lin Yiyang)

286
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:49,400
(in an unusual relationship?)

287
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,080
Hasn't your cousin mentioned her to you?

288
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,120
My cousin?

289
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,279
Is he familiar with her?

290
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,279
More than that.

291
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,799
Lin Lin has been chasing him
for a few years.

292
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,519
Lin Lin is your sister?

293
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Not my biological sister.

294
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,080
But we're close like siblings.

295
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,880
Back in school,
Wu Wei was a good student.

296
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,080
He was timid.

297
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,360
So he was often bullied by bad guys.

298
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,640
Lin Lin always protected him.

299
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,120
So Wu Wei sees her as his own sister.

300
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,799
However,

301
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,319
she protected Meng Xiaodong
with her life.

302
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:31,880
The scar on her shoulder.

303
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,200
When she was 16,

304
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,719
it was caused by the thugs

305
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:36,840
your cousin offended.

306
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,400
He never told me about this.

307
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,080
I didn't even know they knew each other.

308
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:48,360
Does my cousin like her?

309
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:51,200
I don't know now.

310
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,319
Now...

311
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,239
Who knows what your cousin is thinking?

312
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,096
Though he's been refusing to date,

313
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:58,479
his performance is just so-so.

314
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,039
This year, he's outperformed
by Jiang Yang.

315
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,519
No, Jiang Yang is rising
starting this year.

316
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,519
Before that, he was always overshadowed
by my cousin.

317
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,559
Yes.

318
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,799
Let's not worry about them anymore.

319
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,319
It's been neck and neck.

320
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,640
You guys talk. I have to go.

321
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,920
Is it bothering you to listen to us

322
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,719
talk about the past?

323
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:54,719
Not at all.

324
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,800
So,

325
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,360
if I tell you about my childhood,

326
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,640
will you find it annoying?

327
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,120
Absolutely not.

328
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,160

I have to move out today.

362
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,560
Everyone's here.

363
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,439
The coach asked me to stay at the hotel

364
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:34,719
to join them.

365
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:35,759
So soon?

366
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,560
I can't believe it.

367
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,279
He takes you away so quickly.

369

I'll take you there.

370
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,759
Aren't you going back to school?

371
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,328
I'll send you first.

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,239
If I don't catch the train,

00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,879
I'll start packing now.

375
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,239
If I can finish it

376
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,799
before lunch,

377
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,279
you can drop me off at the hotel first.

378
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:20,080
And you still have time
to head to the train station.

379
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:27,839
Go ahead.

380
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:47,399
Well,

381
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,680
take your time packing.

382
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,520
I don't want to see my brother.

383
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,480
I'll come see you after he's gone.

384
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,879
I'm a bit hungry. I'm going to eat.

385
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,439
I won't wait for you two.

386
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,488
- It's fine.
- Wash up.

387
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:06,319
- I'm leaving.
- Are you wearing that?

388
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
Yiyang, they came to see you.

389
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,200
We were just passing by.

390
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,200
And we wanted you to join us for brunch.

391
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,160
You guys talk.

392
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,000
Go ahead.

393
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,759
Take a seat, guys.

394
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,879
Coffee, please.

395
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,160
I didn't sleep last night.

396
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,712
I'll catch up on my sleep.

397
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:07,839
Help yourselves, guys.

398
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,640
Is he mad?

399
00:40:45,096 --> 00:40:46,440
(When are they leaving?)

400
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:48,680
(We'll leave first.)

401
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,040
(I dare not go out.)

402
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,136
(I feel awkward.)

403
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,520
(I'm telling them
to go to the bathroom.)

404
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:02,280
(They will come out after you leave.)

405
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,000
(No, it will make things more weird.)

406
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:22,000
(Forget it.
I'll bite the bullet and go out.)

407
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:28,744
(Let's go if you're ready.)

408
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:43,336
Spare key.

409
00:41:43,336 --> 00:41:45,200
I'm going back to school.
Make yourselves comfortable.

410
00:41:56,104 --> 00:41:56,904
Let me help.

411
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:27,688
Bye.

412
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

413
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,560
Take care.

414
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,319
Lin Yiyang goes back to school.

415
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,712
And the girl follows behind,
carrying a suitcase.

416
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,799
He never follows the rules.

417
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:52,520
I'm impressed.

418
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,839
Even in love, he's doing fast.

419
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,799
Time to prepare the red envelopes.

420
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,799
Can't bring shame to Dongxin City.

421
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,759
How much we'll give?

422
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,319
How about this year's bonus?

423
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:11,040
No problem. That's a good omen.

424
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,768
Let's celebrate that our buddy is back.

425
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:20,239
Anyway, your bonus
is much more than mine.

426
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,640
If you're okay with that, so am I.

427
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,200
Wait a minute, I'll check my savings.
