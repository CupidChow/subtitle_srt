00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,360
Surprise, huh?

26
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,479
Jiang Yang made a big difference

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,559
in Dongxin City.

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,680
His ability is beyond doubt.

29
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,279
Have you confirmed?

30
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:34,040
Next week.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,200
Just don't worry.

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,999
I guarantee one-stop service,

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,520
including signing your lease and moving.

34
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,480
You just relax.

35
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,800
This bed is fine.

36
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,200
It's new.

37
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,960
If you give this to her,
where do I put my books?

38
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm asking you.

39
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:14,680
You don't read books.

40
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,840
You give her this too?

41
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,519
It's my favorite.

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,559
I'll buy you a new one later.

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,040
Alright, you bought them anyway.

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,159
Give it to whoever you love.

45
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,200
You better not get a girlfriend.

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,999
If you do, you might give all you have.

47
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,279
Are you crazy?

48
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,919
Stop it.

49
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,760
You want a coffee machine, right?

50
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,200
Just pick one you like.

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,439
I'll pay for it.

52
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,400
Really?

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,679
Anything is fine?

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,839
Yeah.

55
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Wei.

56
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,839
Do you think

57
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,919
I was a good guy?

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,040
Well,

59
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,079
you have a bad temper.

60
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,359
And sometimes, you're mean.

61
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,320
You know what I mean.

62
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,799
I mean,

63
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,919
for girls.

64
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,560
To be honest,
you're the most popular with the girls.

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,119
In Dongxin City alone,
some girls have a crush on you.

66
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,720
Don't tell me you don't know.

67
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,119
Unless you're a fool.

68
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,160
What do you think

69
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,320
I should wear

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,639
to look...

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,560
The best?

72
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,119
Sportswear, or hoodie.

73
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,679
Girls said

74
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,399
you're tall and slim.

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
They look good on you.

76
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:33,639
It makes you

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,639
youthful.

78
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,120
It's on me.

79
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,239
Thank you.

80
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,119
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

81
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,880
Yin Guo, you're really popular.

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,720
You must be regulars here.

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,399
Lin Yiyang is familiar with the boss.

84
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,600
He couldn't go back home
after sending you back.

85
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,560
So he slept here.

86
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,919
We caused trouble for him.

87
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,959
So when will Yiyang come back?

88
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm not sure.

89
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,120
He has to work and attend school.

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,399
He's been busy.

91
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,079
He's always in a rush.

92
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,288
I see him every month or two.

93
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:18,760
But no worries.

94
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,000
He will stay with me

95
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:20,839
and not disturb you.

96
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:23,760
By the way,

97
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,320
the landlord agreed
to rent the house to you.

98
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,800
He helped a lot.

99
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,880
We should thank him.

100
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,200
So, he will come back

101
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,880
in one or two months.

102
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,440
I guess so.

103
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,839
When are you going to return home?

104
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,920
I'll return after the competition.

105
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:49,240
You can see him before that.

106
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,039
However,

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,159
you might not.

108
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,039
Do you drink?

109
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,624
No, thanks.

110
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:00,200
Please enjoy.

111
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,159
I'm bad at drinking,

112
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,039
but I'll drink.

113
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,279
Go ahead.

114
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,360
(We moved to the apartment today.)

115
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,959
(Wu Wei said)

116
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,800
(you helped a lot.)

117
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,880
(Thank you.)

118
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,279
(No problem.)

119
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,200
(No problem again?)

120
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,159
(Is that your catchphrase?)

121
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,760
(I will talk to you after class.)

122
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,479
Alright, class dismissed.

123
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,959
I'll see you next week.

124
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,479
Check homework grades?

125
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,000
Or come for the journals?

126
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,479
I'd like to buy you dinner.

127
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,399
Thank you for this semester.

128
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,599
Your girlfriend can come with you.

129
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,079
I have to prepare my lessons.

130
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,440
I don't have time.

131
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,120
If you want to thank me,

132
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,839
just complete the assignment.

133
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,079
See you.

134
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,519
The street we just crossed is lined
with small restaurants.

135
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,880
The high street

136
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,519
is a ten-minute walk away from here.

137
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,440
There's one downside.

138
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,360
It has no elevator.

139
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,599
But it's only four floors high.

140
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,880
Climbing stairs is easy.

141
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,279
Mind the steps.

142
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,120
Let's go upstairs and put your things.

143
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,159
I'll take you around

144
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,279
and watch other facilities.

145
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,152
Okay.

146
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,920
I'll help.

147
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm fine.

148
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,599
Thank you.

149
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:52,399
Are you okay?

150
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

Hi, what's up?

160
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:20,719
Not so much.

161
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:32,200
Yoo.

162
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:34,320
Hey. Give me five.

163
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,079
Hey, Eric.

164
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:36,839
Hi, Lin.

165
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:37,672
Hey.

166
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,159
I have a train to catch and gotta go.

167
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
You've been acting weird.

168
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,039
You've been going
to Wu Wei's place frequently.

169
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,360
I've been quite busy this week.

170
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,479
The 200,000 I gave you,

171
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
have you transferred it?

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,719
Yes, I have.

173
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,560
The final payment is done,

174
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,760
and I'll be relieved.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,680
Congrats, Yiyang.

176
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,680
This underground billiards room

177
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,839
is yours from now on.

178
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,279
I don't want to let them down.

179
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,120
To take over this place,

180
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,000
I even have no money

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,279
to buy a slightly expensive burger.

182
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,479
If you're having difficulties,

183
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,360
I'll borrow some money.

184
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,000
No, I'll be fine in two months.

185
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,320
Plus, my friend owes me 100,000.

186
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,360
You, a married man, don't need to worry.

187
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,239
My brother is married, but I'm not.

188
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,959
Yiyang, I have saved money
for a marriage.

189
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,119
Don't be silly.

190
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,759
You help us manage the business well.

191
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,040
That's your job.

192
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,296
Got it?

193
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,216
Yeah.

194
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,400
I have to leave in five minutes.

195
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,040
Alright.

196
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,479
You stay and help me with the match.

197
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:44,359
Okay.

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,440
People who will join the Nine-Ball Open,

199
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,040
come here.

200
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,839
Mr. Qian.

201
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,800
You are not in?

202
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,119
Can I?

203
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,359
Yes,

204
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:09,959
you definitely can.

205
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,599
Guys, come in.

206
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:22,984
Here.

207
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,320
Xie Yaoyao, Hao.

208
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,359
Here is your training plan.

209
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,400
Mr. Qian, this is yours.

210
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,440
The two of us share one plan?

211
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,599
Make copies yourself.

212
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,079
The competition registration is online.

213
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,839
You help them.

214
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,239
Call me if you have problems.

215
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,640
Specifically,

216
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,160
Mr. Qian,

217
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,200
you're not young anymore.
Cherish your opportunity.

218
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,599
Feel free to call me.

219
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,200
Can you not be so brutally frank?

220
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,879
I keep my phone on all day.

221
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,160
Call anytime.

222
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,079
You urge them to train.

223
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:56,840
Okay.

224
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,728
Call me if there's anything.

225
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,440
Hi, Grace.

226
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,592
Oh. Lin.

227
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,400
How about here?

228
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,304
Great. I like it.

229
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,968
Don't miss it.

230
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,160
Are you done?

231
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,440
Me too.

232
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
This sofa

233
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,479
is comfy, right?

234
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
Yes, it's really soft.

235
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,168
Wait.

236
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
My sister's room

237
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,160
has a wardrobe, a bookshelf, a sofa,

238
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,239
and a cabinet.

239
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:55,999
Why does my room have the same?

240
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,359
Your sister deserves the best things.

241
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,872
You're right.

242
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,336
Right.

243
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:04,520
Well,

244
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,839
where do you practice?

245
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,759
Can you take me there?

246
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,960
Sure, grab your cue and follow me.

247
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:10,888
Okay.

248
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,576
Well,

249
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,759
I'm off to practice, and you?

250
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,759
I'm okay. You go ahead.

251
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,640
Alright, I'll come back for dinner.

252
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,800
Sure, be safe.

253
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,879
Lin Yiyang

254
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,160
recommended this apartment to me

255
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,040
because there's a billiard room nearby.

256
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,896
Here we are.

257
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:35,784
Come in.

258
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,808
Thank you.

259
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:39,560
How are you doing?

260
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,856
Hi, Vilo.

261
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,168
Hey.

262
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,079
New friend.

263
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:47,560
Hi.

264
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,239
This is Lin's friend.
He asked me to bring her here.

265
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:52,520
So please take good care of her.

266
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,759
Lin's friend?
Then she's everyone's friend here.

267
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,759
Hey guys, this is Lin's friend.

268
00:13:58,418 --> 00:13:58,958
Hi.

269
00:13:58,984 --> 00:13:59,912
Hi, welcome.

270
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,599
He also said she can use his table.

271
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:03,800
Of course.

272
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,119
Back to work.

273
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,160
Follow me.

274
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,400
Let's go.

275
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:13,160
This table was reserved for Lin only.

276
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,479
Normally, no one else is allowed
to play here.

277
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,200
Just make yourselves comfortable.

278
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,119
I will leave you to it.

279
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:27,640
Thank you.

280
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,440
Lin Yiyang used to work here
teaching billiards.

281
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,759
So he's close to the boss.

282
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,239
He's more helpful than me here.

283
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,560
Feels like he's been everywhere.

284
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,999
He's a workaholic.

285
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,759
He used to work for the Chinese bus,

286
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,119
teach billiards,
and do various odd jobs.

287
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,959
Anyway, he tried many jobs.

288
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,040
Importantly,

289
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,160
no matter how hard it is,

290
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,680
He's never stopped playing pool.

291
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,239
I admire Lin Yiyang very much.

292
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,440
He's bold enough
to push himself to the limit.

293
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,040
He practices every day?

294
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,400
Almost.

295
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,920
Growing up,

296
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,200
he's never missed a day
except when sick.

297
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,400
Sounds like a training
for a professional player.

298
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:11,920
Yet he doesn't compete.

299
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,680
Let him tell you about himself.

300
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,352
You practice.

301
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:18,800
I'm going to get changed
and head to work.

302
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,479
Do I need to pick you up later?

303
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,839
No, I just memorized the way.

304
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:22,759
Alright, I'm off.

305
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:23,848
Thank you.

306
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,200
See you next time.

307
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,920
Bye.

308
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:28,440
Your name is...?

309
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:29,999
Yin Guo.

310
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,304
Yin.

311
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,280
Yeah. Okay.

312
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,560
Okay. If you need anything,

313
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,839
or anyone gives you any trouble,
just let me know, alright?

314
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,959
Okay, thank you.

315
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,759
Lin's friend is our friend.

316
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:44,232
Okay.

317
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,640
(It's like I suddenly stepped
into his world.)

318
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,320
(Everyone seems to have connections
with him.)

319
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,440
Are you off?

320
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:04,759
Yeah, off to work.

321
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,800
Bro, have you been short
on money lately?

322
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,800
How about this?

323
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,479
I'll pay your rent for you.

324
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,839
I'll cover all the rent
until I return home, okay?

325
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,680
I just need something to do.

326
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,599
Otherwise, it's quite boring, right?

327
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,879
Thanks, anyway.

328
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,640
That's very kind of you.

329
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,239
It's alright. We're friends.

330
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,239
Okay, I gotta go.

331
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:30,824
Alright.

332
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:35,816
Do you want to watch an opera tonight?

333
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:36,759
I have tickets.

334
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,359
Opera?

335
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,040
But...

336
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,928
My friend will also come.

337
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:42,999
Let's hang out together.

338
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:45,959
Okay.

339
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,879
I'll text you later.

340
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Wait before the opera house.

341
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,248
- Okay.
- My friend has the tickets.

342
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:51,280
- Alright.
- I'm off.

343
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,800
Bye.

344
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,936
Good shot.

345
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:14,664
You...

346
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,119
Aren't you in class?

347
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,040
I came after class.

348
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,359
I heard you were here.

349
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,719
I dropped by.

350
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,759
Surprised?

351
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,640
Wu Wei said you only come back
every month or two.

352
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,400
That's why I text you to thank you.

353
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,368
I'm free these days.

354
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,839
So, are you used to the environment here?

355
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,759
It's good.

356
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,359
They say you usually use this table.

357
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,759
Thank you.

358
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,512
Will you head back?

359
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,599
You must have been here for a long time.

360
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,040
I've been practicing alone today.

361
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,872
If you have time,

362
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,079
you play with me?

363
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,239
I fear I'll make you cry.

364
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,839
I'm actually pretty good.

365
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,479
(I'm a semi-professional player.)

366
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,359
(Even if I lose, I won't cry.)

367
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,800
I've made many kids cry
when playing pool.

368
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:25,879
Wu Wei was among them.

369
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,680
Does that mean he was too weak?

370
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,320
Actually, he's not bad.

371
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,160
But,

372
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,920
I'm better than him.

373
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,119
(Should I concede points?)

374
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:48,359
(It's improper to do this)

375
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,992
(to a professional.)

376
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,800
(Am I pushing him?)

377
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,479
(He seems reluctant.)

378
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,799
Maybe we should go for a meal instead.

379
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,559
I forgot you just got off the train.

380
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,999
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

381
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,559
Best of five games.

382
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,400
If you're not tired,

383
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:11,799
best of nine is okay too.

384
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,056
You serve.

385
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,840
Want to play it fast?

386
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,559
Or you want

387
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,479
to play it safe?

388
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,248
Either way is fine.

389
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,920
There's a seeded player
in the women's division.

390
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,600
Someone specializing in speed.

391
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,808
I'll help you get used to it.

392
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,400
Are you familiar with the players
in the women's division?

393
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,840
Not very.

00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:32,712

You're hiding your strength.

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,992
Am I?

411
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
No need to concede points.

412
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,959
I can stand to lose.

413
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,279
If I take your place now,
I'll win this round.

414
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,520
If you fail, you're

415
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,640
throwing the game.

416
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,279
It's getting late. Let's go back.

417
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,640
Okay, time to have dinner.

418
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,160
Hi, Lin.

419
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,840
Hi.

420
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,519
See you.

421
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,519
Bye, Lin. See you tomorrow.

422
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,200
Bye.

423
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,400
Bye, Lin.

424
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,048
Bye.

425
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,759
Lin Yiyang.

426
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,856
- Bye.
- Hey.

427
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,999
It's on me.

428
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:48,920
It's your first time here.

429
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,999
Let me pay.

430
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,999
No way.

431
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:53,400
What are you two arguing about?

432
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,959
Today is on me.

433
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,080
Well, thanks, man.

434
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,279
Please.

435
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,920
Still counting on you to teach my son.

436
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,559
Of course, I am his master after all.

437
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,544
Let's go.

438
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,920
Keep it.

439
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,144
Thank you so much.

440
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,479
We've prepared a hot pot for tonight.

441
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,680
You can join us.

442
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,719
By the way, I have a very good friend.

443
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,880
She is your alumna.

444
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,440
She's from the law center.

445
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,640
Your brother has told me.

446
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,880
(Alright, you ended the conversation.)

447
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,440
(It's not my fault.)

448
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,519
Why are you quiet?

449
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,792
Well,

450
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,959
I'm not a big talker.

451
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,960
But I want to chat with you.

452
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,959
Let's go in.

453
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,840
Where are they?

454
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,008
Wu Wei?

455
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,952
Tian.

456
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,160
They said they went to see an opera.

457
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,120
So what should we do?

458
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,440
Do you still want to eat?

459
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,600
Of course.

460
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:17,840
I'm hungry.

461
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:37,832

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,424

What is that on your arm?

464
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,279
A classmate of mine
studies body painting.

465
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,680
I visited his exhibition a while ago.

466
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,799
He painted one on me.

467
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,680
It's beautiful.

468
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:02,360
You go with me next time.

469
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,160
How long can this last?

470
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,799
About three or four days.

(Why does he always stare at me today?)

475
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,719
I'll see what's in the fridge.

♪Listen to the sound of dancing snow♪

479
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,840
I'm going to change clothes.

480
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:55,560
Alright.

481
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,519
(So what do you think)

482
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,799
(I should wear to look...)

483
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,039
(The best?)

484
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,440
(Sportswear, or hoodie.)

485
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,239
(Girls said)

486
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,719
(you're tall and slim.)

487
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,600
(They look good on you.)

488
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,680
(It makes you)

489
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:16,759
(youthful.)

490
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:23,976
Bro.

491
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,680
Where's someone else?

492
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:26,696
Just the two of us?

493
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,680
I don't know what happened.

494
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,768
The snow is too heavy today.

495
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:34,632
We can't get back.

496
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,840
You look after Yin Guo at home.

497
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:37,959
She just moved in.

498
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:40,640
Got it.

499
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,319
It's all ready.

500
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,999
Feels like every time we meet,

501
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:55,999
we are eating.

502
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:57,559
It's nice.

503
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,959
What's so good about eating?

504
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,840
One has to eat three meals a day.

505
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,840
I've been busy this semester.

506
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,559
It's rare to have a meal on time.

507
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:18,840
- Do you drink?
- What should we put in?

508
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,640
- How about drinking?
- Let's eat.

509
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
I'll go get the wine,
and you put food in the pot.

510
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,640
Put in whatever you like

511
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,479
Cheers.

512
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:22,880
Cheers.

513
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,880
Do you

514
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:52,600
miss home?

515
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,400
Yes.

516
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,080
Who do you miss the most?

517
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,479
Maybe

518
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:10,759
my grandpa.

519
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,559
Grandpa?

520
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,959
Well,

521
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,400
are you pursuing someone?

522
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:42,440
I saw what Wu Wei posted on his Moments.

523
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,759
Although it was deleted instantly,

524
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,920
I still saw it.

525
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,640
Really?

526
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,880
Don't be sad.

527
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
You're such a good person.

528
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,999
If you like someone,
you'll get a response.

529
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,559
Do I look

530
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,160
very sad?

531
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,959
Good luck.

532
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,440
Thank you.

533
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:54,719
I'll clean it up.

534
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,680
Leave it here. I'll take care of it.

535
00:31:58,568 --> 00:31:59,279
It's okay.

536
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,160
I haven't finished yet.

537
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,200
There's nothing left in the pot.

538
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,120
I'll get spaghetti.

539
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:16,872
I'm not full.

540
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,200
Spaghetti?

541
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,039
Spaghetti hot pot?

542
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,272
It's okay.

543
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,559
Grandma.

544
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,400
Are you happy about moving?

545
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,959
Yeah.

546
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,400
It's much cheaper
than staying in a hotel.

547
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,640
I mean it.

548
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:52,872
Where's Tian?

549
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,039
He went to see an opera.

550
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,840
He hung out again?

551
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,200
Xiaodong.

552
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,400
He rarely goes abroad.
Let him have more fun.

553
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:03,920
That's right.

554
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,519
And he's happy because we just moved
into a new house today.

555
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,360
Please don't scold him.

556
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,999
He's been pretty well-behaved.

557
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,479
I don't intend to scold him.

558
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,479
I'm afraid he disrupts your training.

559
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:15,600
He won't.

560
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:17,519
This is your first international game.

561
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,600
I won't ask you to take first place.

562
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,719
At least the runner-up.

563
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,799
Why set such high expectations?

564
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,640
I've coached her since she was little.

565
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,080
I'm responsible for her.

566
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,920
If you are,

567
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,519
you have to make her happy.

568
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,640
If I just wanted to make her happy,

569
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,400
I wouldn't have kept her by my side.

570
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Don't mind your brother.

571
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:46,719
Is your flatmate there?

572
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,160
Yes, he's there.

573
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,319
I want to thank him personally.

574
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,559
That's not necessary. I will thank him.

575
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,600
He's looked after you for so long.

576
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,120
I must thank him.

577
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,239
You get him here.

578
00:34:02,728 --> 00:34:03,680
I would like to thank him.

579
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:04,959
Get him over.

580
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:11,959
Okay.

581
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,200
He's not here.

582
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:30,120
He might have gone out.

583
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,479
All right. Focus on your training.

584
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,559
Don't forget the training plan, got it?

585
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:35,640
I know.

586
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,408
Bye.

587
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,160
I have to say.

588
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,080
You're being too harsh on Guo.

589
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,479
If I'm not strict with her,

590
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:48,920
she wouldn't have achieved what she has.

591
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:51,959
Oh, Grandma.

592
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,840
About their roommate,

593
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,080
do you know his name?

594
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:59,559
They call him Lin.

595
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,039
Well,

596
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:04,759
Lin Yiyang.

597
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,680
Who?

598
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,440
Right, his name is Lin Yiyang.

599
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,840
(Lin Yiyang.)

600
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,279
(Which places are you going to win?)

601
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:17,160
The first place.

602
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,719
Don't forget Meng Xiaodong

603
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,680
from Bei City.

604
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,600
Boring.

605
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,039
What about Jiang Yang?

606
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,999
Anyway, the three
of them are seed players.

607
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
The first three places

608
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,096
belong to them.

609
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,239
Yes.

610
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,319
Meng Xiaodong.

611
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,200
Do you want to win the championship?

612
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,400
Unless I give up.

613
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,744
Let me do it.

614
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,080
My grandma just video-called me.

615
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,880
My grandma and brother want
to thank you.

616
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,399
You helped us rent the apartment.

617
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:08,960
Wu Wei helped a lot.

618
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,719
I did nothing.

619
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:12,439
But Wu Wei said

620
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,560
you found this apartment for him.

621
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:18,480
So I still have to thank you.

622
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,040
You have a brother?

623
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,160
He's my cousin,
Xiaotian's elder brother.

624
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:54,680
But

625
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,919
he has coached me playing pool
since I was little

626
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:57,919
He was very strict with me.

627
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,960
So he always says that he brought me up.

628
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,680
He's hard on me.

629
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,839
Is he?

630
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,879
However,

631
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
he's hard on me

632
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,359
for my own good.

633
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,719
He has a knack for coaching.

634
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,200
For example?

635
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:32,160
When I was little,

636
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,520
to make me good under pressure,

637
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,759
he would take me

638
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,200
to the noisiest billiard room.

639
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,960
And he let me play in the corner.

640
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:43,560
He would pick someone at random
to play against me.

641
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,120
So now,

642
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:47,560
any on-the-spot environment is easy

643
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,080
for me.

644
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,439
Just like listening to light music.

645
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,719
Master of emotions.

646
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,239
On the court,

647
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,640
an unemotional winning machine.

648
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,560
How do you know?

649
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,239
I read your interviews

650
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,680
when I searched

651
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,279
for the Nine-Ball Open online.

652
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,399
I see.

653
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,120
Sounds like what the journalists said.

654
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:09,799
Did I eat too much?

655
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,279
Haven't you slept yet?

656
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:24,040
Did I disturb you?

657
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:25,520
No.

658
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:27,719
I just want to go to the bathroom.

659
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,719
Good night.

660
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,439
You're not disturbing me. It's okay.

661
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,399
And I'm not sleepy yet.

662
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,879
I'll stay up for a while.

663
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,896
Good night.

664
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:02,664
(I have something to say.)

665
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,000
Well,

666
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,040
I promised your brother to take him

667
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,080
to a place tomorrow.

668
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,520
Okay.

669
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,719
Actually, you don't need to tell me.

670
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:36,120
He usually acts alone.

671
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,319
Wu Wei will also go.

672
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,408
Okay.

673
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,040
We won't be back until the afternoon.

674
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:46,960
So,

675
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,759
are you okay to be home alone?

676
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:54,359
Of course, sure.

677
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,864
And I have training tomorrow afternoon.

678
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,272
I won't be at home either.

679
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,799
