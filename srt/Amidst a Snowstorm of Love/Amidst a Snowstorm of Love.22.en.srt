00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:01,480
Very good.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,000
But you know the waiters also called you guys, right?

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,160
Everyone, listen.

28
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:14,399
Those who booked the hotel, follow me.

29
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,279
Those who get a place to stay,

30
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,719
have two days for rest.

31
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:22,840
We'd meet in two days. Dismiss, go.

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,480
Take care.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,040
Let's go.

34
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,279
Yiyang asked me to go with you.

35
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:32,584
Alright.

36
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,480
Alright, by the roadside, it's fine.

37
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,440
Don't you have an interview?

38
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,400
I told them it's a private trip,
so no interview.

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,080
Let's go home.

40
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,639
Nothing's changed, rooms stay the same.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,279
Everything is the same.

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,159
Xiaotian even set out the slippers.

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,960
Tian, we're back, where are you?

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
In the restroom, Yin Guo.

45
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,359
An'an, you take the bed of that room.

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,960
Okay, thank you then.
I have a sudden headache.

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,200
Go ahead.

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,719
Go.

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,960
Your room has been tidied up too,
stays the same.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,120
We're back.

51
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:05,600
We're back.

52
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:12,808
Yiyang.

53
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,679
Right, Yiyang, I need you
to check my paper,

54
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,799
and then I'll be leaving.

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,959
No problem.

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,519
Don't you see me?

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,079
Yin Guo.

58
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
Where are you going?

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Going back to the country,
Xiaodong wanted me back.

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,720
You're going back? Why? What for?

61
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,359
Don't worry about it.
It's just something.

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,839
Email me your paper
if you're in a hurry.

63
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,799
I'll check it later.

64
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,119
You're the best.

65
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,440
If you and my sister can't get married,
I'll be the first to say no.

66
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,679
Go for the championship!
Make a pair, really cool.

67
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,440
Why did Xiaodong suddenly call him back?

68
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,440
Won't it affect his study?

69
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,280
He has no classes lately.

70
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,880
He told you that?

71
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:16,079
Tian, visit grandma when you return,
she misses you so much.

72
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,600
I know, bye.

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,320
Take care of your belongings.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,280
I know, bye.

75
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,560
Xiaotian tells me everything lately.

76
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,079
He doesn't tell me anything anymore.

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,320
I've become an outsider now.

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,239
Let me see
if there's anything I need to buy.

79
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,959
I'll go to the supermarket later.
Do you want to eat anything?

80
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,119
Not something particular.
Just buy whatever you want.

81
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,519
Okay.

82
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,119
Xiaotian himself lived here for a month.

83
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,000
It shouldn't be too clean.

84
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,399
I'll take a shower first and tidy up
the bathroom, you can shower later.

85
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,839
I don't get you.

86
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,440
You would buy a fancy car,

87
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,399
but you're extremely frugal
to buy bags and clothes.

88
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,680
It's all I've seen.

89
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
I don't care about them.

90
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,240
I'm going.

91
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,560
(Ran into Lin Yiyang at the airport,
he's so charming.)

92
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:50,344
(Met a billiard player accidentally)

93
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,560
(Met my idol on the plane)

94
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,920
That's a pretty good shot.

95
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:08,744
(This guy is really cool,
his girlfriend is lucky to have him.)

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,240
(Alright, welcome
our guests to the event.)

97
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,200
(And the press conference
officially begins.)

98
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,159
(Now it's time for questions and answers.)

99
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:27,760
(Snooker China Open, Press Conference)
(You haven't played for a decade.)

100
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,800
(You're not familiar with
the field or the opponents.)

101
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,719
(Have you ever felt incapable?)

102
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:35,800
(No.)

103
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,599
You're starting your career at 29,

104
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
do you have any concerns about your age?

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,520
No.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,192
Is it true that you retired

107
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:51,639
because you got banned and frustrated?

108
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,320
Will you clear up the rumors
about match-fixing today?

109
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,079
(Why do you come back
after so long since retiring?)

110
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,039
(Are you trying to fight back
against those rumors)

111
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,279
(or just not willing to retire
with those rumors?)

112
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,920
To things in the past,

113
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,399
everyone has their own judgement.

114
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,639
Even if I clarify it
a hundred times today,

115
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,680
you'd think
it's the perfect answer to the public.

116
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,079
(I can't make everyone trust me.)

117
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
(And so do all of you here.)

118
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,719
So let bygones be bygones.

119
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Truth and justice inhabits one's heart.

120
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,800
The path of being an athlete
is very tough.

121
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,039
It won't last long
if one just wants to fight back.

122
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,399
Negative emotions cannot support
a person to get through all hardships.

123
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Only passion can
make one stick till the end.

124
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,440
I only come back today for one reason.

125
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,279
The path that belongs to Lin Yiyang
is not yet finished.

126
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,000
This path is mine,

127
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,599
and I have to finish it myself.

128
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,784
(Thank you, all the reporters here,)

129
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,240
(and thank Lin Yiyang
for today's wonderful game)

130
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,920
(and post-match interview.)

131
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,039
(Here, there's one last question.)

132
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,519
(As a star player,)

133
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,479
(not only do you have
to manage your public image,)

134
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:21,159
(but your relationship
will also be exposed to the public,)

135
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,479
(which bothers a lot of the star players.)

136
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,680
(Before you go back to China,
Jiang Yang and Meng Xiaodong)

137
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,560
(are already
the most popular players here.)

138
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,479
(Neither of them has a girlfriend yet,)

139
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,399
(which is always being
discussed on the Internet.)

140
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,479
(I wonder if you're ready to)

141
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,760
(be one of the most popular
bachelors in the industry)

142
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,159
(after you come back.)

143
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,800
(Or do you feel any pressure)

144
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,200
(to expose your future relationship
to the public?)

145
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,360
(Right, can you tell us?)

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,920
(Yes, we all want to know,
please do tell.)

147
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,839
(I really don't know
if Jiang Yang and Meng Xiaodong)

148
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,719
(have girlfriends.)

149
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,039
The only thing I can make sure

150
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:02,560
(is that I'm not single.)

151
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,512
(Not single!)

152
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:07,200
(How long have you two been together?)

153
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,839
(How long?)

154
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:09,680
(Fans want to know too.)

155
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,360
(Tell us something.)

156
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
(The only thing I can make sure)

157
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,039
(is that I'm not single.)

158
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,240
Do you enjoy it?

159
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,719
Hey you!

160
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,479
Wait, I haven't taken a shower yet.

161
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,879
I stink after a 10-hour flight.

162
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,440
It doesn't matter,
I've already taken the shower anyway.

163
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:48,400
No. I need to take a shower.

164
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,640
It'd be quick.

165
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,759
Your phone.

166
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:02,599
No.

167
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,599
I've changed the bed sheets and covers,
come lie down for a while.

168
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,560
I have to check the paper.

169
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:08,040
You just got here,
take a rest for a while.

170
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,800
I've been waiting for you.

171
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,640
Stop.

172
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
What's going on?

173
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:20,719
I wanted to kiss you on the plane.

174
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,719
Do you remember I came to
your billiard room on your birthday?

175
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,320
Yes.

176
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,239
Bro, welcome.

177
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,320
Yin Guo?

178
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,239
Come in, come in.

179
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:15,848
Okay.

180
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,079
Yin Guo is here.

181
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,796
Yin Guo is here.

182
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,119
Come on, I'll take that for you.

183
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:21,680
It's okay.

184
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,239
I got this.

185
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:22,839
I can do it.

186
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,360
Yin Guo.

187
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,520
Where did you come from?

188
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,959
Singapore, I've just
finished a competition.

189
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:31,119
That's so far.
Please have a seat and rest.

190
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,040
I hope I don't interrupt your training.

191
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,920
No, not at all.

192
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,520
Yiyang didn't tell us, or else
we would have picked you up.

193
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I'm here to surprise him
for his birthday.

194
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Bro, make a call now.

195
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,239
Give it to me.

196
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,119
I've just called him, thank you.

197
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,200
Come on, Yin Guo.

198
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,440
Do I interrupt your training?

199
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,664
- Not at all.
- Not at all, we...

200
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:52,108
Yiyang.

201
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,280
Yiyang.

202
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,999
Yiyang.

203
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:55,640
Yin Guo is here.

204
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,680
Yiyang, Yin Guo is here
for your birthday.

205
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,560
I think you should give her a hug.

206
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:05,719
- Right, hug.
- Hug.

207
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:08,280
- Hug.
- Hug.

208
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,560
- Hug.
- Hug.

209
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,800
- Hug.
- Hug.

210
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,599
Have you finished today's training plan?

211
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,280
Time for us to go.

212
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,320
Don't bother the two of them.

213
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:22,999
Continue.

214
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,759
Don't you shave?

215
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,599
I am busy this week.

216
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
You should pay attention to your image.

217
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,479
What's the point of it
if you're not around?

218
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,200
Are you happy?

219
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,599
What do you say?

220
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:24,879
I almost hit someone on the way down.

221
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,879
Are you tired?

222
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:35,759
Then, I'll take you
to catch up on some sleep.

223
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,160
Don't want to?

224
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,599
Yes, but I just got here,

225
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,759
it's a pity to catch up on sleep
without doing anything.

226
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,400
Let's celebrate your birthday first.

227
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,239
This is the second birthday
we spent together.

228
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,200
I really miss your small billiard room
and those people.

229
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,040
We'll go there.

230
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,432
Right, Lin Lin took special care
of me when I was training.

231
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,160
I wonder if she has ever liked
anyone other than Xiaodong.

232
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,959
Probably not.
Lin Lin has always been decisive.

233
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,520
If she doesn't like someone,
she'd never see him again.

234
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,520
Looking at her and Xiaodong,

235
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,359
I'm sure she still likes him,
so it's impossible to like anyone else.

236
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,959
So, Xiaodong's been
off his game all year,

237
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,079
maybe it has something to do
with this relationship.

238
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,560
No, Xiaodong isn't that fragile.

239
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:52,879
Anyway, his performance has
dropped dramatically over the past year.

240
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:56,839
I wonder why.
It lasts for half a season.

241
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,840
Do you think he can bounce back?

242
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,920
He's even younger than you.

243
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,840
I am just afraid
in case he does go downhill,

244
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,039
he won't accept it himself.

245
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:18,519
Athletes don't always
get paid for their work.

246
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,640
No matter how great the achievements,

247
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,959
what follows is the end.

248
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:32,920
It's just a matter of time.

249
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,360
Lin Lin once told Xiaodong
she just likes watching him

250
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:48,680
defeat others with a pretty face,

251
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
and he even makes the opponent cried

252
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:54,640
with that poker face.

253
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,840
Rest assured. If Xiaodong
still likes her, he will get back up.

254
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,239
You know so much about them.

255
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,400
After all, we've grown up together,
I've seen it all.

256
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Tell me more, keep on telling me.

257
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,039
An'an has awakened.

258
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:29,559
Are you awake?

259
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,200
What's wrong?

260
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,959
I heard Fifth said
there is a billiard room nearby.

261
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,208
Where is it? I should go train.

262
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,799
Wait for me, let's go together..

263
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,080
Okay, let me know when you are ready.

264
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,400
Time to get up.

265
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,279
Right, I haven't told you.

266
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,360
An'an will retire after this game.

267
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,279
This is his last Open tournament.

268
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,959
So soon?

269
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Just pretend you don't know it.

270
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,319
Actually, I am here to be with you

271
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,840
and for him.

272
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
He's always been stubborn.

273
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,479
No matter where he goes,
he starts training once he arrives,

274
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:38,680
and goes home right after the game,
saving every penny for the club.

275
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,519
I want to take him around

276
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,080
this time.

277
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,880
I'll be the host, he wouldn't say no.

278
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,279
Then I'll keep you company.

279
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,880
Lin.

280
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,200
Lin, you're back.

281
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,799
Hey guys.

282
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,400
Lin, Yin.

283
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,239
My little man.

284
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,568
Milo.

285
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,759
I miss you so much.

286
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,479
Miss you too.

287
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,999
Lin Yiyang has been
training here in Hel.

288
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,080
I came here last year.

289
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:20,296
Pretty good.

290
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,039
Let's head to those two
empty tables in the middle first.

291
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,592
Let's go.

292
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,200
Milo, get us some food and drinks.

293
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,784
Okay.

294
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,880
Come on, you two play,
and I'll be your free coach.

295
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,920
Can you handle it?
I'm not the one I used to be.

296
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:43,360
Well, then I'm the only one you have.

297
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,279
Then go for it.

298
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:52,799
Okay.

299
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:03,944
Tables will be unusual to refresh.

300
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:04,680
Okay.

301
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,239
He's so comfortable.

302
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,840
I felt the same way
the first time I saw him play.

303
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,600
In the other billiard room,
he was so arrogant,

304
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,840
while the opponent was
a famous regional champion.

305
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,279
He just said,
"Come on, show me what you got".

306
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:28,799
Him?

307
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,519
I can still clearly remember him

308
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,160
holding a cue stick in one hand
and playing the ball with another hand,

309
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,440
the way he talked to me with
his back turned was extremely arrogant.

310
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,920
Lin Yiyang, whom no one can control,
is truly himself.

311
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,759
But he's also quite contradictory.

312
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,999
On one hand, he's incredibly carefree,

313
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
drops whatever he doesn't want.

314
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:59,719
On the other hand,
he values friendship too much,

315
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,319
would be tied up for it.

316
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,719
Can I join you?

317
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,920
Yes, sure.

318
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,640
Everyone is contradictory.
People have multiple sides.

319
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,600
Sometimes I wonder

320
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,440
if we hadn't shown up,
and he'd still be here,

321
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,200
wouldn't that be nice?

322
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,039
You don't want him back?

323
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,640
I thought everyone
from Dongxin City came here

324
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,120
for the same reason, to get him back.

325
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:40,680
It's Jiang Yang
who wants him to go back.

326
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:44,519
Jiang Yang wants him to go back
and take over for Dongxin City.

327
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,120
Is it Mr. He who wants him to take over?

328
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:54,160
He didn't agree?

329
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,440
Right, he didn't agree.

330
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,080
I'm not very good.

331
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,519
It's okay, we are just having fun.

332
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,880
You used to be a coach?

333
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,120
How could you tell that?

334
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,479
I see you are training them just now.

335
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,239
They don't need me to train them.
They're all professionals.

336
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,559
I'm at most a sparring partner.

337
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,080
How much do you charge for an hour?

338
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:36,160
Shall we start timing just now?

339
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,719
Tonight is free.

340
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:40,440
Okay, thanks.

341
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,440
Nice.

342
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,559
Among us,

343
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,799
only he and Jiang Yang
are the disciples of Mr. He.

344
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,400
Everyone else has their own teacher.

345
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,400
My teacher left
in my second year in Dongxin City.

346
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,160
That year I was in the seventh grade,
and I was just average.

347
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:08,200
N-No teacher was willing to take me on.

348
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,080
But I didn't want to go
and wanted to stay.

349
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,640
But no one wanted to teach me
and I couldn't stay either.

350
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,719
It's Lin Yiyang
who asked Mr. He for help?

351
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:28,080
H-He went to talk
to the people at Dongxin City.

352
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,640
He said he'd teach me
as he was the champion.

353
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,999
He said it so arrogantly.

354
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,039
Because of this,

355
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,080
he offended many teachers
in Dongxin City.

356
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,600
They said he was so disrespectful,

357
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,479
dared to say and do anything
with Mr. He being his teacher.

358
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,160
However, anyone who heard
what he said would get angry.

359
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,640
But if Lin Yiyang didn't do so,

360
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,319
I might have changed my career.

361
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,799
Duncuo doesn't like to talk big.

362
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:06,880
His life philosophy is that only
being strong enough is the real strong.

363
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,999
He doesn't like the social thing.

364
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,239
When you're doing well,
he won't come to please.

365
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,719
When you're down, he'd still be there
even everyone else has left.

366
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,400
Are you drunk?

367
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:55,039
Well, I have a long way
from being drunk.

368
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,560

What? Are you going to feed me again?

372
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,200
Just wait.

Here, the ice creams for both of you.

379
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,920
How can you buy this
for me, a grown man?

380
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,200
Do you know? He'd take his brother
out when he was a kid.

381
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,120
Every time his brother got naughty,
he would only do three things.

382
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,080
Scared him, beat him, bought him food.

383
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,880
I guess he can only do the third one
to you, he can't do anything else.

384
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,999
You're right.
He loves treating people to meals.

385
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,279
It's the trick that won me over.

386
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:20,759
How could a junior from Bei City
have no one treat her to meals, right?

387
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,400
Right, but none compares to him.

388
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,600
Not even close.

389
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:47,640
Jealous?

390
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,200
You're lucky.

391
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,880
Lin, until midnight right,
everything on you.

392
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,680
All drinks, till next morning.

393
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,279
Everybody, all beers on Lin
until the morning.

394
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,400
Today is my lucky day, I got a hundred.

395
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,440
A hundred?

396
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,840
I never got a hundred before.

397
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,640
And I got a beer.

398
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,319
Wait for me.

399
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:29,999
I can't believe how lucky I am today.

400
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,759
It must be my lucky day today.

401
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,880
How lucky can I be today?

402
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,200
I don't know what else can happen.

403
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,759
Enjoy.

404
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
It's amazing, thank you.

405
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:52,160
Incredible.

406
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:18,920
This ice cream is really good.

407
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,319
Yiyang, I can't stand seeing it.

408
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,279
Just a pack of cigarettes
makes them so happy.

409
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,064
Tobacco taxes are high here,
so cigarettes are expensive.

410
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,840
Cigarettes sell in the price
of six times here than China.

411
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,440
They don't have a stable income,
so they rarely buy.

412
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,920
Then I'll buy them two more packs.

413
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,440
Stop.

414
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,239
Finally, I see you again.

415
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,759
To compete.

416
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,759
I know, the Nine-Ball Open.

417
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:15,120
Congratulations, this is for you.

418
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,160
Thanks.

419
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,680
Thank you.

420
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,400
Everyone seems to know him.

421
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,479
Right, when I first got here,
I felt like everyone knew him.

422
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,519
The owner of the ramen store
takes care of him.

423
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,719
The owner of the billiard room
reserves him a private room.

424
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,840
I even saw him playing with
others in another billiard room.

425
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,640
Just some closed random restaurant,

426
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,799
the owner even made ice cream for him.

427
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,360
It's not some random restaurant.

428
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,360
I worked for that restaurant before.

429
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:47,920
Right, I have to go back
to Helsin tomorrow

430
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,519
to have a meal with my mentor,

431
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,080
and take care of
some billiard room matters.

432
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,519
If you want to practice,
practice on your own.

433
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,032
If you want to go straight
to the hotel, then go there yourself.

434
00:33:57,032 --> 00:33:57,680
I got it.

435
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,200
Ramen.

436
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,039
Here.

437
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,559
Thank you.

438
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:06,959
Please enjoy.

439
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:07,559
Thank you.

440
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,880
(Bei City Club)
Yin Guo, I'm going out for a minute.

441
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,640
Okay.

442
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:31,692
(Bei City)

443
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,759
The renovation is quite nice.

444
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,999
Is Yiyang here?

445
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,880
Yes.

446
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,999
You are late.

447
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,200
Are you a prince? You made
an appointment an hour in advance.

448
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,479
It's good I got here now.

449
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:52,640
I'm not from Bei City,
I don't have to be on call for you.

450
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,640
Isn't that...

451
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,479
Right, the boss of Dongxin City.

452
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,816
Who is it?

453
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,959
I found you a chief physician,
who's experienced, a friend of my dad's.

454
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,400
He operated on my dad back in the day.

455
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,080
Didn't expect you really care about me.

456
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,360
I just don't want
to lose a good opponent.

457
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:39,920
It's difficult to get one back,
I don't want to lose one now.

458
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Lin Yiyang came back
and you've become more like a human.

459
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,880
In these years without Lin Yiyang,

460
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,120
it's not easy for you to hold up
Dongxin City and me to hold up Bei City.

461
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,080
Thanks. Since I'm here,
I'll play a game with you.

462
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,960
I'm about to have surgery.
I don't know when the next game is.

463
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,680
How's it? You had a good time today?

464
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,319
I can't drink anymore.

465
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:22,919
I'll get you water.

466
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,279
No, Yiyang, let's chat for a bit.

467
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,759
If it's about Dongxin City, just stop.

468
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,439
I just made it clear to Jiang Yang
before getting on the plane this time.

469
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,160
I'm so troubled.

470
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,520
On one hand, I like the way you're free.

471
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,040
On the other hand,
I hope you to come back.

472
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:05,560
I don't go back.

473
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,120
I'm still from Dongxin City, but...

474
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,600
I won't go back to take over.

475
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,919
Mr. He has made up his mind
to hand over Dongxin City to Lin Yiyang?

476
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:31,239
He has this plan.

477
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:47,799
Are you okay with it,
giving away the power?

478
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,040
Yes, but no if it's Duncuo.

479
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,200
Really?

480
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,399
Really. I always felt like
I owe that kid.

481
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:08,239
Back then, I should have done more.

482
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,919
I am the closest person to them.

483
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,359
We were young back then.

484
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,200
What can you do if you're older?

485
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,799
But I really didn't expect
Lin Yiyang to retire completely.

486
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:29,799
Who could've thought that?

487
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:34,879
So you took advantage of this surgery

488
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,160
to force him to take over?

489
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,439
I have to have my surgery
sooner or later.

490
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,480
I'm just taking advantage of this,

491
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,919
if he can take over, then I don't have
to worry about Dongxin City.

492
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,560
I'm sure the recovery will be quick.

493
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,839
Isn't this a perfect solution?

494
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,439
Wait. You bring him the water.

495
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,359
Forget it, I'm afraid
he'll talk to me again.

496
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,239
Do you want me
to talk to you for a while?

497
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:27,279
Do I look like I need
someone to talk to?

498
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,319
I am different from An'an.

499
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:41,359
I'm pretty neutral
about the matter of Dongxin City.

500
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,640
Whether you open
your own billiard room or go back,

501
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:50,359
it makes no difference to me.

502
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:01,120
Come on, talk. I'm waiting.

503
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,000
About what?

504
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,359
I don't know. Whatever you want to talk.

505
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,080
Whatever makes you happy.

506
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,200
I don't want to let Mr. He down,

507
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,759
or reject him.

508
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,319
If it were anything else,

509
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,520
I'd do anything, but not this one.

510
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,040
That's Jiang Yang's work.

511
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,839
Dongxin City is not mine
or anyone else's.

512
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:57,080
Taking Dongxin City
to where it is today since he was young,

513
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,439
is really difficult.

514
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,200
Although leading
Dongxin City is difficult,

515
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,919
I know Lin Yiyang will
make it even better.

516
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,560
He's not like me or Xiaodong,

517
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:11,879
he started his career
and won championships late.

518
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,279
His achievements come from hard work.

519
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,799
Over the years, he has kept up
with his personal achievements,

520
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:23,919
and the club has grown stronger.

521
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:31,239
You can imagine the effort
he made behind all this.

522
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,640
Because I've made so much effort,
so I want to make it better.

523
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,640
I don't deserve it.

524
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,160
He's better than me.

525
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,160
And my ideas are new.

526
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,680
A big billiard club like Dongxin City,

527
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:48,319
a reform will surely
be a major undertaking.

528
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,160
A reform is a good opportunity
for Dongxin City.

529
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:54,319
Even if it's a major undertaking,
it's worth it.

530
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:56,759
Left at 16 years old,

531
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,120
I never went back or made any effort,
why should I take over it?

532
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:05,279
I want him to come back.

533
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:14,120
I don't think you could
figure it out overnight.

534
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,759
Don't worry and take your time.

535

Whatever you decide anyway,

536

I'm always on your side.

537
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,080
Alright, just won a World Championship,
you should be happy.

538
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,040
I still can't sleep.

539
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,000
I'll get some water.

540
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,919
I drank that glass of water.
