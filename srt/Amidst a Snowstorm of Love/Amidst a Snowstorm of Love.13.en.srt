00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,600
That's true.

64

I'll wait for you out there.

65
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,440
It's going to be an awesome game.

66
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,480
I remember that Hinia
was the champion of the Singapore Open.

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,280
Yeah, she's ranking third in the world.

68
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,600
How long haven't you been to a game?

69
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,000
For 11 years.

70
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,799
It's surreal.

71
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,159
I never thought that
I'd be in the audience seat.

72
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,200
You don't have to do that.

73
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,479
Honestly, I wouldn't know what to say
even if you want me

74
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,760
to consolidate you.

75
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,279
I've aged

76
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,639
and I have a stent here.

77
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,079
I've seen a lot.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,760
I think you've been avoiding this

79
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,959
because you're still troubled.

80
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,800
That's the only reason.

81
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,719
Now entering is Yin Guo from China.

82
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,680
And Hinia from Russia.

83
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,240
Let's give them a round of applause.

84
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,360
The players Yin Guo encountered
along the way were all veteran players.

85
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,910
As a young prospect,

86
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,000
it's already a great success for her
to achieve this point.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,839
I bet you don't want to
become her opponent.

88
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,279
China's women's Nine-Ball team

89
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,719
has always been the top in the world.

90
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,719
So it's not surprising
that she's come this far.

91
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:39,440
After all, all the new faces with talent
and skills in recent years are from China.

92
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
the quarter-final is about to start.

93
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:53,129
And the referee
has signaled to the two players

94
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,240
to start pinning
for their right to break.

95
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,200
Three, two, one, go.

96
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,039
Hinia, break.

97
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,760
Hinia has always been lucky.

98
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,120
And this time,
she also got the right to break.

99
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,800
It seems like a very good start for her.

100
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,440
But we will see how it goes.

101
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,000
She's going to sit for quite a while.

102
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,719
(Live 2022 HULL 9-BALL OPEN)
Hinia has won five rounds.

103
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,920
So in the sixth one,
she still has the right to break.

104
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,079
Here's her chance.

105
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,119
Yin Guo is under a lot of pressure

106
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,759
but she's very good at
winning in difficult situations.

107
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,160
Guo, here's your chance.

108
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,920
Yin Guo can handle pressure.

109
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
It is just the beginning.

110
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:33,032
(Hinia 5 VS Yin Guo 5)

111
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,759
She's so fast and furious.

112
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,400
Why were you playing so fast?
Are you scared of losing?

113
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,479
Throughout the years away from the game,

114
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:00,079
there are no points or rules.

115
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,759
I learned to truly enjoy billiards.

116
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,800
I play fast because I enjoy it.

117
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,359
(Enjoy it. Yin Guo, it's your career
for the next few decades.)

118
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,160
Seven rounds in a row. Zero mistake.

119
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,440
Guo is stunningly steady.

120
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,999
This season, this Chinese player's
giving us huge surprises.

121
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,879
She's definitely a new face
that can not be ignored.

122
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,599
She knows everything
about the Nine-Ball table so well.

123
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,599
It requires a jump shot.

124
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,520
Congratulations
to the Chinese player Yin Guo.

125
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:23,688
Congratulations to Yin Guo
for entering the quarter-finals.

The Nine-Ball is a warm-up.

160
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,792
Just a second.

161
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,360
Wanna hang out?

162
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:15,880
Of course.

163
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,640
Snooker players like us
rarely gather for Nine-Ball.

164

165
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:24,319
How?

166
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,400
I'll get a hotel suite and some drinks.

167
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,640
It's cozy to stay in and drink.

168
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,440
It can be pricy. Let's split the bill.

169
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,479
I'll get our drinks.

172
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,640
I was broke and never had a chance
to get you drinks.

173
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,600
I may not be so well off now,

174
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,920

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,759
But I have a roommate.

182
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,096
I know.

183
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,319
You got a room here?

184
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,880
Yeah, the apartment is too far away.

185
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:09,479
I have to stay here for the final.

186
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,319
How do you know
I can make it to the final?

187
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,160
Almost there.

188
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,799
Let's get in first.

189
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,959
Why did you go for the bottom pocket
when it's cooler to go

190
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,519
for the middle pocket?

191
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,559
I-I'm better with the thin cut.

192
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,279
Are you upset?

193
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,856
I'm leaving soon.

194
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:58,632
When?

195
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,080
Thursday.

196
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,959
I have a competition in Hangzhou
at the end of April.

197
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,559
You haven't even finished this game

198
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,400
and you can't manage?

199
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,360
Come on.

200
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:32,519
Let me see. It's Saturday.

201
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,519
Thursday is just
around the corner indeed.

202
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,680
So hug me now.

203
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,880
Hug me as much as you can.

204
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:23,688
(Li Qingyan Income Call)

205
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:30,216
(Li Qingyan)

206
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,880
Hello.

207
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,200
I couldn't talk to you back there.

208
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,640
Congratulations. You won again.

209
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:38,840
Thanks.

210
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,279
Guo.

211
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,600
I wanted to talk to you

212
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,120
once my world ranking improves
after the Ireland Open.

213
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,880
It's a bit complicated.

214
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,920
After we go back...

215
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,680
Wait...

216
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,640
What?

217
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,400
It's business.

218
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,519
Lin Yiyang is here.
He needs a word with you.

219
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,192
Okay.

220
00:26:27,564 --> 00:26:28,552
(Speaker)

221
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,136
Hello.

222
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,959
I don't have Meng Xiaodong's number.

223
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,479
So I'm using Guo's.

224
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,479
Did you get the drinks?

225
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,096
Yeah.

226
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,440
Which room? What time?

227
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,120
Room 677 at 20:00.

228
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,080
Alright, go ahead.

229
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,440
Let's talk later if that's it.

230
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,880
S-Shall we get up there?

231
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,039
Go ahead. I want to take a walk.

232
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:16,999
I'll be practicing.

233
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,279
The pizza is amazing.

234
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,080
I'll be out for a while.

235
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,039
Where?

236
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,120
Your brother and Jiang Yang
got a room and want to hang out.

237
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:48,552
Okay.

238
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:52,519
I may be late. We'll be drinking.

239
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Okay, I'll wait for you here.

240
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,880
I'm a bit tired. I'll take a nap.

241
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,024
Okay.

242
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:09,864
See you.

243
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Everybody's here.

244
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,640
Let's play later.

245
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,160
No problem.

246
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:36,279
Yiyang.

247
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,120
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

248
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,680
Yiyang.

249
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:42,799
Hey.

250
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,160
You're late. Drink up to apologize.

251
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,400
Sit. You're the guest here.

252
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,440
I'll take a sip.

253
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,719
Come on, guys.

254
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,279
Go ahead. Let me take a break.

255
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,600
- Xiaodong.
- Okay.

256
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,680
Where?

257
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,719
No, here.

258
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,360
Meng Xiaodong.

259
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,480
I'm okay.

260
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,319
Yiyang, if there is anything
you want to know, ask away.

261
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,239
He's going to pass out soon.

262
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,160
You want to ask me about my sister
and her childhood friend Li Qingyan?

263
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:40,759
I never asked her.

264
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,880
But her parents kind of like him.

265
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,160
They must have broken up
even if they were once together.

266
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,999
But someone from her family

267
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,080
was a referee in that game

268
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,440
and knew about your past.

269
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,080
You know which game I'm talking about.

270
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,039
My last game.

271
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,200
You're never going to play again?

272
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,920
I quit a long time ago.

273
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,880
Lin Yiyang, look at me.

274
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,239
You still have a chance to start over.

275
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,480
Fan.

276
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,680
Get Xiaodong some water.

277
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,120
Come on, you're wasted
after a few bottles?

278
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,039
Xiaodong, you're so...

279
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,039
I'm exhausted.

280
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,319
What's wrong? Why are you so silent?

281
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,880
Any tables available?

282
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,880
I rented half the billiard room.
Go ahead.

283
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,479
I'll get them to clear up the table.

284
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,239
I invited your guy to play.

285
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,248
The Ireland Open is coming.
Don't be too harsh.

286
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:50,999
I know.

287
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,640
Keep an eye on Xiaodong.

288
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,920
Let them be. Go on.

289
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,360
Yeah, cheers.

290
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,880
Cheers.

291
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,200
This is how we played when we were kids.

292
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,999
Got it?

293
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,319
Yeah. There are no rules.
Just pocket the balls.

294
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,640
Whoever pockets the last ball wins.

295
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,200
Whoever loses will
put the balls in place, okay?

296
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,799
No problem.
I'll be bragging about it for years

297
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:47,799
after you place the balls for me.

298
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:52,880
You're in a good mood.

299
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,519
You lost your chance.

300
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,560
Thanks.

301
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,656
Thanks.

302
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,279
I lost.

303
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,600
A word of advice.

304
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:56,919
I've seen you play.

305
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,839
You follow Meng Xiaodong's style

306
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,560
and train yourself to play
every 25 seconds, right?

307
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,480
That's the tournament rule.

308
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,120
Don't let it confine you.

309
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,160
Waiting for 25 seconds every time

310
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:22,600
may work only for Meng Xiaodong.
It doesn't work for you.

311
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:28,439
Remember, don't waste your talent.

312
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,680
You're a contestant, not a robot.

313
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,879
Another thing.

314
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:03,319
I don't care how close you were

315
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,399
or if you're still pursuing her,

316
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,480
that's it.

317
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,439
Yin Guo is mine. Do you hear me?

318
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,480
Lin Yiyang.

319
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,759
(Snooker tryouts)
That wasn't a foul.

320
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:20,239
Mind your attitude
or you'll be disqualified.

321
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,520
I can finish the game.

322
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,480
But again, I didn't break the rule.

323
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,640
(Lin Yiyang, apologize to the referee.)

324
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,439
(Winning the last game doesn't mean
you can disrespect the referee.)

325
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,919
(You'll be forbidden to play like this.)

326
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:37,120
(No need. I'll retire now.)

327
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:58,952
Hello.

328
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:01,080
Come on, where are you, man?

329
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:02,640
Is there any

330
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,799
fine pastry shop open

331
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,799
at this hour?

332
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,640
Guo won the game today.

333
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,200
I want to get something
for the celebration.

334
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,359
Come on, it's so late.
Everybody's closed.

335
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:23,439
Is there any?

336
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,279
Come on.

337
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:30,000
Fine, go to the Central Plaza.

338
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,560
Head down the stairs
and there's a pastry shop.

339
00:41:34,279 --> 00:41:36,759
Got it. Thanks.

340
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,319
You're still drinking?

341
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,080
(He's not back yet.
The two clubs are gathering.)

342
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:44,319
(And it's been so many years.)

343
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,560
(How drunk are they going to be?)

344
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,359
Xiaodong, are you done drinking?

345
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,279
(How's it going?
Nobody is replying to my messages.)

346
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,680
