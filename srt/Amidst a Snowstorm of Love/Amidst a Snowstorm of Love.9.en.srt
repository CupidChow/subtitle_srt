=Episode 9=

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,879
My brother rented
the billiard room of the hotel.

26
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,879
Everyone's there.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,239
I'm going to meet my coach.

28
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:28,959
Would you like to come along?

29
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,224
If you want me to.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,359
Hi, Guo.

31
00:02:58,999 --> 00:02:59,760
Senior.

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,880
You're so early today.

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,639
Guo, I thought you'd come at night.

34
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,320
Hi.

35
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,279
My coach asked to see me.
Why is everybody here?

36
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,040
We were going to the tournament.

37
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,120
But Xiaodong sent us here first.

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
I guess he's concerned
about your pro contest.

39
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,880
Where's my coach?

40
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,639
He's been waiting.

41
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,559
But I think he went to talk to Mr. Wang.

42
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,279
Alright, I'll go find him.

43
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,040
So...

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,799
I'll wait here.

45
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,600
Okay, I'll be fast, 20 minutes tops.

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,919
Or half an hour.

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,639
No rush.

48
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,760
Nice to meet you, man.

49
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,648
Nice to meet you.

50
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,560
Do you play?

51
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,600
Sometimes.

52
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,639
An amateur?

53
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,720
We have a rule that whoever visits

54
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,200
our billiard room has to play.

55
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,560
Not snooker.

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,920
Nine-Ball?

57
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,359
Set up the Chinese Billiards

58
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,239
on a Nine-Ball table.

59
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,639
Whoever visits our billiard room

60
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,320
is either one of us or a friend.

61
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,040
Play if you want to make friends.

62
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,839
Or it's hard to convince us.

63
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,280
Unless you tell us
that you never play billiards.

64
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,040
Then we won't force you.

65
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,399
You said you don't play snooker.

66
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,560
No, I don't.

67
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,919
Put the red ball
anywhere you want. Fifty attempts.

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,399
I lose if I fail to pocket three times.

69
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,039
Is he a pro?

70
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,399
I guess. He's not timid in front of us.

71
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,959
He's obviously confident.

72
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,519
Don't give him a hard time. Start easy.

73
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,440
Be polite.

74
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,560
Not bad.

75
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,256
Second one.

76
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,399
Third one.

77
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,159
What a pity, though.

78
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,000
The reward wasn't that great.
He was better than your brother

79
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,399
but he barely got any money.

80
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,120
He could buy a few houses
with the bonus they offer today.

81
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,200
But it's okay. He's young.
He has a bright future.

82
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,800
Your boyfriend?

83
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,120
Li Qingyan is battling with him inside.

84
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,599
Let me see.

85
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Chill, your darling is winning.

86
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,240
They...

87
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,120
It's just basic training,
nothing serious.

88
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,800
He's pocketing the ball 50 times.
It's just play.

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,120
It seems that
the senior is quite considerate.

90
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,079
Why would you say that?

91
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,800
The tournament is coming.

92
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,680
If they play for real,

93
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,039
they'd be devastated once they lose.

94
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,599
Your guy is obviously
trying to protect them.

95
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,560
What a nice kid.

96
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:52,519
Li Qingyan may not lose.

97
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,120
Xiaodong is very proud of him
as a disciple.

98
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,399
That guy in there
was crushing Meng Xiaodong

99
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,519
in all the contests back then.

100
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,519
My brother can't be that bad.

101
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,519
Alright, bro.

102
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,000
We're late for the party.

103
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:30,719
There is no party.

104
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,880
It's just some simple training.

105
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,440
Meet my coach, Mr. Chen.

106
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,000
Hello, Mr. Chen, I'm Lin Yiyang.

107
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,736
I'm Chen Fang.

108
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,680
He's really good.
He pocketed all of them.

109
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
This is Lin Yiyang. I learned
about him right before the trip.

110
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,079
He was the peer of Xiaodong.

111
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:53,959
That's why he looks so professional.

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,872
Nice to meet you.

113
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,479
Aren't you catching the train?

114
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,039
I've got to go.

115
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Let's go. Hurry up. Don't be late.

116
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:18,536
Okay.

117
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,079
He's proud, composed,

118
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,359
and well-mannered.
He's good enough for you. Go ahead.

119
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,599
I'll be right back.

120
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,839

121
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,200

on the weekend.

139
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,820
Okay.

140
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,520
You have nothing else to say?

141
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,520
We'll be apart for a week.

142
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:15,839
We can text each other.

143
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,759
I'm not leaving this week.

144
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,520
It's going to be early April.

145
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:38,879
Wait for me.

146
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:42,560
I may be back

147
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,079
next Thursday.

148
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,400
Just give me a second.

149
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,959
Lin Yiyang.

150
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:14,600
Hi.

151
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,359
I haven't seen you in weeks.

152
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:21,160
The players are staying here. Are you...

153
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,320
No, I accompanied Yin Guo here.

154
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:25,959
I'm late for the train.

155
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:31,359
You're already together. Impressive.

156
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,920
Hey, sorry about that.

157
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,160
I-I just want to ask you something.

158
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,959
Do you have a girlfriend here?

159
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,719
Or someone in between?

160
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,440
(What's going on?)

161
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,032
(What's going on?)

162
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,440

163

in the metro. Trust me.)

I'll see you off. On my way now.

167
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,719
See you at the station. Wait for me.

168
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,599
Okay, take the tram outside the hotel.

169
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,784
I'll be at the next stop.

170
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,599
Guo.

171
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,520
Your parents told me
to bring you something.

173
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,160
Are you coming back for dinner?
I'll wait for you.

174
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,959
I'm not sure. Don't wait up.

175

I'm having dinner with a senior.

176

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,719
I spoke with the coach.

205
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,120
So I can see you off
at the station and come back.

206
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,999
You've been commuting.

207
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:37,039
I should see you off once.

208
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,719
Say something
or I'll hop off at the next stop.

209
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,799
I'm dumb with words.

210
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,719
I'd hate to upset you.

211
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:12,440
Are you always like this?

212
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,536
More or less.

213
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,400
I don't have a problem talking to guys.

214
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,999
What about girls?

215
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,920
Girls? I guess they're scared of me.

216
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,719
They rarely approach me.

217
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,120
Haven't you ever approached someone?

218
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,200
Never?

219
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,600
(No way. You approached me.)

220
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,160
Why did you ask

221
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,559
if I have a girlfriend at school?

222
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,880
It's going too fast.

223
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,479
I'm not quite at ease.

224
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,840
Tell me how to prove myself.

225
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,559
Come on, I'm here to see you off.

226
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,999
I wouldn't come
if I didn't believe in you.

227
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,600
I've been busy

228
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,080
having lessons, doing part-time jobs,
and training since I came.

229
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,799
It's even worse

230
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,976
with the graduation this year.

231
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,319
I've been looking for a walk,
getting my credits, applying for a PhD,

232
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,440
and training every day.

233
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,319
And now

234
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,719
I'm traveling back and forth.

235
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,999
Trust me. I don't have time
for anything else

236
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,559
apart from sleeping and you.

237
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,519
What do you mean by "sleeping and me"?

238
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,200
Sorry.

239
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:24,559
Inappropriate expression.
But you get it.

240
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:22,092
(Train Station)

241
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,360
I'll try to be back early.

242
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:47,976
Okay.

243
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,799
I gotta go.

244
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
(I got you a cab.)

245
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,959
(I'll take the tram back. It's easy.)

246
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,880
(The car is there. Go ahead. Be good.)

247
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,840
Is this Mr. Lin's reservation?

248
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,039
Yeah.

249
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,400
Yes, come inside.

250
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,959
Do you need help?

251
00:25:42,184 --> 00:25:43,319
Okay.

252
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,559
If you don't mind, I can hold your baby.

253
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,959
Thanks.

254
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,384
Hi, there.

255
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,920
I need to take my baby home
every weekend to see my parents.

256
00:25:58,719 --> 00:26:00,160
That's why I have to commute.

257
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:01,580
Yeah.

258
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,400
Okay, okay.

259
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,799
You don't look so well. Are you okay?

260
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,319
Yeah, I'm okay.

261
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,959
If you need some hot water or something,

262
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,279
just let me know. I have some.

263
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,039

(I've arrived.)

(Lin)

300
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,039
Guo.

301
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,920
Missing him?

302
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,680
No.

303
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,080
It's just that he hasn't texted me.

304
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
I don't know if he has arrived.

305
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,920
Isn't he older than you?

306
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,920
Why are you so worried?

307
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,640
He texted me last week.

308
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,840
(Text me once you're there.)

309
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,279
Bedtime. I'm going to brush my teeth.

310
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,279
Listen, Guo.

311
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,496
You're so worried
when you're just in different cities.

312
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,239
What will you do after you go back home?

313
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,559
You'll be in different countries.

314
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,360
As far as I know,

315
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,600
long-distance relationships rarely work.

316
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,279
And you'll be in different countries.

317
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,759
How is it going to last?

318
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,279
I didn't think that much.

319
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:26,200
We've started dating. So I'll try.

320
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,719
Right, good luck to you.

321
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,488
(Text me once you're there.
I've arrived.)

322
00:32:56,044 --> 00:32:57,196
(I've arrived.)

323
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,120
(I've arrived.)

324
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,640
(He just arrived?)

325
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,319
(It's four in the morning.)

326
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:33,080
(Anything happened on the way?
It's so late.)

327
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:54,880
(It's so late
and I guess he has to unpack)

328
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,479
(and shower before bed.)

329
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:33,920
The key person
linking the two major clubs has arrived.

330
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,600
Talk nicely.

331
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,319
We can be in-laws
after all these years of battling.

332
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm truly delighted.

333
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:42,239
Are you done?

334
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,160
What's so funny?

335
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,959
I-I always thought that

336
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,080
you were arch-enemies.

337
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,519
Not really. He can't win me.

338
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:02,999
When is Lin Yiyang coming?

339
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,624
On the weekend.

340
00:35:08,428 --> 00:35:10,559
He usually comes
on the weekend after school.

341
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:15,360
How's it going?

342
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,279
Pretty well.

343
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,799
He's still studying.

344
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,559
That's different from us.

345
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,120
He has no time or money.

346
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,640
Stop. I don't mind it.

347
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:38,400
I think it's nice.

348
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,479
It counts as a positive.

349
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:41,719
Why are you belittling him?

350
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:43,880
Alright, go practice.

351
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,160
Aren't you coming?

352
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,519
I got a billiard room somewhere else.

353
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,640
What were you whispering?

354
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,879
Your brother rented this billiard room.

355
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,879
I asked if he could share it with me

356
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,200
to save me some trouble.

357
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,080
He agreed?

358
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,439
We're going to be in-laws.

359
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,480
Why would he say no?

360
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:27,016
Go ahead.

361
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:40,359
Yin Guo.

362
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,879
- Hello.
- Hi, Yin Guo.

363
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:46,312
Hello.

364
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,560
Senior.

365
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Those guys are really nice to you.

366
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,600
It's probably because my brother

367
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,640
is sharing the billiard room
with Jiang Yang.

368
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:08,480
Someone is playing dumb now?

369
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:14,120
It's obviously
because of your sweetheart.

370
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,120
Chengyan.

371
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,232
What are you looking at?

372
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,480
Lin Yiyang's girlfriend.

373
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,560
She's not just his girlfriend.

374
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,919
She's also the champion
of the last Youth Competition

375
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
and the potential winner from Bei City.

376
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,000
You're terrified by a new girl?

377
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,759
You got me wrong. It's anticipation.

378
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,560
Every dark horse
is worth the anticipation.

379
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,824
Guo.

380
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
What's wrong?

381
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,640
The Nine-Ball team leader
of Dongxin City has been watching you.

382
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:39,040
Chengyan?

383
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,799
She was watching me?

384
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,120
For what?

385
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,359
Who knows?

386
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,759
Maybe she finds you threatening.

387
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,600
I'm new among so many pro players.
Why would she feel threatened?

388
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,439
Who is the woman next to her?

389
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:10,960
A very senior player.

390
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,719
She retired before I made my debut.

391
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,879
And she's back this year.

392
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
What a fierce competition.

393
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:22,919
Keep practicing.

394
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,080
Okay.

395
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,744
We got this.

396
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,239
(I have a game to watch today
and can't have dinner with you.)

397
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,279
(Have dinner with Wu Wei.)

398
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,919
(I can't make it today. It's fine.)

399
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,000
(Are you coming back tomorrow as usual?)

400
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,160
(I'm unexpectedly busy this week.)

401
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,279
(I'll be back early next week.)

402
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,304
Guo.

403
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,279
Why are you here?

404
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,239
To spend the weekend with you.

405
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,680
I'm busy. Entertain yourself.

406
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,919
Yiyang sent me here.

407
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,520
Wait.

408
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,279
Look, he booked a table
at the restaurant

409
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:17,160
and gave me the money

410
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,120
to take you out from Thursday to Sunday.

411
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,839
Wait, why are you
making him pay for our dinner?

412
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,839
He said it's between you two

413
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,279
and I'd be a laborer.

414
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,279
He just texted you?

415
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:38,359
I think it was midnight. Let me see.

416
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,040
Two in the morning.

417
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,319
He arranged for it last night?

418
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,279
Because he cares about you.

419
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,160
Forget about the dinner,
but don't tell him yet.

420
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,480
And wire me the money.
Don't embezzle it.

421
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,919
How dare I embezzle
my brother-in-law's money?

422
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:29,000
Brother-in-law?

423
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,839
It's transferred.

424
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:37,224
Right.

425
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,520
Do you need money
to date my brother-in-law?

426
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,719
Should I give you some?

427
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:42,919
Why?

428
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,040
Wu Wei keeps implying to me
that my brother-in-law is broke

429
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,439
because he's a student
and may not be treating you well.

430
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:55,040
Wait, your brother...

431
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:58,680
He's not broke.

432
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,352
Besides, all the students are like that.

433
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:03,120
I like that about him.

434
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,319
I think it's great.

435
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,279
Alright, just tell me
when you need money.

436
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,160
What's your problem?

437
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,000
I've won a lot of prize money, okay?

438
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,399
You're already defending him?

439
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:22,279
That's it.

440
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:23,879
I must hurry up and go to the training.

441
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:24,520
