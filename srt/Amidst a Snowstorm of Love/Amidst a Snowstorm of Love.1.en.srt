Where is the cab?

200
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,320
Ten minutes away.

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,280
I need to use the bathroom.

202
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,200
Me, too.

00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:44,759

a student?

210
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:05,719
Or

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,479
are you working here?

My student ID.

217

Take a look.

(I guess it's alright.)

221
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,920
And my passport.

222
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,599
Take a look.

223
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,680
Is that my face?

224
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,119
Yeah...

225
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,400
Thanks.

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
when we're not looking?

229
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,520
Tell you what.

230
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,280
He's a fraud.

231
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,560
It's way too easy

232
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,400
to forge his ID.

233
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,400
Ask for his Hukou registration.

234
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
No need.

235
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,999
Thanks.

It's okay. I got this.

241

the light one.

242
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,680
I got this, thanks.

243
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,239
Check, please.

244
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,079

You ran out of food?

297
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,999
I forgot my keys.

298
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,040
Wu Wei got his phone off.

299
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,119
I couldn't find him.

300
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:51,759
Where's your roommate?

301
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,359
No idea.

302
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,839
We don't talk.

303
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,759
I've been working on the thesis

304
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,239
and haven't slept.

305
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,839
Let me

306
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,160

307
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,680
My son came today.

308
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,079
Let me wake him up.

309
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,040
How can I bully the kid?

310
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,839
I guess I will

311
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,959
sleep here.

312
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,800
Finally in bed.

00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,479

316
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,759
Won't you thank me?

317
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,160
Thanks, sis.

318
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
Although

319
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,119
I'm only three hours older than you,

320
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,280
well,

321
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,999
I'm way too responsible.

322
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,160
I have to look after you forever.

323
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,599
Right, sis.

324
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,839
The handsome guy
showed you his student ID?

325
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:39,479
Yeah.

326
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,359
That was awkward.

327
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,560
But I didn't expect him

328
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,759
to be from Zheng Yi's university.

329
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,520
Really?

330
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,560
Top student.

331
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,319

333
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,120

334
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,239
No, thank you.

335
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,519
I repaid your

336
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:26,759
(Transfer)
200k.

337
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,680
Check it.

338
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:29,719
Sorry.

339
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,440
It's urgent, otherwise,

340
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
I won't urge you to pay back.

341
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
I owe you money.

342
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,999
Not the other way around.

343
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,799
Silly kid.

344
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,360

345
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,600

Okay.

347
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,360
Go sit. I'll bring it over.

352
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,920
I wanted to.

353
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:12,999
But I don't know what to say.

354
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,360
Why so hesitant?

355
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,880
I'll send you his name card.

356
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,200
Add him now.

357
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,360
We just talked.

358
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,479
He's on the phone.

359
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,400
Okay.

360
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,440
Take a look.

361
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:47,840
I got this.

362
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,600
Sis.

363
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,239
Where's mine?

364
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,799
Do it yourself.

365
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:57,680
Come on...

366
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,840
What?

367
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,880
Give it back.

368
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,039
- Give it back.
- Wait.

369
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:28,120
Give it back, Meng Xiaotian.

370
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:28,920

371
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,840
No.

372
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
I'll send a smiley face.

373
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,239
Look.

374
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:38,279
I haven't decided

375
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,519

376
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,120
It's okay.

377

He's very nice.

378
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,039
Just ask him

379
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,279
out for dinner.

380
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,080
We promised last night

381
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,719

382
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,080

385

(I know.)

387

388
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,160

389
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:55,759
(If you're available,)

390
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,080
(let us buy you food to show)

391
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,959
(our gratitude.)

392
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,999
(What do you think?)

393
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,400
(Not scared to be scammed?)

394
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:49,600
(We just arrived.)

395
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
(It's our first visit. Plus the storm.)

396
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,640
(I was totally lost.)

397
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,200
(Sorry,)

398
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,039
(I doubted you.)

399
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,360
(No problem.)

400
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,759
(Where are you?)

401
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,759
(We can come by.)

402
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,479
(At the train station.)

403
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,559
(Heading back to school.)

404
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,600
What did he say?

405
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:35,999
He's heading back to school.

406
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,959
Already?

407
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:41,519
Yeah.

408
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,039
That's easy.

409
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,559
Let's follow him

410
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,920
and have some fun.

411
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,479
No more trouble.

412
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,999
We don't have to do it today.

413
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,640
- It's okay...
- No!

414
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,999
Who chases after someone to another city

415
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,479
to buy them a meal?

416
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,360
That's sick.

417
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,400
Sis.

418
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,519
Fine, next time.

419
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,200
Next time.

420
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,880
We finally settled in.

421
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:09,959
I'm still tired.

422
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,680
I just think that

423
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:12,999
we should

424
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
pay him back well.

425
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,920
There will be a chance.

426
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,759
(Lin.)

427
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,319
(Why did you leave so soon?)

428
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,360
(We owe you a meal.)

429
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,479
We need groceries after breakfast.

430
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,319
We need

431
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,799
water,

432
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:28,719
snacks,

433
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
and towels.

434
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:32,479
Shampoo and body wash.

435
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,959
Note it down

436
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,600
just in case.

437
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,360
Alright...

438
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,759
Why are you following me?

439
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,719
The snacks

440
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,880
are over there.

441
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Rain check.

442
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,519
I just got it.

443
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,319
I got tickets.

444
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,080
We're late.

445
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,759
Hurry up. Let's get going.

446
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,039
Wait.

447
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:57,719
What tickets?

448
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,880
To Hexin.

449
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,640
Lin recommended an app.

450
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,319
So I booked two tickets.

451
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,319
It was a good deal.

452
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,479
We said we were not going.

453
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,039
Hear me out.

454
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,759
I didn't want to go.

455
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,479
But we kept talking

456
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,080
and Lin was super friendly.

457
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
I said I knew a girl

458
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,400
from his university

459
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,680
and that I was curious about the campus.

460
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,400
So he invited me over.

461
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,319
M-Maybe

462
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,680
it's a great option for a PhD.

463
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,440
Even if you're curious,

464
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,799
we don't have to go today.

465
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,559
Sis.

466
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,120
I got carried away

467
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,360
and bought the tickets.

468
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:37,920
Look.

469
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,959
Refund them. Let's go another time.

470
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
You'll be busy.

471
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,600
You have training.

472
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,360
I can't hold you back.

473
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,759
Or big brother would punch me.

474
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,559
Let's go.

475
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:50,440
Come on.

476
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,920
I have to pack up.

477
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,559
What for? It's just a day.

478
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,519
I'll put the things back.

What was that?

00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:02,999
Come back with me.

524
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,440
Or I'll be stuck on you.

525
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,200
I went broke,
buying drinks for those kids.

526
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,360
I can't afford a ticket back.

527
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,080
I can.

528
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:21,880
I know

529
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,880
it's not enough for the train.

530
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,999
Let's get on the bus after we arrive.

531
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,719
I can afford that.

532
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,840
What if I just

533
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,920
don't want to go back?

534
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,696
Actually,

535
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,160
it's your teacher's daughter

536
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,200
who wants to see you tonight.

537
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,239
She's coming to attend

538
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,840
her nephew's graduation ceremony

539
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,840
and insists on meeting you.

540
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,559
Her mom prepared many things you liked

541
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,559
when you were a kid.

542
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,319
She's coming all the way here

543
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:00,120
and you're avoiding her.

544
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,200
It's not very nice.

545
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,120
So I'll get tickets?

546
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,999
Whatever.

547
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,039
Leave me alone.

548
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,080
I knew it.

549
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,239
Someone is just

550
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,640
pretending to be tough.

551
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:28,456
(Hexin)

552
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,239
This way.

553
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,120
Sis.

554
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,600
Is it

555
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,440
the burger Lin recommended?

556
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,648
(Hesburgers)

557
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:53,880
Is it?

558
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,279
Do we have time?

559
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,840
I'm hungry.

560
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,840
We have 20 minutes.

561
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,880
Let's grab a bite.

562
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:01,400
Okay.

563
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,080
I'm a bit hungry.

564
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,640
Shall we get a burger?

565
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,479
Have this for now.

566
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,559
We'll eat later.

567
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:57,360
Sis.

568
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,840
Where should we take Lin?

569
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,160
Do you know anything nice here?

570
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,440
I haven't decided.

571
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,680
It's not a city known for its cuisine.

572
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,239
Let's just ask Lin.

573
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,440
He knows this place.

574
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,039
Fine.

575
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,999
(My sister and I came to Hexin.)

576
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,640
(Let's have dinner, Lin.)

577
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,999
(Have fun. I went back to Hel.)

578
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,400
What's wrong?

579
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,640
He went back to Hel.

580
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:35,959
He...

581
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,400
He just came back here.

582
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,640
Why did he go back again?

583
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,400
Maybe there's something urgent.

584
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:47,959
What do we do, sis?

585
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,039
You tell me.

586
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,279
I'm sorry.

587
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,039
I should have

588
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,440
asked him in advance.

589
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,799
You should have.

590
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,319
Sis.

591
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,600
Don't be mad.

592
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,959
Sorry, sis.

593
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
I've grown tired

594
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,600
of getting mad at you.

595
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,519
Since we're here, let's go.

596
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:18,400
Sis.

597
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:18,999
The car is here.

598
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,600
Okay.

599
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,080
Are you international students?

600
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:30,759
Yeah.

601
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,239
Hexin University, right?

602
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:35,519
It's the most famous one.

603
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,640
Its tuition fees are too expensive.

604
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:41,319
Not yet, but I hope so.

605
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,559
Sis.

606
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,200
Did you hear that?

607
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,519
I know it's expensive here.

608
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,080
Zheng Yi has mentioned it.

609
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,080
Lin is quite something.

610
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,719
What does it have to do with you?

611
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,600
Everything.

612
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,840
He's our savior, okay?

613
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,759
Okay.

614
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,440
(Recommended by)

615
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,239
(the most handsome guy I've seen.)

616
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,200
Obsessed with photos.

617
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,440
(Not so handsome. He's lying.)

618
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:34,799
(Got any photos?)

619
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,120
(Your brother has been mentioning him.)

620
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:38,080
(How does he look?)

621
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,239
(So curious.)

622
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,279
(I won't lie to you.)

623
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,559
(If I were a girl,)

624
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:43,600
(I'd fall for him.)

625
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,840
(Mediocre.)

626
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:53,080
(Just ordinary.)

627
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,519
(He's exaggerating.)

628
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,319
(Be honest, okay?)

629
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:06,160
(Yeah, be honest.)

630
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,560
(Be objective.)

631
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,480
(Fine.)

632
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,839
(I admit.)

633
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,239
(He's not bad.)

634
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,719
Childish.

635
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,560
(The Ebbitt Grill there is nice.)

636
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,480
(Try it.)

637
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,279
Meng Xiaotian.

638
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,919
You forgot he could see it, huh?

639
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,560
Why didn't you say something?

640
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,960
I forgot, too.

641
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,399
You...

642
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,799
But I...

643
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:54,799
It's okay.

644
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,439
You didn't badmouth him.

645
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,399
You actually praised him.

646
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,600
I totally forgot about it.

647
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,759
It's okay.

648
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:06,080
Lin is such a nice guy.

649
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,560
So embarrassing.

650
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,320
It's okay.

651
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,759
I'll be quiet.

652
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,759
What is it?

653
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:32,919
Back off, please.

654
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,200
Hey, it's me.

655
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,879
Host two kids for me.

656
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,200
I can't make it

657
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,040
back.

658
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,839
Take care of them.

659
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:04,600
I'll attend once.

660
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:05,919
That's my term.

661
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,560
This is

662
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,160
a one-time deal.

663
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:15,359
Here. Take it.

664
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:15,600
Okay.

665
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm right next door.

666
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,120
Okay.

667
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,200
Sis.

668
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,279
Lin said he was sorry to make us

669
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,279
come in vain.

670
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,120
Dinner is on him.

671
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:23,359
You agreed?

672
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,120
Nope.

673
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,759
He said his friend would come.

674
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,120
I said sure but I had to

675
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,960
pay for dinner.

676
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,040
And?

677
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:40,960
And he said that

678
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,399
we are guests here.

679
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,520
So dinner is on him.

680
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,759
This is how it works with Chinese

681
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,640
even if we're abroad.

682
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,080
But I didn't agree.

683
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:52,640
That's more like it.

684
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:53,359
Well done.

685
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,399
We're already in debt.

686
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,640
He can't pay for us again.

687
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,560
We're here.

688
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,480
Let's go.

689
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,319
Excuse me.

690
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,879
Give him the money
for the ride and the drinks.

691
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,799
Sis, you've said it twice.

692
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:09,960
I'm not a kid anymore.

693
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,120
He didn't accept it.

694
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,480
He said next time when we meet.

695
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:15,000
Next time?

696
00:39:20,939 --> 00:39:22,024
(We will meet later.)

697
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:31,879
Yiyang.

698
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:33,319
We're not drinking today.

699
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,640
You rarely visit.

700
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,279
Have a drink.

701
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,759
Yeah, Auntie.

702
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,680
Have a drink.

703
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,040
Auntie?

704
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,160
He calls me sis.

705
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,160
But you call me auntie?

706
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:46,399
Are you his junior?

707
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:48,319
I can't call you sis.

708
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,120
My mom calls you that.

709
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,080
If I call you sis,

710
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,160
she'd punch me.

711
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,680
Yeah, right.

712
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,719
Then

713
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,239
it's tricky.

714
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,399
Yiyang is such a senior

715
00:39:58,799 --> 00:39:59,480
in Dongxin City.

716
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,399
Not anymore.

717
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,120
I left a long time ago.

718
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,520
Sis.

719
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,520
Have some water.

720
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,239
Don't tell my mom that

721
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,359
I'm calling you sis.

722
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,480
Thanks.

723
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:26,919
Are you two

724
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,359
living here alone?

725
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:31,600
I'm living here.

726
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,040
He sometimes sleeps over.

727
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:35,160
Two sisters rented the rooms.

728
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,759
You're living with girls?

729
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,279
Is it fine?

730
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:41,839
It's alright.

731
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,000
The former tenants were guys.

732
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,000
They moved out.

733
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:45,919
The landlord started short-term rental

734
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
for some income.

735
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,520
They're college kids.

736
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,480
We can communicate.

737
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,520
And we have our own rooms.

738
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,200
Sit, sis.

739
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:53,799
Okay.

740
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,040
Think about your life as a child.

741
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,072
And look at you now.

742
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,080
I'm glad.

743
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,064
I'll tell my mom

744
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:07,200
and she can be at ease.

745
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:14,600
Jiang Yang is in trouble.

746
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,040
He wants to talk to you.

747
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,520
I think I left the decanter

748
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,080
in the storage.

749
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,120
I have no money

750
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:38,319
or connections.

751
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:41,120
If he needs help,

752
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:44,319
I'm the last one he should talk to.

753
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,160
What if

754
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,080
he doesn't need money or connections?

755
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,432
I don't think

756
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,960
I can offer anything.

757
00:41:59,359 --> 00:41:59,839
Fine.

758
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:02,319
This is between

759
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,919
you and your brother.

760
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,080
I won't meddle with it.

761
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:08,616
Right.

762
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:11,848
My mom made pickles for you
and wanted me

763
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:13,600
to bring them here.

764
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,200
I managed to dissuade her,

765
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,359
but she made me

766
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,160
bring you these instead.

767
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,640
I was so worried during the trip

768
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:27,520
that it'd be confiscated by the Customs.

769
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,160
Have them.

770
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:36,680
They should

771
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,960
keep these for themselves.

772
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,080
Yeah.

773
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,000
I told them that

774
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,759
you were only 27

775
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,040
and wouldn't need these.

776
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,399
But she got really upset
and insisted that

777
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,319
I bring these.

778
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:48,359
So I thought

779
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,480
I'd better let her be.

780
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,759
Besides,

781
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:51,960
these are all

782
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,160
gifts from others.

783
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:54,399
They don't eat

784
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:55,279
those things.

785
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,480
So I thought I'd bring them to you.

786
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,839
You can make these into

787
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,040
soup or tea.

788
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,359
You know.

789
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,120
My mom

790
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:05,160
loves keeping the good stuff for you.

791
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,560
Sis.

792
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,640
No need.

793
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,480
You finally

794
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,680
called me sis after a whole night.
