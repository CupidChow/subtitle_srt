1
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,040
Hurry up. This game is so important.

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,160
That's right.

3
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,480
Have some first. Boss,

4
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,680
go out and have a look.

5
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:38,599
Yes, boss.

6
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,199
Go out and have a look.

7
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,919
Okay, okay,

8
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,160
I'll go check it out.

9
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:43,760
Well,

10
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,480
this is bad at a bad time.

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,440
Cheers!

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,160
Are you done?

13
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,080
I'll be done soon.

14
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,040
Hurry up.

15
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,319
The game is about to start.

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,440
Okay, okay.

17
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,119
Let's have a drink first.

18
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,880
Brother,

19
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,240
Calm down.

20
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,119
Think about how to solve the problem.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,479
This period is only for two days,

22
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,119
let's figure out a way first, okay?

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,399
I'm sure I'll earn it back later.

24
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,720
How about this?

25
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,080
You can borrow some money from your friend first,

26
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,679
and you'll earn it back soon.

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,360
This is a tip for you.

28
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,440
I'm surprised.

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,880
A garbage cleaner

30
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,839
who can fix the antenna,

31
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,679
Thank you, boss.

32
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,479
Call me if you need anything.

33
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,039
Of course. Thank you.

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,119
Good job.

35
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,479
Can I lie to you?

36
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,520
What's wrong?

37
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,119
Classmates, friends, brothers,

38
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,240
what's wrong?

39
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,000
What's going on?

40
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,199
I have a good thing to tell you.

41
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,679
In the first half,

42
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,639
I won the Bold bought by my buddy by one to zero.

43
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,880
50 for one Brother won,

44
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,479
how much did you pay for it?

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,919
20 thousand,

46
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,360
20 thousand,

47
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,359
That's the 1 million bonus.

48
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,880
1 million.

49
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,040
1 million.

50
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,839
It's okay. Don't worry.

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,119
Don't worry, my friends.

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

53
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,920
I'm free of charge for today's drinks.

54
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,959
Okay.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
Come on.

56
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,399
It's so cool. Today,

57
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,519
Cool,

58
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,359
I'm telling you,

59
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,200
I need to withdraw cash now.

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,119
After I brought it up,

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,440
I slapped the money

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,559
in front of my wife,

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,119
I saw that she still dared to say that I was incompetent.

64
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,320
Yes.

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,440
Hurry up.

66
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,720
Withdraw now.

67
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,640
My phone might be stuck.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
It's okay.

69
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,679
Don't worry. Don't worry.

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,320
Don't worry.

71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
User failed.

72
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,399
What's wrong?

73
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,239
What do you mean?

74
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,079
Try again.

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
Let's do it again.

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,679
What's going on?

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,079
This … This

78
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,600
Slow down. Slow down.

79
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,519
You were cheated.

80
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,880
I was cheated.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,119
We were cheated.

82
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,160
Or we should call the police.

83
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,320
What's wrong?

84
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,200
Then turn it off.

85
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,480
Save it for the Spring Festival,

86
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,480
you fool.

87
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,160
Otherwise, how can we find the mastermind?

88
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,880
All your records and accounts

89
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,119
have been cleared.

90
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,959
All of them, all of them,

91
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,000
5%.

92
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,760
Hey, Old Guo.

93
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,320
Let's start,

94
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,519
I don't want to bet.

95
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,160
But then they brought me into a group,

96
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,480
and there was a mentor who taught you

97
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,279
how to watch the game and how to bet?

98
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,519
Mentors?

99
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,480
Liars are liars.

100
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,799
How much did you put in?

101
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,000
Let me ask my sister-in-law.

102
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,799
No, no, no.

103
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,959
Don't tell her.

104
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,119
She's pregnant.

105
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,760
Around 100, 000 yuan.

106
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,920
I thought I would have a balance

107
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,440
after winning 1 million this time.

108
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,279
Who would have thought it would be a big hole?

109
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,839
Let me remind you,

110
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,239
don't say you can't bring up cash.

111
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,959
Even if the cash withdrawal is successful,

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,079
it's illegal income.

113
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,200
Sir,

114
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,160
I beg you to help me.

115
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,119
Okay, I got it.

116
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,040
As for the details,

117
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,079
let's talk about it at the station.

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,000
Xiaopeng.

119
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,359
Please come with us.

120
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,079
Guo Yao.

121
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,040
I know you have to answer

122
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
the same old questions,

123
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,079
I'm sorry,

124
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,160
but I still haven't heard from Chen Mo.

125
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,239
Have you ever thought,

126
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,119
maybe he's avoiding you on purpose.

127
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,119
I don't want to see you.

128
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,239
I don't know what happened

129
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,359
between you two?

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,719
But if he knows

131
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
what you've done for him all these years,

132
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
He must be very moved.

133
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
Okay. I'll leave the chairman's matter to you.

134
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,799
I'm leaving.

135
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,159
Qin Huai,

136
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:51,719
look,

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
I got the admission notice from Hu forced.

138
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,400
Congratulations.

139
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,719
What's wrong?

140
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:03,880
I didn't get it.

141
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,159
That's impossible.

142
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:07,719
When it comes to penetrating attacks,

143
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,919
no one can match you.

144
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,119
They're the main defense team.

145
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,799
I'm not suitable for them.

146
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,320
But you are

147
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:17,719
the strongest shield in the computer department,

148
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,840
It suits them very well.

149
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,960
Come on!

150
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,080
I'm not going either.

151
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,960
Are you stupid?

152
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,479
Hu forced is one of the best companies.

153
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,400
The treatment is good,

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,039
and you can settle

155
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,960
your student loan soon,

156
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,960
I'm not going either.

157
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,559
Are you really not going?

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
We agreed to do it together.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,840
You're not going.

160
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,919
Why should I go?

161
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,200
Fine. I won't go

162
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,760
if you don't.

163
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,640
Are you stupid?

164
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,400
You lied to me.

165
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
How could I not get the admission notice?

166
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:02,039
Stand there.

167
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Who am I?

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,080
We are the Gemini of the Computer Department.

169
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,200
The combination of two swords,

170
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,119
the world is invincible,

171
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:07,960
Shame on you.

172
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,719
Shame on you.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,080
I'll start a company later,

174
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,239
we'll start a company,

175
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,479
I'll focus on your main defense,

176
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,599
and I'll take the money I earn.

177
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,960
What about me?

178
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,119
I'll pay you.

179
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,200
I just want the shares for my salary.

180
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,520
You're here too.

181
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,840
They're all here.

182
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,400
That's great.

183
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,760
This round

184
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,320
I won.

185
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,479
I wasn't good at defending.

186
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,960
Let's decide

187
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,400
the final round.

188
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,719
Be careful.

189
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,919
And that,

190
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,840
the investigation of Ye Jinglin and Si Anju,

191
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,919
Get on that number.

192
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,599
Okay, okay.

193
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,880
Yes

194
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,599
That's right. It's a rare opportunity for us.

195
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,679
If you miss it,

196
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:54,000
you almost won't have such a chance.

197
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,119
What are you doing?

198
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm a garbage collector.

199
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,559
Why are you stopping here?

200
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Me,

201
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,679
Why?

202
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,760
Why?

203
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,039
Idiot. Idiot.

204
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,239
How many times have you been here?

205
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,919
Why are you looking in the wrong place?

206
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,559
Excuse me,

207
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,200
hurry up.

208
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,640
I still have a lot of things to clean up in my restaurant.

209
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,840
Sorry to bother you.

210
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,679
Hurry up!

211
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,559
Hurry up.

212
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,039
Get lost!

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
Be careful.

214
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,440
The owner of this house is unusual.

215
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,080
Someone is protecting it.

216
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
Don't ask for trouble.

217
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:51,799
All right,

218
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,640
Okay.

219
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,159
Hello.

220
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,119
I lost all my money.

221
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,799
It's gone.

222
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,080
My money.

223
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
You haven't slept for over 30 hours.

224
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,359
Take a break.

225
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm fine.

226
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,119
We'll be able to find

227
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,559
the Internet Protocol address of the gang soon.

228
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,719
Then you can't ignore your health.

229
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,080
What about Godmother if you fall down?

230
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,119
I'm not tired.

231
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,559
Go to sleep first.

232
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,039
Godmother is in good spirits.

233
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,640
She's recovering fast.

234
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,000
Qin Huai,

235
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,520
thank you for taking care of my mom these days.

236
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,800
What are you talking about?

237
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,560
We're brothers.

238
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,199
Your business is my business.

239
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,239
I think I found a clue.

240
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,199
Follow this

241
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,079
internet protocol address.

242
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,359
I don't believe they didn't leave any traces.

243
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,000
I found it.

244
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,520
The Internet protocol address is abroad.

245
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
The rehabilitation center suggests that

246
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,599
you have not paid the full amount of the fee for the second half of the year.

247
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,400
To ensure your normal treatment,

248
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,800
please pay in time.

249
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,160
The amount owed is

250
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,479
48, 888 yuan.

251
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,000
Silence.

252
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:30,119
This is the one on the next street that sealed the window that day.

253
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,439
Remember,

254
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,359
take the money and leave.

255
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,119
Got it?

256
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:37,479
Okay, I got it.

257
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,760
Hello, sir.

258
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
What are you doing?

259
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,640
I'm here to deliver food.

260
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:29,119
Put it here.

261
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,400
Okay.

262
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,040
What are you looking at?

263
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,319
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,520
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,280
Okay, okay, okay,

266
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,280
okay,

267
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,040
What's wrong with you?

268
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,959
I'm sorry. I... I'll

269
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,040
send you a new one.

270
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,079
Get out.

271
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,599
Get out.

272
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,040
Come on, turn around.

273
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,800
Why is he here?

274
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:44,839
The food delivery guy.

275
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,119
He's not the food delivery guy. I've seen him before.

276
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,719
Please don't kill me.

277
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,160
I … I'm just a food delivery guy.

278
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,880
Aren't you a garbage collector?

279
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Why are you delivering food now?

280
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,439
Yes I got a job delivering food

281
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,959
at a nearby restaurant,

282
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,040
Disgusting.

283
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:22,160
next time

284
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,280
Find someone who has a good eye.

285
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,520
Do you understand?

286
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,359
Okay,

287
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,479
let him go!

288
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,640
Get lost!

289
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,719
Get lost!

290
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,079
What you got in your hand,

291
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,800
is the crystallization of our peers for many years.

292
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,280
How?

293
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,800
How can you talk to different people?

294
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,800
How to deceive their trust.

295
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,560
How can I fool them into paying?

296
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,239
When they suspect something,

297
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,560
what should they do?

298
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,839
Investment Group,

299
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,160
you specialize in investment and financial management,

300
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,479
Futures speculation,

301
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,680
gambling group,

302
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,400
Gambling and gambling

303
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,760
are all your responsibility.

304
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,239
Game recharge group,

305
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,160
game account recharge,

306
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,959
You even tricked me into buying props

307
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,079
and giving gifts.

308
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,680
What's our slogan?

309
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,640
3thousand is not too few,

310
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,760
1. 001 billion is not capped,

311
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,920
Boss, a big fish has taken the bait.

312
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,839
This one …

313
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,880
497149865 … Well, he talked to us

314
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,640
about 497149865.

315
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,000
What?

316
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,119
Lg (pi)

317
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
When I disguise my identity online in the future,

318
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,800
Use this string of numbers.

319
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,880
You use the natural logarithm of pi,

320
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,880
so no matter where you go in the future,

321
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,000
I can find you.

322
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,280
Qin Huai

323
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:16,400
Hello, sir.

324
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,400
We need to change shifts.

325
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,599
Please pay the bill,

326
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,680
Okay,

327
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:21,239
How much is it?

328
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,560
It's 88 yuan in total.

329
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,160
Well

330
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:28,040
You sell 88 yuan for a glass of water.

331
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,040
This is imported soda water.

332
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,959
Okay,

333
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,239
okay. Thank you

334
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,520
Brother,

335
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,920
I just want to find a woman who loves me.

336
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,079
Why is it so hard?

337
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,040
I'm putting all my hopes

338
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,560
on you now.

339
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:05,199
Brother,

340
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,920
You can't let me down.

341
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,119
Got it.

342
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,760
I can't take it anymore.

343
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,959
It's torturing me.

344
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,239
It's disgusting.

345
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,959
Got it.

346
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,199
Honey, you're a little weird.

347
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,880
How am I weird?

348
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,400
It's so

349
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,680
annoying.

350
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,160
I hate it. I hate it.

351
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,599
Why do I hate it?

352
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,160
Your mouth is sweet enough,

353
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,199
but what's the use of just being sweet?

354
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,439
You have to take action.

355
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,079
Honey,

356
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,239
let's do it.

357
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,560
Of course we have to act.

358
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,920
Love you. Love you.

359
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,439
No, no.

360
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,199
I love you more.

361
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,800
I love you too.

362
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,599
I love you more.

363
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,680
I love you so much,

364
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,199
baby. All right, honey,

365
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,439
Keep the fat and water flowing out of the land.

366
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,800
Call me the money now.

367
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,079
I'll buy you new internal shares,

368
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,000
and I'll transfer them to you

369
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,319
when my 100thousand arrives.

370
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,920
Hurry up.

371
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,920
It will be closed in an hour.

372
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,079
Don't worry.

373
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,920
I made an appointment with them.

374
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,280
Wait for us to meet.

375
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,239
Okay, honey.

376
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,119
This is a plate for killing pigs. Don't fall for it.

377
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:18,880
Qin Huai,

378
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,599
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,839
Guo, are you on duty today?

380
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,239
We'll get going then.

381
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:47,880
Okay,

382
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,880
Bye, Miss Guo.

383
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,760
Bye.

384
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,040
Hello, Qin.

385
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,680
I'll synchronize the location for you.

386
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,560
Come here quickly.

387
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,280
Okay, I'll be right there.

388
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,520
Brother,

389
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,199
Are you mistaken about me?

390
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,839
I only borrowed 100 houses,

391
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,400
How did you write 300 thousand?

392
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,119
Mr. Qin,

393
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,119
you're

394
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,680
our new client,

395
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,880
We'll give you a huge discount.

396
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,479
I'll lend you 200 thousand more.

397
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,520
And you only need to repay the principal,

398
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,640
without paying interest.

399
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,199
You still

400
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
don't believe it?

401
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,199
Our agreement

402
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
has been reviewed.

403
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,239
Brother,

404
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,040
the main reason is that there are too many frauds now,

405
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,959
It's not that I don't want to believe it,

406
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,160
but that I can't believe it.

407
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,520
How about this?

408
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,800
Do you think it's convenient for you to put that,

409
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,760
just your report,

410
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,119
Let me have a look at the approval report.

411
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,119
I'll be more at ease.

412
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:43,880
Be careful.

413
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:44,599
Yes.

414
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:45,400
You're right.

415
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,160
Come on,

416
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,400
This is our app in the background. Come on.

417
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,400
This is yours.

418
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,119
What do you think?

419
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,880
No problem, right?

420
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:05,920
No problem.

421
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,160
Then we'll sign it.

422
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,199
Okay, no problem. Sign it.

423
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:09,199
Mr. Qin,

424
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,359
your ID card,

425
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,359
ID card,

426
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,079
ID card,

427
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,599
Let's press the handprint.

428
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,839
Press the handprint

429
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,839
and pay it back, okay?

430
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,479
No problem.

431
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,040
Okay.

432
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,160
I'll transfer the money to you now.

433
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:24,959
Okay,

434
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:25,920
Here you are.

435
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,920
Thank you.

436
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,119
Turn around.

437
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:31,800
Check it out.

438
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,000
Okay, let me see.

439
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,680
We're here.

440
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:38,839
Okay,

441
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,439
Mr. Qin, if you still need money in the future,

442
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,479
just come to us.

443
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,359
Sure, sure.

444
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,119
I'm telling you, I won't buy that stock.

445
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,439
I won't buy it,

446
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,319
brother.

447
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,000
We're all ready.

448
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,040
Don't talk nonsense with me.

449
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,520
I won't buy it if I say no.

450
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,359
The police told me

451
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,520
to date you first,

452
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,199
Those who ask you to buy stocks are all liars.

453
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,040
You're a pig-killing dish maker, right?

454
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,439
Those who lend money are all your associates, right?

455
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,839
Are you kidding me?

456
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,040
Wait and see!

457
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:39,040
I'm just teaching you a lesson.

458
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,520
I'll take the 300 thousand,

459
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,400
Hello?

460
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,119
Let's go.

461
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,000
Stop the car! Stop the car!

462
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,239
Qinhuai,

463
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,160
that's right.

464
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,880
That 497149865,

465
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,520
I got caught. The money is here.

466
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,520
Don't worry, brother.

467
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Okay, okay, okay.

468
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,040
He was caught just now.

469
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,119
He can still run away.

470
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,640
I don't want to see what we do,

471
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,920
but tell them to be careful these days

472
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,079
Let's go.

473
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,000
Where are we going tonight?

474
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,520
Same place.

475
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,079
Kid,

476
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,719
are you courting death?

477
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,920
Let him go.

478
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,520
Or I'll call the police.

479
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,160
You're the only one

480
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,719
who called the police? What police?

481
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,239
Brother, brother,

482
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,439
no, no. Are you with that boy?

483
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,000
Okay,

484
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,640
I called the police.

485
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,040
-I'll send you two to the road. -Police,

486
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,079
police,

487
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:44,920
Get in.

488
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:48,800
Let's go.

489
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,040
Why are you here?

490
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,239
Didn't I come to save you?

491
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,439
I often see victims of online fraud

492
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,199
in various forums,

493
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,719
Post about what happened to him.

494
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,000
Share your own case.

495
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:14,800
To warn others.

496
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,920
This is a good thing.

497
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,959
But you have to be careful,

498
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,640
you might be targeted by the bad guys.

499
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,119
I have a real case here,

500
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,160
a boy

501
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,959
got cheated by 90thousand on his online loan.

502
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,199
I feel very depressed.

503
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,239
He posted his own story on the internet,

504
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,560
and a kind-hearted netizen left him a message,

505
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,760
One of the netizens said that

506
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,359
he had the same experience as him,

507
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,640
He got the money back

508
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,800
through his hacker uncle.

509
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,719
I saw someone who was in the same boat

510
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,640
get the money back.

511
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,839
The boy immediately turned to this netizen for help.

512
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,359
Boys are eager for money,

513
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:42,199
borrowing money everywhere,

514
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,760
I transferred the introduction fee,

515
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,040
handling fee and deposit back and forth.

516
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:47,000
A total of 40 thousand,

517
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,040
the final result,

518
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,640
This netizen is also a liar,

519
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,839
and this boy was cheated by a series of people.

520
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,920
Make things worse.

521
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,079
He's heavily in debt.

522
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,000
So,

523
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,959
if you see someone on the Internet

524
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,640
claiming to be able to recover the money you cheated.

525
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,479
No matter you call yourself a difficult friend,

526
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,359
a hacker, a lawyer, a reporter,

527
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,599
Or anyone else,

528
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,599
don't trust him.

529
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,560
So once you're cheated,

530
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,439
calling the police is your only right choice.
