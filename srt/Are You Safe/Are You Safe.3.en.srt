1
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,599
Xia Yan filed a divorce suit.

2
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:29,720
The IPO of Allsword Group.

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,519
Forced to pause.

4
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,680
Old Yu, please explain the situation.

5
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:33,480
good

6
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,639
What about Shiquan?

7
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,080
Is the tenth largest individual shareholder.

8
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,919
Owns 0.5% of the stock.

9
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,760
Xia Yan wants to cut it.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,319
This part of the couple's common property

11
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:44,080
It will cause the individual majority shareholder

12
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,720
And the ownership structure.

13
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:46,959
Is inconsistent with the prospectus.

14
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,239
So,

15
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:51,440
Before the divorce judgment and the division of property,

16
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,680
Can't go ahead with the IPO.

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,120
Kobayashi

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
What are you going to do?

19
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,279
I can handle the mess.

20
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,559
But I can't let a bastard

21
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,600
And become a good person.

22
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,479
Lin,

23
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,679
You're a lawyer.

24
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,119
You should handle the problem with professionalism.

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
Instead of using your personal emotions,

26
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:17,960
To judge customers.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,960
You're right.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,279
You should understand.

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,000
Kobayashi

30
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,720
This IPO

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,600
I have entrusted you with a great responsibility.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,720
To be optimistic about your future.

33
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,119
I hope you won't let everyone

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,119
Disappointed in you.

35
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:51,800
You're back.

36
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,759
Why are you so happy?

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,039
Free eggs

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,440
It's 20 yuan per box in the supermarket.

39
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:00,800
And this good thing.

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,039
You can get a credit card downstairs.

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,000
A free box of eggs with a QR code.

42
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,039
It's always cost-effective.

43
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:06,919
You should go too.

44
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,240
I'm not going. I have no money.

45
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,119
I don't use credit cards.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,600
I don't need a credit card.

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,759
Isn't this for a free gift?

48
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,160
Look at these.

49
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,440
Are all my free trophies.

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
You're a soldier, Aunt Ding.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,880
This little cat can't move.

52
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,559
What's wrong with it?

53
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,880
Look at this little hand.

54
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,039
Boss is back.

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,399
See who it is.

56
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,360
Auntie,

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,479
Thank you for the bathroom.

58
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,919
Aren't you the stall downstairs?

59
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,199
Yes

60
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,039
He stole a lot of our clients downstairs.

61
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,160
The boss was angry with him.

62
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,279
Aunt Ding, get him.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm telling you,

64
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,759
You just said that

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,320
Is this lucky cat broken?

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,160
I'll take a look.

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,720
I can fix this for you.

68
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,880
OK.

69
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,679
Fix it for me.

70
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,240
good

71
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,800
Do you need any tools?

72
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,639
I have them all here.

73
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,479
Nothing

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
How about this hammer?

75
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,720
Free

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,959
Qinhuai, Qinhuaia.

77
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,640
Don't you think you are very skilled?

78
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,119
Don't you feel safe?

79
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,839
This kind of thinking is often the most dangerous.

80
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,839
Isn't this the boss's phone number?

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,799
His phone is still moving.

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,160
That's right. How else can it be called?

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,160
Where's the mobile phone?

84
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,119
You followed him.

85
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,119
Nothing.

86
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,760
Why should I follow him?

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,839
I found that

88
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,559
Aunt Ding just now.

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,679
Give me the money

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,760
Was planted secretly.

91
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:17,760
WiFi probe

92
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,480
What?

93
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,399
WiFi probe

94
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,119
this

95
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,279
Light this.

96
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,200
What is this?

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,239
WiFi probe

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,600
I don't even know.

99
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,320
I have no idea

100
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,480
Alright

101
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,359
Then I'll explain to you.

102
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,480
Do you know about the wireless network?

103
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,559
The wireless network we usually connect to,

104
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,480
The wireless network probe

105
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,359
I will put all the people

106
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,600
The phone that connects to its wireless network

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,320
All personal information is recorded.

108
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,279
And then pass it to

109
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,519
The hacker's server

110
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,519
When the hackers got hold of it,

111
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,679
With certain personal information,

112
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,320
You can get the owner's personal information.

113
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,079
Such as personal address and personal income.

114
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,320
Preferences and so on.

115
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,000
dang!

116
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,440
Who is so rude?

117
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,920
There are so many evil people.

118
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,519
Think about it. If these people

119
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,640
The wireless network probe

120
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,119
To every corner of the city,

121
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
Then,

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,040
To intercept your personal information.

123
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,600
And committed fraud.

124
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,600
And get a loan.

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,959
And ruin your lives.

126
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:14,760
Then I...

127
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:15,359
My mother.

128
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,519
I'll check my other gifts.

129
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,480
Is there such a thing?

130
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,359
Don't worry.

131
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,640
What are they trying to steal?

132
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,519
Are important personal information.

133
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,320
Don't connect to unfamiliar wireless networks.

134
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:25,959
It won't be your fault.

135
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,959
Sure, brother.

136
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,799
You're really something.

137
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,799
That's right.

138
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,200
Compared to me,

139
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,239
You almost mean it?

140
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,320
You are showing off.

141
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,040
Look.

142
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,760
I didn't know his whereabouts.

143
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,279
Warehouse Three.

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,119
What is Warehouse 3?

145
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,679
Warehouse Three is a dating mecca.

146
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,000
Combined with the boss's coquettish style,

147
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,320
Something's wrong with him.

148
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,040
Do you still believe in fate?

149
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,559
Do you believe me?

150
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,119
I promise.

151
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
I won't lie to you.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,799
I'll rely on you from now on.

153
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,040
I have to go to work.

154
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,679
I'm leaving now.

155
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,040
good

156
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,679
bye-bye

157
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,200
Slow down.

158
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:24,880
Waiter/Waitress

159
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,600
Please get me another orange juice.

160
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,320
OK

161
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,079
Okay, thank you.

162
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,079
feed

163
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,000
Dear

164
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,959
Don't call me dear.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You don't love me at all.

166
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,359
The props are reluctant to give me.

167
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,559
You don't care about me at all.

168
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,920
Nonsense. I'm charging you.

169
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,959
That's more like it.

170
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,399
Then give me a kiss.

171
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,079
Give me a kiss.

172
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,239
How about this?

173
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,040
You're the best.

174
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,239
a row

175
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:05,839
I'll hang up then.

176
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,880
bye-bye

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,559
bye-bye

178
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,079
Your boss has an hour and a half.

179
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,320
Three different girls.

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,679
That's amazing.

181
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
Boss is really bad.

182
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,519
Oh, my God.

183
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Should not

184
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,479
She's a rich woman.

185
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,599
It doesn't look like that.

186
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,679
Is it possible that the boss is the wedding care?

187
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
I can't stand it anymore.

188
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,359
Let's go.

189
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,880
Let's go.

190
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Do you still believe in fate?

191
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,400
Do you believe me?

192
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,320
good

193
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,400
I won't let you down.

194
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,840
It's so disgusting.

195
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,039
Your boss is a sea king.

196
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,840
I thought he was a celibate.

197
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,520
After all, it's a mistake.

198
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,359
Do you like your boss?

199
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,039
Don't touch him.

200
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,239
I care more about you now.

201
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,640
Who are you?

202
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,200
Lawyer Lin,

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,719
Are you looking for me?

204
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,960
Ghost Fire Dance.

205
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,799
Sorry.

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,640
No comment

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,320
Who is this Mr. Lin?

208
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,159
This is the lawyer hired by the cheating executive.

209
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,719
She asked me about the Ghost Fire Dancer.

210
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,520
Why do you care so much?

211
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,599
Why does Lin Shuo have my phone number?

212
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,479
You're back.

213
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,000
When did you come?

214
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,919
I cooked a meal.

215
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,440
What day is it today?

216
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,679
It's so sumptuous.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,799
You don't know?

218
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,679
I don't know. Come here.

219
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,359
Sit down. I'll tell you.

220
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,119
say

221
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,400
today

222
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,960
It's our third anniversary.

223
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,840
Three years.

224
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,159
Look, I'm too busy to remember.

225
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,559
Sorry, Yi Zhang.

226
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,359
Nothing

227
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm busy with work.

228
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,239
Understand

229
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,239
come

230
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,719
I hope we can be better and better.

231
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,840
telephone

232
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,760
Hello, hello.

233
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,119
I'm

234
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,719
deity

235
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
I have successfully hacked Shi Quan's account.

236
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,640
I wrote a letter of apology on his behalf.

237
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,599
Help me take a look.

238
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,200
I'll post it if there's no problem.

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,760
It's childish to send only an apology letter.

240
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,919
Is there any black material in his account?

241
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,280
There are only some beautiful pictures.

242
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,239
And money.

243
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,239
Then transfer his money.

244
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,520
To vile your friend.

245
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,239
I'm not interested in money.

246
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,359
But I can transfer it to my friend.

247
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,760
It's her spiritual loss.

248
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,640
Qinhuai

249
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,359
Why did you give my phone back?

250
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,239
Calm down.

251
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,599
The apology letter can't be sent.

252
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,599
I have deleted it for you.

253
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,640
I managed to edit it.

254
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,799
The money can't be transferred.

255
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,840
It's Shi Quan's fault.

256
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,960
Have you thought about it?

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,520
Once you touch the money,

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
Its nature has completely changed.

259
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,479
You're not seeking justice for Siya.

260
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,280
You're committing a crime, do you understand?

261
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,359
And will wear a black hat.

262
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:13,960
You can never turn over.

263
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,719
I'm doing justice for Heaven.

264
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Uphold justice

265
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,919
You missed it.

266
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,880
You still want justice.

267
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,880
That's not how a hero works.

268
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,919
We can't do this anymore.

269
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,400
Why are you telling me this?

270
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,559
because

271
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm a good person.

272
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,919
Good person

273
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,440
Then how did you know

274
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,640
I hacked Shiquan's

275
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,679
Is it a coincidence?

276
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,960
It's no coincidence.

277
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,000
I've been watching you.

278
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,159
Keep an eye on me.

279
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,520
Aren't you here to see Lin Shuo?

280
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,200
Right?

281
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,080
That's right.

282
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
How did she find you?

283
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,039
I made an appointment.

284
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,520
Why are you doing this?

285
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,679
I want everyone to know

286
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,039
What Siya has been through.

287
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,200
Don't you worry?

288
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,119
Lin Shuo can claim that

289
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,400
Shi Quan knew the dancer was a man.

290
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
So what?

291
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,200
What about

292
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,559
It proves that Shi Quan

293
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,119
I'm not interested at all.

294
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,760
That's why he

295
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,400
You won't harass female interns.

296
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,080
Shi Quan not only retreats,

297
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,080
The girls he was harassing

298
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,760
Instead, he will become a slanderer.

299
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,520
Look at the internet.

300
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,320
So many black waters are helping Shiquan.

301
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,640
Step on them with rhythm.

302
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,520
You even offered me a head.

303
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,679
They will only suffer more.

304
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,599
What are you saying?

305
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,320
Since you are not on the side of Shiquan,

306
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,359
And not on Xia Yan's side.

307
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,479
But on our side.

308
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,599
good

309
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,359
I believe you.

310
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,359
I'm telling you,

311
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,960
I don't care what others think of me.

312
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,320
But remember,

313
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:53,799
In our business,

314
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,760
You don't need applause.

315
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,400
Instead of crying,

316
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,159
Are you the Ghost Fire Dancer?

317
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,919
Hello

318
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm Lin Shuo, the lawyer of Heng Yuan Zhi Zheng.

319
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,520
Hello, what would you like to drink?

320
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,440
Latte, please.

321
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,200
OK

322
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,440
I didn't expect that

323
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,479
You would ask me to meet.

324
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,080
Today,

325
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,880
I want to ask you a question.

326
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,320
Excuse me?

327
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,599
If you had the video,

328
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,280
Will you publish it?

329
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,719
Or destroy it directly?

330
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,440
What would you do?

331
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,919
If I had the video,

332
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,080
First, I will verify its authenticity.

333
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:06,400
If it's true,

334
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,440
I will publish it.

335
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,799
If it's fake,

336
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,080
I will destroy it.

337
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:13,880
Thank you

338
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,719
I answered your question.

339
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,840
Can you answer my three questions?

340
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,840
The first question.

341
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,719
What's your purpose?

342
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,359
To expose him as a scumbag.

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,840
The second question

344
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,440
Do you know Xia Yan?

345
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:31,760
Shi Quan's wife.

346
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,239
I don't know.

347
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,239
How do you know her name if you don't know her?

348
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,760
Watch the news.

349
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,599
Due to the rules of privacy protection,

350
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,119
In the news,

351
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,559
Her name didn't appear.

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,679
Does it matter?

353
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,320
Who cheated on me.

354
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,080
You won't tell your cheating partner.

355
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,400
The name of his wife.

356
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,719
Victims of workplace sexual harassment

357
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,520
You didn't bother to ask about it.

358
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,719
The name of his wife.

359
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,440
What do you mean?

360
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,479
Or you already know Xia Yan.

361
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,119
Or he has investigated Shi Quan's background.

362
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,080
So you came prepared.

363
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
To get close to Shi Quan on purpose.

364
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:14,840
yes

365
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,440
I did come prepared.

366
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,559
So you're not a victim at all.

367
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,719
You're the one who set the trap.

368
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,320
My third question.

369
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,119
You're an immortal.

370
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,080
Or acting with Xia Yan?

371
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,479
You don't have to answer.

372
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,000
You won't tell the truth anyway.

373
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,080
But I still want to tell you.

374
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,000
No matter morally,

375
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,599
From the legal point of view,

376
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,479
Once the motive is wrong,

377
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,119
Everything will be wrong.

378
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,960
My motive is forensics.

379
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,239
My good friend, Siya,

380
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,520
Was harassed and persecuted by Shiquan.

381
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,119
Almost committed suicide.

382
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,840
She was the victim.

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,119
She's the one who was attacked by the Internet.

384
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,239
So she had to give up on Shi Quan.

385
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,599
Give up your dream.

386
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,560
To escape from here.

387
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,839
I want to help her.

388
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,079
I want to punish Shi Quan.

389
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,719
Lawyer Lin,

390
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,000
Is my motive wrong?

391
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,719
Please tell me.

392
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,079
Everything

393
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,520
Whose fault is it?

394
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
Your eyes aren't lying.

395
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,479
What I want to say next,

396
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,800
Would violate my professional ethics.

397
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,560
So it's not an easy decision.

398
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,119
I hope you can listen to it.

399
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm the lawyer representing Quan Jian Group.

400
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,760
But I personally hate Shi Quan as much as you do.

401
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,079
So,

402
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Are you willing to help my friend?

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,119
If you want Shi Quan to be punished,

404
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,640
You need your friend to come forward.

405
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:54,800
You are brave enough to sue.

406
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,560
You didn't come forward.

407
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,040
Has been exposed to the internet.

408
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,920
To come forward.

409
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,760
You still have to die.

410
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:03,920
I know.

411
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:04,800
I know

412
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,239
Someone deliberately tried to smear the girl.

413
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,319
To clean the stone.

414
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,319
I know it's not easy to stand out.

415
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,239
But the premise of justice

416
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,239
You should believe in justice and law.

417
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,439
If you don't believe me,

418
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,199
I can recommend you a lawyer.

419
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,560
He won several cases like this.

420
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,560
You can check it online.

421
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,520
Lawyer Lin,

422
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,520
Are you willing to help my friend?

423
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,439
Then you are my friend.

424
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,920
Young Master, I never cheat my friends.

425
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,760
Are you a man?

426
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,040
I'm a network anchor.

427
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,400
Professional costume and voice.

428
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,560
Do you still have

429
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,359
What other places are you hiding from me?

430
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Without Lawyer Lin,

431
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,359
The reason why I dress as a woman,

432
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,319
Because I didn't trust you enough.

433
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,920
Now I believe you.

434
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,040
Please don't let me down.

435
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,199
good

436
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,800
Shi Quan asked you to come.

437
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,079
Don't bother.

438
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,760
The lawyer told me

439
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,040
He is the one who made the mistake.

440
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,000
I can get most of the money.

441
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:21,400
Go back.

442
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,479
Here's the thing, sister-in-law.

443
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,800
Actually, this time,

444
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,359
To see you.

445
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,199
I

446
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,119
There are some things.

447
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,439
I want to show you.

448
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,719
Three years ago,

449
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:37,760
What about

450
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,160
Do you look familiar?

451
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:45,800
And this.

452
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,359
Three years later,

453
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,079
Not to mention the changes,

454
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,719
Where did you get these photos?

455
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,119
You might think

456
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,599
Delete the photos online.

457
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,160
No one can be found.

458
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,479
But the Internet has memory.

459
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,119
I found it.

460
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,560
Are all done by you, right?

461
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
You can say

462
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,880
These photos are processed by me.

463
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
But these

464
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,839
Your classmates in the executive wife training class

465
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,959
I can't process the image.

466
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,040
Don't say that.

467
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,640
The training course is expensive.

468
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,959
Fancies of men of letters

469
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,880
Drinking and riding.

470
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,239
Golf table manners.

471
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,000
You taught me well.

472
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,800
You're educated, natural appearance,

473
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,920
A full set of counterfeits.

474
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,839
If these materials are sent out carelessly,

475
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,319
How much do you get for a divorce?

476
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,560
I don't know.

477
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,439
But if you want to find a new home,

478
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,599
difficult

479
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,280
Chinese women live an average of 79 years.

480
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
You're not even 30.

481
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:05,880
There are still 50 years to go.

482
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,079
It's hard to find them.

483
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,680
I'm not leaving, okay?

484
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,880
a row

485
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,239
Understanding and amenable to reason

486
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,760
But sister-in-law,

487
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,199
How about this material?

488
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,400
Your husband doesn't know anything.

489
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,959
Then what do you mean?

490
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
I mean,

491
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,359
I bought these ingredients.

492
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,760
Spent a lot of money.

493
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,199
Make an offer.

494
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,560
If my wife drags it out,

495
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,040
It became a powder keg.

496
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,800
We have agreed on the price.

497
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,839
feed

498
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,560
Hello, Lin Shuo.

499
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,439
Xia Yan dropped the charges.

500
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,239
Xia Yan dropped the charges.

501
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,880
yes

502
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,640
I have to hang up.

503
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,119
Hello, everyone.

504
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,079
I'm Shi Quan.

505
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,760
I admit that

506
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,319
But the premise of justice

507
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,839
You should believe in justice.

508
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Believe in the law.

509
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,239
Siya

510
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:01,839
Don't hesitate.

511
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Let's sue Shi Quan.

512
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:21,839
feed

513
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,439
Don't log into Shi Quan's account anymore.

514
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,959
What do you care?

515
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,119
And log into his account.

516
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,359
I'll report you. Believe it or not?

517
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,599
Some people said that

518
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
The most important thing in our business

519
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,079
No crying?

520
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,319
It sounds good.

521
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,640
What are you doing?

522
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:43,599
you

523
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,079
Guoyao

524
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,040
Have you paid attention to Shi Quan's case?

525
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,719
There's a Water Army on the Internet.

526
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,880
Victims of internet abuse

527
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,680
I'm sending their account numbers to you.

528
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,040
Boss

529
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,079
The police blocked the account number of our navy.

530
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:30,839
Fortunately, I found it in time.

531
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,040
Cut off the lower road.

532
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,719
Or they'll find us.

533
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,959
It doesn't make sense.

534
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,520
I spent a long time on those accounts.

535
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:38,839
There has never been any problem.

536
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,560
Did you check it?

537
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,560
Who is behind?

538
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,760
I've checked.

539
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,079
Is a man named Qin Huaihe.

540
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,439
He's a consultant to the police.

541
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,239
The affair of Shi Quan

542
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,439
He's the one who reported it.

543
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,880
Look, it's him.

544
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,199
How are you feeling?

545
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,040
Mrs. Shen.

546
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,920
We should stick to the rehabilitation.

547
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,959
Otherwise, the muscles would have atrophied.

548
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,599
I know, Mr. Zhang.

549
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,439
good

550
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:23,839
Miss Zhang.

551
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:24,880
Qin is here.

552
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,599
Mom's here.

553
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,199
What about

554
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,239
Here, let me help you.

555
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,760
Easy, easy.

556
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,400
Don't waste money in the future.

557
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,400
How can that be?

558
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
To see a dry mother, you have to buy flowers.

559
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,280
is or isn't

560
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,000
We haven't seen each other for a few days.

561
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,839
Dry mom is too young.

562
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,920
You're such a child.

563
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:42,959
What have you been eating?

564
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,359
Have you eaten?

565
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,599
I've eaten. I have eaten you.

566
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,800
I just ate it too.

567
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,239
a row

568
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,119
Miss Zhang.

569
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,000
我干妈今天是不是都

570
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,640
That's enough.

571
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,199
Everything is fine.

572
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:51,560
That's it.

573
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,719
Alright, let's go out for a walk.

574
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,199
good

575
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:53,719
go

576
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,079
come

577
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,719
Put on your shoes first.

578
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,400
good

579
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,400
Alright.

580
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:03,479
come

581
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,560
One, two, three.

582
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,000
Be careful

583
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,199
Alright.

584
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,239
This one.

585
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:15,880
That's it.

586
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,000
Thank you, Miss Zhang.

587
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,079
I forgot the flowers.

588
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,880
And bought you flowers.

589
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,160
Aunt Shen is so happy.

590
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,000
I must.

591
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,359
Let's go.

592
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,680
It's so beautiful.

593
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,959
What kind of mom is good at?

594
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,640
Original

595
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,599
If I hadn't been deceived,

596
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,920
Mo won't go to jail.

597
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,280
She wouldn't have disappeared.

598
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,199
I harmed him.

599
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,560
He can't go home now.

600
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,359
What a mother?

601
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,839
Don't say that.

602
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,640
I promise.

603
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,599
I will definitely find Chen Mo.

604
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,359
And let him return to you safely.

605
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:13,959
But you have to promise me.

606
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,880
Take good care of yourself.

607
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,520
So that you can

608
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,040
Stay with him.

609
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,199
Sister Shen,

610
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,359
Mr. Qin,

611
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,800
Sister zhang

612
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,800
Mr. Qin,

613
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,479
I've been looking for you.

614
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,560
I finally found it.

615
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:31,800
Sister Shen,

616
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,119
Why are you crying?

617
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,640
What have I done badly?

618
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,560
Tell me.

619
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,280
I just miss my son.

620
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,079
Xiaoqin

621
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,160
If you have something to do, go back to work.

622
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,839
Everything is fine here.

623
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:47,680
What a mother?

624
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,680
I'll leave now.

625
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,800
Call me if you need anything.

626
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,359
I'll visit you another day.

627
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,119
Mr. Qin,

628
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,479
What's wrong, Miss Zhang?

629
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,160
Shen'shen

630
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:04,719
That

631
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:07,280
Sister Shen didn't want me to tell you something.

632
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,239
what?

633
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Here's the thing.

634
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,319
What about the food recently?

635
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,719
It doesn't suit Shen's taste.

636
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,760
She wouldn't eat.

637
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,640
I was so anxious.

638
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,640
I want to add a small stove for her.

639
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,239
But she wouldn't.

640
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,160
He said he was afraid that you would spend money.

641
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,479
I want to save you some money.

642
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:29,959
To you.

643
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,040
Don't look.

644
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,119
Don't let godmother see it.

645
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:35,800
Thank you so much.

646
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,079
Give my dry mom more nutrition.

647
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,000
Don't worry, Mr. Qin.

648
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,959
I don't care about

649
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
As if it were my own sister.

650
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,239
a row

651
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,319
Get back to work.

652
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,199
Cheers!

653
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,479
Come on.

654
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,800
Come on. Bring it on.

655
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,239
Hurry up.

656
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,680
One by one.

657
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,239
Come and take photos later.

658
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,160
For the photo shoot later.

659
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,119
Take photos later.

660
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,560
Everyone will take photos later.

661
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,560
Come on.

662
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:04,520
Come on.

663
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,199
Everyone.

664
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,839
Come on.

665
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,400
Come on, one by one.

666
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,400
Come on.

667
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:09,760
There's only one left.

668
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,640
It's all there.

669
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,880
It's nice to be like this every year.

670
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,040
Every year.

671
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,680
Come on.

672
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,839
Class, class.

673
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,359
Let me say something.

674
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:21,479
Today,

675
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,199
The Level 2012 Gun Fans Association

676
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,640
The ninth annual party.

677
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,640
At this time of year,

678
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:29,160
We are all going to get together here.

679
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,599
Watch the Arsenal game

680
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,160
This is our rule.

681
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:32,599
Right?

682
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:32,959
Yes

683
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,479
Then I want to ask you.

684
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,199
We've held this conference until now.

685
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,160
You've held on to my tavern until now.

686
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,800
Who does that depend on?

687
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,160
Arsenal Football Club

688
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:52,119
Arsenal Arsenal

689
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,400
Yes, that's right.

690
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,920
For Arsenal.

691
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,079
For Arsenal.

692
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,680
Cheers.

693
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,520
Come on.

694
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:23,760
It's all here.

695
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,000
He's the only one left.

696
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,400
What about

697
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,040
I haven't got his letter yet.

698
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:39,479
You and Chen Mo

699
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,880
Is also the twin star of our computer department.

700
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,479
Twin Towers.

701
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,760
Is invincible.

702
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,520
Just like Arsenal back then.

703
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:49,680
What a pity.

704
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,880
The current Arsenal is a tiger in the sky.

705
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,680
The hero is separated.

706
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,040
You and Chen Mo

707
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,359
It's hard to break the mirror.

708
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:05,959
You're really good at this.

709
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,880
If you don't know how to use a set phrase, you shouldn't use it.

710
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,599
What is that?

711
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,680
To Chen Mo.

712
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,319
It's starting.

713
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,280
Take a look.

714
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,400
As everyone knows,

715
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,160
Of sensitive information.

716
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,640
Can't be sent directly.

717
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,479
Then an empty photo

718
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,680
Is it very safe to send it?

719
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,280
There's a knowledge point.

720
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,160
I want to introduce

721
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,319
Actually, every digital photo

722
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:52,160
Comes with a detailed explanation.

723
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,760
Called Interchangeable Image File Format

724
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,239
EXIF for short.

725
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,199
Contains a lot of information about this photo.

726
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,239
Let's have a look.

727
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,839
The photo of nothing

728
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,880
Interchangeable image file format

729
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,119
There are photos in it.

730
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,680
The brand and model of the phone.

731
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,079
Aperture, shutters, and so on.

732
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,079
And the precision.

733
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,839
If the phone supports altitude,

734
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,199
Will appear here.

735
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,199
With the precision and latitude,

736
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:17,839
You can locate the location of the photo.

737
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,760
With the altitude,

738
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,040
We can even determine the floor.

739
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,280
A photo.

740
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,439
We can reveal your position completely.

741
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,719
The sensitive information of the photo.

742
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,079
Not only in the picture,

743
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,839
Where you can't see it.

744
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,239
But don't worry.

745
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,959
There are many solutions.

746
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,520
Such as the geographical information of the camera.

747
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,880
Sharing a photo without sending the original photo

748
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,920
And the Great Method of Drawing Modification.

749
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,839
And very effective.

750
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:39,880
The phone software.

751
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,359
The output is a brand new photo.

752
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,560
Rewrites the interchangeable image file format

753
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,560
Besides

754
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,640
Plane ticket

755
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,319
train ticket

756
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:50,959
The certificate photo.

757
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:51,839
Wait a second.

758
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:54,359
You must type the sensitive information.

759
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,079
Sharing photos is right.

760
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,680
But while sharing the photos,

761
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,959
We enjoy the convenience.

762
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,599
But pay more attention to safety.
