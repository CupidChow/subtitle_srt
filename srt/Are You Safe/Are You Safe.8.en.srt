1
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,360
It seems that tonight,

2
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,400
we can only make do with it here.

3
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,279
That USB drive

4
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,040
is very important to you.

5
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,639
I wasn't sensible when I was young.

6
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,800
How many years have you been locked up

7
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,519
because of a network virus?

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,680
Go to jail.

9
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,800
Everyone has a past.

10
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,600
But for some things,

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,720
there's really no way to get over them.

12
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,960
Back then,

13
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,839
my mom was cheated by telecom

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,600
and got into a car accident.

15
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,440
Although he was saved in the end,

16
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,679
but because of his injuries,

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,880
Paralyzed.

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,919
Did you catch

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,839
the swindler?

20
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,600
They are all abroad,

21
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,919
and they have never been brought to justice.

22
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,440
When I got out of prison,

23
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,119
I put my mom in a rehabilitation center,

24
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,759
I asked my friend to take care of me,

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,559
and I came to Taimanda alone,

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,479
To find out the truth.

27
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,759
In order to get more evidence

28
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,119
of the fraud group,

29
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,440
I deal with the black products here

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,360
almost every day,

31
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,279
It's such a scary day.

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,919
I can't count how long it's been.

33
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,479
Did you find anything?

34
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
I put all the clues I found

35
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,720
in that USB drive.

36
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,320
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,000
I really didn't mean it.

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,119
There's nothing to say sorry about.

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,039
You saved my life.

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,320
As long as I'm alive,

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,720
I'll keep looking into it.

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,720
What about you?

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,320
Why did you come to Taimanda?

44
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,759
It's easy to say,

45
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,679
How much

46
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,440
will the surgery cost?

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,199
No matter how much it costs, it has to be treated.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Old Madam is old enough,

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,479
why do you have to suffer that?

50
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,119
What do you think?

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,559
You're right.

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,039
It's too dangerous.

54
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,559
It's enough

55
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:56,479
at such an old age.

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,440
Without the surgery,

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,320
are you going to watch grandma die here?

58
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,520
When grandma was sick and needed money,

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,720
I came to the casino here as a Dutch official.

60
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,480
Uncle, where are we?

61
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,959
Uncle, where are we going?

62
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,399
Do you still want to earn money?

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,959
You still want to treat your grandma. If you don't go in,

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,799
don't talk too much.

65
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,000
One more round.

66
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,079
You can do it today.

67
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,079
You can wait here.

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll go find someone. Can you

69
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,760
afford it? Number one,

70
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:48,480
number one, number one.

71
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,160
Come on, come on.

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,880
What are you doing?

73
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,480
You're the one

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,600
who cheated on me, right?

75
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,679
I didn't cheat.

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,279
I'm sure I'll win this round.

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,600
Why did you arrest me?

78
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,519
Three sides, three sides, three sides, three sides,

79
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,640
three sides, three sides,

80
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,959
We won.

81
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:22,880
We won.

82
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
Here you go.

83
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,000
Here you go too.

84
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,519
Hurry up. Why are you still

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,880
standing there?

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
Meet Sister Zhan with me.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,600
Sister Zhan,

88
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,959
this is my niece,

89
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,519
My family is so poor.

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,079
That's why I brought it to you.

91
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,040
I want to find a way out for her.

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,679
Mouton,

93
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,920
it's better to call someone

94
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,679
Sister Zhan,

95
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,040
Sister Zhan,

96
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,959
look,

97
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,320
I always think of you for any good things here.

98
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,760
You should go

99
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:04,480
and play, too.

100
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,480
It's my treat today.

101
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,799
Okay.

102
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,920
Listen to Sister Zhan.

103
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
She's pretty handsome.

104
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,640
Have you ever been a Dutch official before?

105
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,440
But I can learn.

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,600
I have a good memory. I'm a fast learner.

107
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,279
I won't hold you back.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,799
Sister Zhan,

109
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,160
please give me a chance.

110
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,799
I really need this job.

111
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,399
Okay,

112
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,720
Let's go.

113
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,679
Why didn't you

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,480
tell me in advance when you came?

115
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,480
Come on,

116
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,640
Mouton. Come here,

117
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,119
Treat him well.

118
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
Grandma's medical expenses

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,880
will be settled.

120
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,959
General,

121
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,119
these days,

122
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,559
Mouton will be in charge of receiving you.

123
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,359
What about you?

124
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,880
Eat, drink and have fun. Let me know

125
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,559
if you need anything.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,440
I'll get going then.

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,119
Moutong.

128
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,320
You're luckier than me.

129
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,559
At least you have a family.

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,359
When Grandma left,

131
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,239
I didn't even see her for the last time.

132
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,519
She only left me this.

133
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,520
I just went out to check it out.

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,400
There's no one left.

135
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,479
We should be safe now.

136
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,119
Where are we going now?

137
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,039
Let's

138
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,640
go back first.

139
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,880
Go back.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,679
The most dangerous place

141
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,840
is the safest place.

142
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,760
They've already looked for us.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,840
I think in a short time,

144
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,520
they won't come back either.

145
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,119
Besides,

146
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,000
we really don't know where to go.

147
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:37,520
Okay,

148
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,359
Then let's go back.

149
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,200
Why did you bring me here?

150
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,760
This is where Chen Mo and I study.

151
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,919
Those who can go to school here,

152
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,280
many of them will be

153
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,239
mainstays in the Internet industry in the future.

154
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:08,520
Qinhuai,

155
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,760
I thought you were bringing me here.

156
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,799
What good place?

157
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:11,880
Then you turned around

158
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,159
and called me illiterate, right?

159
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,080
Are you okay, bro?

160
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,119
It's okay.

161
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,440
Chen Mo and I

162
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,640
spent four years here.

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,039
Every day, we dream that

164
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,719
one day, we can use our technology,

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,640
You can do your best

166
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,159
in this society.

167
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,039
But superb technology is like a knife,

168
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,799
we are just knife holders,

169
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,479
If this knife

170
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,719
doesn't work well,

171
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:39,679
It's very likely that you'll cut yourself.

172
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,960
He even hurt a lot of innocent people.

173
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,640
But it's not about the knife.

174
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,039
It's the right or wrong choice.

175
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,520
If you use it to do good,

176
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,119
even if you cut yourself,

177
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,719
That's also a kind of growth,

178
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,119
right?

179
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,799
To be honest,

180
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,840
how could you make such a choice today?

181
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,599
Actually, I admire you.

182
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,039
Appreciate what?

183
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,080
In our line of work,

184
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,919
we face

185
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,000
all kinds of temptations

186
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,200
every day,

187
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,719
As long as you taste it, there will be sweetness,

188
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
and if you don't have a sense of justice in your heart,

189
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,919
Then I really can't resist it.

190
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,599
Over the years,

191
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,960
I've seen too many white hats.

192
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,159
It just turned dark like this.

193
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,479
You know what?

194
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
In your choice,

195
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,919
there is a very simple sense of justice,

196
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,320
Your skills,

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,719
your brain,

198
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,840
And your most important sense of justice,

199
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,960
is no worse than anyone else here.

200
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,520
That's why I think highly of you.

201
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:06,760
Really?

202
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:07,880
Of course.

203
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,760
Have some confidence in yourself, okay?

204
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:14,799
No,

205
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,840
I was trying to comfort you,

206
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,880
Why are you encouraging me?

207
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,119
Now that you've figured it out,

208
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,799
let's go.

209
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,960
Why is your school so far away?

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,960
You have to take so many stops,

211
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,080
what do you know?

212
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,919
Cultivating talents requires more and more

213
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,159
ambience.

214
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,679
The less you are affected by the outside world.

215
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,760
What do you know?

216
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,559
Nonsense!

217
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,719
You,

218
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,200
Excuse me,

219
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,359
what are you doing?

220
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Pedestrians, please be careful.

221
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,479
Yes, just this car

222
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,080
and this one,

223
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,559
At such a young age,

224
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,080
I'm sorry. I'm going

225
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,000
to check my phone. Sorry.

226
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,719
When there is an old man by your side,

227
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,000
Come on,

228
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,119
Please sit here.

229
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:17,599
Excuse me.

230
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,400
I'll get off the passenger

231
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,479
with the baby at the next stop,

232
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,760
Please give up your seat in time.

233
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,039
We would like to express our heartfelt thanks.

234
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,479
The next stop is Yaoxing Park Station.

235
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,760
Why is it so hard to get into the city?

236
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,559
If you bring the company here,

237
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm sure I can concentrate on my work.

238
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,640
Don't tell me.

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,960
You made

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,440
a very constructive suggestion.

241
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,440
Okay, I'll think about it.

242
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,359
I'm just kidding.

243
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,320
You took it seriously.

244
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,320
If you can really move the company here,

245
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,119
I'm sure I'll be the first to resign.

246
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,000
All right.

247
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,440
No, no, no.

248
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,640
What's wrong with you?

249
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,760
What are you doing?

250
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,760
What's going on?

251
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,359
He touched my butt. He was sneaking around

252
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,400
before he got in the car.

253
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
I don't know what he wants.

254
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,200
Colored Wolf,

255
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,280
take a picture of him.

256
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,280
Pervert.

257
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,760
I didn't touch it.

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,919
It's you.

259
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,239
Stop slinging mud at me!

260
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,520
If not you, who are you?

261
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,960
Stop recording. Stop recording.

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,640
No, I didn't.

263
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,719
Touch her butt.

264
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,559
No, I didn't.

265
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,960
I didn't. I didn't.

266
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,159
Are you idle?

267
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,640
Why did you kill him with one bite?

268
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,039
I touched your butt.

269
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,320
Isn't it you?

270
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,400
Oh my god, I … Why did I touch your

271
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,520
butt?

272
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,479
I have my own butt.

273
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,000
Even if I touch him, I won't touch you.

274
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,159
Then go touch him.

275
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,080
Me,

276
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,280
All right,

277
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,640
you think of this place as a vegetable market?

278
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,159
-Tell me. -No.

279
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
No. It's not a police officer.

280
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,479
Can we adjust the surveillance footage?

281
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,080
Am I right?

282
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,039
I'm not a hooligan.

283
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,159
Sir, don't listen to him.

284
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,640
This guy

285
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,280
What should I do? I

286
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,000
must be a recidivist.

287
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,919
How can you talk like that?

288
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,799
Do you know each other

289
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,280
before? No.

290
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,440
But one of my sisters

291
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,039
was touched before.

292
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,760
It's at this time. This bus … No, no. What does that have to do with

293
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,200
me?

294
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,359
I finally caught him today.

295
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,280
Otherwise, how many girls will there be in the future?

296
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,159
I'll be harmed by you.

297
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,919
You have to pay attention to evidence.

298
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,919
Or I'll sue you for defamation.

299
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't know if you touched me or not.

300
00:14:59,039 --> 00:14:59,520
That's right.

301
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,599
I'll sue you for defamation.

302
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,239
What does it have to do with you?

303
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,159
Stop talking.

304
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,359
I got it.

305
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:08,559
Sir,

306
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,000
they must be working together.

307
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,200
He covered for him.

308
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,039
Enough, enough. Stop talking.

309
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,919
Now my colleague has gone to check the surveillance footage.

310
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,640
Please cooperate with my investigation, okay?

311
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:19,880
Name?

312
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,320
When we get back,

313
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,599
This phone is turned on 24 hours a day,

314
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,400
waiting for my message.

315
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,159
I'll find out for you.

316
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,200
All right. Let's go.

317
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,799
What are you doing now?

318
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,919
I'll do it. I'll do it. What's wrong?

319
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,200
Meimei, the mediation

320
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,119
is over. You rascal, just wait.

321
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,400
You're crazy.

322
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,919
Do you think this kind of person is insane?

323
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,400
Actually, it's all because

324
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,239
you're so easy to be misunderstood.

325
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,119
What are you talking about?

326
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,880
You won't die if you say less.

327
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,000
This man is so embarrassing.

328
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,119
How could there be such a person?

329
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,719
Look, look, look. There's gossip again.

330
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,559
You look like a scumbag.

331
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,679
Pervert! Pervert.

332
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,719
This must be

333
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,239
the Black Net Security Company.

334
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,840
Continue to incite public opinion.

335
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,679
Let's just say that Kaihang Net An is a black-hearted company.

336
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,799
Send me the entry of the pervert Qin Huai

337
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,239
on the hot searches.

338
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:33,760
Qin Huai,

339
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,479
I finally got the chance this time.

340
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,520
I want you to have a taste of internet violence.

341
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,880
This kind of person also deserves to be a net security,

342
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,039
open up the net security

343
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,760
Sisters, don't be afraid.

344
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,799
You have to apologize publicly,

345
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,799
stand up bravely, and the evil will not suppress the good,

346
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,919
How many victims are there?

347
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,599
Qin Huai, come out?

348
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,679
This is it.

349
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,880
Come out.

350
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,119
If you have the ability to stand up,

351
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,479
you dare to do it but don't dare to do it.

352
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,920
Hurry up.

353
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,959
You don't know,

354
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,959
Wu Yangyang downstairs is surrounded by

355
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,719
a bunch of people. It's so ugly to talk.

356
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,280
When I answered the phone just now,

357
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,040
these people are not good enough.

358
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,599
The company's homepage has also fallen.

359
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,079
It's all about scolding Qin Huai,

360
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,599
and boycotting the company.

361
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,359
They're crazy.

362
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,599
They're completely crazy.

363
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,239
They are just netizens.

364
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,199
What do you mean?

365
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,760
They are just netizens.

366
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,719
Then what am I?

367
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,719
You're a bus pervert

368
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,280
who hangs out on the internet,

369
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,560
How many times have I told you?

370
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,280
My hand

371
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,560
didn't touch her at all.

372
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,760
Take it easy. Take it easy.

373
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,239
As a person

374
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,640
who works in cyber security,

375
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,479
But now there's no way to prove his innocence.

376
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,239
Is it pathetic?

377
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,560
What are you talking about?

378
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,359
Me,

379
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,079
Stop it. Deduct the money.

380
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,280
Deduct the money.

381
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,520
If you deduct more money,

382
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
you'll easily lose our little Huaihuai,

383
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,520
Did you really not

384
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,079
touch her butt?

385
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,160
All right, all right.

386
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,119
What are you talking about?

387
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,079
I'm embarrassed. Okay,

388
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,359
okay.

389
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,119
Why are you embarrassed?

390
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:34,319
Why should I be embarrassed?

391
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:35,719
Ms. Ding,

392
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,239
that's who I am to you,

393
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,160
isn't it?

394
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:37,839
No, no,

395
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,439
I'll keep my voice down. Be good. Keep your voice down.

396
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:46,959
Oh no.

397
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,160
I got it.

398
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,000
What do you know?

399
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,520
There are visual differences in the photos,

400
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,239
when you look at them at first glance,

401
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,680
I really thought Huai Huai

402
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,640
was touching her butt.

403
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:01,880
You don't have to say that.

404
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,560
So all the men present at that time,

405
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,079
could have reached out.

406
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,680
You don't have to say that.

407
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,599
So,

408
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,319
as long as we find

409
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,479
the real bus pervert.

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,920
You can clear Huai Huai's name.

411
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,599
I'm not being sarcastic.

412
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,280
Boss, don't deduct my money.

413
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,040
This kind of person

414
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,040
is worse than a thief.

415
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,319
We're not going to catch him.

416
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:24,839
Right?

417
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,760
Others may not be able to.

418
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,199
But I

419
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,359
have my own unique skill.

420
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,359
Don't worry.

421
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,719
Never mind.

422
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,359
Give me

423
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:47,800
the car. Pedestrians, be careful.

424
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,760
Ms. Ding,

425
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,439
let me tell you,

426
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,359
Zhou You,

427
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,760
he's so unreliable.

428
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,959
He summoned me here early in the morning,

429
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,560
saying that he could find evidence for Qinhuai?

430
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,479
And you left me alone

431
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,839
at the bus stop,

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,920
If I trust him one more time,

433
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,880
I'll be a dog.

434
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,079
What are you doing?

435
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,280
Zhou You,

436
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,400
You,

437
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,479
Zhou Zhou.

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,640
Brother and sister

439
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,000
are very open-minded,

440
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,800
Very tolerant,

441
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,599
I think you can wear

442
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,199
whatever clothes you want to go out.

443
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,880
I will respect and support you.

444
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,479
I was so surprised

445
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:01,719
just now.

446
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,640
Don't make a fuss, Tang Lin.

447
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,359
This is role-playing, okay?

448
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Aren't we here to catch that pervert?

449
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,439
I don't usually dress like this, okay?

450
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,719
How are you going to catch it when you're dressed like this?

451
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,439
Please pay attention to

452
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,719
the safety of vehicles and pedestrians later.

453
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,479
Slow down.

454
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,880
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,119
It's okay.

456
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,560
Really?

457
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,319
Please hold on to the start of the car.

458
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,599
The Arts and Sports Center North Station

459
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,160
is here. Please get off at the back door.

460
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,040
Please hold on to the start of the car.

461
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,000
The station ahead is

462
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,000
Jiahe Plaza North Station.

463
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,599
Please get off at the back door.

464
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,839
Women,

465
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,599
Women.

466
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,760
Excuse me. Let's get off.

467
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,680
Be careful.

468
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,959
Please sit tight and hold on to the start of the car.

469
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,439
When you are surrounded by old, weak, pregnant,

470
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,800
disabled passengers with children,

471
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,199
Please give up your seat in time.

472
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,479
We would like to express our heartfelt thanks.

473
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,640
The next stop is Yaoxing Park Station.

474
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,599
The bus starts.

475
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,760
Pedestrians, please be careful.

476
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,560
Don't litter in public.

477
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,280
Don't move.

478
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,520
The man behind you,

479
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,119
don't look at him.

480
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,079
He's about to get started.

481
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,760
Hang in there.

482
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,400
Do you want to make an appointment?

483
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,319
What's wrong with you?

484
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,319
He's so bold.

485
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,319
Touching someone's butt

486
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,319
in broad daylight,

487
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,359
Don't talk nonsense.

488
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,400
Do you have any evidence to say that

489
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,199
I touched you? You're blind. I've recorded it.

490
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:48,560
Pervert.

491
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,040
Let go,

492
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,239
Driver.

493
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,520
Please take us to the police station.

494
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,599
It won't erase,

495
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,000
A few

496
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,719
All of them.

497
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,800
This time and the last harassment incident,

498
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,239
it was all done by that guy alone.

499
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,560
You can go back now.

500
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:06,599
Thank you for your hard work.

501
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,359
Thank you.

502
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Thank you, sir.

503
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,599
Look, I told you,

504
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,160
Huai Huai didn't do it.

505
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,839
Why don't you apologize to him?

506
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,119
Did you erase it?

507
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,160
Mr. Qin,

508
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm really sorry.

509
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,800
I know about this.

510
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,599
It had a big impact on you.

511
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,239
I solemnly apologize to you.

512
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,239
Forget it.

513
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,680
Okay, got it.

514
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,400
Alright,

515
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,520
Miss Chen, get up.

516
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,199
That's enough.

517
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,599
I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.

518
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,560
Okay,

519
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,920
Don't blame yourself too much.

520
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,280
Our boss is so tolerant,

521
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,000
generous and handsome.

522
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,079
I'm sure I'll forgive you.

523
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,680
Right?

524
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,280
Yes.

525
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,680
That's the end of the story.

526
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,479
I'm really sorry.

527
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,439
I'm really sorry.

528
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:01,680
-It's okay. -I'll walk you out.

529
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,599
Let me see you off.

530
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,719
Thank you.

531
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,239
What?

532
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,719
Say it again. I didn't hear you clearly.

533
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,800
Shout it out loud.

534
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,640
What did you just say?

535
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Thank you.

536
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Did you hear me clearly?

537
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,119
Sir, I want to call the police.

538
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,520
Someone touched my butt,

539
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:39,880
Officer Chen Someone,

540
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,640
Someone touched my butt,

541
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,359
Officer Chen,

542
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,520
Really?

543
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,800
No, no.

544
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,400
The boss is not young

545
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,719
anymore. What's the surprise?

546
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,239
You're so secretive.

547
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,160
I've always kept a low profile,

548
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,839
I don't like surprises.

549
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,640
What are you doing?

550
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,119
Come and take a look.

551
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,640
Congratulations

552
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,920
on your safe return.

553
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,000
Xiqing boss

554
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,359
got his revenge.

555
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,439
Why is there no horizontal approval?

556
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:10,280
Yes

557
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,640
Promotion and salary

558
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,599
increase. Applause.

559
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,479
And I think,

560
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,040
this time, thanks to our brother.

561
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,640
To stand up for the boss,

562
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,280
I suggest,

563
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,839
Everyone will croak for him again.

564
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,079
Thank you

565
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,880
for keeping it easy.

566
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,719
After the celebration,

567
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,079
I have bad news to announce.

568
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:30,800
Boss,

569
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,119
this time because of your trouble,

570
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,959
Our company's reputation

571
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,199
has plummeted.

572
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,560
We don't have any business anymore.

573
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,160
Mr. Qin,

574
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,880
what's your opinion on this matter?

575
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,599
This … This is the end?

576
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,560
What else do you want?

577
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,479
All right, sue them.

578
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,359
Right?

579
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,880
But anyone who is brainless,

580
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:48,920
who rises to a personality insult,

581
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,160
For personal attacks,

582
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,680
one counts as one.

583
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,359
Find them out one by one and pay for them.

584
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,880
Yes. Pay for it.

585
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,359
Your coffee.

586
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,520
-Okay. -Thank you. -Two lattes.

587
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,920
One cup

588
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:00,880
is enough.

589
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,599
Okay.

590
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,400
Where's the post?

591
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,199
Delete all of them for you.

592
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,319
I saw it a long time ago.

593
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,599
Where are the people who hacked you?

594
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,880
It's basically a zombie.

595
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,160
The point is who would use the Zombie

596
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,920
to hack such a selfless person like me,

597
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,839
What about a cute and charming law-abiding citizen?

598
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,719
That's a lot.

599
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,760
Let me count it for you.

600
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,800
All right, stop counting.

601
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,760
You can find someone to check the post

602
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,400
even if you delete it.

603
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,880
Hold on a second.

604
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:31,280
Wuqi,

605
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:31,719
what's wrong?

606
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,040
585960. Let's talk about it

607
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,800
tomorrow after work.

608
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,000
Don't go.

609
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,520
Raw coconut latte,

610
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,160
don't regret it if you don't drink it.

611
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,839
Go home and drink some cold water.

612
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,359
Mr. Xu wants to see me,

613
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
what's the matter?

614
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,040
He really didn't say anything,

615
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
but he seems quite satisfied

616
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,719
after reading

617
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,280
the user feedback report of Huyun recently.

618
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,520
So I assumed irresponsibly,

619
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,280
that you might receive good news.

620
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:04,479
Okay.

621
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,719
Come in,

622
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,119
Mr. Xu,

623
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,000
Sit down.

624
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,239
What do you think?

625
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,160
Do you want some coffee?

626
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,199
Thank you.

627
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:47,280
I've read the latest technical report of Huyun,

628
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,160
and I think the technical department did a good job this time,

629
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,719
Thank you.

630
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,439
It's directly related to your efforts.

631
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,239
That's what I should do.

632
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,359
I have a contract here.

633
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,239
Take a look.

634
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,040
To put it simply,

635
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,839
this is a long-term contract,

636
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,479
If you plan to

637
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,160
continue working for Hu Forced Company.

638
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,000
Not only can you get options,

639
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,040
but you'll also get a generous bonus every year.

640
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,000
Ten years.

641
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:26,719
Deep binding,

642
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,239
this is also for the benefit

643
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,199
of both you and the company.

644
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,079
Thanks to Mr. Xu's trust in me,

645
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,800
as soon as I graduated from college,

646
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,199
I started working in the company.

647
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,760
In fact, to me,

648
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,599
the company is like home.

649
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,959
Please rest assured, Mr. Xu.

650
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,040
I'll work hard under Hu's coercion.

651
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,680
Okay.

652
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:53,839
I'm here.

653
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,319
It's loaded again.

654
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,359
I was thinking,

655
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,040
how have you been lately,

656
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,640
Hurry up and find some new partners.

657
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,880
It's not small.

658
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,359
Let's move the stall to China.

659
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,599
In China,

660
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,359
what about over there?

661
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,439
Stop over there.

662
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,119
Stop.

663
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,920
You still don't believe that General is dead, do you?

664
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,599
I've been feeling uneasy lately.

665
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,280
I always think it's not that simple.

666
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,760
Stop for now.

667
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:06,760
What's wrong?

668
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,719
The USB flash drive is broken.

669
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,160
The general is dead,

670
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,079
the clue to the murderer who lied to my mom,

671
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,719
Another one is broken.

672
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,239
What's your plan?

673
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,680
I want to go back home.

674
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,239
I'll go back with you.

675
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,520
You.

676
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,800
Are you sure?

677
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,760
There's nothing left

678
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,920
for me to miss here.

679
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,839
Okay.

680
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,560
What are you doing?

681
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:15,880
Seal the camera.

682
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,920
Why did you seal it?

683
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You don't have to use it a few times a year.

684
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,119
I almost forgot about it.

685
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,359
You forgot it.

686
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,719
Others won't forget it.

687
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,239
Who is it?

688
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:22,839
Hacker,

689
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,560
he can hack into your camera.

690
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,199
So that you can see everything in your life.

691
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,119
It's okay.

692
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:27,920
This indicator light,

693
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,000
If the camera is on,

694
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
it will light up.

695
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,040
I knew it.

696
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,119
Hackers can turn off the lights,

697
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,959
let his peeping,

698
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I don't know it.

699
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,800
Aren't you a little too sensitive?

700
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,880
You don't believe me, do you?

701
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,400
Come and have a look.

702
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,800
There really is such news.

703
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,560
Of course.

704
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:47,880
Anyway,

705
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,599
And you don't use the laptop's camera

706
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,400
to take a selfie,

707
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,880
You won't lose anything if you seal it.

708
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,040
It can prevent problems before they happen.

709
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,479
I mean,

710
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,439
this is the cheapest

711
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,920
and best anti-hacking technique I've ever learned.

712
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:58,560
Thank you.

713
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,920
Why did you tear it up?

714
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,239
I posted mine.

715
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,560
I have a new one.
