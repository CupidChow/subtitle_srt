1
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,199
Can I borrow your charging treasure?

2
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,319
Of course.

3
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,199
Officer Guo, let's work overtime tonight.

4
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,080
You are suspected of illegally stealing other people's information,

5
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,600
please come with us.

6
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
This is

7
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,679
just

8
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,759
a small one of my many successful cases,

9
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,679
My friend said,

10
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,080
do you have a registered information security professional?

11
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,839
Information qualification security certification,

12
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,520
is a formal expert.

13
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,759
Internet police consultant.

14
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,360
That's why I'm here to consult you.

15
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,639
Your friend is right.

16
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,759
So what do you want to

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,880
consult today?

18
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,119
I just want to

19
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:08,240
install a full set of

20
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,039
security applications,

21
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,720
Aren't you at the right place?

22
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,479
I have

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,559
everything here.

24
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,919
My friend also said that

25
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,240
as long as we can connect to the Internet,

26
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,600
There's nothing you can't solve.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,479
Not only are you skilled,

28
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,919
but you're also very strict.

29
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,160
Yan Niu,

30
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,839
to be precise about my principles,

31
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,720
It's three words,

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,639
Yan Niu,

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,520
First

34
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,440
There's another payment first.

35
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,160
Although we have to pay the full amount in advance,

36
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,639
we also have some free advice,

37
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,639
Adjusting the relationship between husband and wife is helpful for insomnia.

38
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,720
How did you know that?

39
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,479
Shi Quan told you,

40
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
Shi Quan is your husband, right?

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,520
Then come to me.

42
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,919
Is it because your husband has it outside.

43
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,039
Then how did you figure out that

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,279
my husband cheated on me?

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,960
When you were watching the video of the case,

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,720
I used people nearby

47
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,039
to search your WeChat,

48
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,080
Your Moments shows ten visible items

49
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:13,839
to strangers,

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,639
In addition to drying bags, clothes and jewelry,

51
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,239
and poisoning food in the early morning for three days in a row,

52
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,399
It means you slept late,

53
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,600
or,

54
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:21,799
Insomnia,

55
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,079
as the saying goes,

56
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,959
If the friends don't bask in the sun,

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,559
there is something wrong with the couple,

58
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,760
What I said just now

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,279
comes from fact analysis,

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,760
One is from speculation,

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,239
and the other is for testing.

62
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,000
As a result, I broke through your psychological defense.

63
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,079
This is called

64
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,760
zero-distance physical attack,

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Hacker only,

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,720
hacker,

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,760
There are many kinds of

68
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,000
hackers. You're lucky.

69
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,040
The one

70
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,839
who only does good deeds.

71
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,000
So tell me

72
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,079
what happened to you.

73
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,519
Let's see if I can help you.

74
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:01,839
Me.

75
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,279
Honey

76
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,160
I've been walking a lot lately

77
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,119
and my feet hurt. Press it.

78
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,119
Aren't I going to get you a massage card?

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,200
You have to go.

80
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,320
And don't wear your high heels in the future.

81
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,600
My feet are swollen.

82
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,399
You don't play games. Stop watching.

83
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Is the game as good as mine?

84
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:02,679
No,

85
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,880
Itchy,

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,279
It's not that I'm ticklish. You know

87
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm ticklish!

88
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,320
Ms. Xia,

89
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,440
you can skip this part,

90
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,079
Just get to the point.

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,839
That's the point.

92
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,200
That's not the point. What else is the point?

93
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,880
He didn't respond to me even though I was like this.

94
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,799
Is there any problem

95
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,679
with this?

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,399
All right.

97
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,480
Go on.

98
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,359
I'm fine.

99
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,440
You're on WeChat,

100
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,320
Yes

101
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,519
No.

102
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:33,760
Take a look.

103
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,359
What are you looking at?

104
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,040
It's all about work.

105
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,959
I'll call them back tomorrow

106
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,679
Okay,

107
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,880
You'll come back tomorrow, right?

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,839
It's not like this.

109
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,559
Find some TV shows you like.

110
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,279
I … I have to sleep first.

111
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,279
Don't be too late.

112
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,279
Here.

113
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,119
Go to bed early.

114
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,480
I just want you

115
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,559
to help me install an app

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
on his phone,

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,720
I heard that there is

118
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,839
a very advanced application now,

119
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,239
You can monitor, monitor,

120
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,279
and peek.

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,359
How can we not leave a lot behind?

122
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,279
Wait, wait, wait.

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,200
I would never

124
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,119
install an app like this,

125
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,679
You don't care about this?

126
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,760
The first principle

127
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
is never to break the law.

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,839
Then why did you charge such a high price?

129
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,640
I want a refund.

130
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,239
Second rule of the company,

131
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,160
no refund.

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,160
He's been working very hard in the shower lately.

133
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,720
The shower gel has changed

134
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,119
from tasteless to rose-scented.

135
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,279
And a few days ago,

136
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,600
I even bought a colorful cartoon T-shirt,

137
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,000
This flowered T-shirt

138
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:54,720
is also a secondary periphery.

139
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,279
As for the rose-flavored shower gel,

140
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,239
that woman's preference,

141
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,399
It's just a gift.

142
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
This is the exclusive app I developed.

143
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,720
You can quickly compare it

144
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,559
with the pictures on the internet,

145
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,720
Look, this is a gift from the golden mask.

146
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,440
It's too much

147
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,239
to give me a gift.

148
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,799
I want a concrete proof.

149
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,239
A concrete proof,

150
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,279
Tracking and taking photos,

151
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,079
blocking people at the door,

152
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,679
Right now,

153
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,359
right now. I'm not a private detective.

154
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,239
Besides,

155
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,719
stalking without permission is illegal,

156
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,119
However,

157
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,919
there are new ways to play in the Internet age,

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you want to know about it?

159
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,440
The first step

160
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,880
is to check each other's WeChat steps,

161
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,880
We can use this to judge how much exercise he has.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,479
We're in a meeting.

164
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,000
It's not even noon yet,

165
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,760
You've already made thousands of steps.

166
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,039
And he's still walking.

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,400
He must be having a sports meeting.

168
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,840
The second step of catching rape on the Internet,

169
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,119
fishing,

170
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,039
Order whatever you want.

171
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,119
Send the shopping link to your husband,

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,799
and if he transfers it to someone else,

173
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,520
Someone else opened it.

174
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,200
You'll be reminded.

175
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,400
You see,

176
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,159
this means that your husband quickly forwarded

177
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,760
the lipstick link

178
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,200
you sent him to someone else,

179
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,440
Do you like the one I sent you?

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,599
Next, the third and fourth steps,

181
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,400
you have to rely on yourself.

182
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,640
His chat records

183
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,840
will be very clean.

184
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:11,679
It's okay.

185
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,799
We have the Internet. Step three,

186
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,400
Open the Baidu network disk,

187
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,559
log in the Baidu network disk account

188
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:17,559
to your own mobile network

189
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,080
for setting up.

190
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,760
Real-time cloud backup of photos and call records.

191
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,280
As a guilty person,

192
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,799
you are afraid of meeting acquaintances on the way,

193
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,719
I rarely drive my own car.

194
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,200
The fourth step of catching a mole on the Internet,

195
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,719
open his Didi,

196
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,840
Set the emergency contact number to your number.

197
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,119
Don't forget

198
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,239
to turn on the default shared itinerary.

199
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,320
A young woman,

200
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,320
a second dimension,

201
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,280
I like anime,

202
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,000
play games and eat candies,

203
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,359
But after comparing with the phase software,

204
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,479
I found that,

205
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,000
Whether it's her Moments

206
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,080
or her space.

207
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,479
Whether it's food photos or travel photos,

208
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,880
they were all stolen from the internet.

209
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,159
But boss,

210
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,559
this is quite normal.

211
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,880
Now a lot of people like to steal pictures from the internet,

212
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,840
although there are hundreds of pictures in her space,

213
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,440
But the first one was only a month ago.

214
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,559
What do you mean?

215
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,400
It means that

216
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,919
her identity on the Internet,

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,280
It was forged a month ago.

218
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,039
It also hides a lot of real information.

219
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,840
Then what is her purpose?

220
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,960
Think about

221
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:29,799
the purpose,

222
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,719
Shi Quan is a senior executive in the company,

223
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,359
and his company is going to make

224
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,280
an initial public offering soon.

225
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,640
At this time,

226
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,239
who would deliberately fake his identity to get close to him?

227
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,760
so

228
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,520
This is a conspiracy.

229
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,760
In that case,

230
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,960
these investors

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,159
have all become leeks, right?

232
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
I'll add her as a friend,

233
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,919
send her a fake link,

234
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,559
As long as she's authorized to click on it,

235
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,960
I can see her location from the background.

236
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,559
Let's take a look at

237
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,919
what kind of path this dancer is?

238
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,479
The office work in this community

239
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,880
is becoming more and more networked.

240
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,280
Network security

241
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,080
is also very important.

242
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,039
Today, we specially invited

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
our network security experts,

244
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:13,919
Mr. Qin Huai,

245
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:15,760
teach our staff a lesson.

246
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,400
Welcome, everyone.

247
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,559
Mr. Qin.

248
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:24,119
Thank you very much for your invitation. Hello,

249
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,559
everyone,

250
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,799
I'm Qinhuai.

251
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,559
I'm very happy to be here today,

252
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,520
to share my experience with you,

253
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,840
In this long-term network security work,

254
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,919
I found that,

255
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,400
There are a lot of people,

256
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,200
who think

257
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,520
they are safe,

258
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,679
I let my guard down.

259
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,359
That's why they were attacked by the internet.

260
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,880
So we should always

261
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,039
ask ourselves a question,

262
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,119
You.

263
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,359
Is it safe?

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,960
Online fraud

265
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,960
refers to the use of various communication tools,

266
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,239
Internet platform,

267
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,280
with the help of the public,

268
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:02,599
What's wrong?

269
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,479
With the help

270
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,000
of... What is this?

271
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,320
You're my grandson.

272
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,200
Mr. Qin,

273
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:14,799
what's going on?

274
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,479
It's not me.

275
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,159
Expert,

276
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,719
is your computer infected with a virus?

277
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,679
That's right.

278
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,719
Is he infected with a virus?

279
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,039
How could this happen?

280
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,799
Yes,

281
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,919
this is a live demonstration

282
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,000
I prepared for you.

283
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,400
It's a demonstration.

284
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,119
Here's the thing,

285
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,880
I just want to ask you,

286
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,159
if our computers

287
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,799
are hacked remotely.

288
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,200
Like just now,

289
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,760
what should we do?

290
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,159
What should we do?

291
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,320
Unplug the network cable, shut it down,

292
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,919
and call the network security personnel immediately.

293
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,239
At the same time, report to the superior,

294
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,359
and,

295
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,520
Do not restart the infected computer by yourself,

296
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,799
strictly disconnect the network,

297
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,000
When the computer is turned off,

298
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,520
don't connect to the internet either,

299
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,440
Why?

300
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,080
Because there are many computers

301
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,640
with network startup function.

302
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,559
It can restart automatically via the network cable.

303
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,359
So all the other computers

304
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,400
have to be disconnected from the network and isolated,

305
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,799
Awesome. Awesome.

306
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:30,400
Auntie,

307
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,200
please send this to me.

308
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:31,679
-Okay. -Bye.

309
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,359
Bye, Director.

310
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:32,880
Bye.

311
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,200
Thank you for your hard work.

312
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:33,919
Help us promote it.

313
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,479
Okay, okay.

314
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:34,719
Okay,

315
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,719
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

316
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,599
Boss,

317
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,119
so it wasn't a demonstration just now

318
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,280
but he was poisoned, right?

319
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,599
How was your performance?

320
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,760
One word,

321
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,200
Absolutely,

322
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,840
If I hadn't made the presentation,

323
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,960
I would have believed it.

324
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,840
Every good Internet security player

325
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,719
is a good actor.

326
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,039
Learn from me.

327
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,159
But then again,

328
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,119
that woman is good.

329
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,440
You mean

330
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,679
the Ghost Fire Dancer,

331
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,840
My fake link

332
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,039
is a little rudimentary,

333
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,479
But I can detect it in a short time,

334
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
and then my backhand

335
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,640
goes straight to the point. My backhand is black.

336
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,679
I have two brushes.

337
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,640
Okay, I underestimated the enemy.

338
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,080
No one is safe.

339
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,080
What's wrong?

340
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,159
As a person like you,

341
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,320
you're narcissistic and conceited,

342
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,559
And acting as well.

343
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,479
I can't believe you still have a chance to be fooled by others.

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,679
I'm telling you,

345
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,359
a woman who knows computers,

346
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,599
She's not just a mistress.

347
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,320
Someone must have a purpose behind her,

348
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,559
Okay,

349
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,400
This is getting more and more interesting.

350
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,200
Get in the car.

351
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,599
Hello,

352
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,440
I'm Heng Yuan Zhi Zheng's lawyer,

353
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,239
Hello,

354
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,320
Yu Shihai,

355
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,479
My name is Lin Shuo,

356
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,359
and we are the lawyers for this transfer.

357
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,080
I hope you can cooperate with our work.

358
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:02,960
Just as the chairman said,

359
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,920
can you get through the tutoring period smoothly?

360
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,000
A successful listing

361
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,400
requires all of us to work hard and cooperate with each other,

362
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,959
Please read this document

363
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,800
carefully.

364
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,520
Be sure to comply with it completely.

365
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,359
Other than that,

366
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,640
everyone here,

367
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,079
If you have any flaws in your personal life,

368
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,959
please let me know in advance.

369
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,239
Otherwise,

370
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,920
if something goes wrong,

371
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,880
The law firm won't help you

372
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,199
with your problems.

373
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,640
You must be responsible for my confusion.

374
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,400
How do you expect me to be responsible?

375
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:44,880
Who is it?

376
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,880
It affected the listing.

377
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,880
Then.

378
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,640
Don't blame me for being rude.

379
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:57,280
Fuhua Hotel is waiting for you.

380
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,479
It's impossible to reveal your privacy.

381
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,839
Alright then.

382
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:05,959
Mr. Shi,

383
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,479
do you have any questions?

384
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,599
No problem.

385
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:15,839
It's an honor.

386
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,079
Our company can hire

387
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,599
an excellent and professional team like you,

388
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,560
Of course,

389
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,000
as our chairman said just now,

390
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,439
In order to ensure the listing of the company,

391
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,479
we will do our best.

392
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,880
I'll cooperate with your work.

393
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,040
Thank you.

394
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,400
By the way,

395
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,280
it must be our first meeting.

396
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,599
How do you know my last name?

397
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,199
In order to ensure your company can go public smoothly,

398
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,199
about everyone here,

399
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,640
I know everything like the back of my hand.

400
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,599
Professional, professional, professional, professional,

401
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,560
professional, professional,

402
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,560
Now please open the file.

403
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,640
We'll discuss specific matters.

404
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,599
Miss Xia,

405
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm really sorry.

406
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,760
That's all for now.

407
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:11,920
Boss,

408
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,160
Xia Yan said her husband is in the hotel now,

409
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,880
I want you to catch him with her.

410
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,640
I refused

411
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,719
to catch him.

412
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,199
Because it's impossible for you to go there.

413
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,839
I'll go.

414
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,400
What?

415
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,479
Did I hear it right?

416
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,479
She went to catch a mole.

417
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,719
I'm going to meet that dancer.

418
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,119
Let me see what kind of person she is.

419
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:29,839
Where is it?

420
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,040
Mr. Shi,

421
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,359
you have a wife,

422
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,199
You can't do this.

423
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,000
Don't mention her now,

424
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
you can't force me.

425
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,520
Or I'll report you.

426
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,760
Report it.

427
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,479
Do you know what happened

428
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
to the last person who reported me?

429
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,319
Just like you,

430
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,680
during your internship,

431
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:54,880
And then?

432
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,040
Reporting me,

433
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:57,599
it's not like she didn't make a scene before.

434
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,319
But who will believe it if I tell anyone?

435
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,800
You mean Xiaoya,

436
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,520
I heard from the company before,

437
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,040
Someone mentioned it,

438
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,839
but I didn't expect it to be true.

439
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,599
If you follow me,

440
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,520
I promise.

441
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,400
You have a bag

442
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:22,959
you like,

443
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,920
Watch,

444
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,640
A car,

445
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,520
I'll buy them all for you.

446
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,199
And if you don't agree,

447
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,000
I promise.

448
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,119
You'll end up worse than her.

449
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,719
I'll be here soon.

450
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,359
No! I don't want it!

451
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,199
Mr. Shi No,

452
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:48,880
Shi Quan,

453
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,479
What are you doing?

454
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Let me explain.

455
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,400
Why should I listen to your explanation?

456
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,479
Not us.

457
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,439
Who is this girl?

458
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
You're still dressing up, aren't you?

459
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,560
She's my colleague.

460
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,800
What kind of colleague is this?

461
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,920
We're here

462
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,119
for a meeting. What meeting?

463
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,680
A colleague dressed like this,

464
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:04,959
you have to let me explain.

465
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,560
Divorce?

466
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:06,880
You're so strong.

467
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,119
Still running.

468
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,680
Run.

469
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,280
Keep running.

470
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,719
Little girl, you're good at

471
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,079
running. You're so strong.

472
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
You know how many blocks I've been chasing you.

473
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,920
Are you done?

474
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,439
What's wrong

475
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,800
with a man?

476
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,439
No, I haven't.

477
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Stop chasing me.

478
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,880
Wait a minute.

479
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:22,680
Tell me,

480
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,599
Who sent you here?

481
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,880
Who cares?

482
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,160
Where's your camera?

483
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,560
I don't know.

484
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,880
Where did you go?

485
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,439
Think about it.

486
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,520
Think about it.

487
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,000
You're really thoughtful.

488
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,880
You have a strong sense of prevention.

489
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:40,880
Are you there?

490
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,000
Boss,

491
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,239
new beauty tea,

492
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,599
Beauty beauty, detoxification, rejuvenation and cure all diseases.

493
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:46,640
Please taste it.

494
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,560
Do you have to recite the lines

495
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,079
of Wechat business like this now?

496
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,439
I'm showing my true feelings.

497
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,560
I don't even want to talk about you.

498
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,040
Do you work as a Wechat business during working hours?

499
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,839
I've turned a blind eye.

500
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,400
Now you're selling it to me.

501
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:58,760
It's not necessary.

502
00:24:58,959 --> 00:24:59,959
What did you say?

503
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,319
I think you've worked too hard.

504
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,000
Look.

505
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,640
You look haggard in such a prosperous age.

506
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,599
I specially made a cup of tea to make it up for you.

507
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,800
What you said woke me up,

508
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,880
so let's say it to your gorgeous face

509
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,839
What is it?

510
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,560
Didn't you go to see

511
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,880
the Ghost Fire Dancer today?

512
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,599
Is she tall, short, fat,

513
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
thin, pretty or has long hair?

514
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,640
All right, all right,

515
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,319
all right.

516
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,719
Don't gossip.

517
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,920
We're an internet security company,

518
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,280
not a private detective.

519
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:24,560
Get back to work.

520
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,839
Hold on.

521
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:27,719
What's wrong?

522
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,439
Where's Shengshi Beauty's tea?

523
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,719
Slow down.

524
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,560
It's hot. Is she pretty?

525
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,439
It depends on whether your tea tastes good or not.

526
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,560
Get back to work. Cut the crap.

527
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,040
In fact, you shouldn't have saved me,

528
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,719
and you shouldn't have given me hope.

529
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,079
Sorry to bother you.

530
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,199
Auntie, I've reached

531
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,199
1205, right?

532
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,199
What?

533
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,400
You've rented it out,

534
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,400
Auntie

535
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,839
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

536
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,439
Didn't I come here for nothing?

537
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,239
Auntie,

538
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,760
if there are any good houses in the future,

539
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,000
Remember to recommend it to me,

540
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,280
Okay,

541
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,199
-Thank you. -Bye.

542
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,079
Hello, is anyone there?

543
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,280
Hello, is anyone there?

544
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,800
Is there anyone here?

545
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,079
Open the door!

546
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,800
Come on. I bought you lunch.

547
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,119
I heard that

548
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,760
this restaurant is the best.

549
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,040
Do you want to try it?

550
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,880
The patient is recovering well now,

551
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,400
so I usually talk to her more often,

552
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,079
Pay attention to her mental state.

553
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,839
It's so nice.

554
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,439
You're awake.

555
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:18,520
Are you hungry?

556
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,640
Why did you save me?

557
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,319
I can't just leave him in the lurch.

558
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:39,640
It's useless.

559
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,160
I'm going to die sooner or later.

560
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:52,640
Yes

561
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,199
People will die sooner or later,

562
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,239
but now is not the time.

563
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,719
Look,

564
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,400
there are so many wonderful things.

565
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,280
We can enjoy it.

566
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,640
I don't even know.

567
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,359
Where did you get so much courage?

568
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,520
He's a jerk.

569
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,560
I graduated from college this year.

570
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,560
After working hard here alone,

571
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,000
I finally found a job.

572
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,479
But unexpectedly,

573
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,359
I met a scumbag boss,

574
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,199
At first, he just sent me WeChat messages to harass me,

575
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,599
later

576
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,839
You became a salacious jerk to me in the office,

577
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,920
and then I couldn't stand it anymore.

578
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,880
So I offered to resign.

579
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,560
I didn't expect that before that,

580
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,040
I was bitten back by him.

581
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,400
They said I tampered with the financial affairs.

582
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,319
You know what?

583
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,040
For our industry, this kind of comment

584
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,640
is equivalent to a death sentence.

585
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,079
Isn't there a saying in One Piece?

586
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,680
As long as you live,

587
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,520
there will be surprises in your life.

588
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,319
But the evidence has been taken away.

589
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,479
What if he destroys it?

590
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,479
Since he stole the camera,

591
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,199
it means he wants to know what's inside.

592
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
As long as the file is still there,

593
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,479
we can get it back.

594
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,479
Do you know who he is?

595
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,239
-Test. -One, two, three,

596
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,599
two, three.

597
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,599
One, two, three,

598
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:29,880
okay?

599
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:31,959
Don't worry.

600
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,400
I'm sure it'll be fine.

601
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,920
The camera has been installed,

602
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,599
so you can't tell, can you?

603
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,439
Young Master, I've been pretending to be

604
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,439
a female game anchor online for so long.

605
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,439
There's no pressure to switch female voices.

606
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,880
Leave it to me.

607
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,839
This kid is a bit like me.

608
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,599
Except he's not as handsome as me.

609
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,359
For the mobile phone party,

610
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,880
charging treasure is the guarantee of security.

611
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,079
But charging treasures from unknown sources

612
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,680
may be very unsafe.

613
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,079
The criminals will put a super small computer

614
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,800
in the shell of the charging treasure,

615
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,040
The modified charging treasure looks normal,

616
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,439
but after connecting,

617
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,959
They will automatically steal personal data, photos

618
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,640
and other privacy from their phones,

619
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,079
Even if you unplug the data cable

620
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,280
and implant the Trojan virus into your phone,

621
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,040
And through the mobile phone network,

622
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,920
you'll keep sending your privacy

623
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,760
to criminals,

624
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,079
However, it is inevitable

625
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,520
to borrow charging treasures in your life.

626
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,760
How can we protect ourselves?

627
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,199
First,

628
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,079
do not use charging treasures provided by strangers,

629
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,959
Renting a regular shared charging treasure.

630
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:51,479
Second,

631
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,479
Even if it's a charging treasure provided by an acquaintance,

632
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,119
during the whole process of using it,

633
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:57,319
Make sure the phone is in your own hands,

634
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,040
and cut it off immediately if you find anything abnormal.

635
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,599
Thirdly,

636
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,439
confirm that the serial line debugging function of the mobile phone is turned off,

637
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,760
Reject all requests for serial line debugging.

638
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,839
If there's anything you don't understand,

639
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,880
you can check the videos online.

640
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,040
Remember, safety comes first.
