Awesome.

3
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,559
A well-known company executive Shimou

sexually harassed several female subordinates,

5
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,360
Real name suggests physical castration,

6
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,199
when you meet this kind of person,

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,360
So I slapped him.

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Be sure to turn on the microphone boldly.

9
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,120
Be brave and say no,

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,639
sisters,

11
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,599
You must learn to protect yourself.

12
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,360
No way. No way.

13
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,319
Are you blaming girls for being too pretty again?

14
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,279
You can't force me.

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,480
Or I'll report you.

16

Do you know that?

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,360
The last person who reported me,

20
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:53,360
think about what will happen?

21
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,480
Think about it. I still have a meeting

23

No

29
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,919
I've been on hot searches

30
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,800
for several times.

31
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,399
Smelly boss,

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,399
The sexual harassment of the company's executives

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,440
is amazing.

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,919
Awesome! Travel

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,279
heroes! Hero! Hero! Hero!

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,279
Stop.

37
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,679
Zhou You,

38
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,679
the blogger said that the account he reported to Quan Jian

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,880
was SilenceLamb's Silence of the Lambs.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,199
Isn't your Weibo called

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
Seven Days Chain Dasheng?

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,160
That's right.

43
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,399
Did you send it?

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,080
That's right.

45
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:39,800
Did you send it?

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,520
Is it you?

47
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:41,839
Why are you leaving?

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,600
The monsters know it.

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,279
I am anxious to find a son of a bitch with bad rules,

about hidden rules of the workplace

53
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,479
has been trending all over the internet these two days,

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,839
He's the one who sent it to Quan Jian.

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,880
The trouble of knowing the route number

56
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,720
is to take a bubble,

57
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,240
No one replied.

58
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,960
My puzzle box level is 76,

59
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,600
and now I offer a heavy reward.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
Those who provide valuable clues,

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,039
I will reward them with heavy money,

62
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,559
The level of the puzzle box is 76,

63
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,479
which is just so-so.

64
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,039
There are so many masters at Level 130

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,800
in the forum.

66
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,440
By the way, how much is the heavy money?

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,039
How?

68
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,919
When will you pay?

69
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm a huge sum of money.

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
Ridiculous. Braggart. Please

71
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,440
figure out

72
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,679
your vital capacity first, okay?

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,520
Girls with scores above 90,

74
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,639
no picture and no truth.

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,240
Please show me your valuable evidence.

76
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay,

77
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll blind you today.

78
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,679
Zhou You,

79
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,639
my computer is broken.

80
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,279
Come out and have a look.

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
Restart.

82
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,839
I've restarted it eight times.

83
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,520
Hurry up.

84
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,440
You're picking your feet,

85
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,520
you're the bubble gum demon,

86
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,360
Let's go.

87
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:03,440
Get out of here!

88
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:03,880
Let's go.

89
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,800
Don't touch me

90
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,080
there. I don't want to do it anymore.

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,240
Pay your salary.

92
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,160
You broadcast live in my net cafe every day,

93
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,399
I haven't calculated the money with you yet.

94
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go.

95
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:15,559
Okay.

96
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,480
Network manager.

97
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,079
What's going on?

98
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,200
They're coming.

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm here.

100
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,200
The network manager's computer is blacked out.

101
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,079
Don't make so much noise.

102
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,320
Let me have a look.

103
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,040
Don't worry,

104
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,160
webmaster.

105
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,040
Let me have a look.

106
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,679
Zhou You, you brat.

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,760
You hacked my computer again.

108
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,000
Bubble Gum Devil,

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,519
you can hack the other party's account

110
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,640
in a short time,

111
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,679
Good job.

112
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,640
I'll accept your big offer,

113
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,000
It turns out to be a deep water zone,

114
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,519
a hidden god.

115
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,679
The person you're looking for is Qin Huai,

116
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,799
the boss of Kaihang Internet Security Company,

117
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,720
I'll send you the address and photos. Remember

118
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,320
not to break the law.

119
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,959
It's not illegal to know the rules.

120
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,760
You don't even know the basic defense.

121
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,559
Quite a lot of tricks.

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I can't defend myself.

123
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,399
I can't even defend myself.

124
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:24,559
It's hard for you to be satisfied.

125
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:26,959
Ms. Cleaner,

126
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,839
come on. The kids are here for class.

127
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,200
As the boss of a company,

128
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,880
with such a small office,

129
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,880
And there are only two employees.

130
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,799
You're such a failure.

131
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,679
Yes. That's

132
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,959
why the funding is limited.

133
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
The reception is not good,

134
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,079
but the coffee tastes good.

135
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
Are you interested?

136
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,480
Let's just have a drink.

137
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,040
I'm just asking you,

138
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,399
who said I'd flush it for you?

139
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,799
You, Qinhuai,

140
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,720

141

He graduated from the Computer Science Department of Nanhua University.

142
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,359
He's a talented student,

143
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:10,920
After graduation,

144
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,079
he turned down an invitation from a big company.

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,040
He runs a small internet security company,

146
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,440
likes the Premier League and Arsenal

147
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,160
is a money junkie.

148
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,040
So far,

149
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,959
there are dozens of other Solo events.

150
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,720
Do you want to know where I got it?

151
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,480
No,

152
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,440
it's what you want inside,

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,760
Kid,

154
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,679
you have to pay for talking to me on time.

155
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,920
You have two choices now,

156
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,000
One,

157
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,079
Go pay the money to this lady.

158
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,600
Two,

159
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,480
See you off.

160
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,359
You stole my camera?

161
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,480
You stole my video report,

162
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,239
and took away the fruits of my victory.

163
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,239
Don't think this is over.

164
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,839
Of course not.

165
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,399
I've been waiting for you

166
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,640
to thank me, haven't I?

167
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,119
I reported the video

168
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,640
to Shi Quan Company for you,

169
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,320
Why are you so thick-skinned?

170
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,279
If you're still a man,

171
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,000
you can compete with me.

172
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,399
If I win,

173
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,440
you will not only admit publicly that

174
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:17,720
you are the son of a bitch riding the wave.

175
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,279
And give me

176
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,519
SilenceLamb's account number.

177
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,959
What if you lose?

178
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,000
You said,

179
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,640
you can work for me for one year free of charge.

180
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
It doesn't include food and shelter.

181
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,559
Isn't it too dark?

182
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,679
I can't afford to lose.

183
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,200
If you can't afford to lose, go home and eat bubble gum.

184
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,479
How could I not afford to lose?

185
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:47,840
Okay,

186
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,599
Work out the questions.

187
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,359
No matter what method you use,

188
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,320
you won't be able to answer it in ten minutes.

189
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,599
I'll win.

190
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,960
I'll give you these ten minutes as a free gift.

191
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,640
Tell me,

192
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:06,880
who am I?

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,400
Aren't you quite capable?

194
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,719
You gave up so soon?

195
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,719
Ghost Fire Dancing Girl,

196
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,599
Bubble Gum Demon

197
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,520
Cleaning Auntie.

198
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,880
But I think your real name

199
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,799
sounds better.

200
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,039
Right?

201
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,840
Zhou You.

202
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,039
You can't just say your name.

203
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
You don't like to study,

204
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,760
but you're smart,

205
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,400
The computer is self-taught.

206
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,440
On the bright side,

207
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,080
you're a talented computer boy,

208
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,039
At worst,

209
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,200
you're a teenager with severe internet addiction.

210
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,520
You still have some free time.

211
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,359
Then,

212
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,359
as a comparative statistic

213
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:39,719
for this quantity difference,

214
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,719
It's usually used to compare

215
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,679
two or more addition values,

216
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,400
Size at different times

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,799
or under different conditions,

218
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,599
There's only one.

219
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
You're lawless just because you know

220
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
how to use computers twice.

221
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,280
Change your grades,

222
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,520
get back at the teacher,

223
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
In the future, in the society,

224
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,960
he will make a big mistake.

225
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,080
Principal,

226
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,200
something's wrong with the child,

227
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,039
It's all because we didn't teach them well.

228
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:12,799
Yes, yes, yes.

229
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,200
I apologize to you.

230
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,840
It's all our fault.

231
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,000
This brat is not sensible.

232
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:17,880
When I get back,

233
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,320
I'll teach him a lesson.

234
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,280
Principal,

235
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,239
Please

236
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,400
Just give him one last chance, okay?

237
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,520
This kind of student

238
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,919
must be dealt with seriously by the university.

239
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,039
Take him home.

240
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:28,559
Principal,

241
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,119
he knows he's wrong.

242
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
Yes, sir.

243
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,239
Give him another chance.

244
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,520
Come here

245
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,000
and apologize to the principal. Come on, come on.

246
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:35,760
-You admit your mistake. -Your mom, I'm

247
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,960
not wrong.

248
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,840
Take a look.

249
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,280
What kind of attitude is that?

250
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,719
You didn't admit your mistake,

251
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,559
Principal.

252
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,159
The child did wrong,

253
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,520
because we didn't teach him well.

254
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,719
It's our fault.

255
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,520
I'll kneel down for you.

256
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,440
I'll teach him

257
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,039
how to behave now. Get up first.

258
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,359
Mom, I'm not wrong.

259
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,000
Mom, get up and talk.

260
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:55,880
Get up!

261
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,479
Come here.

262
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,440
Let's get up first.

263
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,520
Take a look.

264
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,880
It's all your fault.

265
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,640
Just give him a chance.

266
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,960
I'll teach him a lesson.

267
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,080
Okay, get up first.

268
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,599
I'll teach him a lesson when I get home.

269
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,080
Forgive him this time, okay?

270
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,760
After you ran away from home,

271
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,840
you started wandering around the country.

272
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,679
It's been two or three years.

273
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,239
I'm willing to admit defeat.

274
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,119
Two out of three.

275
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,479
Hello,

276
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,599
Hey,

277
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:02,280
Hey,

278
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,559
Say something.

279
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,919
Zhou You,

280
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,400
Zhou You,

281
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,440
Zhou You, is that you?

282
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,080
Son,

283
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,760
Son,

284
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,919
I miss you.

285
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,440
After verification, we found that

286
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:12,520
the person who posted the news was an employee of your company,

287
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,159
He also admitted to posting the video privately

288
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,760
in order to increase his popularity.

289
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:16,760
The company has handed him over

290
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,080
to the police.

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,119
Have I told you,

292
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,000
this period of time

293
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,440
is very important for the company to go public.

294
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Did I say,

295
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,400
never for personal reasons,

296
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,960
Discredit the image of the company.

297
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,679
As an external legal team,

298
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,520
we can understand the pressure

299
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,559
of the group now,

300
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,679
How about this?

301
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,479
Where's Lawyer Lin?

302
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,280
He's very experienced in this kind of case.

303
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,640
Tell everyone about it.

304
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,559
I've had a few cases of harassment in the workplace.

305
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,840
We all won.

306
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,679
However,

307
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,400
I represent

308
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,440
the harassed party every time.

309
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,520
After all, I'm also a woman,

310
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,000
and usually,

311
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,679
The primary need of the victim

312
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,679
is psychological,

313
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,159
They need to apologize.

314
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,039
get your reputation back,

315
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,039
get respect,

316
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,000
Find a sense of security.

317
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,479
The second is financial compensation,

318
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,200
if you just use money to send it away,

319
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,640
It will bring them a stronger sense of shame.

320
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:17,960
Give me a result.

321
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,359
Most of the time,

322
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,679
because of privacy,

323
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,599
The injured party will choose not to hear the case in public.

324
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,479
The impact is limited.

325
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,960
But this incident has been made public.

326
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,719
And there's a concrete proof video.

327
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,159
It has a lot of influence,

328
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,479
so my advice is,

329
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,679
Fire the client immediately.

330
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,320
Announce Lin Lv as quickly as possible,

331
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,640
so Chairman,

332
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,359
What about us?

333
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,880
Let's go back and discuss it carefully.

334
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,799
I'll give you the best solution as soon as possible.

335
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:41,599
Okay.

336
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,840
You,

337
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,159
Get out.

338
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,479
Because of Shi Quan's misconduct,

339
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,200
the company's reputation has been greatly affected.

340
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,080
The board of directors discussed and decided

341
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,799
to transfer him to the branch office.

342
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,280
This kind of person should be fired directly.

343
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,359
Let me ask you a question first,

344
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,640
why did the chairman take such a big risk?

345
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,640
And when all the stones

346
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,520
are adjusted,

347
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,479
I've read the materials.

348
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,599
When Quanjian was in a small workshop,

349
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,919
The 19-year-old Shi Quan

350
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,080
worked hard with the chairman.

351
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,960
It's been 20 years now.

352
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,640
It seems that they have a special friendship.

353
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:29,919
Chairman wants to protect him,

354
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,679
not because of 20 years of friendship.

355
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,919
It's because of the bloody history of our family

356
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,280
in the past 20 years.

357
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,479
He knows too much.

358
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,719
You mean,

359
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,880
they're in the same boat.

360
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,840
If Shi Quan is really pushed too hard,

361
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,440
and something bad comes out of it,

362
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,119
Then the listing will be ruined, right?

363
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,440
Stop thinking about it.

364
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,919
I'll tell you the truth in advance.

365
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,760
As a partner of the law firm,

366
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,440
Boss has privately agreed to it.

367
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,320
Really?

368
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,479
That's why you have to behave well this time.

369
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,159
Make sure they go public with all their might.

370
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,599
As for Shi Quan,

371
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,439
now that we've got the result,

372
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,520
Don't pursue it any more.

373
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:07,800
But I can't just

374
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,520
let this scum go.

375
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,439
Lin Shuo,

376
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,160
show some professionalism

377
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,479
and do what you should do.

378
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,839
Okay,

379
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:22,520
I'm here to pick you up.

380
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,079
Let's go.

381
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,400
I'll get going then. How's Lawyer Yu?

382
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,280
Is everything going well?

383
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,680
I haven't figured out what happened to Shi Quan yet.

384
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,400
Honey,

385
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,959
try to think like this.

386
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,599
If the company fails to go public

387
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,599
because of the Shi Quan scandal,

388
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,040
Then the company

389
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
is doomed to be hit.

390
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,800
Hundreds of employees

391
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,800
will be laid off by then,

392
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,719
There are hundreds of families behind it.

393
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,599
What did they do wrong?

394
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,880
But what about the victims?

395
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,839
They have won.

396
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,760
Your reputation will recover slowly.

397
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,239
And you're the defense's lawyer.

398
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,160
Don't get emotional.

399
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,439
Don't think too much.

400
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,040
I have one more question,

401
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,880
Mr. Yu, why do you think

402
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,680
I can't solve this problem by myself.

403
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,280
I need your help.

404
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,439
Because Shi Quan

405
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,439
is facing a crisis of public opinion.

406
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,359
What does your boyfriend do?

407
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,439
Your boyfriend works as

408
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,160
a public relations company specializing in solving public opinion crisis.

409
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,599
I'm just a gift.

410
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:55,000
It's like

411
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,839
buying a house and giving decoration,

412
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,079
No one wants to buy decoration

413
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,239
instead of a house, right?

414
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,760
Right?

415
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Don't think too much.

416
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,800
I'm coming.

417
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,560
Siya,

418
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,239
Zhou You,

419
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:24,920
Thank you.

420
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,400
Actually, I just want to

421
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,520
tell you today,

422
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm going back to my hometown.

423
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,439
Haven't things been settled?

424
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,040
Come in and have a seat.

425
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,319
Here to drink water,

426
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,520
why are you going back to your hometown all of a sudden?

427
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,079
So Xiaoya

428
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,760
is not good-looking.

429
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,680
Which decent girl would wear a dress like this?

430
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,280
Xiaoya looks good and has a good figure.

431
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,160
It's me. I want to do it too.

432
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,199
Wait for the reversal.

433
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,319
I thought,

434
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,479
this is the end of this matter.

435
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,880
But who would have thought,

436
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,760
because of the word Xiaoya in the video,

437
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,520
I was tracked down by netizens.

438
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,359
Who are these people?

439
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,920
I'll scold him for you first.

440
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,199
Zhou You, forget it.

441
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,079
I also blamed them,

442
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,199
but I found out,

443
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,959
The more I explained it, the more excited they were,

444
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,719
and what I was thinking,

445
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,160
It's a good thing that

446
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,520
my name appears in the video.

447
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,160
We can take the opportunity to clarify the truth.

448
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,920
But the netizens aren't looking at the truth,

449
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,920
they're just having fun.

450
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,439
Maybe for you,

451
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,439
it's just a battle.

452
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,119
But for me,

453
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,880
this is just life,

454
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:19,040
I just want to live in peace now.

455
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:22,800
All right,

456
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,199
don't see me off.

457
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,560
Take care of yourself.

458
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,880
Mr. Shen, you're really something.

459
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,040
It's only been two or three days,

460
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,160
The trend of public opinion changed.

461
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,319
Nice rhythm.

462
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,479
In the public relations industry,

463
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,760
in this case,

464
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,959
There's a technical term,

465
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,079
called slut humiliation.

466
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,280
Slut humiliation?

467
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,359
What do you mean?

468
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,959
Take this girl as an example.

469
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,719
If this girl

470
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,479
uses this photo to post a Weibo,

471
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,880
What would you think?

472
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:39,920
Beauty,

473
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,880
what about now?

474
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:49,680
A gold-worshiping beauty.

475
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,640
Comparing this photo,

476
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:55,959
what do you think now?

477
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,800
Slut?

478
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,680
That's right.

479
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,599
I didn't find the dancer,

480
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:16,000
But we can start with Heisiya first,

481
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,040
the effect is the same.

482
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,599
Because the public thinks

483
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,560
they are the same kind of people,

484
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,199
It doesn't matter if it's good or bad.

485
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,199
Put a label on her first,

486
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,199
slut

487
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,560
To change the public's perspective on problems,

488
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:29,959
everything will be beautiful.

489
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,800
It gets worse in an instant.

490
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,680
Good, good, good.

491
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:36,560
I admire you.

492
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,119
If anyone dares to make a scene again,

493
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,640
then push a wave of

494
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,839
conspiracy theories about dancing girls shooting videos,

495
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,160
They won't be able to explain it clearly.

496
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:46,640
Okay,

497
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,680
Let's do this.

498
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
I finally figured it out.

499
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Nothing

500
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:57,079
can't be solved by a troop of water,

501
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,880
If you can't solve it,

502
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,160
can you give me a push?

503
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,079
By the way, Mr. Shen,

504
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,079
about the video,

505
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,599
It'll be over after a few days.

506
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,040
But my wife,

507
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,119
if my wife puts it off any longer,

508
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,479
It'll be a powder keg.

509
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
This is really delaying the listing.

510
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,280
Then our chairman

511
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,920
will have to eat me,

512
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:20,359
It's hard for an honest official to break the family affairs.

513
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,400
No, no, no, no,

514
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm telling you,

515
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,800
you have to help me with this.

516
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,680
Besides,

517
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,319
we've agreed on the price.

518
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,000
Let me think.

519
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,439
Okay.

520
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:51,680
Boss,

521
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,959
that little brother came again yesterday,

522
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,280
And he still stays at the door.

523
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,800
It's none of your business

524
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,319
whether Xiong Haizi is childish or not.

525
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,959
But many of our clients,

526
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,119
have been taken away by him.

527
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,280
I'll go.

528
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,439
Hit him.

529
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:11,920
I'll go check it out.

530
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,719
Pick it up.

531
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,439
It's a big reward for opening a business.

532
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,280
Today, we can

533
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,359
get rid of it for free

534
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,439
and eliminate it for free,

535
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,560
Eliminate the virus, okay?

536
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:20,479
It's free.

537
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,719
Come and experience it.

538
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,439
Have a try.

539
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,280
Come on.

540
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,800
Do you want to have a try?

541
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,239
It's free. It's free.

542
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,400
No problem. Okay,

543
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:27,760
Okay,

544
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,880
It's free.

545
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:30,959
Professional elimination opening and hanging,

546
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,160
don't miss it

547
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,040
when you pass by.

548
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,640
Come in and have a look.

549
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,839
There's a surprise on the second floor.

550
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,359
There's an event on the second floor.

551
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,719
Professional team and thoughtful service.

552
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,640
To answer all your doubts,

553
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,319
you can't afford to lose money and you can't fall for it.

554
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,680
It's free for me.

555
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,839
It's free for me.

556
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:49,920
He refused to operate

557
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,920
without a license for a fee,

558
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,640
If you see it, you can call the police

559
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,280
and take it away. It's free.

560
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,359
What are you doing?

561
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,079
Aren't you competing with me?

562
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,160
Aren't you going to compete with me?

563
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,119
Yes.

564
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:05,800
Today, when you didn't see it,

565
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,079
I already took five orders from you.

566
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,560
One to one.

567
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,079
Do you know this is a vicious competition?

568
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:12,239
I think it's benign.

569
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,439
It's free for you if you can.

570
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,599
Hello,

571
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,400
you're looking for a company, right?

572
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:17,959
Come in. Please come in.

573
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:18,800
Can the photos be restored?

574
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,079
We can recover. We can recover.

575
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,199
My service is better than his.

576
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,160
And it's free for me.

577
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,479
Come on, beauty. This way, please.

578
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,560
Beauty, come and sit here.

579
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,280
What service do you need today?

580
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,680
I accidentally deleted

581
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,239
the most important photos on my phone.

582
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:31,959
Can you recover?

583
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,839
I'm sure you can recover.

584
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,560
Beauty, have a seat.

585
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,439
Let me get you a glass of water.

586
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,119
Have a seat.

587
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,760
Don't rob my client.

588
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,359
Mr. Li, let me lend you a glass of water.

589
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:00,800
All right,

590
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,400
do you think you've recovered?

591
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,599
You've really recovered.

592
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,479
Thank you.

593
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,479
-You're welcome. -It's okay. If there's any

594
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,280
problem with your phone or computer in the future,

595
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,239
You can come to me directly.

596
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,439
I'll stay here from now on, okay?

597
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:11,839
Bye.

598
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,040
Hello,

599
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,760
Hello,

600
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,439
I'm Heng Yuan Zhi Zheng's lawyer,

601
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,400
Lin Shuo

602
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,800
I'd like to meet your boss, Mr. Qin,

603
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,160
our boss,

604
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,239
He's on a business trip.

605
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,599
Why don't I make an appointment for you?

606
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll check his schedule first.

607
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,760
Please wait a moment.

608
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,560
From the current point of view,

609
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,000
Tang Lin,

610
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,599
Lend me your comb.

611
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,599
I don't think there's any need for another day.

612
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,319
This way, please.

613
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,239
Hello, Mr. Qin,

614
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm the lawyer representing Quanjian Group.

615
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,680
-Lin Shuo. -Hello,

616
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,800
Mr. Lin. Hello,

617
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,719
Qin Huai Qin Huai,

618
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,239
I'll cut to the chase.

619
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,760
Good for you.

620
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,680
I'm here with the Firecloud Dancer

621
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,719
who charges on time,

622
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,400
This name is familiar, isn't it?

623
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,520
Not bad.

624
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,439
I'm quite familiar with it.

625
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,040
It's an idiom, right?

626
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,719
On the day Shi Quan was filmed,

627
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,119
you also showed up at the scene.

628
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,680
Someone caught a video of you chasing her.

629
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,160
So?

630
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:36,880
So,

631
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,640
I hope you can provide her whereabouts.

632
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,719
I've asked about Mr. Qin's style,

633
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,119
so I need to pay the full amount in advance, right?

634
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,239
After signing the confidentiality agreement,

635
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,079
you can make the payment.

636
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,000
I thought only a shameless person

637
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,920
like me,

638
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,239
That's when I met Qian Yan.

639
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,000
I didn't expect Lawyer Lin

640
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,920
to be such a righteous person.

641
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:20,079
You colluded with me, too.

642
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,719
I didn't expect that,

643
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,199
Mr. Qin, a well-known boss in the internet security industry,

644
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:26,119
actually did the dirty work of catching traitors,

645
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,560
Thank you for your compliment.

646
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,040
How is it, Miss Lin?

647
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,560
If I also investigate for you,

648
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,479
your other half

649
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,839
is not real and doesn't need money.

650
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,839
And I'll give you a 20% discount.

651
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,640
Mr. Qin,

652
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,160
I'm looking for the Ghost Fire Dancer,

653
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,359
I want to verify some information with her.

654
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,280
I'm not trying to harm her.

655
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,359
Or buy her off.

656
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,000
In addition, my PhD major

657
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,119
is Internet law and personal information security,

658
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:55,599
When it comes to protecting personal information,

659
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
I'm also a professional.

660
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,719
If I find out about your flaws

661
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,800
in this aspect,

662
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,520
I'll sue you.

663
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,040
So please take care of yourself.

664
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,000
You surrendered so quickly.

665
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:10,800
No,

666
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,160
I welcome you.

667
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,640
Mr. Lin is very welcome

668
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,239
to do research in our company.

669
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,359
It's my honor to be

670
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
the subject of academic research.

671
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,439
In less than five minutes,

672
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,239
I won't charge you this time.

673
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:48,880
Aunt,

674
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,439
no sister,

675
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,719
Are you here for business?

676
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,760
It's free. We're still

677
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,400
collecting tickets here.

678
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,959
I can't even

679
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,640
stop that rich guy

680
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,239
just now.

681
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,319
You have to place an order with me.

682
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,839
There's still a big order.

683
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,400
Your hair is pissed off by me.

684
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,479
When you grow up,

685
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,599
Then you'll know our world as a man.

686
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,839
Have some nuts.

687
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,359
Replenish your brain.

688
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,319
Remember to sort garbage?

689
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,319
Give me the leftovers.

690
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,520
Obviously, the girl named Siya is a bigger problem.

691
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,199
There are always people like you who can't carry it clearly,

692
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,800
who speak for Green Tea. What about your values?

693
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,800
Bro, you're on the wrong side.

694
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:00,959
May I ask,

695
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,479
how can we let the netizens see the truth clearly?

696
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:05,920
What is it?

697
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,760
My friend was slandered and no one believed her.

698
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,599
Who slandered your friend?

699
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,079
Whose account did you hack?

700
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,199
If you send an apology letter in his name,

701
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,599
you can clarify the truth for your friend.

702
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,520
Black account number is not good, right?

703
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,680
He can throw dirty water on your friend,

704
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,439
and of course you can hack his account,

705
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,439
Why are you talking to a scoundrel?

706
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,599
You're right.

707
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,800
Do you know

708
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,680
the National Anti-fraud Center app?

709
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,640
Of course I know.

710
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,400
This app classifies

711
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:56,400
and presents

712
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,920
cases of fraud.

713
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,599
If you encounter any abnormal situation,

714
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:01,439
you can directly compare it

715
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,040
according to the above case,

716
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,359
I found that

717
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,239
it can also monitor

718
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:05,719
the security of apps in your phone,

719
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,280
And give an incoming call warning.

720
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,160
If you find

721
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,719
any clues about fraud,

722
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,959
You can report it here.

723
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:12,760
You know what?

724
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,800
Thanks to the National Anti-Fraud Center,

725
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,239
this app is so popular.

726
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,319
A swindler has pretended to be

727
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,880
a staff member of the Anti-fraud Center.

728
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,400
Fraud.

729
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,199
If they meet me,

730
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,119
I must report them here.
