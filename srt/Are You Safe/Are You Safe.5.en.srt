1
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,479
You're quite bold.

2
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,000
How dare you cheat our money.

3
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,639
I wasn't sure.

4
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
Now it seems that you are really

5
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,160
with those pig-killing plates.

6
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,279
We're on the same team.

7
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,240
Are you investigating us?

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,479
I wouldn't dare, bro.

9
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,960
I just happened to find out that

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
you are liars.

11
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:53,639
Brother, it's all done.

12
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,440
We are destined to be together.

13
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,759
Sign this debit note.

14
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,600
Don't suffer too much.

15
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,839
1 million.

16
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,679
I'll take your 300 thousand.

17
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,520
You fooled us around.

18
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,320
You have to collect some labor costs.

19
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,639
I was wrong.

20
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,639
I was so wrong.

21
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,360
I'll return the 300 thousand

22
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,600
to you intact.

23
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's pretend it never happened.

24
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,919
Let's make friends, okay?

25
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,399
Give me a break

26
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,639
and let him talk.

27
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,600
Son of a bitch, you only know how to hit people, right?

28
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,839
That's all you can do.

29
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,080
You're still a professional debt collector.

30
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,119
Do you have the strength to do it?

31
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,199
All right,

32
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
stop talking,

33
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,600
Okay,

34
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,440
It seems that you two have an unusual relationship.

35
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,279
It's really unusual.

36
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,399
Enemy,

37
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,039
Enemy,

38
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,119
That's good.

39
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,639
I'll avenge you.

40
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,240
I'll go.

41
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,039
What are you adults

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,279
capable of beating a child?

43
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,279
Come at me if you dare.

44
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,520
Zhou You

45
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,039
Do you want to continue?

46
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Or should I sign it?

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,320
What do you think?

48
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,720
I'll sign your name.

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,760
The little brat's mouth is still tough.

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,200
Chop off

51
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:18,839
one of his fingers.

52
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,679
Get down!

53
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:23,880
let go

54
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,519
Big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big.

55
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,600
I was wrong. I was wrong, brother.

56
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,200
I have to operate the computer with my hands Brother,

57
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,040
Brother I was wrong Brother.

58
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,839
I'll count to three.

59
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,399
Brother, brother,

60
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,320
One

61
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,799
Qin Huai, Qin Huai, Qin Huai,

62
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,760
Qin Huai, Qin Huai, Qin Huai,

63
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,440
If I lose my finger

64
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,239
Qin Huai Qin Huai Will you sign it or not?

65
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,880
Qinhuai,

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,399
Two,

67
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,640
Qin Huai, I'm losing my hand.

68
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,679
I'm losing my finger.

69
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,359
Will you sign it or not?

70
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,679
Say something Qin Huai,

71
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,480
Qin Huai,

72
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,079
Say something Qin Huai,

73
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,160
Qin Huai,

74
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,040
I'll sign it.

75
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,920
I'll sign it.

76
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,119
Brother,

77
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,320
take the knife away.

78
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,799
That's right.

79
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,480
Behave yourself.

80
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,799
Run!

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,559
Run!

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,519
Run, Zhou You

83
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,640
Run,

84
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,079
Go after him!

85
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,640
This way.

86
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,799
Go after him!

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,000
This way.

88
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,040
Have you practiced before?

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,720
You have to protect yourself in this line of work.

90
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,880
Stop!

91
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,239
Hurry up!

92
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,119
This way.

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,640
Let's split up. You guys

94
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,600
go over there.

95
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,359
I'll go this way.

96
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:02,880
Brother,

97
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,320
I fell in on purpose.

98
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,320
I won't be able to explain it to you for a while.

99
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,279
I don't know what to say.

100
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,040
Tell me about your love brain,

101
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,679
what else do you like, Aunt Loli?

102
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,679
You have to find a chance

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,279
to run.

104
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,880
Leave me alone.

105
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,279
Who's running? I'm here to save you.

106
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,799
I'll run.

107
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,799
Save yourself first.

108
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,679
I'll go with you.

109
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,440
Brother.

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,839
I told you

111
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,359
to hit me. I told you to hit me.

112
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Stop right there!

113
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,760
Let's go.

114
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,679
You two, stop right there!

115
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,239
Little brat.

116
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,840
Chubby.

117
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,520
Chubby,

118
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,320
Big one,

119
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,640
They're downstairs.

120
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,039
Let's go.

121
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
You can't run away.

122
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,479
Run.

123
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,520
Keep running.

124
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,559
Let's see where you can go.

125
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,679
Keep running.

126
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,359
Where can you

127
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,440
two little brats go?

128
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,280
What a toast.

129
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,039
If you don't sign

130
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,000
1 million's contract,

131
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,200
He even stabbed my brother's leg.

132
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,880
You even stuffed me in the elevator.

133
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,559
I'll charge you five million yuan now.

134
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,440
It's not too much, is it?

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,320
I'll give you two choices,

136
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,440
One

137
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,840
Go back and sign the contract with me,

138
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,239
Two,

139
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,359
I'll prick each of you

140
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,799
on one leg. It's up to you.

141
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,200
You're breaking the law, you know?

142
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,640
It's not up to you to decide whether to break the law or not.

143
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,640
What are you afraid of?

144
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,679
Look at my

145
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,320
5million deal.

146
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,719
That's

147
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,280
all you got.

148
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,719
That's more like it.

149
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,880
Right here.

150
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,159
Hurry up!

151
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,239
Don't touch the police.

152
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm really impressed.

153
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,679
You'll fall for this too.

154
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,640
I even went to save you.

155
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,799
I'm impressed.

156
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,400
Stop laughing.

157
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
I suggest you change your career

158
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,080
and close the door sooner or later.

159
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,200
Qin Huai,

160
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,840
you're so bold.

161
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,840
You acted on your own.

162
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,679
Are you going to die?

163
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,880
Well,

164
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,000
what should I do?

165
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,359
You should have told me earlier.

166
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,880
If I hadn't found out in time,

167
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,159
I would have come to the police team to save you.

168
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,359
Your life will be over.

169
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,280
Officer Guo, come here.

171
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,719
Originally,

172
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:08,039
everything was in my plan.

173
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,239
It went very smoothly.

174
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm going to have those three people in my hand.

175
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,000
Who knew this brat

176
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,520
would come in and mess around all of a sudden,

177
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,479
Fortunately, I didn't mess up when I was in danger,

178
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,159
what do you mean by messing around?

179
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,640
I'm here to save you, okay?

180
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Our captain is over there.

181
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,000
Go and explain yourself.

182
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,440
I … I'll explain.

183
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,400
Come on.

184
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,400
Take it easy.

185
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,599
Come on.

186
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,640
Have some water.

187
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,760
It turns out that Qin Huai asked those girls out,

188
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,960
just to get close to them.

189
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,320
Why didn't I think of that?

190
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,640
Face up to your own shortcomings.

191
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,159
It's also an improvement.

192
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,960
Are you comforting me?

193
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:09,080
That's right.

194
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,119
Thank you.

195
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,520
It's even sadder.

196
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,200
Well

197
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,919
… Is there anything you want to eat?

198
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,479
Hello, Commander Huang Mao,

199
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,280
Advisor,

200
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,799
Something happened.

201
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,679
Did someone order anything

202
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,919
missing here?

203
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,799
I didn't lose anything,

204
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:56,640
but,

205
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,280
A lot of information has been copied away,

206
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,119
do you think you're a loser?

207
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,520
I'll go.

208
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:13,840
The police are here.

209
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,119
What should I do?

210
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,919
Delete all the data on the server,

211
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,679
as well as the records

212
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,760
of my contact with you.

213
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
Shut up and don't talk!

214
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,080
I'll find a way to get you out.

215
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,159
Stop!

216
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:25,880
Don't move.

217
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,719
Hands above your head.

218
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,200
General,

219
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,760
one of my men has been arrested.

220
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,479
Find a way to get him out.

221
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,719
We've been working together for so long,

222
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,760
don't let me down.

223
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,640
We're old acquaintances,

224
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,039
so we don't need a voice changer.

225
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,760
Don't act like it's none of your business.

226
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,880
When you talk to me,

227
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,719
you'd better be clear about your position.

228
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:19,880
General,

229
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I'll provide you with,

230
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,559
The personal information you need for your business,

231
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,080
the four major databases,

232
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,559
What about you?

233
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,200
To provide landing service

234
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,280
for my team in Taimanda.

235
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,239
You've paid so much for the protection.

236
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,080
It's time for you to contribute.

237
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,719
Captain Guo's surprise trial is over.

238
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,320
These are all off the line.

239
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,039
They're all online abroad,

240
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,599
and now they're all online docking,

241
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,359
It won't be easy to track it down.

242
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:09,640
Let me show you something.

243
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,520
This is the report I just received.

244
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,359
There are trading records of online fraud gangs,

245
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,599
and even a cheat script for killing pig plates.

246
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,280
It's said to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

247
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,760
This matches the result of our surprise trial perfectly.

248
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,319
It should be the same gang.

249
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Do you know who the informant is?

250
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,319
The other party hid the route,

251
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,479
deliberately not letting us know his information.

252
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,839
And the level is very high.

253
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,640
Using the network disk,

254
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,119
the whistleblower uploaded several G's of data,

255
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
This is just a small part of what we've sorted out.

256
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,640
And more importantly.

257
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,760
He also provided the location of the gang

258
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,199
and information about the people involved,

259
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,280
After comparing with the information we have,

260
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,160
the information he sent is related to the Military Advisor,

261
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

262
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,400
Siya, why are you here?

263
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,040
What's wrong with your head?

264
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:08,599
Head,

265
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:09,800
I accidentally touched it.

266
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,359
Take a seat inside.

267
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,560
There's water in the fridge. Help yourself.

268
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:23,920
Today, I'm here

269
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,640
to tell you a piece of good news,

270
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,079
Shi Quan and I won the case.

271
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
He's a street rat now.

272
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,560
Everyone shouted.

273
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,560
I want to thank you.

274
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,119
You introduced such a great lawyer to me,

275
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,599
but it's not a big deal.

276
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,760
As long as we can get people like Shi Quan

277
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:46,800
to confess,

278
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
It's all worth it.

279
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,319
By the way,

280
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,319
do you know the Silence of the Lambs?

281
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:55,520
What's wrong?

282
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,000
I want to thank him.

283
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,839
He helped me find the Water Army,

284
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,640
and asked the police to seal their numbers.

285
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,560
Silence of the Lambs.

286
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,599
Okay,

287
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,640
I'll pass it on for you.

288
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:15,880
Thank you.

289
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,199
I'll treat you to dinner another day.

290
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,359
Okay.

291
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,479
You're not going back to your hometown?

292
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,439
No,

293
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,560
I've decided to stay

294
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,199
and find a job,

295
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,479
Live a good life,

296
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,479
I want to show those girls

297
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,199
who have the same experience as me,

298
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,800
We are the only ones who speak bravely.

299
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,800
Only the bad guys have nowhere to hide.

300
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,319
If you need any help

301
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,479
in the future.

302
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,079
Just mention it.

303
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,640
I'll be brave on my own in the future.

304
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,520
Protect yourself.

305
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,119
Come on!

306
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,560
Come on!

307
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,680
Boss helped Siya,

308
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,800
but he didn't say it himself,

309
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,160
I think there must be some misunderstanding

310
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,479
between you two.

311
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,479
But he

312
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,319
is indeed quite strange.

313
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,000
Let me tell you,

314
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
how is it strange?

315
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,119
He's a big money fan.

316
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,760
Don't talk about jobs that don't have money.

317
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,319
But as long as it's related to online fraud,

318
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,640
he's willing to follow him for free

319
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,880
and thinks he's hitting on girls.

320
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,199
I didn't expect it was to help the girl

321
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,239
who was cheated recover her loss.

322
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,239
So,

323
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,119
our boss is a good person?

324
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,599
I guess so.

325
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,119
Anyway, I don't have the face to stay any longer.

326
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,959
What did I say?

327
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,560
Ginger is still old and spicy.

328
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,599
The way I look at people,

329
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,479
Accurate,

330
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,319
Give me the money.

331
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,560
What do you mean?

332
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,680
We made a bet on

333
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,640
whether the boss is really morally bankrupt.

334
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,640
I lost.

335
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,560
The receipt code. Come on,

336
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,160
I'll

337
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,359
clean you up.

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,119
You even cut you off.

339
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,680
My character is worth five yuan.

340
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,319
Come to my office.

341
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,119
You used social engineering

342
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,359
to get close to Tang Lin and Ms. Ding to get a good impression.

343
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,199
And then secretly get my information.

344
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,719
This set of office infiltration attacks,

345
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,040
you're pretty good at it.

346
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,800
It also cracked the background software of the wireless network probe

347
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,599
and has some basic hardware technology.

348
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Let's put it together.

349
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,079
He's a net security talent.

350
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,880
You're not blind yet.

351
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,160
What a pity,

352
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,439
He's just an entry-level talent.

353
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,000
Young and vigorous,

354
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:39,040
he only cares about attacking but forgets to defend himself.

355
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,920
I encountered some high-level defense skills.

356
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,079
You're completely blind.

357
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,119
You know what?

358
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,599
I just used the sacrificial inducement

359
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
of a successful force,

360
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,400
Tell me,

361
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,959
why did you fall for it?

362
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,439
All right. I won this round again.

363
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,280
Two to one.

364
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:02,920
Still not convinced?

365
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,920
Why should I take it?

366
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,959
Only two to one,

367
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,040
three out of five,

368
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,800
I'm sure I can beat you.

369
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,400
It's just a matter of time.

370
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,920
All right.

371
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,640
How about

372
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,239
this? Come to work in the company tomorrow,

373
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,680
What?

374
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:20,920
What?

375
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,199
If you want to beat me,

376
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:23,199
how can you not know me?

377
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,560
Before that, you could only stay outside the door.

378
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,079
Now I let you in.

379
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,599
Only by understanding my weakness,

380
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,800
can I win. If I dare not come,

381
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,560
I'll go back to practice if I'm afraid of losing.

382
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,359
I'm not in a hurry.

383
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,199
Let's go.

384
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,640
What if I win?

385
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:45,160
Don't you want my account number?

386
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:46,959
You win

387
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:48,839
Here you are.

388
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:50,719
It's a deal.

389
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,319
It's a deal.

390
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,280
One, two, three,

391
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,479
today is Lawyer Lin Shuo's

392
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,680
day of double happiness,

393
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,599
Lin Shuo solved Shi Quan's case

394
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,119
decisively and simply,

395
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,719
Let Quanjian Group go public successfully.

396
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,400
Lin Shuo

397
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:15,599
is officially our new partner.

398
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,319
Let's raise our glasses together.

399
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,520
Welcome Mr. Lin to join us.

400
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,359
Okay. Congratulations.

401
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,000
Hey,

402
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:25,760
Mr. Lin,

403
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,319
about my friend,

404
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,359
Thank you.

405
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,599
I want to thank you too.

406
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,920
Thank you, my friend.

407
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,719
Stand up bravely and sue Shi Quan.

408
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,199
That's why I have a chance.

409
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,000
Let Quanjian make up its mind

410
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,040
to fire Shi Quan.

411
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Mr. Zhou,

412
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,719
I can't tell that your company is quite formal.

413
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,719
And the contract?

414
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,680
Look carefully.

415
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,400
The probation period is six months.

416
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,439
The regular salary depends on the specific performance,

417
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,119
doesn't it mean that the minimum wage will be paid for half a year?

418
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,319
Aren't you going to give me a promotion even if I become a full member?

419
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,640
Why is your boss so dark?

420
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,680
Otherwise, how can you call it a hacker?

421
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,479
To tell you the truth,

422
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,479
do you want to do it or not?

423
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:36,959
Cheers

424
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,520
The refrigerator and the water bar

425
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,280
are shared equally,

426
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,439
And you have to take turns to fill it up.

427
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,199
Look,

428
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,719
Our boss loves billiards very much,

429
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,280
but his skills are terrible.

430
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,959
So don't play billiards with the boss,

431
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,800
if you want to play billiards,

432
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,599
Remember to lose to him.

433
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,680
Due to the salary problem,

434
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,920
half a day's salary will be deducted for being late,

435
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,239
Half a day's salary will be deducted for early retirement

436
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,800
and three days'salary will be deducted for absenteeism without reason.

437
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,520
Draw the key points,

438
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,400
win the boss billiards,

439
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,400
Dismissal,

440
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:57,959
Also,

441
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,400
The toilet door is broken.

442
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,520
Remember to knock on the door when you go in,

443
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,119
Okay,

444
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,359
When do we usually get paid?

445
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,640
Who knows?

446
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,599
This is your desk.

447
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,680
Do you mind sitting opposite me?

448
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,280
I don't mind.

449
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,079
It's such a big place.

450
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,040
Where else can I sit?

451
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,000
Mr. Zhou,

452
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,319
welcome to join us. Bye.

453
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,680
Zhou,

454
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,520
look at you.

455
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,439
Okay,

456
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,119
Work hard.

457
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,239
Bye.

458
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:19,920
Excuse me,

459
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,599
Mo. Did you go home?

460
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,319
Yes,

461
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,439
what's wrong with that?

462
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:31,119
It's okay. It's just a small accident.

463
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,359
What is this?

464
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,400
I've never seen you drink.

465
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Today is my birthday.

466
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,000
Your birthday?

467
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,439
Yes,

468
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,119
Really?

469
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,479
Yes,

470
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
that's great.

471
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,199
Mo,

472
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,560
Look at this.

473
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,680
This is for you.

474
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,800
For me?

475
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,199
Happy birthday to you!

476
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,599
Take it.

477
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,119
Hello, sir. Here's your drink.

478
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:16,760
Thank you.

479
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,000
Enjoy your meal.

480
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,680
Pretty girl,

481
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,839
are you alone?

482
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:28,880
Have a drink.

483
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,319
Excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.

484
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,479
Sorry, my brother is drunk.

485
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,920
Have a drink with him,

486
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:33,560
and I'll help him back, okay?

487
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,040
Why should I have a drink with him?

488
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,560
Why can't I explain it to you?

489
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,800
If you keep doing this, I'll call the police.

490
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:38,880
Let go of me!

491
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,439
What a coincidence.

492
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,599
Lawyer Lin,

493
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,119
Qin Huai,

494
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,839
Who are you?

495
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:45,959
I'm her friend.

496
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,199
I'll drink it for her.

497
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,479
Brother,

498
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,319
I'm sorry. My brother is drunk,

499
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,199
I'll help him back.

500
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:53,959
You guys have a chat.

501
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,640
Would you like another drink?

502
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,359
No, no, no, it's okay.

503
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,719
What a bummer.

504
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:00,760
Thank you.

505
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,640
Help me out.

506
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,199
Why are you here alone?

507
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:06,760
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

508
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:07,880
What about you?

509
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,319
-Birthday friend. -Sorry to

510
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,119
bother you. -No. He's

511
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,000
not here anyway.

512
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,920
Let me buy you a drink.

513
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,719
Okay,

514
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,760
Come on,

515
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,599
Thank you.

516
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,680
Don't tell me,

517
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,319
I saw you this time,

518
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,599
Much more pleasing to the eye than last time.

519
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,199
Last time

520
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,479
What was I like last time?

521
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,280
Last time,

522
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,680
he was so cocky,

523
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,800
It bothers me to look at you.

524
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,119
You're not much better.

525
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,160
We are the same.

526
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,560
Lin Shuo,

527
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,959
Yi Zhang,

528
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,119
Flowers for you.

529
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,479
Thank you.

530
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:51,520
Let me introduce you.

531
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
This is my boyfriend Shen Yizhang,

532
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,359
This is Qin Huai

533
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,599
who works in the network security industry

534
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,000
and happened to meet him.

535
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:58,839
It's a man named Qin Huai.

536
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,040
He's a consultant to the police.

537
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,400
He was the one who reported

538
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,239
Shi Quan's cheating.

539
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,959
Hello, Qin Huai.

540
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:07,839
Hello,

541
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,760
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

542
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
You guys talk first.

543
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,479
Aren't you celebrating your friend's birthday?

544
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,239
He might not come.

545
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,719
Zhou You,

546
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,760
pick me up here.

547
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
I can't do it anymore.

548
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,000
This is.

549
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,319
My medicine is working.

550
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:22,119
Brother,

551
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,319
wake up, brother.

552
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,479
Brother, wake up.

553
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,079
Wake up!

554
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,920
Are you okay?

555
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,160
Aren't you going to be a hero?

556
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,599
Can't you drink it?

557
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:30,959
Brother,

558
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,199
get up and have another drink.

559
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,599
If you can't rob her, let's rob her of money.

560
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:35,719
Brother, look at the phone.

561
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,680
This phone is nice.

562
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,800
This phone is good.

563
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,239
Empty the wallet of his phone.

564
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,800
Who are you?

565
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,800
Qinhuai.

566
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,560
Qinhuai.

567
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,839
Little Huai Huai.

568
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:28,479
Little Huai Huai.

569
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,119
Qin Huai Xiao Huai Huai,

570
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,439
let me tell you Look,

571
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,040
At a time like this,

572
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,959
you can only call me.

573
00:31:58,719 --> 00:31:59,800
Thank me.

574
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,040
No, it's okay.

575
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,239
Treat me to hotpot next time.

576
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,400
Gosh, it's so heavy.

577
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,280
Let me open the door.

578
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,160
Are you okay?

579
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Qin Huai

580
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,640
Can you keep your voice down?

581
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,359
Ms. Ding,

582
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,400
what are you doing?

583
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,959
Tang helped me get a second kill.

584
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,280
It's a great deal.

585
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm paying with my phone.

586
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,599
Is it safe for you to pay by mobile phone?

587
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,760
This way is very safe.

588
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,680
And it's convenient.

589
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,959
Most importantly,

590
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,640
I don't want to spend my own money.

591
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,760
How did you do it

592
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,800
without spending your own money?

593
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,479
My child gave me

594
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,040
a WeChat relative card payment function,

595
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,599
He set a payment limit.

596
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,439
He won't overspend.

597
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,439
When I paid the money,

598
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
he knew there was a problem immediately

599
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,839
and the child solved it for me.

600
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,199
I'm not bothered at all.

601
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,800
The most convenient thing

602
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,079
is to use his card.

603
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
I don't need to use my phone for a long time,

604
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,599
so what kind of payment function can I use?

605
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,280
What I fear the most is to be upset.

606
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,439
That's really a relief for my parents.

607
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,959
We can still do our

608
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,680
filial duty.

609
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,400
Especially for those old people who don't understand their phones

610
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,319
and are worried about losing money.

611
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:01,880
I'll get ready.

612
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,880
Ask the child to activate a kinship card

613
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,599
function for his grandparents,

614
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,120
He asked me to show filial piety to my parents at any time,
