1
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,000
You're awake.

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
You're awake.

3
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,559
Why are you here?

4
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,680
This is my home.

5
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,240
Why can't I be here?

6
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,639
What's going on?

7
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,559
You were so drunk last night.

8
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,800
Lying on the edge of the flower bed,

9
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,360
I'm glad I went to save you.

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,960
Otherwise, your clothes, pants and shoes

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
will be ripped off.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,559
By the way,

13
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,119
your phone and wallet,

14
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,240
No one survived.

15
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,440
I lost it.

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,600
I didn't expect that,

17
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,720
a great man who runs the Internet,

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,240
When you encounter

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,160
a physical attack in real life,

20
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,039
I can't believe there's nothing I can do.

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,720
You got caught so quickly.

22
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,320
I remember now.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
So,

24
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
there's no such thing

25
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,960
as absolute safety in this world.

26
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:07,960
You know that, right?

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,279
No matter how strong the awareness of prevention is.

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,919
will also fall into a security breach.

29
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,119
How about this

30
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,039
I'll beat you by one round.

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
Two to two parallel.

32
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:19,679
By the way,

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,639
should we

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,639
win four out of seven,

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,360
I'll just give in, okay?

36
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,240
You won.

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,360
Let's call it a day, okay?

38
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,160
You talked to me

39
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,720
all night last night,

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,279
It's like chanting sutras.

41
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,759
Do you remember what you said?

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,320
How can I remember what I said?

43
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,160
What is it?

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
But I remember.

45
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,479
You said

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,919
I was young,

47
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:55,199
With strong skills

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
and courage,

49
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,800
He's handsome,

50
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,080
didn't he say that,

51
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,160
Did it bring back memories in your mind?

52
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,360
Do you remember?

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,919
You believe in nonsense too.

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,239
Are you telling the truth after drinking?

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,920
Anyway, I believe it.

56
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,160
No, I don't think

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,760
it's that simple, you know?

58
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:28,320
I only drank a glass of wine last night.

59
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:30,839
Based on my capacity for liquor,

60
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,720
someone must have drugged the liquor.

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,720
It's drugged.

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
My mobile phone wallet,

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
is it gone?

64
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,799
That's right.

65
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,480
I lost them all.

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,279
That's easy.

67
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,559
By the way,

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,239
the pajamas on you are mine.

69
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,359
I sold it to you.

70
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,119
Remember to transfer the account to me later.

71
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,239
Come on, Brother Huai. Have some water.

72
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,399
Thank you.

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Qin Huai,

74
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,720
the watchdog software of your phone is quite good.

75
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,119
You can install one for me later.

76
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,920
How is Qin?

77
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,440
That's it. My head still hurts.

78
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,559
Because of what happened last night,

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,440
I almost forgot that

80
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,440
the blood test report came out.

81
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,399
You do have some illegal

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,880
psychotropic drugs left in your body,

83
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:32,279
It's a drug commonly used in rape and rape cases.

84
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,279
What a jerk.

85
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,359
We must catch them.

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,440
Otherwise, more girls will suffer.

87
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,880
He has been transferred to the Criminal Investigation Department.

88
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,119
By the way, Xiao Mo,

89
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,279
I was just about to ask you.

90
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,200
Do you have any news?

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,760
That's right Qin Huai,

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,679
you kept saying that name

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,399
last night.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,760
Who on earth is Chen Mo?

95
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,440
Lao Guo,

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
when can I take away my evidence?

97
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,760
Xiaopeng, take care of it.

98
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,679
Okay.

99
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,600
I'm asking you a question.

100
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
Who on earth is Chen Mo?

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,040
Let's go.

102
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,600
No.

103
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,440
Wait! Wait!

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,799
Spit here. Spit here.

105
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,079
Hello,

106
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,119
the package is here.

107
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm looking for Mr. Qin Huai.

108
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,239
I can collect

109
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,440
his package for him.

110
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,720
Ask me to sign for it.

111
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,880
Hold on.

112
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,399
Boss,

113
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,559
please sign for it.

114
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,239
I asked you to collect it yourself.

115
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,839
Mr. Qin?

116
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,440
Please sign for your package.

117
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:34,799
You've worked so hard.

118
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,000
Ms. Ding,

119
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,600
get me a bottle of water.

120
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,480
Thank you.

121
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:41,959
Okay.

122
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,000
Thank you.

123
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,200
Thank you.

124
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:48,640
Of course.

125
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,279
Thank you for your hard work.

126
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,799
Welcome, Mr. Qin Huai.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,119
498.

128
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,040
499。 .

129
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,040
Dear Mr. Qin Huai,

130
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,839
thank you for coming to the Cyber Security Summit

131
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,480
and successfully signing in.

132
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,079
Zhou You

133
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,679
Everyone,

134
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:45,640
this way, please.

135
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,279
Thank you for taking the time

136
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,559
to attend our conference.

137
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:49,959
Hello, sir.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,959
This is our competition area.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,760
You can't enter it casually.

140
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,760
It's okay. I'll take two photos.

141
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,839
Please cooperate with us. Sir,

142
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,320
I'll just take two photos. What's wrong?

143
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,640
It's no big deal.

144
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,079
Just a few computers

145
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:58,679
and a few desks. What's the big deal?

146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
We also prepared a generous prize.

147
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,880
This way, please. Come on,

148
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,480
let's go.

149
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,519
I'm really sorry, sir.

150
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,000
Would you please cooperate with me in the photo shoot?

151
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Please cooperate with us.

152
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,079
Okay, okay. I'll go.

153
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll go. Okay?

154
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,320
I'll take two more photos of you.

155
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,079
Hello, sir.

156
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,359
Which company are you from?

157
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,720
Yes, I am.

158
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,839
Do you have an invitation?

159
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Invitation,

160
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,119
You mean the invitation?

161
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,000
Of course.

162
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Wait a minute. I was

163
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,720
in my pocket just now

164
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,239
Waiting for you

165
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,919
We found

166
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,760
Qinhuai who opened the net,

167
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,080
This is my secretary.

168
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,239
Welcome, Mr. Qin.

169
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,520
Help yourself.

170
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,520
Why are you here?

171
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,960
The system informs me that someone is impersonating me,

172
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,280
so I have to come and take a look, right?

173
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,760
If you embarrass me now, I'll embarrass you.

174
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,239
I'm embarrassed.

175
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,599
Are you kidding me?

176
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,559
You didn't see,

177
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:00,200
when I was in the center of the stage,

178
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,159
How many fans have you attracted?

179
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,679
I'll go.

180
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,640
Isn't Hu forced too bold?

181
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
As for the presentation document,

182
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,760
you can do it.

183
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,599
Then you should hold one as well.

184
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,799
A meeting like this.

185
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,119
Distinguished guests,

186
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,119
and the audience watching the live broadcast.

187
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,000
Hello

188
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,080
and welcome to

189
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,159
Tiger Force Internet Conference.

190
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,719
In this conference, we are honored to invite

191
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,000
Professor Huang Ming, a famous network security consultant.

192
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,479
Cloud computing security expert Academician Yao Qing

193
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,640
is here.

194
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,919
Now let's welcome the well-known

195
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,400
domestic network security service technical support,

196
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,799
He is also the chief technology officer of Hu Forced Group.

197
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,520
Mr. Ma Pingchuan came to the stage,

198
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,520
Please welcome him

199
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,960
Hello, everyone.

200
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,200
Hello, I'm Ma Pingchuan,

201
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,119
and I'm honored to be here with all the experts and scholars,

202
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,359
And our colleagues in the industry,

203
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,000
to share the research and results

204
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,280
of Hu forced on network security,

205
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,799
As you all know,

206
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,320
from national security

207
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,479
to scanning the code to buy breakfast,

208
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,080
We can't live without the internet everywhere.

209
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,679
For the network,

210
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,719
security is its top priority.

211
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,799
As a responsible company,

212
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,400
Hu forced to keep up with the times,

213
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,159
Hold it for me.

214
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,000
Do your best to research and develop it,

215
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,880
aiming at the ubiquitous network security problem,

216
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,159
It provides all-round security

217
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
for the masses.

218
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:12,239
To promote a new era of network security.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,799
In addition,

220
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,960
Hu forced the company to do its best in research and development,

221
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,400
Facing the public,

222
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,320
we launched a brand new flagship product,

223
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,280
Hu forced the security service group.

224
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,960
It's called Hu Yun

225
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,640
for short. Where's our Hu Yun?

226
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,320
It provides a cross-era protection solution

227
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:41,080
for enterprises and websites.

228
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,039
Since building the cloud and running it today,

229
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,640
it has experienced hundreds of thousands of attacks.

230
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,440
But none of them were successful.

231
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,320
That's because I didn't attack him.

232
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,200
This is what Huyun is capable of.

233
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:59,960
As I'm sure you've noticed,

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
in the middle of the venue,

235
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,320
There is a circular area,

236
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,599
so this is a challenge project

237
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,080
organized by our conference,

238
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,359
First, to prove

239
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,520
how outstanding Huyun is,

240
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,520
Second, through this challenge,

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,159
I want to find some new talents.

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,919
Our Huyun Branch

243
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,200
has a total of five defenses,

244
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,080
Who can break through three of them?

245
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,359
He'll be able to win

246
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,840
the super prize we're offering,

247
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,479
Interested friends can sign up now.

248
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,239
It's right here.

249
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,719
Remember, there are only eight people.

250
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't bring shame on yourself.

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,919
It's almost done. Let's go.

252
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,400
I want Ma Pingchuan

253
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,919
to see what I'm capable of.

254
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,440
The game begins.

255
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Goodbye.

256
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,039
Goodbye.

257
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,919
Goodbye. Goodbye.

258
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,679
Mr. Lin,

259
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,599
what a coincidence.

260
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,919
Why are you here?

261
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,280
I'm here for a job.

262
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,239
By the way,

263
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,599
I want to thank you.

264
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,400
You helped me out at the bar last time.

265
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,880
I heard Officer Guo tell me about the situation,

266
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,479
and I've been thinking,

267
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,599
When will I have a chance to treat you to dinner?

268
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:48,640
It's okay,

269
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:49,400
number three,

270
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,640
Knocked out.

271
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,080
Number four,

272
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,359
eliminated.

273
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,159
Number eight,

274
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,239
eliminated.

275
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,400
No. 2 is eliminated.

276
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,719
Hu Yun,

277
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,880
who eliminated you on the 1st,

278
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,239
is still very well guarded.

279
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Of course.

280
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,679
No. 5 is eliminated.

281
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,679
It's amazing.

282
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,559
Good for you.

283
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,640
The younger generation is awesome.

284
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,599
Number seven,

285
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,039
break the second level.

286
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,400
The third round.

287
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,640
The game begins.

288
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,239
Countdown to three minutes.

289
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,119
Let's just say the first three,

290
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,799
there's still a chance to break through.

291
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,799
The key is the last two lanes,

292
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,039
if you want to break through

293
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,919
all five lanes at once,

294
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,679
it's impossible.

295
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,119
So we chose lane three.

296
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,239
You still have time?

297
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,400
Don't always think about attacking.

298
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,960
Are you fooling me?

299
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,239
That's all you can do

300
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,400
to embarrass yourself,

301
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,239
Luckily, I didn't transfer you to a full-time job in advance.

302
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,400
Well

303
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,960
How could I have thought that they would fight back?

304
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,880
You can do it. Go.

305
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,119
Let's welcome Mr. Ma Pingchuan, Chief Technology Officer

306
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
of Hu Forced Group, to present the award.

307
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,439
Please welcome him

308
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,719
-Hello, Mr. Ma. -Hello, Mr. Ma. Right

309
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,599
now,

310
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,560
The mood of this award is complicated,

311
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,959
because after all, it has to be given to a player

312
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,560
who has broken through the three lines of defense of Huyun,

313
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,079
But you're here to present this award.

314
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,319
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

315
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,839
I think this is a very good thing.

316
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,040
Because the spirit of Hu forced

317
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,640
is to constantly break through and improve.

318
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,920
Luckily, you only broke lane three,

319
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,479
but if you break lane five today,

320
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,719
I can only detain you here.

321
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,839
I was forced to go to work by Hu.

322
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,280
Come on,

323
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,040
Congratulations.

324
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,119
Awesome. Awesome.

325
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,160
Qinhuai,

326
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,160
Qin Huai

327
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,319
Champion,

328
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:58,959
Champion. Champion.

329
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,760
This is the chief technology officer of Hu forced,

330
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,439
Director Ma,

331
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,239
This is my partner Qin Huai.

332
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,040
Long time no see,

333
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,000
long time no see,

334
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,280
You know each other?

335
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,760
Of course we're old friends.

336
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,959
I always thought you liked to be alone.

337
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,680
I didn't expect to have another partner now.

338
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,479
And he's so young and outstanding.

339
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,599
Congratulations,

340
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,959
Director Ma didn't say that

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,400
about my partner last time.

342
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,239
Ma Pingchuan,

343
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,599
why are you doing this?

344
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:39,839
Let go of me!

345
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,160
What you did is ruining his life.

346
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,079
-Let him go! -Let him go!

347
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,319
You ruined his career, okay?

348
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,359
Calm down.

349
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,199
Listen to me.

350
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,319
I'm the vice president of NetSecurity Association,

351
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,839
and I'm putting a member who's morally corrupt,

352
00:19:58,959 --> 00:19:59,880
Expel the meeting,

353
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,800
and notify all members and member units,

354
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,119
That's my responsibility.

355
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,160
You don't have to use him.

356
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,599
But you can't slander him.

357
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,800
You misunderstood.

358
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:14,599
I just did what I should do.

359
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,199
As you know,

360
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,599
network security is extremely sensitive

361
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,119
to our industry,

362
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,079
Our industry is built on

363
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
trust,

364
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,599
We can't let anyone hurt

365
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:29,079
the credibility of the industry.

366
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,400
So it's inevitable to fire him.

367
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,000
But it doesn't affect you.

368
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,040
I'll never be with

369
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,040
a hypocrite like you.

370
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
Hu forced is the best company.

371
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,359
Are you really willing to

372
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,880
influence your future for him?

373
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,839
It's the best company now.

374
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,920
Not necessarily in the future.

375
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,439
Now that five years have passed,

376
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,359
the tiger is still forcing you

377
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,079
or you?

378
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,439
You have to work hard.

379
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:04,800
Of course,

380
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,239
you have to work harder on this server.

381
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,400
Mr. Ma,

382
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,280
you just said to break through the lane three defense system,

383
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,000
And what was the ultimate prize?

384
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,520
You can work in our company,

385
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,239
I'll give you ten times the annual salary,

386
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:24,959
Damn it.

387
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,920
Ten times the annual salary?

388
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,319
Is it really ten times?

389
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,239
Of course.

390
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:31,880
Okay,

391
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,599
Remember,

392
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,479
Okay, bye.

393
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,719
Xiao Huai Huai Xiao Huai Huai,

394
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,479
your old friend,

395
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,000
I just asked for ten times the salary.

396
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,239
Dig me to work at his place,

397
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,920
ten times?

398
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,920
Then why don't you go?

399
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,760
I won't go even if it's 20 times.

400
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,680
Am I that cheap?

401
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,079
He's the technical director of Hu forced.

402
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,079
And the vice president of the Security Association,

403
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,800
why would you offend someone

404
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,000
you can't afford to mess with,

405
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,880
I just don't like him.

406
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,400
I've never taken anyone seriously. Okay,

407
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,800
that's great.

408
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:10,760
Jin,

409
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,119
you're as good as I was back then.

410
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,719
Hey, Godmother.

411
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,599
What?

412
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,239
Don't worry. Speak slowly.

413
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:26,199
Qin is here.

414
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,040
Slow down.

415
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,479
Qin is here,

416
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,239
Godmother

417
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,520
I'm here.

418
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,079
What's the rush?

419
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,839
There's one thing

420
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,199
Godmother has been hiding from you,

421
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,280
He.

422
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,719
Is it Chen Mo?

423
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,880
In fact, in the past few years,

424
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,920
Mo has been in contact with me.

425
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,839
But he told me

426
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,199
not to tell you.

427
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,199
As for the specific reason,

428
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,040
I didn't dare to ask.

429
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,079
Don't think too much,

430
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:14,479
Godmother Qin.

431
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,359
In fact, all these years, I can always feel that

432
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,119
he can't leave you alone.

433
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,959
But on his birthday the day before yesterday,

434
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,319
I sent him a message,

435
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,199
He never replied to me.

436
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,359
In the past, no matter how busy he was,

437
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,839
no matter how late he was,

438
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,760
He would reply to me.

439
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,599
I haven't contacted him for days.

440
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,439
Qin,

441
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,959
I can't help it. I'm looking for you.

442
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,760
Did something happen to Mo?

443
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,119
Godmother, don't worry.

444
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,439
Did you talk to each other before?

445
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,439
I … I

446
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,400
… I … We have been in contact via WeChat.

447
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,520
He didn't even tell me where he lives

448
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,959
or where he works.

449
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,359
Chen Mo will be fine.

450
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,199
Can I have a look at your phone records?

451
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,079
Okay.

452
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:06,479
Mom,

453
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,719
I've sent you the video.

454
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,599
Did you see that?

455
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,000
This is where I work.

456
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,319
I'm very good here,

457
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,599
The boss is a nice person,

458
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,560
don't worry.

459
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm on my way home now.

460
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,280
The restaurant is very close to where I live,

461
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,719
and I can get home within an hour's walk.

462
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,199
Don't worry.

463
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,439
I'll tell you when I get home.

464
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,119
We're off work.

465
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,959
We have a lot of customers today,

466
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,439
It's just a little late.

467
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,079
I'm going home by bus now.

468
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:54,800
We're off work.

469
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,640
We have a lot of customers today,

470
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,160
It's just a little late.

471
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,640
I'm going home by bus now.

472
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:29,800
We're off work.

473
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,719
We have a lot of customers today,

474
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,160
It's just a little late.

475
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,479
I'm going home by bus now.

476
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,959
News came from Taimanda,

477
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,839
saying that the general caught the informant,

478
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,239
Tell Chen Mo

479
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,680
to inform his men,

480
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,760
Contact the Taimanda police,

481
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
and take this opportunity,

482
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,319
Take the general away as well.

483
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,319
Look, between Li Weiming

484
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,760
and Li Jinglong,

485
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
They're uncles and nephews,

486
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,479
you know?

487
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,400
Captain Guo,

488
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,079
Qin Huai is here.

489
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,439
I have news about Chen Mo.

490
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,160
You found him?

491
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,719
But he disappeared again in the past two days.

492
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,079
This is where he was last seen.

493
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,680
Check it out.

494
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,400
Okay.

495
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,680
Is the information reliable?

496
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,359
Godmother told me.

497
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,040
He has been in contact with Godmother,

498
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,719
but he suddenly lost contact in the past two days.

499
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:28,640
Don't worry. Let's wait

500
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,599
a little longer.

501
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,160
Captain Guo, come and take a look at

502
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
where Chen Mo appeared.

503
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,199
and the location of the fraud group.

504
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,640
It's very close.

505
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,079
Could it be a coincidence?

506
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,359
Is Chen Mo one of the people involved?

507
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,359
It's impossible.

508
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,839
It's really unlikely.

509
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,800
Because in the information

510
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,119
sent by Taimanda,

511
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
There's no such thing as him.

512
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,079
But I can't rule out that

513
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,719
he has nothing to do with this case.

514
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,040
What do you mean?

515
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Xiaopeng,

516
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,199
do you still remember that

517
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,560
the anonymous report email

518
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,760
sent from Taimanda

519
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,319
showed up in time.

520
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,359
Then Chen Mo disappeared.

521
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,439
You suspect that Chen Mo sent us the email?

522
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,319
Because he sent us an email,

523
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,319
he was retaliated

524
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,920
by the Black Production Group,

525
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,199
If that's the case,

526
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,520
isn't he in danger now?

527
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:22,959
Tell me,

528
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,359
Who asked you to come?

529
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,000
Say it or not?

530
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:40,479
Go on. Go on.

531
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,199
Who sent you here?

532
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,079
Tell me if you want to live.

533
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:51,040
I really don't understand what you're talking about.

534
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,119
It's such a simple question,

535
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,920
don't you understand?

536
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Okay,

537
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:08,239
Let me change to a simpler question.

538
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:13,160
Do you still remember me?

539
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,119
I don't know you.

540
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,880
Last time in Chiang Mai,

541
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,560
I let you run away.

542
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,040
I thought you'd hide

543
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,239
and disappear,

544
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,680
I didn't expect to see you again.

545
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:36,839
What are you looking for?

546
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,640
Like a fly,

547
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,719
it keeps flying around me,

548
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,959
For the last time,

549
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,640
who sent you here?

550
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,599
North and North of Myanmar,

551
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,680
those who want me dead,

552
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,880
still

553
00:30:58,959 --> 00:30:59,760
Police.

554
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,119
I'm just...

555
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,880
I'm just a nobody.

556
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,560
Let's make a living.

557
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,800
Hurry up.

558
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,199
You can suffer less.

559
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,119
Passwords are needed everywhere in the digital age,

560
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,079
the most common being passwords

561
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,640
composed of numbers and letters,

562
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,479
With the continuous development of technology,

563
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,160
biological codes have been rapidly popularized.

564
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,479
Like fingerprints, sounds, irises and so on.

565
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,479
These biological codes that you carry with you

566
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:00,400
are very convenient.

567
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:02,119
You don't need to remember it. It won't be lost.

568
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,160
But as passwords,

569
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,160
they also have a very big weakness,

570
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,920
It can't be changed.

571
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,000
You can't change the fingerprint, the sound,

572
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,239
or the iris in your eyes.

573
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,599
The only thing we can do

574
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,959
is to protect them all the time.

575
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,719
When it comes to the protection of biological codes,

576
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,560
fingerprints are the first to bear the brunt.

577
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,560
Have you heard of the news?

578
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,160
The fingerprint of the defense minister of a European country

579
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:21,959
was copied.

580
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,680
The reason is that he's innocent too.

581
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,640
From the hands of several photos

582
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,439
of his speech,

583
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,199
His fingerprints were extracted.

584
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,920
I have to admire the technological progress,

585
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,079
so that the clarity of the photos is getting higher and higher.

586
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,000
It's so high that even ordinary people's phones

587
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,160
can take 100 million pixel photos.

588
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,599
In this case,

589
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,439
a Scissorhands punch-in photo,

590
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,439
It's enough to make a copy of your fingerprint.

591
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,400
Can't we use scissors?

592
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,959
Life is so hard.

593
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,479
We can't post it on Moments anymore.

594
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,640
But it didn't happen.

595
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,199
Because we have another great technological invention

596
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,560
that is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people,

597
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,800
That's the art of retouching.

598
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,920
Grind the skin before you send the picture.

599
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,560
Even if you have 800million pixels,

600
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,000
the hacker won't be able to dig out a single fingerprint of yours.

601
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:00,920
Some people will say,

602
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,680
don't worry about fingerprints leaking out.

603
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,959
Now the fingerprint is unlocked and there's a biopsy.

604
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:05,680
That's right.

605
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,040
It does have this technology.

606
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,000
But I believe,

607
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
the way to crack it is on the way.

608
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,520
The confrontation between black and white has never stopped.

609
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,920
As the saying goes, the road is one foot high and the magic is one foot high,

610
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,520
the technology can be constantly changed,

611
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,199
But our fingerprints can't be changed.

612
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,560
There's no need to take risks.

613
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,359
They can be protected with a simple operation.

614
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,199
Then we made it.

615
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,680
Please make a mosaic

616
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
for me later,

617
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,400
Protect me.

618
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:27,880
Bye.
