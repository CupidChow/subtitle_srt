1
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,519
Boss, there are a lot of cops outside.

2
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,559
We're surrounded.

3
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,879
Boss, be careful.

4
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,440
Xiaopeng,

5
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,200
any news from Taimanda?

6
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,279
The Thai police have insufficient police force

7
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,839
and the search scope is too large.

8
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,600
No news.

9
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,839
Zheng,

10
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,720
what about you?

11
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,519
The Thai side has sent out more than 40 information

12
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,640
about the people involved in the repatriation.

13
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,880
I'm sorting it out.

14
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Did you catch a big fish?

15
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
The criminal police caught a few middle-level officers,

16
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,239
asked them out,

17
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,559
Their boss is not in Taimanda,

18
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,640
but the good news is,

19
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,720
We stopped dozens of frauds.

20
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
and prevented millions of losses.

21
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,040
Captain Guo, someone is still

22
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,320
transferring money into their account,

23
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,519
I called him to show that

24
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,559
they didn't believe me,

25
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
You said I was a swindler.

26
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,119
You should go back first.

27
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,839
We'll let you know as soon as there's any news.

28
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,799
Be careful.

29
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,399
Watch out!

30
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,239
It's time to change the dressing.

31
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,000
You can speak Chinese?

32
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,799
How do you know I'm Chinese.

33
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,239
Who are you?

34
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,119
When you were unconscious,

35
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,880
you kept calling Qin Huai Qin Huai.

36
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
Thank you for saving me.

37
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm the one who should say thank you.

38
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,640
If it weren't for you,

39
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,559
I guess the person lying here right now,

40
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
It's me.

41
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,679
Thank you.

42
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,720
Give it to me.

43
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,640
What's your name?

44
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,799
I'm sorry.

45
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,480
My name is Mouton,

46
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,040
You're badly injured.

47
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,320
Do you want to go to the hospital?

48
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,720
No need.

49
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,679
I'm fine.

50
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,760
Do you have any family or friends?

51
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,799
I can contact them for you.

52
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,399
No, thanks.

53
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,359
Just stay here

54
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,959
and recuperate for a while.

55
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,959
Don't leave until you're done.

56
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,559
You didn't even ask me?

57
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,119
I'm not afraid that I'm a bad person.

58
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:12,279
All right,

59
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,320
I'm going to pack up.

60
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,320
My name is Chen Mo.

61
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,160
When I get better.

62
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,160
Then I'll leave.

63
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,279
I won't bother you for long.

64
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,119
Call me if you need anything.

65
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:13,880
You.

66
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:15,799
Why is it called Mouton?

67
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,239
Grandma got it for me.

68
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,719
She can't read. There's a buttonwood tree

69
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,559
in front of her house,

70
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,159
It's called Mouton.

71
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,159
What about your parents?

72
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,479
No, I haven't.

73
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,799
I'm sorry,

74
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,679
Me

75
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,599
If you have nothing to do, let's eat.

76
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,479
Godmother.

77
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,039
The police haven't heard

78
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
from Chen Mo yet,

79
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
So I want to go there in person.

80
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,479
You have to be careful.

81
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,799
It's okay. Don't worry.

82
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,960
I will bring Chen Mo back safely.

83
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:13,840
Okay.

84
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,039
Take good care of yourself.

85
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,400
Okay, okay,

86
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:16,840
Goodbye.

87
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,599
I'll get going then.

88
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,640
You're just in time. I need to talk to you.

89
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,760
Let me go first.

90
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,520
Boss,

91
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,760
our company's recent financial situation

92
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,799
is very worrying.

93
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,080
The money that the swindler put in

94
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,000
during the last fishing and killing pig plate

95
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,919
can't be taken out for a while.

96
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,200
In the second half of the year, our rent, water and electricity,

97
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,320
property management,

98
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,320
and the monthly expenses you pay to the nursing home.

99
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,320
Get to the point. Get to the point,

100
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,599
If we don't get any more money this month,

101
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,280
our company can directly

102
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,559
declare bankruptcy.

103
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,159
Okay, I got it.

104
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,640
I still have some balance on this card.

105
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,000
It's enough for the company to last for a while.

106
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:40,960
Let's talk about the rest when I come back.

107
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,919
Are you really going on a business trip?

108
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,239
Yes.

109
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,919
Where are you going?

110
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,840
Where are you going?

111
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,840
You're leaving now?

112
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Could it be that you can't afford to pay

113
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,039
and you want to run away?

114
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:48,919
It's impossible.

115
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,840
It's possible. You have

116
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,520
such a rich imagination.

117
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,799
It's a pity that you're not a scriptwriter.

118
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,760
I have something urgent. Give it to me.

119
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,919
I heard everything just now.

120
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,520
You're going abroad

121
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,679
to find a man named Chen Mo.

122
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,880
You eavesdropped on my call.

123
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,239
I didn't eavesdrop on your call.

124
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,039
You're the one

125
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,919
who called too loudly, okay?

126
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,000
Who on earth is Chen Mo to you?

127
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,239
Why did you go to see him?

128
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
Mr. Zhou, I'm really in a hurry.

129
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,760
Can you give me your bag?

130
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,359
Not bad.

131
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,760
Answer my question first.

132
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,640
He's my friend.

133
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,280
I'll leave Tang Lin's company to you.

134
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,960
Keep an eye on him.

135
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,520
Okay.

136
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,000
I want to go with you.

137
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,039
I've long wanted to meet

138
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
the mysterious Mr. Chen.

139
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,159
I promise.

140
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,640
I'll just help and not cause any trouble, okay?

141
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,400
No way.

142
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
You have to stay.

143
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:29,559
To cooperate with Tang Lin's work,

144
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,760
why should I?

145
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm the most effective employee around you.

146
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,880
You're absolutely right.

147
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,440
But think about it,

148
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,479
if we both leave,

149
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,840
Who will handle the operation of this company?

150
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,080
By her,

151
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:48,880
or by her.

152
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,400
You're the only one who travels around,

153
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
so you have to stay.

154
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,320
Staying here is the biggest help

155
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,239
for me and the whole company.

156
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,159
Tang Lin and Ms. Ding also depend on you.

157
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,479
Zhou You,

158
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm not here,

159
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,960
You're really

160
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
the backbone of this company.

161
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,719
You can leave.

162
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,280
Don't worry.

163
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,479
Don't delay the flight.

164
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,520
I'll take care of the company.

165
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,280
Don't worry.

166
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,119
Let's go.

167
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:17,960
Don't delay it.

168
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,119
Chen Mo.

169
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:47,679
Watch out!

170
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,359
Are you okay?

171
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,719
It's okay.

172
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,719
Where are you going?

173
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,640
I still have something to do.

174
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,000
But you haven't recovered yet. You

175
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,039
… This matter is very important to me.

176
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,400
I have to go.

177
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,640
Do you need my help?

178
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,679
Godmother.

179
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,640
Don't worry.

180
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,840
I'll find Chen Mo as soon as possible.

181
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,799
Be careful.

182
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,359
He looks like

183
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,919
this. That's why he's also Chinese.

184
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,320
Be nice to the Chinese. We'll let you know

185
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,960
when we find it.

186
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,200
Okay, okay.

187
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,359
Please let me know if you have any news.

188
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,039
Excuse me,

189
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,159
has any water monster engaged in internet technology

190
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,559
ever heard of the name Chen Mo?

191
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,599
It seems to be the technical genius

192
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,559
who made revenge.

193
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,599
It's a pity that we took a wrong path.

194
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,599
What is revenge?

195
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,960
It's a super virus,

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,520
it's said that the producer originally developed it

197
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,880
to crack down on black products,

198
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,559
I don't know how it leaked out.

199
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,799
Don't wash those upstairs.

200
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,760
These are all Chen Mo's words

201
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,919
in order to reduce the sentence,

202
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,840
Add 1086, a bad guy

203
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,280
who uses technology to harm people for money.

204
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,320
You deserve to go to jail.

205
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,880
Qin Huai wouldn't be friends

206
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,400
with such a person.

207
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,280
My friend.

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,760
About Chen Mo,

209
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,000
how much did Qin Huai tell you?

210
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,440
I only know that they are friends.

211
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,919
Be careful of Qinhuai,

212
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,520
everyone who is with him will suffer.

213
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,359
Chen Mo is the best example.

214
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,599
What do you mean?

215
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,239
Hello, Mr. Qin.

216
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,520
Yes,

217
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,000
I found Mr. Chen Mo's

218
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,239
work place for you.

219
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,320
Thank you.

220
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:37,359
Does he

221
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,880
work in your shop?

222
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:40,960
Chen Mo

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
works for me.

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Where is he now?

225
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,000
But he hasn't come these days.

226
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
If you want to find him,

227
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,880
you can go to his house to find him.

228
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:49,880
Okay,

229
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,039
Could you please

230
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,960
write down the address for me?

231
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,640
Okay, wait a minute.

232
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,200
Okay.

233
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,679
Hello How does it taste?

234
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,599
It's good.

235
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,520
Chen Mo.

236
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,640
Hello,

237
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,479
I'm looking for Chen Mo.

238
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,239
Is Chen Mo here?

239
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,199
If anyone asks me,

240
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,439
just say I'm dead,

241
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,400
Chen Mo is dead.

242
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,160
It's impossible.

243
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,400
Who are you?

244
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,359
Who are you?

245
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,199
Where is he?

246
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,400
As you said,

247
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,160
they were at the place where I used to live,

248
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,319
Are you looking for me?

249
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,959
It means they haven't let me go.

250
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,719
Do you think it still works?

251
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,959
Is that okay?

252
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,119
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,319
It's okay.

254
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:32,920
Godmother

255
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,079
I haven't been able to reach Xiao Mo yet.

256
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,479
Don't worry.

257
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,920
When I get in touch with him,

258
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,400
I'll let you know as soon as I can.

259
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,880
You bought me a drink for no reason.

260
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,000
What are you doing?

261
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,199
You want to hit on me?

262
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,520
No, no,

263
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,160
no. I want to ask you something.

264
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,319
What?

265
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,839
As far as I know,

266
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,359
Chen Mo is a hacker,

267
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,599
Because he released the virus and caused a big trouble,

268
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:41,119
how could Xiao Huaihuai treat this kind of person as his friend?

269
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,920
You have to ask him yourself.

270
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,839
I also want to ask him,

271
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,040
when will he come back?

272
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,040
He's back.

273
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,079
What?

274
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,199
But I didn't mean to hide it from you.

275
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,839
He said he didn't want to be disturbed.

276
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,920
Where are you going?

277
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,800
Qin Huai,

278
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,400
Qin Huai, open the door.

279
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:24,839
Qin Huai,

280
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,959
Qin Huai, open the door.

281
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,760
I know you're in there.

282
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,000
Stop pretending Qinhuai,

283
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,199
Qinhuai,

284
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,800
Open the door!

285
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,439
Qinhuai,

286
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,719
Tell me,

287
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,079
Don't make so much noise.

288
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,800
Didn't you

289
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,280
come back?

290
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,439
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:40,719
If Tang Lin hadn't told me,

292
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
I wouldn't have known.

293
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,359
I didn't find Chen Mo.

294
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,800
What if you have nothing else to do?

295
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,160
Go back first.

296
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,079
Close the door for me.

297
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,680
You don't want to tell me, do you?

298
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,239
Okay,

299
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,719
What if you don't tell me?

300
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,079
I'm staying here.

301
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,079
What do you want?

302
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Tell me what happened between you and Chen Mo.

303
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Make it clear.

304
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,439
I'll leave right away.

305
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,719
To find the gang

306
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,160
that lied to my godmother.

307
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,719
Chen Mo posted a virus

308
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,239
on the criminal's website.

309
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,400
I don't know why

310
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,280
the revenge was accidentally revealed.

311
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,839
Chen Mo was trying to protect me.

312
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,760
You took all the blame

313
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,359
on yourself.

314
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,560
It's not that I didn't want to bear the burden with him.

315
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,359
Don't disturb the order.

316
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,000
Chen Mo,

317
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,800
take good care of my mom.

318
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:50,839
What did you do?

319
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:05,439
But at that time,

320
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:07,560
Godmother was too weak,

321
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,479
No one can take care of her except me.

322
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Since then,

323
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:23,000
I've been cooperating with the police.

324
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,959
And continue to look for the truth of revenge leak.

325
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,520
It's because I promised Chen Mo.

326
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,520
We're going to start a company together.

327
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,439
I'm in charge of the attack,

328
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
while he's

329
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,680
in charge of the defense.

330
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,640
Did you find out?

331
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,719
Is Chen Mo

332
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,319
a good technician?

333
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,800
Not under me.

334
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,800
It's far above you.

335
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,640
Forget it.

336
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,520
I'll take care of you,

337
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,680
one for you two.

338
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,359
I'm here.

339
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,599
I'm sure I can help you.

340
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,839
I'll go.

341
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,680
It hasn't been repaired yet.

342
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,359
No.

343
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,719
How about

344
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,280
I take it out and show it to others.

345
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,239
It's okay.

346
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,680
I'll try again.

347
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,119
I'm sorry.

348
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,719
It's not your fault.

349
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:21,680
Well,

350
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,760
You do it first. I'll get you some medicine

351
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,079
when you run out of medicine.

352
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,160
Okay.

353
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,599
Goodbye.

354
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:16,719
Chen Mo,

355
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:17,839
what's wrong?

356
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:18,920
Someone's following me

357
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,079
again. Let's go.

358
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,000
I know a path

359
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:26,560
Come on,

360
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,239
Okay.

361
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,079
I've told you before,

362
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,680
you need to protect your fingerprints.

363
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,560
Today, we're going to talk about

364
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,400
another kind of biological code that protects us.

365
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:06,839
Voiceprint,

366
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:08,000
as the name suggests,

367
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,800
It's the fingerprints in our voices,

368
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,640
the acoustic spectrum of each of us,

369
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,719
In fact, they are all different.

370
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,680
I'll be fixed for a long time after I become an adult.

371
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,239
No matter how similar it is

372
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,319
to someone else's voice,

373
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,800
But there's no way to copy

374
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:19,800
each other's voice print,

375
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,439
To some extent,

376
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,119
it's even harder to imitate than a human face.

377
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,959
So more and more important departments

378
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,319
are using voiceprint certification.

379
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,800
For example, some bank applications,

380
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,479
such as WeChat voice print login,

381
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,000
As a biological code,

382
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,719
it can't be changed at will.

383
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,359
It will only change as the vocal organs

384
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,920
mature and age.

385
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,479
So we have to be very careful to protect it.

386
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,479
How can we protect the voiceprint?

387
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,479
You can retouch photos one by one,

388
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:44,800
but you can't change your voice one by one.

389
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:48,239
And I have to talk to others.

390
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,599
I can't help but send voice messages.

391
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,439
That's right.

392
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,119
That's true.

393
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,800
So in this case,

394
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,439
the only thing we can do is,

395
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,839
Don't let out

396
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,560
certain voices,

397
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,319
For example, reading numbers clearly,

398
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,239
reading the alphabet,

399
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,119
If you read the pronunciation of a specific text,

400
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,640
you can't send it to others

401
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,640
at will.

402
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,599
Because they're easy to edit.

403
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,319
Is spliced

404
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,560
so as to be utilized to pass voiceprint detection,

405
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,280
Secondly,

406
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,079
when we use the voiceprint password,

407
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,199
You must choose to

408
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:14,599
avoid the presence of others,

409
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,400
Hello,

410
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:17,359
how can I help you?

411
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,040
No. Please go away.

412
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,040
And the most important thing is

413
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,640
to drink plenty of water,

414
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
Protect your voice.
