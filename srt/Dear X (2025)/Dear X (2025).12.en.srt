1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,969
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,764
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:58,390
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:07,066
Don't think it's a bit much?

5
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:12,988
How many guys did you bring
just to take me out?

6
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:14,907
You should be ashamed of yourself.

7
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:21,038
So, that's all you have to say
for your last words?

8
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,294
First, I'm going to prep two cameras.

9
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:31,548
You can install them
at the location I mentioned.

10
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:32,633
Okay. And then?

11
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:35,135
Then, my phone.

12
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:38,055
We install spyware on it
as insurance.

13
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,515
You know, a zombie phone.

14
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:45,479
Then I put an app on your spare phone
so you can remotely control my phone.

15
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,108
Even if my phone is turned off

16
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:52,236
we can tweak it so that certain
functions stay active like malware.

17
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,196
Audio and video recording
will still work.

18
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,950
Everything will auto-upload
to the cloud every 30 minutes

19
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,076
so it won't be tampered with.

20
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,245
This feels dangerous.

21
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,623
What are you planning that you need
to prepare this thoroughly?

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,583
Knowing too much will get you hurt.

23
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:10,295
This guy.

24
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,475
You think this is funny?

25
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,897
It is funny. You don't think so?

26
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:31,108
Hey.

27
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,068
Let's be real.

28
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:35,445
Can you actually kill me?

29
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,698
Do you have the guts
without your boss

30
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:40,409
Moon Do-hyuk, giving the order?

31
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,704
You're just his errand boy.

32
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,748
You must be desperate
to find a way out of this.

33
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:50,169
Forget it.
Mr. Moon already signed off on it.

34
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,629
Whether you die here

35
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:55,090
or vanish without a trace

36
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,718
it won't be a problem,
you piece of shit.

37
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:00,387
Take him out.

38
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:16,987
You scared me.

39
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,698
Because she's more likely to live
a normal life

40
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,491
through you, rather than me.

41
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,619
Tell me. What do you want me to do?

42
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:26,455
- Anything for you.
- If anything happens, call me.

43
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,877
Why not? Why won't you?

44
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,045
You could be in danger--

45
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,130
No. I don't want that.

46
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,424
Why do I have to suffer?

47
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:38,550
All right.

48
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:41,220
- I understand.
- So go ahead, Ah-jin.

49
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,764
Use me all you want.

50
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,475
That's what I want.

51
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,480
MESSAGES

52
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:37,776
KIM JAE-OH

53
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:39,611
CONFIRM

54
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,283
How many guys did you bring?

55
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,161
You should be ashamed of yourself.

56
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:00,590
Check his phone.

57
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:06,722
YOON JUN-SEO

58
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,182
Have you finished the job?

59
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:10,892
As you can see, yes.

60
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:17,065
Make sure to clean it up
without a trace.

61
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,567
Do we get rid of this, too?

62
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,901
It's his phone.

63
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,486
You can give it to me.

64
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,947
I need to check it, just in case.

65
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:28,201
This psycho dragged the CEO's name
into his threats.

66
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,037
I need to see what he was holding.

67
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:58,774
Welcome home, ma'am.

68
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,303
CALLING

69
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,308
The phone you have dialed
is turned off.

70
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,937
You will be connected to voicemail
after the beep.

71
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,689
You will incur charges
once connected.

72
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:43,777
Press one to leave a message.

73
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,781
Press two to leave a callback number.

74
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:54,996
Your time to press a button
has expired.

75
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,916
Press one to leave a message.

76
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,003
Press two to leave a callback number.

77
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,429
Your time to press a button
has expired.

78
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,473
Press one to leave a message.

79
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:17,519
Press two to leave a callback number.

80
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,573
Please check the instructions
and call again.

81
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,700
Thank you for using our service.

82
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,034
Goodbye.

83
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,665
Take care of Kim Jae-oh
however you want.

84
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,960
Just make sure
I never hear about him again.

85
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:43,211
I don't want his name

86
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,632
ruining another meal with my wife.

87
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:37,557
EPISODE 12: THE FINAL X

88
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:50,820
Where's Kim Jae-oh?

89
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,159
Where is he?

90
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,495
I had no idea

91
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:01,498
what this job was for.

92
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,419
If I had known,
I never would have helped him.

93
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,338
What was it?

94
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:10,465
The cameras.

95
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,677
He asked me to install them
at the construction site.

96
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,680
He said the footage would auto-upload

97
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,683
and that I should collect the cameras
once enough time passed

98
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:21,726
and hand you

99
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,312
the memory card

100
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,816
and my spare phone.

101
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:38,410
What are you doing? Throw him.

102
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,876
Two of you stay on the lookout.
The rest go down and clean it up.

103
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,253
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:43,099
I don't see anyone.

105
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,268
Even Ms. Gong stepped out.

106
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:48,271
I asked them to give us some privacy.

107
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,775
Sit. I have something to say.

108
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:56,863
I wonder

109
00:10:57,697 --> 00:10:59,240
what you want to say to me.

110
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,874
From now on,
don't touch me without permission.

111
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,293
Don't hug me from behind
like earlier.

112
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,129
Don't even let your breath touch me.

113
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,257
Don't do anything.

114
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:19,928
That's unreasonable.

115
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,847
Aren't we husband and wife?

116
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,432
Because we're husband and wife

117
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,977
I'm telling you
not to treat me like a doll.

118
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:32,982
If I'm your wife

119
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,694
you should treat me as your equal.

120
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,446
Isn't that right?

121
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:47,163
I thought pitying you
and adoring you was enough.

122
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,875
Why should I listen to that?

123
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,336
I'm sure you received
the report by now.

124
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:59,968
I found a way to corner you.

125
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,970
People who got locked up

126
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:05,932
and disappeared on your orders.

127
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,060
Now, there's one more.

128
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,025
And I have the evidence.

129
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:21,656
Let's be real.

130
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,408
Can you actually kill me?

131
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,410
Do you have the guts
without your boss

132
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:28,371
Moon Do-hyuk, giving the order?

133
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,166
You're just his errand boy.

134
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,752
You must be desperate
to find a way out of this.

135
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:37,297
Forget it.
Mr. Moon already signed off on it.

136
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,507
Whether you die here

137
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:42,051
or vanish without a trace

138
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:45,138
it won't be a problem,
you piece of shit.

139
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,723
What are you doing?

140
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:47,807
Throw him.

141
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:54,939
You're not the only one

142
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,026
who can corner me or discard me.

143
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:01,237
With your perfect little life

144
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:04,199
a single crack will stand out.

145
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:07,118
Can you handle that?

146
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,913
Mr. Perfectionist?

147
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,671
So, this is what you wanted to say?

148
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,591
You made me sit here just for that?

149
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:29,849
When you gave the order

150
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,144
I was there.

151
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,149
The evidence is here.

152
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:39,776
And so is the witness.

153
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,989
I can't tell
if this is a negotiation or a threat.

154
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,034
Does your dear friend know

155
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:49,869
that his death

156
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,373
is being used like this?

157
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,708
He'd be proud

158
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:58,837
he was used for my sake.

159
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,091
It wasn't exploitation.

160
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,635
He let himself be used.

161
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:11,850
Just so I could have something
to shake you with

162
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:13,560
he risked everything.

163
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,771
You had everything from the beginning

164
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,148
so I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

165
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,397
What the heck did you do?

166
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:03,693
Say something.

167
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:05,528
If I tell you

168
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:08,364
can you handle it?

169
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,325
Tell me.

170
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,786
I wanted to put a leash
around Do-hyuk's neck.

171
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,456
So he couldn't mess with me again.

172
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:19,125
And Jae-oh helped me do that.

173
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,838
He walked straight in

174
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,423
knowing that he'd die.

175
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,219
That's what he wanted.

176
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,638
What are you trying to say?

177
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:34,057
You did nothing wrong,
whether Jae-oh is dead or not?

178
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,516
- That--
- What should I have done, then?

179
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,936
How long are you
going to live like that?

180
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,771
I'm sick of it, too.

181
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:40,855
Jun-seo.

182
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,358
Now that Jae-oh ended up like that

183
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,777
I can't stop anymore.

184
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:48,488
Is this all my fault?

185
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,367
Who has the right to condemn me?

186
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,244
Who can understand

187
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,456
my situation and my position
right now?

188
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:00,792
Then, answer me this one thing.

189
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,087
You can stop now.

190
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,175
This is the end, right?

191
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:16,474
Right?

192
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:18,726
Please say something.

193
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,480
Please tell me that this is the end!

194
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:25,650
I can't stop.

195
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,319
I won't stop.

196
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:33,449
If you knew how dangerously
I'm hanging on to this position

197
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,370
you wouldn't tell me to stop.

198
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:01,644
This is Yoon Jun-seo.

199
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,273
Does the documentary offer
from last time

200
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,109
still stand?

201
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,366
Hold on, sir. How can I help you?

202
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,201
- What's the matter?
- Moon Do-hyuk.

203
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:22,373
Mr. Yoon Jun-seo?

204
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,919
I didn't think
you'd come find me in person.

205
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,838
You killed Jae-oh.

206
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,134
Everything you ordered is
all recorded here.

207
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:36,262
I see.

208
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,016
And?

209
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,435
If you're planning
to do anything to Ah-jin

210
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:45,855
I'll spread this footage
to the media.

211
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,198
A lot of people are telling me
what to do today.

212
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:56,783
But tell me.

213
00:17:57,075 --> 00:18:00,620
Do you think I'll just sit still
while you post that?

214
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:04,332
I'm sure you know I can do
far more than you can.

215
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,460
A cheap video
where my name is barely mentioned

216
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,087
won't...

217
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,588
- Do we get rid of this, too?
- What's this?

218
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:11,672
It's his phone.

219
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:12,882
You can give it to me.

220
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:16,761
This psycho dragged the CEO's name
into his threats.

221
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:19,013
Anyway, once this is handled properly

222
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,015
put in a good word for me
with Mr. Moon.

223
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,976
I still feel uneasy
about that mistake last time.

224
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,561
The fire incident, right?

225
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,648
If we had killed him properly then,
we wouldn't have had to do this.

226
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,818
Perhaps releasing the video
and audio recordings I have

227
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,528
won't deal a fatal blow to you.

228
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:35,446
But you know what?

229
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:38,366
It'll leave a stain.

230
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,034
Once those stains pile up

231
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,620
the perfect reputation
you've been keeping so far

232
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:45,832
will get dirty eventually.

233
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:49,377
I can always clean up
when things get dirty.

234
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,297
But are you threatening me right now?

235
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:55,174
I'm here to warn you.

236
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:59,011
Because I can't just sit by and watch
you or Ah-jin any longer.

237
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:00,847
Now that I think about it

238
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,600
your friend also tried to warn me,
and we both know how he ended up.

239
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,064
I guess friends

240
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:12,316
share similar traits.

241
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:19,198
Leave Ah-jin alone.

242
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:23,661
I'll be the one to stop her.

243
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,832
You just take a step back
and watch from afar.

244
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,585
Just like you always have.

245
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:51,397
I've come to make a confession.

246
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,361
Sister, I know
who killed your family.

247
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,030
It's someone you know.

248
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:04,535
Actress Baek Ah-jin

249
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,663
invited to the Berlin Film Festival
with The Woman with a Suitcase

250
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:11,876
is making a strong impression
internationally.

251
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:15,213
Through her recent film
Amen to Nothing

252
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:18,132
Baek Ah-jin has captivated
critics and audiences

253
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,885
with a bold transformation
and a fully immersive performance.

254
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,889
Many say that she's at the peak
of her acting career.

255
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:26,682
Tonight at the Bluedragon Awards

256
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:30,269
she's considered the strongest
candidate for Best Actress.

257
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:32,813
Will she take home the award

258
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:37,068
at the Bluedragon Awards tonight?
All eyes are on her.

259
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:42,573
- Why are you glowing so much today?
- You look stunning.

260
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,868
It's the same face you see every day.
What's the fuss?

261
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:49,121
And it's pretty every day.
I can never get tired of your beauty.

262
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,206
I agree.

263
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,877
JUN-SEO

264
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:01,509
JUN-SEO

265
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:43,152
You can just leave that.
I can throw it out for you.

266
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:44,236
- I'll--
- No.

267
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,113
It's okay. I'll throw it out.

268
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:47,365
Oh, sure.

269
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:17,728
BAEK AH-JIN

270
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:20,856
If you ever feel like helping me,
call me then.

271
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:24,568
Otherwise, don't get in my way
for no reason.

272
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,186
It's Baek Ah-jin!

273
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:11,425
You're aware the award show is airing
on a different channel now, right?

274
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:16,222
They say the Best Actress Award is
basically guaranteed to go to her.

275
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:18,265
That actually works out better.

276
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:22,144
Because her final appearance

277
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:26,482
will stay in people's memories
as her most beautiful one.

278
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,738
DIM HEART: TWO FACES OF AN ACTRESS

279
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,242
NOTABLE TRAITS:
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

280
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:38,619
FOUND IN ABOUT 4 PERCENT
OF THE POPULATION

281
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:43,916
Baek Ah-jin.

282
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:49,755
She falls within the four percent
of the population

283
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:51,423
with antisocial personality disorder.

284
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,886
She views others as tools

285
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,556
and manipulates or uses them
to achieve her goals.

286
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:02,393
At the biggest annual event
in Korean cinema

287
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:08,774
Baek Ah-jin stands
as a top contender for Best Actress

288
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:12,278
drawing intense attention
from media and fans alike.

289
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:21,745
She has never
physically committed murder

290
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,664
but she caused
the deaths of two people.

291
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:30,170
She has deliberately approached
only men who were of use to her.

292
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,468
She still harbors
an unfulfilled plan to kill.

293
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,728
She is Baek Ah-jin, an actress.

294
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:26,685
Now, let us begin

295
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:28,854
the 46th Bluedragon Awards.

296
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,689
Let's get started.

297
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,741
Baek Ah-jin is

298
00:27:40,824 --> 00:27:42,743
the strongest candidate
for Best Actress, right?

299
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:44,912
If she wins, ratings will explode.

300
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:46,705
Don't tell her anything beforehand.

301
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:49,041
Make sure no one gets near her.
Got it?

302
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,626
...Song Kyeong-su.

303
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:52,795
DIM HEART

304
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:54,296
Baek Ah-jin.

305
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,884
The elegant and kind actress.

306
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:01,261
Baek Ah-jin?

307
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:03,597
She was the epitome of perfection.

308
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,307
She was smart, kind, and pretty.

309
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,851
She stood out wherever she was.

310
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:11,563
Everyone at our school knew her.

311
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:14,775
Even the teachers adored her.

312
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,905
But those who knew her well
tell a completely different story.

313
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,032
We met those people.

314
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:26,412
What do I think of Baek Ah-jin?

315
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:30,082
A devil wearing human skin.

316
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:31,417
She didn't have a mother.

317
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:33,919
And her father was a criminal.

318
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:36,630
She wasn't normal,
at least from what I felt.

319
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,342
It always seemed like her emotions
were rehearsed, as if she was acting.

320
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,053
Her acting has
always been exceptional.

321
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,723
She switched masks
whenever it suited her needs.

322
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:48,267
That's why I could never tell
what she was thinking.

323
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,062
I think she has
very little empathy for others.

324
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:54,356
I figured that was the case.

325
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:57,985
I even recommended
she get psychological counseling.

326
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,278
TRUE LOVE COUNSELING CENTER

327
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:01,071
Check this out.
It's about Baek Ah-jin.

328
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:03,240
Is this for real?

329
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:04,825
Isn't she terrifying?

330
00:29:04,908 --> 00:29:06,535
How can a human being do this?

331
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:10,247
Now, we'll move on to the highly
anticipated Best Actress Award.

332
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:15,377
Last year's winner, Jin Seo-gyeong,
will be joining us to present it.

333
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:17,004
Please give her a round of applause.

334
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,674
Hello, I'm Jin Seo-gyeong.

335
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:23,302
Let me announce the winner.

336
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:25,721
The Best Actress Award

337
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:28,724
at the 46th Bluedragon Awards...

338
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:31,769
goes to...

339
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:39,735
Baek Ah-jin for Amen to Nothing.

340
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:41,111
Congratulations.

341
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:52,623
Baek Ah-jin,
the winner of the Best Actress Award

342
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:54,291
portrayed a nun in Amen to Nothing

343
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:57,002
who investigates the tragedy
that befell her family

344
00:29:57,085 --> 00:29:59,379
and carries out revenge

345
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:01,089
delivering a deeply moving

346
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:03,300
and introspective performance
about a character

347
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,177
in anguish over religious doubts.

348
00:30:05,677 --> 00:30:07,387
Congratulations
from the bottom of our hearts.

349
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:25,322
Thank you.

350
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,409
First of all

351
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:31,495
my mom

352
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:34,122
in heaven.

353
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,917
How do I look, Mom?

354
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,380
Are you proud of me?

355
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,423
Her mother died in an accident.

356
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:47,553
Her father was
the victim of a murder case.

357
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:50,889
She was also present
at her lover's grandmother's death

358
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:53,392
and later, her lover took
his own life.

359
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:56,436
For one person
to experience all of this

360
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,981
the coincidences seem too extreme.

361
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,899
- A documentary about Ah-jin is out.
- What?

362
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:02,109
That's a scoop.

363
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:03,819
Start preparing for revisions.

364
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:06,446
- Check if any articles are out.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,618
While working on Amen to Nothing

366
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,872
I couldn't help but wonder...

367
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:19,042
"Where is my God?"

368
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:22,504
Looking back

369
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:25,257
I realized

370
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:28,135
He was inside me all along.

371
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,263
I grew up

372
00:31:32,347 --> 00:31:34,141
in an unfortunate environment.

373
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:40,188
But luck always followed me.

374
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,857
I thought we were incredibly lucky.

375
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,109
I caught myself wondering
if she was an angel

376
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:45,819
who had come down for my brother.

377
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:49,156
But I overheard something
at my grandma's funeral.

378
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:51,033
Was it someone in the film industry?

379
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:53,076
Apparently, she was smiling
in front of him.

380
00:31:56,747 --> 00:32:02,002
Every step I took to get here

381
00:32:02,794 --> 00:32:04,379
wasn't easy.

382
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,424
But I never stopped.

383
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,509
I kept moving forward

384
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:12,888
and eventually, I got here.

385
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:17,684
Her acting has
always been exceptional.

386
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:20,479
She switched masks
whenever it suited her needs.

387
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:24,149
To everyone who walked with me

388
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:27,361
on my journey to today

389
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:31,949
I offer my sincere gratitude.

390
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,409
She used the people around her

391
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,912
to make me look
like an idiot and a thief.

392
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:41,458
Could she have used our boss
to try to kill her own father?

393
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:44,127
We were like family
when she was dating my brother.

394
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,713
I thought she'd at least
show up once at the funeral.

395
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:50,258
I was stunned.

396
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:53,845
Soon after, news came out
that she was marrying a chaebol.

397
00:32:58,141 --> 00:32:59,518
I was like, "What?"

398
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:07,317
These testimonies about Baek Ah-jin

399
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:09,611
are not easy to verify.

400
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:13,740
So, we wondered
whether continuing this investigation

401
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:15,367
was the right thing to do.

402
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:17,869
Then, we learned something new.

403
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:19,955
Rumors surrounding

404
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:24,209
the suspicious death of her father,
Baek Seon-gyu.

405
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:29,715
Dim Heart began to track down
the truth of that day.

406
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:35,679
There were three primary suspects
in this case.

407
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:39,307
Former baseball player, Mr. Choi.

408
00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:43,770
And the person who was
consistently abused by the victim

409
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:46,815
and thus had the clearest motive,
the victim's daughter

410
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,233
actress Baek Ah-jin

411
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:50,152
BAEK AH-JIN
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

412
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:51,403
I remember that case.

413
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:53,530
It was very unusual.

414
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,492
There was only one victim
but multiple potential perpetrators.

415
00:33:57,576 --> 00:34:00,454
Among them, the one
with the clearest motive was

416
00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:02,497
the victim's daughter, Baek Ah-jin.

417
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:10,505
Lastly

418
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,550
to everyone

419
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:15,969
who loved my performance

420
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:19,306
and showed enthusiasm for my work

421
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:22,059
and to those who supported me
not only as an actress

422
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,102
but as a person.

423
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,438
I give this glory to you.

424
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,694
I sincerely thank you.

425
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:26,456
The final suspect provided
our team with a decisive tip.

426
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:29,626
It was Yoon Seok-ha,
the author of Co-Offender Y.

427
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,383
The incident back then

428
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:39,177
was planned from the beginning.

429
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,848
It's true that Ah-jin
deliberately sought out

430
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,683
someone kind enough to act for her.

431
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,270
It's also true that
she found Choi Jung-ho and used him.

432
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:52,357
It would have been easy for her
to win someone over

433
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:54,234
and set a trap.

434
00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:56,486
Back then

435
00:35:57,195 --> 00:35:59,364
she even had a stalker decoy to use.

436
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:04,369
When the said stalker hit her,
she immediately called Mr. Choi

437
00:36:04,452 --> 00:36:06,538
so he rushed over.

438
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:08,832
But it wasn't a stalker.

439
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:16,756
The person Choi struck
with the bat was...

440
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,050
Seeing you alive
wasn't part of my plan.

441
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:21,553
...the man disguised
to look like her stalker.

442
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:24,472
It was her father

443
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:26,433
Baek Seon-gyu.

444
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:43,825
When I arrived, Choi was already gone

445
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:46,161
and Baek Seon-gyu
was lying on the floor.

446
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:47,829
There was blood everywhere

447
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:49,956
so I assumed he was dead.

448
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,711
Then, I saw Ah-jin.

449
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:01,760
She was sitting
against the bathroom wall

450
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:04,512
holding the bat.

451
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:18,026
She looked at me and said

452
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:20,654
"It's over."

453
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:27,160
That's what she said.

454
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:29,704
"It's all over."

455
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,193
Other people's suffering
meant nothing to her.

456
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:04,364
She only ever used people
to achieve her own goals

457
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:06,700
and discarded them.

458
00:38:10,203 --> 00:38:11,371
That's how she built...

459
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,209
her current position.

460
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:41,252
Do you want to go somewhere?

461
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:45,256
Anywhere

462
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:47,258
without people.

463
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:16,579
I thought you'd change
if I waited long enough.

464
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:19,707
But you didn't.

465
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:23,211
I realized that far too late.

466
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:25,880
That I couldn't save you

467
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:29,342
and that I was clinging
to something impossible.

468
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,763
That you could never change.

469
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:35,974
Exactly.

470
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:39,894
And you realized
that simple thing too late.

471
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:43,064
So what? Do you regret it now?

472
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,320
No.

473
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:55,243
Because now,
I'm the only one who can handle you.

474
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:01,624
Handle me how?

475
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,336
I have nowhere to go anymore.

476
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,631
If you truly have nowhere to go

477
00:41:09,424 --> 00:41:11,426
how about we go to hell together

478
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:12,802
Ah-jin?

479
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:19,642
Are you being serious?

480
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:26,274
I already decided
to stay with you to the end.

481
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:29,652
If you stop now

482
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:31,279
I'll stop, too.

483
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:34,657
What will you do?

484
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:54,260
I thought there was nothing left
that could tie me down.

485
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,311
But it was you.

486
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:07,440
My final shackle.

487
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,507
Let's not do anything anymore.

488
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,307
So that no one gets hurt

489
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:44,769
we'll only look at each other.

490
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:54,779
I love you...

491
00:42:58,116 --> 00:42:59,284
Ah-jin.

492
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:43,745
Last night, the car driven
by author Yoon Seok-ha

493
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:46,998
crashed into a guardrail
and fell off a cliff.

494
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:51,044
The driver, Yoon Seok-ha,
died at the scene

495
00:43:51,502 --> 00:43:53,546
and actress Baek Ah-jin,
believed to be the passenger

496
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,756
is currently missing.

497
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:58,134
The police are investigating
the exact cause of the accident.

498
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:00,053
WRITER YOON SEOK-HA DEAD,
ACTRESS BAEK AH-JIN MISSING

499
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:06,768
At some point

500
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:13,232
your presence started feeling
like a blade stuck in my heart.

501
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:20,156
Even in death, I wouldn't be able
to understand or forgive you.

502
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:26,704
So, in this life, I wanted to cleanly
sever anything tied to you and leave.

503
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,626
And I wanted to disappear

504
00:44:32,543 --> 00:44:33,795
from your life, too.

505
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:36,714
That's the best choice.

506
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:43,221
I gave you
one last brief moment of happiness

507
00:44:44,722 --> 00:44:45,723
so you can live

508
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,643
the rest of your life
with that in mind.

509
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,690
Maybe this is
the first and last long revenge

510
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:57,902
I'll ever give you, Mom.

511
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,072
No, Jun-seo.

512
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:04,450
Jun-seo.

513
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:07,787
I hope you stay healthy.

514
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,122
Jun-seo!

515
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:15,169
Jun-seo!

516
00:45:56,878 --> 00:45:58,588
You can't find her anywhere?

517
00:46:01,382 --> 00:46:04,218
No signs of life or trace anywhere?

518
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:07,513
Fine, never mind.

519
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:09,098
You don't have to go that far.

520
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:10,433
ACTRESS BAEK AH-JIN STILL MISSING

521
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,018
Just leave the broadcast

522
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:14,395
and respond
when they ask for cooperation.

523
00:46:16,689 --> 00:46:19,942
We want to share
a follow-up to our previous broadcast

524
00:46:20,026 --> 00:46:22,361
"Two Faces of an Actress."

525
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:24,947
We recently learned that Yoon Jun-seo

526
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:26,866
our informant
and the author of Co-Offender Y

527
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:29,827
passed away not long ago.

528
00:46:30,995 --> 00:46:33,623
Please pay attention to this video.

529
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,794
It was submitted anonymously.

530
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:40,755
This footage proves

531
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:43,841
that she was in the vehicle

532
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:45,426
that Yoon Jun-seo was driving.

533
00:46:57,563 --> 00:47:00,107
After this video,
she vanished completely

534
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:02,902
and has not been reachable since.

535
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:35,643
THE LATE BAEK AH-JIN

536
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:02,772
Do something about this!
