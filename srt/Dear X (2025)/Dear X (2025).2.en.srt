00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,969
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,805
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:01,435
Mom.

5
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:02,895
I'm here to see you.

6
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,772
THE LATE LIM SUN YE

7
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:05,856
How is it up there?

8
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:07,608
Is it any better?

9
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,279
I'm doing just fine.

10
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:17,493
This girl in my class
has been acting up.

11
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:19,703
She got on my nerves.

12
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:21,455
But it's fine.

13
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,043
I have something for you.

14
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:27,336
Want to know what it is?

15
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,382
Was it at the start of the semester?

16
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,677
I had to turn in
an assignment for art class.

17
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,931
I got the deadline wrong

18
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:41,058
and had to turn it in incomplete.

19
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:44,269
I went to my art teacher and said...

20
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,063
"Sir.

21
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:51,443
I was abused as a child.

22
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:53,904
I think my wrist is still weak.

23
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:58,075
I can't seem to finish my artwork.

24
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,411
I can't draw properly.

25
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:05,666
What should I do?"

26
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:09,378
I mistakenly thought

27
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:13,215
he'd give me a good grade
if I said that.

28
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,969
I'm not sure
if he really took pity on me

29
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:19,680
or if he saw through my lies.

30
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,723
He kept telling me
to see a psycholo--

31
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:22,808
Did you eat?

32
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:24,977
Hey.

33
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:28,188
About what I said last time.

34
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,731
There's no pressure at all.

35
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,817
Just vent and release what's inside.

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,193
TRUE LOVE COUNSELING CENTER

37
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,278
Give them a call.

38
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,074
He's an interesting guy.

39
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:46,957
I'll leave this here.

40
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:48,750
It's a gift.

41
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,920
Get some counseling over in hell

42
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:54,840
and be born again.

43
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:56,967
Who knows?

44
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,510
In your next life

45
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,388
your daughter might save you.

46
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:04,766
I won't ever live like you.

47
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,521
I won't die like you, either.

48
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,442
Watch from where you are

49
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,403
just how far I climb.

50
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:22,868
Then you'll feel less wronged
about how you died

51
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:26,997
and your death will carry more value.

52
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,719
JUNE 2007

53
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:48,018
GENERAL STORE

54
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:49,102
Ah Jin.

55
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:52,940
Get me two bottles.

56
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:54,691
Go on.

57
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:17,047
You're the little thief
who's been stealing from me, right?

58
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:19,091
Where's your mom?

59
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,926
Goddamn it.

60
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,018
Honey.

61
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,650
Are you taking me to an orphanage?

62
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,779
We'll live here from now on.

63
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,407
If you listen to your stepmom
and don't get in trouble

64
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,743
I'll let you stay here
until you grow up.

65
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,036
Will you really?

66
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:54,603
Hello.

67
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:06,448
Jun Seo.

68
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,202
Say hello.

69
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:12,329
He's your stepdad who just moved in.

70
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:13,789
Hi.

71
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:32,808
Hi.

72
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,476
I'm Baek Ah Jin.

73
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,479
Hi, I'm Yoon Jun Seo.

74
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,773
All the assets that Jun Seo will get.

75
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:42,317
I told the darned old man
I'd manage it all

76
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,320
but the old fool won't listen.

77
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,864
There are more mouths to feed.

78
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:51,368
I won't make much
from selling this place.

79
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,453
Do you have any ideas?

80
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,342
Just you wait.

81
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:10,595
We can make a fortune with the girl.

82
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:12,764
She's worth quite a bit.

83
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:15,809
Sell a few videos of her

84
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,229
and we can move to a penthouse
overlooking the Hangang River.

85
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,982
That video you speak of.

86
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,777
We'll take a few
then ship her off to an orphanage.

87
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:27,487
You bet.

88
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:32,492
You'll be better off
if you don't upset her.

89
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,372
She has her dead mom's dirty temper.

90
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,625
She'll just gnaw you to bits.

91
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,629
I'm not some meat on the bone.
Why would she gnaw me?

92

EPISODE 2:
THE MOMENT A HUMAN BECOMES A DEVIL

93
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:11,698
Keep the rest.

94
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,536
Oh, I haven't been here in a while.

95
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,372
SINGWANG HIGH SCHOOL

96
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,627
I said no.

97
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,087
If people find out
you slept with my English teacher

98
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,548
I'll be too embarrassed
to stay in school!

99
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:31,259
Whatever.

100
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,386
I'm dropping out, and that's that.

101
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:35,889
Hello?

102
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,266
I'm looking for my daughter's school.

103
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,644
It must be somewhere here

104
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:42,479
but I can't tell
because I don't know where she lives.

105
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:45,357
I was thinking
of squeezing her for money.

106
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,361
You remember my Ah Jin, right?

107
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,155
- Baek Ah Jin?
- She has one pretty face.

108
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:54,491
She takes after me, Baek Seon Gyu.

109
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:55,867
It's in her blood.

110
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:57,786
Excuse me.

111
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:04,084
Did you just say
your daughter's Baek Ah Jin?

112
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,627
I'll call you later.

113
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,338
Do you know Ah Jin?

114
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,756
I'm her dad.

115
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,717
Is she better off being an orphan?

116
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,845
Why is she an orphan?

117
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:17,180
It's Sim Sung Hee's notebook.

118
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:18,557
SIM SUNG HEE

119
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,894
She noted everyone's grades,
parents' jobs, and living standards.

120
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:25,981
Everyone's graded
between A-plus and D.

121
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:29,526
Anyone below B,
she scratched out in red.

122
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:37,576
It's insane.
The kids would kill her if they knew.

123
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,785
BAEK AH JIN, C-MINUS
YOON JUN SEO, A-PLUS

124
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,706
Hey, what's an "Un..."

125
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:43,999
KIM JAE OH, D
AN UNTOUCHABLE

126
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:45,083
"Untouchable?"

127
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:46,710
What does that mean?

128
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:48,712
It sounds nasty.

129
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:57,095
Hello?

130
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,055
Ah Jin, your dad's here.

131
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:01,600
- Who's here?
- Your dad.

132
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:03,268
- He's here looking for you.
- Ah Jin!

133
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:04,686
At the first floor
central staircase--

134
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,063
Where are you off to?

135
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:08,940
Baek Ah Jin!

136
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,075
Where are you, Jae Oh? I'm scared.

137
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,578
Dad keeps calling me Satan.

138
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:22,662
Come home soon.

139
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,833
Ah Jin!

140
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:29,252
Baek Ah Jin!

141
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:31,171
Dad's here!

142
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,007
Baek Ah Jin!

143
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:36,051
Guys, did you see Baek Ah Jin?

144
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:41,431
Her father is looking for her.

145
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,683
Well? You haven't seen her?

146
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:45,435
Didn't she say she was an orphan?

147
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:47,520
He's so weird. What's up with him?

148
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:48,605
Dad.

149
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,233
Who is this weirdo?

150
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,943
Dad, come with me.

151
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:59,324
Hey, Jun Seo.

152
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:03,411
You go to this school, too?
You're all grown up.

153
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,372
Where's Ah Jin?

154
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:06,956
Let's head out, Dad.

155
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:09,793
- Where's Ah Jin, you punk?
- I'll give you cash.

156
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:14,214
I'll give you money.

157
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,261
Mister!

158
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,931
You're not Jun Seo's dad.

159
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:27,602
Anyone who lived with me
under the same roof is my son.

160
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:32,065
- How have you been?
- Mister!

161
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:33,274
Mister!

162
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:35,735
She's psycho.

163
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,327
- What was that about?
- Darn it.

164
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:46,329
What's this?

165
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,874
- What is this?
- It looks funny.

166
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,334
It has your name.

167
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,461
What kind of bitch would...

168
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:17,902
SEO MI RI
CEO OF LONGSTAR ENTERTAINMENT

169
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,176
You didn't have to.

170
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,096
The condition is
that you never appear

171
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,098
near our school
or in front of Ah Jin.

172
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:51,227
Don't call even if you're dying
of a terminal illness.

173
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:52,771
She's my daughter.

174
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:55,565
A dad wants to see his daughter.
What's wrong with that?

175
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:59,402
When a dad's in a bind,
he can ask his daughter for help.

176
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,863
You arrogant bastard.

177
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:05,950
We can't sever our ties
just because you say so.

178
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,086
I thought you'd say that,
so I only got you half.

179
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,507
If you stay away from Ah Jin
until she graduates

180
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,925
I'll give you the other half.

181
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:23,676
She takes after me.

182
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:25,386
She has a pretty face.

183
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,223
I can get at least two large
if I sell her off to a bar.

184
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,976
I hope you keep your word.

185
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:37,816
Why would you go
to such lengths for her?

186
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,609
You're complete strangers.

187
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:43,696
You might not be related,
but you were step-siblings once.

188
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,741
It's so nice to see you
look out for each other.

189
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,868
You're pretty loyal, unlike your mom.

190
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,329
Is that all you have to say?

191
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:54,374
Don't you feel bad for Ah Jin at all?

192
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,251
What are you on about?

193
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,470
See you around, girlie.

194
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,623
Are you Baek Ah Jin?

195
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,335
Who are you?

196
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm Seo Mi Ri
from Longstar Entertainment.

197
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:50,305
Would you like to be a celebrity?

198
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,851
SEO MI RI

199
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,227
You've heard of us, right?

200
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,647
I'd love to make you an actress.

201
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:01,983
No, thanks.

202
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,068
Sorry.

203
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:08,197
Wait.

204
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,827
Are you in talks with another agency?

205
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,708
I'd like to know
why you said no outright.

206
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,293
I won't do anything like that.

207
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:34,432
Where are you, Jae Oh?

208
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,351
Hurry up!

209
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:46,736
Dad...

210
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:48,571
Dad...

211
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:49,989
Dad!

212
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:51,699
Satan.

213
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,620
You're scheming
so you can possess my son.

214
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,705
You evil devil.

215
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,624
- Get out of--
- Stop!

216
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,338
Are you crazy?
How can do this to a kid?

217
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:08,383
Dad, take it out on me instead.

218
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,842
Get the fuck off me.

219
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,515
Please stop!

220
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,978
You fool.

221
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,980
Dad, please listen to me!

222
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,690
- Dad!
-Leave me alone!

223
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,991
Jae Oh.

224
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:40,415
Dad...

225
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,109
Jae Oh.

226
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:31,299
Ah Jin.

227
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:35,386
Are you all right?

228
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,141
There's no need
to let the past get to you.

229
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,435
He'll stay away for a while.

230
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:45,146
He will. For a while.

231
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:47,482
Don't worry too much.

232
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,360
I'll do it all.

233
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,114
I won't ever allow
another situation...

234
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:58,868
in which I can't do anything.

235
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:00,912
Don't worry about your dad.

236
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,457
He'll do anything for money,
so he was easy to handle.

237
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:13,091
About Sim Sung Hee.

238
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:16,219
How did she manage
to bring your dad to our school?

239
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:18,721
Now he knows where to find you.

240
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,014
I took care of her.

241
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,363
What are you doing?

242
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,240
I'll give you money.

243
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:42,870
Do you think
we're after your fucking money?

244
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,413
What is this?

245
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,040
You're still all up
in other people's business.

246
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,334
We beat you up in middle school,
but that wasn't enough?

247
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:51,170
Why am I an untouchable?

248
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,840
Why ask? It means you're dirt poor.

249
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:54,924
You bitch.

250
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,135
This won't do.
I'll beat you to death.

251
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,720
You might actually get sentenced
for assault.

252
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,973
- What are you saying?
- You're over 14!

253
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:04,016
Shut your mouth, bitch.

254
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,644
I'll just kill you then kill myself.

255
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:07,812
How about that?

256
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:11,607
My family is dirt poor,
and I have no damn future anyway.

257
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:14,110
- Let's all go to prison together.
- To prison!

258
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:22,910
Yes, Auntie.

259
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:24,370
Kim Jae Oh.

260
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:27,915
You can't send your brother over
at this time of night.

261
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,459
The taxi fare came out to 60,000 won.

262
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,504
Do you know how surprised we were?

263
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,883
And why is he such a mess?

264
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,177
- I was so--
- Take him to a hospital.

265
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:43,014
He needs a guardian.

266
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:46,184
I can't be there for him.

267
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:47,643
What's wrong?

268
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,395
What's going on?

269
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:53,983
Auntie.

270
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:57,653
Jae Hun...

271
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:02,867
Look after him for me.

272
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,329
He was badly beaten

273
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,041
and he saw something
he shouldn't have.

274
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:12,627
He'll be in shock.

275
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,463
- Gosh, did your dad do something?
- I'm sorry, Auntie.

276
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,840
Don't forgive me.

277
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,095
I promise to pay...

278
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,599
for what I did.

279
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,644
Jae Oh, what on earth--

280
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:50,873
What's up?

281
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:52,833
You picked up.

282
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,670
I tried calling one last time.

283
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,923
What do you mean, "last time"?

284
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:00,549
I killed that punk.

285
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:02,802
What?

286
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,681
I stabbed him.

287
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,891
He's dead.

288
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:12,770
What you just said.

289
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:14,397
Is it true?

290
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:15,773
Was there a witness?

291
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,485
I'm in front of the police station.

292
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,821
I'm going to turn myself in.

293
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:24,490
I don't regret it, though.

294
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:26,784
Pretend to regret it.

295
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,620
So people will pity you.

296
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,084
Why?

297
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,045
Does the future law student think

298
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:40,715
I'll rot in prison for a long time?

299
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:42,842
Kim Jae Oh.

300
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:50,641
Even if you go to prison

301
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:54,979
you'll still be free since you've cut
the chain that was tying you down.

302
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:57,523
What's important
is what happens next.

303
00:21:58,691 --> 00:22:00,651
You were a victim
before you were an assailant.

304
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:02,778
Appeal with that.

305
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,324
Cry, wail, and tremble,
and pretend to be remorseful.

306
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,076
Do you get that?

307
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,456
Baek Ah Jin.

308
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,044
You're so weird.

309
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:23,049
Thanks, though.

310
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,219
I don't know
if that was meant to be comforting

311
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:29,930
but thanks.

312
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,267
For talking in my favor
instead of criticizing me

313
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:35,227
for killing someone.

314
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,647
You're wrong, though.

315
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,781
I am trash.

316
00:22:50,534 --> 00:22:52,119
I should hang up now.

317
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:54,747
Take care.

318
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,292
You were

319
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:01,545
the only person
who said I was useful.

320
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:05,216
Thanks for that.

321
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,511
Look after yourself...

322
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:10,763
Baek Ah Jin.

323
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:37,415
Sim Sung Hee did all she could
to drag down Ah Jin.

324
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,127
She transferred schools
in a hurry as if to flee.

325
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:47,049
As no one ever got on
Ah Jin's nerves again...

326
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:50,636
we got to enjoy

327
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:55,015
the ordinary kind of life
every other teenager did.

328
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:07,820
We lived in peace
as if God smiled upon us

329
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,823
and a few more seasons passed.

330
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,080
Ah Jin...

331
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:19,248
2018 ADMISSION RESULTS

332
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:21,834
...got into Hankook University's
Department of Law.

333
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:23,794
BAEK AH JIN, SINGWANG HIGH,
DEPARTMENT OF LAW

334
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:25,379
CONGRATULATIONS

335
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:27,506
You're in! Yes!

336
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,550
How did you get
into Hankook University?

337
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,469
DECEMBER 2017, ADMITTED
TO HANKOOK UNIVERSITY'S DEPT OF LAW

338
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:34,513
Also...

339
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:35,598
NOJEONG-DONG PATRICIDE

340
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:39,143
...the Nojeong-dong patricide
that everyone talked about

341
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:41,020
was soon forgotten.

342
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:42,104
DEFENDANT

343
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:44,690
We'll consider the jury's decision...

344
00:24:44,773 --> 00:24:46,275
Will you really study law?

345
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:51,280
Once we graduate

346
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,116
I'll never see you again.

347
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,535
Why? Do you want to see me?

348
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,793
Then quit stealing stuff
and get your life back on track.

349
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:08,339
If and when you become
more useful than you are now

350
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:10,007
I might have a use for you.

351
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:12,176
Then we could meet again.

352
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:16,639
What Baek Ah Jin said to me that day.

353
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,225
Why does it come to mind today?

354
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:22,645
The defendant's parents
should've protected him, but...

355
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:23,812
Jae Oh.

356
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:25,814
You're not useless.

357
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:27,900
At least, not to me.

358
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:32,321
Will I even get another chance?

359
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:37,785
We also accept the fact
that it was an accidental death

360
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:39,203
caused during a struggle

361
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:43,332
in which the defendant protected
his brother who was being abused.

362
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:47,211
I sentence you
to three to five years in prison.

363
00:25:47,294 --> 00:25:53,801
NOJEONG-DONG PATRICIDE
SENTENCED TO 3 TO 5 YEARS

364
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:56,595
I won this time.

365
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:57,680
All in.

366
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:14,530
Fuck this!

367
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,045
Welcome.

368
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:34,008
A pack of cigarettes.

369
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:38,345
Students can print their tuition bill
at their university's website...

370
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,805
4,500 won, please.

371
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:46,895
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ACCEPTANCE

372
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:58,657
Baek Ah Jin, Yoon Jun Seo.

373
00:26:58,741 --> 00:26:59,825
YOON JUN SEO, ANAM UNIVERSITY

374
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:07,791
You want a loan?

375
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:14,882
She's a friend of mine.

376
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:17,968
She doesn't have enough
for her tuition.

377
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:20,220
I'm in no position to help her.

378
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:24,183
So what? You know your grandpa's rich

379
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,976
and you want to be benevolent?

380
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:28,395
No, lend it to me.

381
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:30,230
Since I have no collateral

382
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:33,359
if you agree to give me a loan,
I'll pay you back every cent

383
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:36,862
at a higher interest rate
than what you charge your clients.

384
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:39,948
You’re using our blood ties
as collateral

385
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:41,283
but offering a higher interest
in return?

386
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:44,787
It'll be pretty steep, then.

387
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,288
Do you have a way to pay me back?

388
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,624
Yes, I'll find students to tutor

389
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:50,501
and I'm looking for a part-time job.

390
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:54,505
You'll have no time left to study.

391
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:59,009
You know I travel to Japan
every two months for treatment.

392
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:00,678
If you tag along

393
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:04,139
for three days and two nights
as my secretary and guardian

394
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:07,476
I can waive the interest. How's that?

395
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:12,064
Okay, as a debtor,
I'll pay you back with interest

396
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:14,733
and as a grandson,
I'll be your guardian.

397
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:17,611
I offered a deal,
and you're making a donation.

398
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,864
You're such a softie.

399
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:24,993
We leave tomorrow. Get packing.

400
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,455
Okay. Thank you, Grandfather.

401
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:43,345
I smell money on you.
You look nicer, too.

402
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:45,389
How did you find me?

403
00:28:49,143 --> 00:28:50,519
I'm Baek Seon Gyu.

404
00:28:53,772 --> 00:28:54,773
Is Jun Seo well?

405
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:57,735
What do you want?

406
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:00,654
Be nice.

407
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:06,201
Where does Ah Jin live?

408
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:08,871
Why ask me about your daughter?

409
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:12,207
That's why I asked
about your son first.

410
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,002
You know where she lives, don't you?

411
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:16,670
I don't.

412
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:19,715
I kept her for a few years
after you went to prison.

413
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:22,009
She left of her own accord.

414
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:25,053
You left the young girl
on the street?

415
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:28,307
I have no obligation
to look after your kid.

416
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:32,728
Jun Seo must know where she lives.

417
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,481
They used to be step-siblings.

418
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:37,608
Leave Jun Seo alone.

419
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,947
He got into Anam University.

420
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:02,466
MS BANK, BAEK AH JIN
1,577,900 WON

421
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:18,357
Did I make you wait?

422
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:23,278
- Two gukbap, please.
- Okay.

423
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:25,948
Congratulations, Ah Jin.

424
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:27,658
You got a scholarship.

425
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:29,493
What are you on about?

426
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:32,913
I applied for a scholarship for you,
and you got it just like that.

427
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,001
Ta-da.

428
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:41,713
My grandfather decided

429
00:30:41,797 --> 00:30:44,424
to start giving scholarships
to students this year.

430
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:46,802
I raised my hand right away.

431
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:49,388
Baek Ah Jin,
you're the first recipient.

432
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:51,557
Isn't it a huge honor?

433
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,397
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

434
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,776
Did you ask your grandfather?

435
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,863
What did you agree to do in return?

436
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:06,947
Be a good grandson.

437
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:10,158
He regularly goes to Japan
for treatment.

438
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:12,160
He asked me to tag along this time.

439
00:31:12,452 --> 00:31:15,789
I decided to be
the best grandson I can be.

440
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,292
Jun Seo.

441
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:21,086
Don't you think this is still...

442
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:24,506
I know what you're thinking,
but your enrollment comes first.

443
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:27,885
Let's think about the rest
when you achieve your dream.

444
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:29,887
Wait until after that. Okay?

445
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:36,727
Let's eat. This looks amazing.

446
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,511
Peekaboo.

447
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:13,096
Dad's here.

448
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:15,891
Get lost before I call the cops.

449
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:21,813
It's not a crime for a dad
to visit his daughter.

450
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:26,234
You want to study law
when you lack common knowledge?

451
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:27,486
Give up.

452
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:31,156
I need money.

453
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,910
I don't have any.

454
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:36,954
Where's the money you made
working day and night?

455
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:39,539
You must have enough for tuition.

456
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,208
It's not at home.

457
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:44,419
Is it in there?

458
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:47,381
It must be in here.

459
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:48,757
Hand it over.

460
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,841
Get away.

461
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:53,345
This bitch.

462
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:02,437
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

463
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:06,149
You're insane.

464
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:08,151
Damn it.

465
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:13,991
It's not safe to carry cash around.

466
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:17,327
Why, you...

467
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:25,419
You're crazy.

468
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:27,713
You're out of your mind.

469
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:30,132
You're insane. Totally mad.

470
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:58,618
Ah Jin.

471
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:02,205
Ah Jin?

472
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:09,546
Ah Jin.

473
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,680
What is it?

474
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,390
Is something wrong?

475
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:23,351
I'm sick.

476
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,521
I think I caught a cold.

477
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:30,192
Tell your mom, then.

478
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:32,569
I told her.

479
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:34,738
But she told me to sleep.

480
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:37,449
Go and lie in bed.

481
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:39,618
I'll find you some medicine.

482
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,551
I couldn't find the medicine.

483
00:34:57,594 --> 00:35:00,138
But I'll stay with you
until you fall asleep.

484
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:03,600
Thank you, Ah Jin.

485
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:06,561
- Jun Seo.
- Yeah?

486
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:10,232
You don't look like your mom at all.

487
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:11,316
You're wrong.

488
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:13,693
Hang on.

489
00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:27,124
Take a look. Don't we look alike?

490
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,376
Who's this man here?

491
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:31,878
That's Mr. Kang the chauffeur.

492
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:35,924
He used to drive my dad around.

493
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:39,719
He moved to another country
after Dad died.

494
00:35:40,512 --> 00:35:43,849
I cried so much because he left
without saying goodbye.

495
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:53,400
Ah Jin.

496
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:56,611
I have to take Jun Seo
to see a doctor.

497
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:59,239
Will you take this to his mom
when she wakes up?

498
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:00,907
- Okay.
- Thank you.

499
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:02,659
Let's go.

500
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:21,720
Jun Seo just left to see a doctor.

501
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,683
I'm saying
it's just you and me at home.

502
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,352
What do you want?

503
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:31,855
I didn't say you could come in.

504
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:37,903
Last night, Jun Seo showed me
a photo of his dad.

505
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:42,616
He must've missed him
because he didn't feel well.

506
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:46,203
But Ms. Hwang.

507
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:48,580
Jun Seo's real dad.

508
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,708
Why did he move abroad
without saying goodbye?

509
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:03,261
What did you just say?

510
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:05,847
Jun Seo's real dad did what?

511
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:07,974
Said who?

512
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,186
Did Jun Seo say so?

513
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:17,025
It's funny to see you
get serious so suddenly.

514
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:19,653
I was just joking.

515
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:22,989
Jun Seo's real dad
didn't move abroad.

516
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,867
Mr. Kang the chauffeur did.

517
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:28,995
Ms. Hwang.

518
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:32,290
I just figured out your secret.

519
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,168
Jun Seo doesn't know yet.

520
00:37:35,877 --> 00:37:39,381
But what would happen
if he were to find out?

521
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:41,925
Forget about that.

522
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:44,302
What if his grandfather were to know?

523
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:51,268
Are you blackmailing me?

524
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:55,563
How dare a kid do that to an adult?

525
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:00,026
That's why

526
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:05,740
you should never dream
of sending me to an orphanage.

527
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:09,536
By the way.

528
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:11,830
I need some clothes.

529
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:15,709
This is all I brought
when I moved in.

530
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,044
Thanks in advance.

531
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:27,012
How does this look?

532
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,682
- Do I look nice?
- Yeah.

533
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,309
It's pretty.

534
00:38:36,354 --> 00:38:37,355
What about this?

535
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:39,774
It's pretty.

536
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,987
What's wrong?

537
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,071
Are you sulking?

538
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,950
I want to go outside, too.

539
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,829
Mom won't let me leave home.

540
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:54,706
Jun Seo.

541
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,003
Do you think your mom loves you?

542
00:39:01,129 --> 00:39:02,964
She doesn't let you go outside

543
00:39:04,424 --> 00:39:07,802
and she won't even let you
say hi to the neighbors.

544
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,472
Why do you think that is?

545
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:13,892
Your mom.

546
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:17,354
She's ashamed of you.

547
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,940
Because she doesn't love you.

548
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:24,694
Her one and only son told her
he didn't feel well

549
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,489
but she didn't care at all.

550
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:30,617
I'm the one who looks after you.

551
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:34,329
Ah Jin.

552
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:36,873
Does my mom

553
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,834
not love me?

554
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:41,836
No.

555
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:45,507
She doesn't love you.

556
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:48,218
So, she doesn't even get angry.

557
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,680
Your mom isn't on your side.

558
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,018
I bet she's thinking of ways
to get rid of us.

559
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:05,068
Baek Ah Jin, your daughter,
is absolutely psycho.

560
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:07,737
The kid manipulates me to no end.

561
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:11,449
Why cause trouble by aggravating her?

562
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,368
I told you to bear with it.

563
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:15,245
Forget it.

564
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,706
I can't live with her anymore.

565
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,917
Take her with you
or leave her at an orphanage.

566
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,628
We'll never be legally married
until then.

567
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:25,505
I'm on my way right now.

568
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:28,133
I'll text you
to bring the kid outside.

569
00:40:28,216 --> 00:40:29,509
Make sure she doesn't notice.

570
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,151
What now?

571
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:47,819
Are you spying on me again?

572
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,946
I told you last time

573
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,658
that I'd tell Jun Seo everything
if you split us up.

574
00:40:55,243 --> 00:40:56,744
You're blackmailing me again.

575
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:59,122
This is the last day
I put up with this.

576
00:40:59,205 --> 00:41:03,585
He doesn't know how things are
because you keep him indoors

577
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,255
but I bet he has a gut feeling.

578
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:09,716
That his mom is a piece of trash.

579
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:15,013
- Stay still!
- Jun Seo!

580
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:16,306
Jun Seo!

581
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:09,400
Die.

582
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:11,778
Die.

583
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:13,821
Die.

584
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,156
Just die!

585
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:18,826
Die already.

586
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,328
Die!

587
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:36,177
Jun Seo...

588
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:39,055
Jun Seo.

589
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,558
Do you like your mom?

590
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:45,311
Do you think your mom loves you?

591
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:06,082
Call 911 and say
a kid fell from the second floor.

592
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:07,875
Do it right now!

593
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:40,992
What are you doing?

594
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:42,744
Ms. Hwang.

595
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:44,370
Guess what?

596
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:48,458
People don't always die
from falling from high places.

597
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,918
My mom didn't.

598
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:54,631
I went to check if she was dead.

599
00:43:55,214 --> 00:43:58,051
But she begged me to help her
as she lay on the ground.

600
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:01,471
No.

601
00:44:02,555 --> 00:44:03,556
You'll die.

602
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:07,852
- Get down from there.
- No.

603
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:12,315
I won't die easily, either.

604
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:16,944
I'm pretty lucky

605
00:44:18,237 --> 00:44:20,156
and I'm a lot like my mom.

606
00:44:43,888 --> 00:44:46,474
I told you she shouldn't have a scar.

607
00:44:46,557 --> 00:44:48,643
How was I to know she'd jump?

608
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:50,395
I told you so many times.

609
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:53,523
She's no ordinary witch.
You can't upset her.

610
00:44:53,898 --> 00:44:56,401
We can't film a girl
with a bust-up head and broken leg.

611
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:58,945
How are we to wait until she heals?

612
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:01,239
Forget the money.
Send her away already!

613
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:03,199
No way! She's worth a fortune.

614
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:08,496
You don't have to listen
to the bad things grown-ups say.

615
00:45:11,165 --> 00:45:12,583
Why are you crying?

616
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:16,754
I read your diary.

617
00:45:18,214 --> 00:45:19,215
DIARY
BAEK AH JIN

618
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:21,092
I also know what X means.

619
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:26,139
X gets angry
only when Jun Seo isn't around.

620
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:28,224
I'm so sad when Jun Seo isn't around.

621
00:45:28,307 --> 00:45:29,767
X is such a bad grown-up.

622
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:31,811
I hope Jun Seo takes my side.

623
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:33,604
I don't want to go to an orphanage.

624
00:45:33,688 --> 00:45:35,565
I can't make X angry.

625
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:41,863
Then you must know
X is a bad grown-up.

626
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:44,532
I know.

627
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:46,033
I'm sorry.

628
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:49,245
You looked after me all night.

629
00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:51,497
Yet I didn't know about it.

630
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:53,708
Do you still like X?

631
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,294
No, I don't like her.

632
00:45:58,129 --> 00:45:59,505
I only like you, Ah Jin.

633
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,508
You're the only nice person at home.

634
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:07,555
"Home"?

635
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,058
I might not be able to go back there.

636
00:46:12,226 --> 00:46:14,687
I might get kicked out.

637
00:46:15,229 --> 00:46:16,230
Says who?

638
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:18,357
You won't get kicked out.

639
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:22,320
I'll protect you so she can't do

640
00:46:23,446 --> 00:46:24,697
anything bad to you.

641
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,033
Does that mean

642
00:46:27,366 --> 00:46:29,243
you'll always be on my side?

643
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:32,163
Yes, I'm always on your side.

644
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:36,292
So, Ah Jin,
don't ever let go of my hand.

645
00:46:37,043 --> 00:46:38,044
Okay?

646
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:02,360
Ah Jin, are you all right?

647
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:04,111
You're awake.

648
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:05,613
Do you recognize me?

649
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:08,407
How can't I

650
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,285
when you're holding my hand so tight?

651
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:18,918
Don't look at me like that.

652
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:20,837
I'm not dead, am I?

653
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,339
You were unconscious
for three days straight.

654
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:25,675
What?

655
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:34,267
What's the date today?

656
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,982
The enrollment deadline
was two days ago.

657
00:47:43,192 --> 00:47:47,113
You didn't enroll in time,
so your admission was canceled.

658
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:49,323
We texted you many times already.

659
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:54,120
We already accepted
a student on the waiting list

660
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:56,205
so I'm sorry about your situation.

661
00:47:56,289 --> 00:47:58,040
But there's nothing
we can do to help--

662
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:11,429
Ah Jin, we graduate tomorrow.
Will you be at the ceremony?

663
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:14,682
Yes, of course.

664
00:48:42,668 --> 00:48:43,669
Thank you.

665
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:12,865
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR GRADUATION

666
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:19,372
Ah Jin, why are you still here?

667
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:22,458
Are you all right?

668
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,293
I was worried when I heard
you were hospitalized.

669
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:25,670
What happened to your face?

670
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:28,339
I'm fine. I just fell.

671
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:30,466
You should've been more careful.

672
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:32,385
Congratulations on graduating.

673
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:33,469
I'll take a photo for you.

674
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:37,682
Are you ready?

675
00:49:37,765 --> 00:49:39,308
One, two, three.

676
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:42,269
Smile a bit, will you?

677
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:44,480
One, two...

678
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:54,532
Jun Seo.

679
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:56,951
I'm sorry I got here so late.

680
00:49:58,202 --> 00:50:00,121
Congratulations on graduating.

681
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:01,706
Let's take some photos. Let's go.

682
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:08,838
Did you hear from your grandpa?

683
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:10,506
Does he know you're graduating?

684
00:50:10,881 --> 00:50:11,882
Yes.

685
00:50:11,966 --> 00:50:14,135
How? Did you tell him?

686
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:16,303
Yes.

687
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,264
Did he say anything?

688
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:22,351
About a graduation present
or something.

689
00:50:22,935 --> 00:50:23,936
Like what?

690
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:27,815
I mean you're an adult now

691
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:30,526
so he might have prepared
something special--

692
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:32,153
Take this, Mom.

693
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:34,113
I'll eat with my friends.

694
00:50:34,196 --> 00:50:35,740
Wait, Jun Seo. My gosh.

695
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:45,875
- Get in here.
- One, two, three.

696
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,334
Look here, Mom.

697
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:29,293
Thief! Catch that thief!

698
00:51:30,294 --> 00:51:31,587
Oh, no!

699
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,801
He's a pickpocket!

700
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:46,769
You asshole!

701
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,845
If I hadn't cross paths
with that man then

702
00:52:22,346 --> 00:52:25,057
his life would've been
completely different.

703
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:28,727
It's such a shame.

704
00:52:34,024 --> 00:52:36,610
The newbie's just 20 years old?

705
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:38,737
He was sent here
from a youth detention center.

706
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:41,532
His skin is so smooth and firm.

707
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:43,033
I did, too, once.

708
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:45,035
Jeez.

709
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,121
What's he in for?

710
00:52:48,205 --> 00:52:49,999
Murder, but not just any kind.

711
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:52,293
Patricide. My gosh.

712
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:55,629
That young guy killed his dad?

713
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:57,548
Kids these days are fearless.

714
00:52:57,631 --> 00:53:00,176
I talked to him a bit,
and he's pretty docile.

715
00:53:00,634 --> 00:53:04,346
He got bullied so much
at the youth detention center.

716
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:06,182
He could've stayed there

717
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,267
but he chose to be transferred here.

718
00:53:15,482 --> 00:53:20,070
DEAR X
