1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,969
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:56,889
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:58,515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,130
Two, three. Clear!

5
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:22,724
CARDIAC PACEMAKER

6
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:51,253
- One, two, three. Clear!
- At that fork

7
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,631
where one life stands
between life and death

8
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,886
what kind of prayer
did desperate Ah-jin

9
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:02,055
offer up?

10
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,018
At death's door

11
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:09,021
was that one's life

12
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:11,607
or one's end?

13
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:25,287
Was that death

14
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,499
God's answer to Ah-jin's prayer

15
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,294
or His punishment?

16
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:48,435
WITH DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

17
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,161
No!

18
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,588
Grandma!

19
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:30,620
EPISODE 8: BEFORE JUDGMENT

20
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,959
SAMYUN SEOUL HOSPITAL MEMORIAL HALL

21
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,462
NOTICE REGARDING MEDIA COVERAGE

22
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,559
REST IN PEACE

23
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:39,898
Get some rest.

24
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,483
You'll collapse at this rate.

25
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,318
I'll take him outside for a moment.

26
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,365
HONG KYUNG-SUK

27
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:57,874
- You two know each other?
- Yes.

28
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,709
He helped me out a lot.

29
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:02,587
And I worked part-time
at his café for a year.

30
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:10,804
BASEBALL PLAYER CHOI ARRESTED
FOR MURDERING A PART-TIMER'S FATHER

31
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:13,140
PARTIALLY ADMITTED GUILT
AND SAID "IT WAS IMPULSIVE"

32
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,821
I was going to go home

33
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,490
after In-gang left.

34
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:33,910
But I went to her place instead.

35
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,081
He had asked me

36
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:44,796
and I remembered she hasn't been
sleeping well at night lately.

37
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,551
I wanted to keep her company.

38
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:52,804
I thought of you
as a gift from my daughter.

39
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:58,310
I scolded In-gang for doubting you
and pushing you away.

40
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,521
I reprimanded him for that.

41
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,775
You looked so pitiful
when I first saw you

42
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:08,111
so I believed
you could never do such a thing.

43
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:09,863
The one who deceived me...

44
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,490
No.

45
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,950
The one who deceived my whole family!

46
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:16,912
I foolishly trusted you

47
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:20,624
and I drove my own grandson...

48
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,628
into a bottomless pit.

49
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:31,968
What...

50
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,346
What should I do?

51
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,558
What am I supposed to do now, Ah-jin?

52
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,980
Can you explain what happened

53
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,566
before and after the fall?

54
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:52,656
A cat.

55
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,993
She went out to show me

56
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:01,498
the kitten that had come by.

57
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,000
A cat?

58
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,587
She used to feed

59
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:11,925
the stray cats in the neighborhood.

60
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:16,263
In-mo is allergic,
so she couldn't let them inside.

61
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:22,060
She had only put food out for them.

62
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:27,357
Sometimes, the cats would bring
their kittens

63
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,234
and show up at her door

64
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,362
at night.

65
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,072
Please continue.

66
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,617
After putting food out for them...

67
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:41,288
she was standing up...

68
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:47,335
when she suddenly swayed
as if she got dizzy.

69
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,472
Then, she lost consciousness.

70
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:07,439
I see.

71
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:10,150
I know this is hard

72
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:13,236
but I have a few more questions.

73
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:33,798
I'll take care of it.

74
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,843
I'll wipe every security camera
and dash cam clean

75
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,679
so get her away from here.

76
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,182
It's more natural
to say that I was here.

77
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,894
And there aren't
any security cameras here.

78
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:48,813
Don't do anything stupid.

79
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,331
A grandma fell down the stairs.

80
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,751
Please hurry.

81
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:21,805
Wait!

82
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:27,519
I'd like to know
exactly what kind of relationship

83
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:29,229
you have with Baek Ah-jin.

84
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:30,772
I looked you up.

85
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:33,024
The Nojeong-dong Rooftop Murder Case.

86
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,528
What does that have to do
with Dharma Sister Yeonhwa's passing?

87
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:38,363
I read that you testified
you were caught in a trap

88
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,949
set by the victim's daughter,
who worked part-time at your café.

89
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:43,034
What exactly are you trying to ask?

90
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:46,621
Is it whether there's a link

91
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,790
between Baek Ah-jin
and her father's murder?

92
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:50,166
Can you answer that?

93
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,210
You want an answer?

94
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,967
Between the murder
of Mr. Baek Seon-gyu...

95
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:02,804
and Ms. Baek Ah-jin...

96
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:07,976
there is no connection.

97
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:09,853
Sorry?

98
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,479
No connection whatsoever.

99
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:15,024
Back then, I testified like that
out of a cowardly wish

100
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,861
to slip through the law
because I was afraid

101
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:19,362
of becoming a criminal.

102
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:21,906
Which I regret now.

103
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,078
I served five years
and paid for my crime behind bars

104
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:29,372
but my debt to the deceased

105
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:32,584
is something I must carry for life.

106
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,296
Baek Ah-jin is

107
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,966
simply a bereaved daughter
who lost her family.

108
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:41,259
She's someone

109
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,887
I must keep apologizing to
until the day I die.

110
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:46,723
Since she became so famous

111
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:50,935
there will inevitably be
all kinds of rumors.

112
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,937
But they're baseless.

113
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:54,606
I'm relieved to hear that.

114
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:56,858
Thank you for coming.

115
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,369
Why did you tell him that?

116
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:17,212
It was a chance to get revenge.

117
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,050
Why defend me?

118
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,350
During my first year in prison...

119
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,604
I wondered what I'd do to you

120
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,565
once I got out...

121
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:40,985
and how to pay you back.

122
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,447
During the second year

123
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,367
I kept thinking...

124
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,037
"Why me, of all people?"

125
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,625
After the third winter...

126
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:00,755
I started thinking
about what could have driven you...

127
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,051
to do something so horrific.

128
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,513
And the year after that...

129
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:13,518
I began taking pity on you.

130
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:19,649
If you had had
even one proper adult in your life

131
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,861
as a child

132
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:27,740
I thought your path
might have been different.

133
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,910
So, in the last year

134
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,414
I decided to pray for you.

135
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:38,042
And I started wondering

136
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:42,797
if I could become
that one adult for you.

137
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:47,969
Once I thought about it that way

138
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,556
I stopped resenting you.

139
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,643
So, don't carry any guilt.

140
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:58,646
What happened then

141
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,649
was simply my fate.

142
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,361
That sounds just like you.

143
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,156
I'm going to root for you.

144
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:09,824
That's my way.

145
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,831
So, live your life
remembering there's someone out there

146
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:20,335
who genuinely pities you

147
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,880
and sincerely cheers for you.

148
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:27,800
Try living like that.

149
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,598
That's the best revenge I can offer.

150
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,106
But Mr. Choi.

151
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,322
There's no such thing
as "best revenge."

152
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:52,617
What just happened was

153
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:55,578
that you missed
your one and only chance

154
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:58,623
to take revenge on me.

155
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,046
Thank you.

156
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:16,641
HEO IN-GANG WAS KNOWN
TO BE DEEPLY AFFECTIONATE

157
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:18,101
TOWARD HIS GRANDMOTHER...

158
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:19,894
Baek Ah-jin and Heo In-gang?

159
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,480
How long are you going to milk them?

160
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:23,898
It works for the public.

161
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,775
They're like a bone broth.

162
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:28,277
You boil and boil,
and it still gives.

163
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:31,239
It's about time
they broke up, though.

164
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,075
I was going to lock in the breakup
as an exclusive

165
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:35,660
and be done with it.

166
00:16:35,743 --> 00:16:37,829
Why split up a couple
that's doing fine?

167
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:39,622
Isn't it obvious?

168
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,542
Ah-jin is a rising sun,
and In-gang is a setting sun.

169
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:46,754
She's gotten everything
she could out of him.

170
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,424
Why would she keep dating him?

171
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,300
Who knows?

172
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:52,552
It could be true love.

173
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:58,933
"True love"? You don't know anything.

174
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:28,671
What do you want?

175
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,006
Oh, nothing.

176
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:33,801
I'm just calling to see
if there's anything new.

177
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:37,597
Nothing pulls clicks
like you and In-gang.

178
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:40,391
We're in mourning. Show some respect.

179
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,143
I have something to verify--

180
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:43,227
Hello?

181
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:44,645
Hello...

182
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:48,483
Right.

183
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,277
For a time like this...

184
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,072

00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,159
Hello, Ms. Sim Sung-hee?

187
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,286
I told you I never did that.

188
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:02,914
It looks like Ah-jin's side
has already made a move.

189
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:04,665
Was it Longstar's CEO, Seo Mi-ri?

190
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:06,667
I don't know
what you're talking about.

191
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:10,171
If you're going to keep talking
nonsense, I'm hanging up.

192
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:19,680
I did what you told me to.

193
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:21,599
Guess you're scared, after all.

194
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:26,270
Figures.

195
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,398
Your dad's past
as an adulterous lawyer

196
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,151
and your own past,
stealing your classmates' stuff

197
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:34,028
beaten by the homeroom teacher
and kids

198
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,655
and forced to transfer.

199
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,200
It'll look bad on you
if those spread in your workplace.

200
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:44,539
You saw the comments
on your post last time, right?

201
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,667
Plenty of people still remember you.

202
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:51,003
So, unless you want
your past dragged out in the open

203
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,588
shut your mouth and lie low.

204
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,135
If not

205
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,972
I'll follow you around
with your past everywhere you go.

206
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,484
Fuck.

207
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:16,863
SAMYUN SEOUL HOSPITAL MEMORIAL HALL

208
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:20,908
Director.

209
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:24,078
Hello.

210
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:27,665
Are you heading out now?

211
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:29,667
Oh, Ms. Baek Ah-jin.

212
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:32,503
I'm glad you know my name.

213
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:34,338
I was nervous you might not.

214
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:37,091
Of course, I do.
I enjoyed your works.

215
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:38,634
Thank you.

216
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,804
I've watched all of yours as well.

217
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:43,681
I'm a big fan.

218
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:45,892
And In-gang talks about you so much.

219
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:49,353
He does?
I should buy him a meal sometime.

220
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:50,438
No need.

221
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:52,815
Since you came today

222
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:58,654
once he settles down,
let me treat you to a meal with him.

223
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:01,282
What do you say?

224
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,409
I'd love that. Anytime.

225
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:05,953
For today, please stay by him

226
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:07,955
and comfort him.

227
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:09,790
I will.

228
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,753
- Get home safe.
- Thanks.

229
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:18,507
Ms. Baek.

230
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,053
If you don't mind

231
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:24,639
how about you drop
by my studio sometime?

232
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,604
He must have seen Ah-jin
at In-gang's grandma's funeral.

233
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:33,606
He said she was the image
he'd been looking for

234
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:37,985
and wants her to play
a key role in his new work.

235
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,279
Director Seol Yeong-uk is...

236
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:42,156
It'll be invited
to the Cannes Film Festival

237
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,784
and that naturally opens
a route into the global market.

238
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,161
There's no better opportunity
for an actor.

239
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,413
It's what every actor dreams of.

240
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,045
In-gang's grandma left Ah-jin
a big gift as she passed.

241
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,399
You're curious, aren't you?

242
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,403
Whether I was the one
who did it to her that night.

243
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,495
What do you think?

244
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:33,040
Do you think I could go that far?

245
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,171
I don't get you.

246
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,094
It must have been hard

247
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,888
thinking about what to do with a girl
who even committed a murder.

248
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,224
Say it.

249
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,145
It wasn't you, right?

250
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:56,689
And what happens if it were me?

251
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:03,446
You're right.

252
00:22:05,114 --> 00:22:06,782
She started getting on my nerves.

253
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:09,660
She was no use to me anymore

254
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,079
and constantly got in my way.

255
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:16,792
She had also found out
that I approached her on purpose.

256
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:24,425
So, what do you think I did to her?

257
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:27,053
Is that true?

258
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:28,804
Did you really do it?

259
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:31,974
Whatever you're thinking
is the truth.

260
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:33,059
Baek Ah-jin.

261
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:41,108
This is so exhausting.

262
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,414
Excuse me.

263
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:39,583
You're the grandson of the lady
who lived in Unit 401, right?

264
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,005
My grandma was crying?

265
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:49,093
Yes, she was practically wailing,
so I was shocked.

266
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:50,636
She normally doesn't do that.

267
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:53,097
By the time she calmed down

268
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,933
a pretty, young woman
walked into her place.

269
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:59,311
I brought her some red bean porridge

270
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,689
and saw something strange
at the door.

271
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:04,066
What was it?

272
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,570
Your grandma was pounding
the young woman's chest

273
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:12,199
saying things like, "I trusted you
who deceived my whole family."

274
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,368
It was something like that.

275
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:20,374
Also, the woman in Unit 409 said

276
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,334
someone kept stealing her packages

277
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:25,296
so she secretly set up
a camera in the hallway.

278
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:28,799
But it's illegal

279
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:31,177
so she probably didn't tell
the police.

280
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,596
But if your grandma fell
down the stairs

281
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,389
between the fourth and third floors

282
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,516
it might have been filmed.

283
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:43,022
Could I speak with her?

284
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,775
My husband saved
a copy of the footage just in case

285
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,527
but a detective came and got it.

286
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,696
I see.

287
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,573
Thank you.

288
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:12,760
Don't ever make me do
stuff like this again.

289
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:16,096
You, of all people,
should believe in Ah-jin, damn it.

290
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,767
- Did you see it?
- No.

291
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:21,435
I don't need to.

292
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:23,437
I believe her. She's innocent.

293
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:34,782
And don't worry about Sung-hee.

294
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:37,826
I gave her a good scare, so she won't
dare open her mouth again.

295
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,453
She won't be spreading stories
about Ah-jin.

296
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:41,288
Good.

297
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:11,819
In-gang, are you still in bed?

298
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:13,153
Yes, why?

299
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:15,531
Come on. You too?

300
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,784
I heard you backed out of the film
you were supposed to do.

301
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:21,912
We've got to hang in there
now more than ever.

302
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,039
Don't keep starving yourself.

303
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,250
Remember to eat.

304
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:29,295
Ah-jin brought me some porridge.

305
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:31,589
I'll have it later.

306
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:52,818
I saw you were asleep, so I left.

307
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:54,778
Don't skip meals, okay?

308
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:56,530
I love you.

309
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:02,202
HEO IN-GANG SPOTTED
SHOPPING FOR RINGS IN HONG KONG

310
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:06,165
There are headlines saying
you're about to get married now.

311
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:08,042
This is a problem, Ms. Baek.

312
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,002
You do know

313
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:12,338
what kind of character
you're playing, right?

314
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:15,424
If audiences can't stay
immersed in my film

315
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:18,802
because of your real-life romance
or marriage rumors

316
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:21,096
I've got no reason to cast you, do I?

317
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:23,557
I'm sorry.

318
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:26,894
I wasn't expecting
this kind of speculation, either.

319
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:34,485
I actually like
seeing you and In-gang together.

320
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:38,739
I got to work with you thanks to him,
and I appreciate that.

321
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:41,575
But let's keep personal
and professional matters separate.

322
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,619
You're not dumb enough
to confuse them

323
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:45,454
right?

324
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:47,623
No, Director.

325
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,043
Director, you're already here!

326
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,586
I came as early as I could.

327
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:55,339
Long time no see, Ms. Seo.

328
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:56,632
Hi.

329
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,345
I don't see Mr. Yoon, though.
Is he running late?

330
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,349
He said
we should meet on a better day.

331
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,560
He said today wasn't
the night for drinking.

332
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:13,607
Anyway, I'll get going.
Let's talk again soon.

333
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:15,484
Of course.

334
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:17,069
We'll see you soon.

335
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:18,779
Take care!

336
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:28,038
It must have been tough
cleaning up the mess.

337
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:31,834
I only posted a statement asking
to refrain from wild speculations.

338
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:33,502
What about In-gang?

339
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,922
When has he ever cared
about articles?

340
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:39,925
His fans are already freaking out
that he can't get married yet.

341
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:42,469
But he's talking about retiring
once his contract's over.

342
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:43,971
It's driving me insane.

343
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:48,934
He really said that?

344
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,146
He didn't tell you?

345
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:54,606
I had my phone turned off.

346
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:57,818
It was getting too chaotic
due to all the calls coming in.

347
00:29:01,822 --> 00:29:04,533
You didn't know
about the ring, either, did you?

348
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:07,119
No.

349
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:11,039
Are you going to marry him?

350
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:18,297
No, I'm going to end it.

351
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:20,883
You'll back me up, right?

352
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:24,344
Ah-jin.

353
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,638
While preparing for your birthday

354
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:29,808
I realized

355
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:32,227
it was the first time in my life
I had ever felt so deeply grateful

356
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:34,021
that someone was born.

357
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:40,277
I suddenly understood how huge
my feelings for you had become.

358
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:42,946
This must be love.

359
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,700
Let's share our lives together.

360
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:50,996
Let's fill and exchange our love

361
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,040
within the same everyday life.

362
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,793
I want to marry you.

363
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:58,504
You're home, right?

364
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,185
I'll be at your place in ten minutes.

365
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:14,728
We need to talk.

366
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,400
Will you stay by my side?

367
00:30:40,295 --> 00:30:41,505
What are you hesitating about?

368
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,173
Is it something exciting?

369
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:45,592
Something scary.

370
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,761
I'm not sure if I can handle it.

371
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:48,887
Scary?

372
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:50,264
Like what?

373
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:52,266
It's just scary.

374
00:30:54,768 --> 00:30:56,353
Then throw it away.

375
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:57,646
I wish I could.

376
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:06,113
Why isn't he home yet?

377
00:31:11,743 --> 00:31:12,870
Man.

378
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:15,497
What are you doing?

379
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,208
Wait, who are you?

380
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:19,918
"Who are you?"

381
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:21,003
Are you serious?

382
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:23,964
Don't you even remember the guy
you hugged last time?

383
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:27,175
Go make some ramyeon.

384
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:28,802
I'm sorry?

385
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,681
It's for Jun-seo's stomach.

386
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:35,767
He needs something spicy to sober up.

387
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:40,647
Jackass.

388
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,168
Gosh.

389
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:28,403
I was worried
something had happened to you.

390
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,865
It relieves me to see your face.

391
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:38,789
In-gang,
are you thinking of retiring?

392
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,668
Did Mi-ri tell you?

393
00:32:44,252 --> 00:32:46,630
Why didn't you tell me first?

394
00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:49,174
I didn't mean to hide it.

395
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,302
It wasn't easy to make up my mind.

396
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:55,555
I was going to tell you
once I was sure.

397
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:08,276
Are you planning to marry me
after you retire?

398
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:14,908
I thought we were on the same page.

399
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:18,078
Was I wrong?

400
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:22,624
Then you shouldn't have let it
become news.

401
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,292
What?

402
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:29,715
I feel awful.

403
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:32,592
Do you have any idea

404
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:34,553
how humiliated I was
in front of the director today?

405
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:37,472
Why should I have to take

406
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,683
that kind of criticism
because of you?

407
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,061
Ah-jin.

408
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:49,568
Let me ask you one favor.

409
00:33:51,236 --> 00:33:54,656
You're a good guy who always
does me a favor when I ask

410
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:57,200
so I hope you do it again this time.

411
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:03,373
Let's break up.

412
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:13,717
Hang on.

413
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:16,303
What kind of nonsense is this?

414
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:18,221
This is too sudden.

415
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:20,932
I know you're angry, but...

416
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:24,644
Are you even the same Ah-jin I know?

417
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:28,231
And are you the In-gang I know?

418
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:31,401
You're not in your right mind.

419
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:33,820
You can't even control your emotions

420
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:35,989
babbling about retiring
and fairy-tale dreams.

421
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:37,783
Get a grip.

422
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:42,537
Do you know how many fans you've lost
in the year we've been together?

423
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,998
And now you want me to marry you?

424
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,961
Don't make me laugh.
And what about me?

425
00:34:51,296 --> 00:34:53,507
You want to put
a "married woman" label on me

426
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,843
while I lose my movie roles,
so I can watch as my career dies?

427
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:02,516
How can a person change
so completely overnight?

428
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:04,768
Why?

429
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,314
You don't like the new me?

430
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:13,777
Then would you rather have me
smile sweetly

431
00:35:15,153 --> 00:35:16,696
while I break up with you?

432
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:20,242
Would that make it easier for you?

433
00:35:25,497 --> 00:35:26,957
We've been together a year.

434
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:32,087
I thought I knew you,
and I was certain about us.

435
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:35,715
That's why I pictured
a future together.

436
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:38,301
Was that so wrong?

437
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:41,096
You know how much pain
I'm in right now.

438
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:43,640
Can't you even try to understand--

439
00:35:43,723 --> 00:35:46,059
Why should I understand you?

440
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:49,312
It wasn't ten years,
not even five years.

441
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:52,232
Who cares
about a one-year relationship?

442
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:55,402
You thought I knew you? Well, I...

443
00:35:57,863 --> 00:36:00,365
I've never heard
such an arrogant thing in my life.

444
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:06,955
I can't believe this.

445
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,667
I wish this were a dream.

446
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:14,129
Given your tragic life

447
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:15,922
I'm probably not
even nightmare-worthy.

448
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:21,136
Don't make a scene over something
as ordinary as a breakup.

449
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:29,352
Ah-jin, what's wrong?

450
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,478
Come on.

451
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:34,399
- Don't do this.
- In-gang.

452
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:38,862
What I'm about to say

453
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,239
will hurt.

454
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:50,332
I'm already hurting.

455
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,503
You were pretending ignorance.

456
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,395
But listen anyway.

457
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:14,940
Don't try to avoid it.

458
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:22,155
Your grandma's notebook.

459
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:25,909
I stole it.

460
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:32,707
I wanted to win her favor
so I could date you.

461
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:38,046
She found it at my place a while ago

462
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:40,465
and she found out...

463
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,677
what kind of person I am.

464
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,055
And from that shock

465
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:49,307
she...

466
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,730
You understand what I mean, right?

467
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:03,989
In-gang.

468
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,284
How you fell

469
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:11,204
in love with me...

470
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:15,292
and what happened to your grandma--

471
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,668
What the hell did you do?

472
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,130
All I did was...

473
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:24,843
tell her the truth.

474
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:29,973
I asked what you did to my grandma!

475
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:38,398
I simply told her honestly.

476
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:42,527
For once in my life.

477
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:02,672
Say that again.

478
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:08,595
If you don't let go of me now

479
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:12,098
you'll be in hell
every time you think of her.

480
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:15,852
You're not the type of person
who can handle that.

481
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,440
So, admit it.

482
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,902
Our ending was already decided.

483
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:29,949
I'll release the breakup article

484
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:33,411
through a reporter I know
at the right time.

485
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:39,292
The reason will be
"grew apart due to busy schedules."

486
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,128
About Ms. Seo...

487
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:46,633
I'll tell her myself,
so get some rest for now.

488
00:39:48,426 --> 00:39:50,553
You look like you haven't slept
since your grandma passed.

489
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:54,808
Get a good sleep.

490
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:43,064
It's me, Mr. Lim.

491
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:45,024
What is it, at this hour?

492
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:47,527
I think it's time to end
our little arrangement.

493
00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:49,237
What?

494
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:51,614
Don't tell me
you're going to marry In-gang.

495
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,074
No, it's the opposite.

496
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:54,159
The opposite?

497
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:56,494
Get a breakup article ready for us.

498
00:40:56,578 --> 00:40:58,288
Breakup? Hold on.

499
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:01,416
Just write we drifted apart
due to our busy schedules.

500
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:04,210
- You're seriously going through--
- As quickly as possible, please.

501
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:09,924
CEO SEO MI-RI

502
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,313
Hey, Boss.

503
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:24,397
Where are you?

504
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:42,040
Boss, don't pull over.
Just keep driving.

505
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:43,416
You've got a tail behind you.

506
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,079
Who are you?

507
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,248
Are you a stalker?

508
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,541
Or gangsters?

509
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,960
You've got nothing better
to do with your lives?

510
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:29,587
Get out.

511
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:51,317
Get him.

512
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:53,736
- No!
- Punk.

513
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,882
Let's stop all this.

514
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:17,010
Forget about Ah-jin now.

515
00:43:30,398 --> 00:43:32,567
She's not the right girl for you.

516
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,110
We won't renew her contract, either.

517
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:36,070
I know.

518
00:43:38,197 --> 00:43:41,075
All lovers break up in the end.

519
00:43:44,245 --> 00:43:46,205
This kind of breakup happens
to everybody.

520
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,959
Just today.

521
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:53,880
I'll let it hurt just for today.

522
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:00,845
Just for today?

523
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,980
Fine. Let's drink, then.

524
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:16,611
Let's get totally wasted tonight.

525
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,367
It brings back old memories.

526
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:29,457
Thanks, Mi-ri.

527
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,001
For what?

528
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:37,882
Thank you.

529
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:42,178
Silly.

530
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:44,180
Pour me some more. Is this a joke?

531
00:45:10,248 --> 00:45:11,249
AH-JIN

532
00:45:23,636 --> 00:45:24,846
Hey, Ah-jin.

533
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:27,849
Jae-oh, who was in that car
that was following me?

534
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:31,310
Paparazzi.

535
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:34,439
I talked to them and sent them away

536
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:36,190
so don't worry.

537
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:41,070
You didn't call me out
for something urgent, right?

538
00:45:41,904 --> 00:45:45,283
No, I'm a little tired today.
I'll talk to you later.

539
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:48,870
I'll call you.

540
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,325
What?

541
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:29,035
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN
BREAK UP AFTER 1 YEAR

542
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:30,411
GREW DISTANT DUE TO BUSY SCHEDULES

543
00:46:30,495 --> 00:46:31,996
THE FAMOUS COUPLE
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN

544
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,623
ENDED THEIR RELATIONSHIP
AFTER A TURBULENT YEAR

545
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:43,257
Ms. Seo, these documents are for you.

546
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:46,010
Yes, fix the parts I marked.

547
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:48,346
Where's In-gang?

548
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:49,847
His manager called and said

549
00:46:49,931 --> 00:46:51,849
he just went to bed
after taking sleeping pills.

550
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:55,311
He won't be up
until late afternoon, then.

551
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:57,104
That brat probably skipped food

552
00:46:57,188 --> 00:46:58,731
and poured alcohol
into an empty stomach.

553
00:47:01,025 --> 00:47:03,194
Is there
a good hangover-soup place nearby?

554
00:47:03,945 --> 00:47:05,446
Are you taking it to him?

555
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,573
I'll swing by his place
on my way home.

556
00:47:08,366 --> 00:47:11,953
I need to make him eat something
and pull himself together.

557
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:46,487
I'm out of town right now

558
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:48,239
but In-gang isn't picking up
the phone.

559
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:51,075
He's just passed out
from drinking too much.

560
00:47:51,158 --> 00:47:52,660
I'm heading over
with hangover soup now.

561
00:47:52,743 --> 00:47:55,329
I'll feed him
and tell him to call you.

562
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:56,414
Yes.

563
00:47:56,497 --> 00:47:58,165
Don't worry, In-mo.
Focus on your work.

564
00:47:58,249 --> 00:47:59,375
Okay.

565
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:25,067
In-gang, wake up!
Time to fix that hangover.

566
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:30,156
I brought you
some amazing hangover soup.

567
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,373
He's still asleep, huh?

568
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:42,835
In-gang!

569
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:48,591
Where is he?

570
00:50:25,896 --> 00:50:26,897
In-gang.

571
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:30,317
In-gang, no.

572
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:34,572
No!

573
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,409
No!

574
00:51:16,113 --> 00:51:17,114
Hey.

575
00:51:17,948 --> 00:51:19,241
Look at me.

576
00:51:20,284 --> 00:51:21,285
Ridiculous, right?

577
00:51:26,373 --> 00:51:27,374
What happened?

578
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,376
You've never been this hurt.

579
00:51:29,877 --> 00:51:31,003
What have you been doing?

580
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,217
I just got unlucky.

581
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:39,220
How's Boss?

582
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:41,555
What?

583
00:51:41,972 --> 00:51:43,015
Is she all right?

584
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:44,642
Why are you asking that?

585
00:51:47,228 --> 00:51:48,938
As long as nothing happened to her.

586
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:02,243
Who the hell were those guys, anyway?

587
00:52:02,326 --> 00:52:03,869
Heo In-gang is dead.

588
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,497
Seriously? Was it suicide?

589
00:52:06,997 --> 00:52:09,250
But he recently broke up
with Baek Ah-jin.

590
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:12,253
Wait, does that mean
he killed himself because of her?

591
00:52:12,336 --> 00:52:13,712
That can't be.

592
00:52:13,796 --> 00:52:15,089
Apparently, he had depression.

593
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:52,251
What did you say to me before?

594
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:54,295
What did you say to me last time?

595
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,591
You said you were just going to have
a normal relationship and break up.

596
00:52:58,674 --> 00:53:01,093
You said yourself
that he wouldn't get hurt.

597
00:53:01,886 --> 00:53:03,137
You're hilarious.

598
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:04,763
Why are you angry?

599
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,184
Who are you to yell at me?

600
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:12,229
He couldn't accept the breakup.
That's on him.

601
00:53:12,313 --> 00:53:13,981
I did everything I could.

602
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,025
How is that my fault?

603
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:19,820
It was bad luck on his part
that he ended up like that.

604
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,948
That's not my fault.

605
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,580
He's dead.

606
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,584
An entire family was shattered
in an instant.

607
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,630
And that's all you have to say?

608
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:41,300
You make it sound like I killed him.

609
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:42,426
Didn't you?

610
00:53:44,595 --> 00:53:47,389
Did you think I'd feel guilty?

611
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:49,058
Don't expect that from me.

612
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:51,518
You're the only one
who'll end up hurt and disappointed.

613
00:53:57,858 --> 00:53:58,901
Can't you just...

614
00:54:00,736 --> 00:54:02,446
live like a normal person?

615
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:09,870
It was my mistake
for thinking you had

616
00:54:09,954 --> 00:54:11,789
even a shred of humanity in you.

617
00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:15,626
How exactly
am I supposed to be human?

618
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:19,255
Do you think things would have
turned out differently

619
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:21,257
if you had pulled me
out of that bathtub?

620
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:24,009
But you didn't.

621
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,428
Jae-oh would have stormed
into the bathroom

622
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:29,223
and smashed that woman's head,
but you didn't.

623
00:54:29,765 --> 00:54:32,017
And you dare to judge me?

624
00:54:35,854 --> 00:54:39,149
Did you just stand there and watch
because you had humanity?

625
00:54:41,193 --> 00:54:42,945
This isn't my fault.

626
00:54:43,988 --> 00:54:45,823
You made me like this.

627
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:51,537
If you feel bad for me,
say you're sorry.

628
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:55,291
Say you're sorry
you turned me into this.

629
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:58,377
When you condemn me

630
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,170
you're actually condemning
your past self.

631
00:55:10,347 --> 00:55:12,224
You can blame me all you want

632
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:15,269
but I'll never blame you.

633
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,990
If you want to leave me, then do it.

634
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:34,455
Run away from me

635
00:55:34,955 --> 00:55:36,582
just like you did in the past...

636
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,961
and I still won't blame you.

637
00:55:47,092 --> 00:55:50,012
Because you're the first person
I chose to keep by my side.

638
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,806
I was afraid my grandma
wouldn't be able to get her surgery.

639
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:36,392
Thank you, Manager.

640
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,519
I'll never forget this.

641
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:40,229
I'm not a manager anymore.

642
00:56:40,312 --> 00:56:42,856
You can call me CEO now.

643
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,066
And just so you know

644
00:56:44,149 --> 00:56:46,276
I never forget
a favor I gave, either.

645
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,569
Thank you, truly.

646
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:51,115
Hello.

647
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:58,497
You said you never forget
a favor you've done.

648
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:00,416
I wish you massive success, Ms. Seo.

649
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:03,335
Thank you.

650
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,131
REPRESENTATIVE: SEO MI-RI
NAME: HEO IN-GANG

651
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,719
I never forget
the favors I receive, either.

652
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:14,680
I sure know
how to pick the right people.

653
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,191
I just want to thank you.

654
00:57:41,582 --> 00:57:44,168
HEO IN-GANG

655
00:58:55,489 --> 00:58:57,241
Everyone ends up abandoned

656
00:58:57,908 --> 00:58:59,159
and broken in life.

657
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:02,329
You were just too weak.

658
00:59:13,674 --> 00:59:15,842
I couldn't just fall apart with you.

659
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:27,437
Please understand me.

660
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:01,847
- Kick her out!
- Kick her out!

661
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:03,515
Kick Baek Ah-jin out!

662
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,350
- Kick her out!
- Kick her out!

663
01:00:05,434 --> 01:00:06,852
This is unfair!

664
01:00:06,935 --> 01:00:08,729
- Unfair!
- Unfair!

665
01:00:08,812 --> 01:00:10,606
Take responsibility, Longstar!

666
01:00:10,689 --> 01:00:12,524
- Take responsibility!
- Take responsibility!

667
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:14,234
This is unfair!

668
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:16,236
- Unfair!
- Unfair!

669
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,113
Baek Ah-jin is a criminal!

670
01:00:18,196 --> 01:00:20,073
- Criminal!
- Criminal!

671
01:00:20,157 --> 01:00:21,867
Kick Baek Ah-jin out!

672
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,869
- Kick her out!
- Kick her out!

673
01:00:23,952 --> 01:00:25,579
Bring In-gang back!

674
01:00:25,662 --> 01:00:27,331
- Bring him back!
- Bring him back!

675
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:29,499
Take responsibility, Longstar!

676
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,585
- Take responsibility!
- Take responsibility!

677
01:00:31,668 --> 01:00:33,378
Bring In-gang back!

678
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:35,380
- Bring him back!
- Bring him back!

679
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:36,465
Baek Ah-jin!

680
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:40,010
- Bring him back.
- Bring In-gang back.

681
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:42,679
- Devil!
- You're the worst!

682
01:00:43,388 --> 01:00:44,931
Who are you? Move!

683
01:00:45,515 --> 01:00:47,851
I was her classmate.

684
01:00:47,934 --> 01:00:49,728
She doesn't deserve all this insult!

685
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:51,855
- Where do you think you're going?
- Go away!

686
01:00:51,938 --> 01:00:54,441
- Come back here!
- Baek Ah-jin!

687
01:00:54,524 --> 01:00:57,152
- You're a devil!
- Bring him back to life!

688
01:00:58,111 --> 01:01:01,156
- Stop!
- Bring In-gang back!

689
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:02,949
- Get away from her!
- Come here!

690
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:05,786
Who the heck is she?

691
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:14,252
Hey, I'm all filthy because of you,
so let me wash up first.

692
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,963
Seriously.

693
01:01:17,798 --> 01:01:18,799
Hey.

694
01:01:24,054 --> 01:01:26,348
You have a nice place.

695
01:01:46,993 --> 01:01:48,662
So fancy.

696
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:50,664
This is insane.

697
01:01:54,084 --> 01:01:56,044
You have lots of nice clothes.

698
01:01:58,964 --> 01:02:00,173
I missed you.

699
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:02,926
Not bad for an orphan.

700
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,304
You're successful now.

701
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:07,681
Impressive, friend.

702
01:02:13,562 --> 01:02:16,606
Bring me some booze.
You drink, right?

703
01:02:17,566 --> 01:02:18,567
Right?

704
01:02:23,613 --> 01:02:24,656
Get out of my house.

705
01:02:28,326 --> 01:02:30,370
You used to run loan-shark schemes
on kids back in school

706
01:02:30,454 --> 01:02:32,497
and now look at you.

707
01:02:35,709 --> 01:02:37,419
Let me try that scheme, too.

708
01:02:38,962 --> 01:02:40,172
How about 100,000 won a day?

709
01:02:45,635 --> 01:02:48,513
Don't pick fights you can't win,
and get out.

710
01:02:52,476 --> 01:02:53,477
Fine.

711
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,061
For now...

712
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,066
I'll take this and call it even.

713
01:03:07,783 --> 01:03:09,493
The public sentiment
is extremely negative.

714
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:12,329
Longstar also hasn't made
a clear statement yet

715
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:14,456
so speculative articles
are flooding in.

716
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:20,086
The agency's actor is under attack,
and they're merely watching?

717
01:03:32,682 --> 01:03:34,976
I know you were digging
into Ah-jin's father's death

718
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,312
and stopped
when you started working with her.

719
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:41,441
I suggest you work with me now.

720
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:46,905
We may not be able
to reopen the whole case

721
01:03:46,988 --> 01:03:48,824
but this will be enough
to drag her down

722
01:03:48,907 --> 01:03:50,617
since she lives off public image.

723
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:53,119
Is this everything?

724
01:03:53,203 --> 01:03:54,412
Just a portion.

725
01:03:55,372 --> 01:03:58,458
I'll give you the rest
as soon as you agree.

726
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,419
Think about it and get back to me.

727
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:03,880
Ms. Seo.

728
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:07,300
You do know timing is everything
with exposés, right?

729
01:04:07,384 --> 01:04:08,552
About that timing...

730
01:04:09,886 --> 01:04:12,138
The sooner, the better.

731
01:04:50,135 --> 01:04:51,261
What are you doing?

732
01:04:52,596 --> 01:04:53,597
I'm sorry.

733
01:04:55,307 --> 01:04:56,308
Ah-jin.

734
01:04:57,767 --> 01:04:59,477
Is this a new persona
you're trying out?

735
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:04,232
Sorry about what, exactly?

736
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:08,028
I truly want to apologize.

737
01:05:11,698 --> 01:05:13,158
For everything I've done...

738
01:05:15,744 --> 01:05:16,912
I'm sorry.

739
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:19,748
Ah-jin.

740
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:22,626
After all this time?

741
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,097
I'm even on my knees.

742
01:05:39,142 --> 01:05:42,228
Won't you please accept my apology?

743
01:05:43,647 --> 01:05:44,648
Please?

744
01:05:58,411 --> 01:05:59,412
Why should I?

745
01:06:00,997 --> 01:06:03,541
Why should I accept your apology?

746
01:06:07,212 --> 01:06:08,213
Ms. Hwang.

747
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:10,340
For kneeling once?

748
01:06:12,175 --> 01:06:14,135
Considering everything
you've done to me

749
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:16,721
your knees should be
worn down to the bones.

750
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:23,228
Deep down, you've been waiting

751
01:06:24,396 --> 01:06:25,647
for my apology.

752
01:06:31,444 --> 01:06:32,612
I don't need it.

753
01:06:35,782 --> 01:06:36,783
Is that right?

754
01:06:42,163 --> 01:06:43,748
Well, I apologized.

755
01:06:50,296 --> 01:06:52,173
Don't forget to tell Jun-seo

756
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:55,552
that I came and apologized.

757
01:06:58,513 --> 01:07:00,306
Make sure he knows

758
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:02,517
I got on my knees.

759
01:08:43,827 --> 01:08:44,828
Do you know...

760
01:08:49,082 --> 01:08:51,876
when I hated you the most?

761
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:20,405
I asked what you did to my grandma!

762
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,366
I admit

763
01:09:24,325 --> 01:09:27,328
that was my intention at first.

764
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:31,040
But...

765
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,548
I liked

766
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:41,259
In-gang so much.

767
01:09:45,096 --> 01:09:46,306
So, I...

768
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:53,354
wanted you to love me, too.

769
01:10:03,323 --> 01:10:05,408
I'll take care of it.

770
01:10:11,623 --> 01:10:13,416
I'll tell

771
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:17,503
In-gang the truth...

772
01:10:21,174 --> 01:10:22,508
and end this.

773
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,101
Look at me.

774
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,158
I still stand by it.

775
01:10:51,037 --> 01:10:52,038
The fact

776
01:10:53,623 --> 01:10:55,458
that you're also one of my children

777
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:59,003
just like In-gang and In-mo.

778
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:03,716
When your child does wrong,
you scold them

779
01:11:04,676 --> 01:11:06,261
and embrace them again.

780
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:10,265
That's what a parent does.

781
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:27,282
Ah-jin.

782
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:29,826
Baek Ah-jin.

783
01:11:31,744 --> 01:11:32,745
Yes?

784
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:35,290
You did wrong, didn't you?

785
01:11:41,421 --> 01:11:43,172
You won't do it again, right?

786
01:11:49,762 --> 01:11:51,180
That's good enough.

787
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:55,268
Ah-jin.

788
01:11:57,186 --> 01:11:58,980
Here's what we should do.

789
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:04,485
We'll keep this just between us

790
01:12:05,403 --> 01:12:06,612
and never tell anyone.

791
01:12:16,497 --> 01:12:19,500
My other babies must have arrived.

792
01:12:26,799 --> 01:12:28,468
Do you want to meet them?

793
01:12:37,602 --> 01:12:38,686
I hated you the most

794
01:12:41,064 --> 01:12:43,483
when you were kind to me
every once in a while.

795
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:56,162
Because I would be tricked
by your kindness

796
01:12:58,206 --> 01:13:00,458
and start to fall for it.

797
01:13:07,173 --> 01:13:09,842
I was afraid of having
even a tiny bit of false hope.

798
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:17,016
That's what scared me.

799
01:14:14,866 --> 01:14:16,909
Come on. Come.

800
01:17:02,825 --> 01:17:04,452
But now I know for sure.

801
01:17:27,433 --> 01:17:29,727
It's all my fault.

802
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:33,606
Save her life.

803
01:17:38,444 --> 01:17:40,321
Please save her life.

804
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,865
In hell, hope is...

805
01:17:47,703 --> 01:17:49,580
something you should never hold onto.

806
01:18:54,353 --> 01:18:56,480
They don't seem to know
who we are yet.

807
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:58,441
It looks like he followed us
by coincidence.

808
01:18:58,524 --> 01:19:00,818
She's hospitalized at the moment.

809
01:19:01,485 --> 01:19:02,653
What would you have me do?

810
01:19:06,115 --> 01:19:07,241
Let's observe for now.

811
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:12,121
Find out exactly
how they're connected.

812
01:19:12,204 --> 01:19:13,205
Yes, sir.

813
01:20:29,406 --> 01:20:33,744
DEAR X

814
