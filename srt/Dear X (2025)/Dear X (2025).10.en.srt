1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,969
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,764
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:58,474
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,434
Wedding, you say?

5
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,981
I'll wipe away
all the stains from your past.

6
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:09,318
And you'll start over by my side.

7
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:11,403
What do you say?

8
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,615
No need to overthink it.

9
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:16,700
All you have to do

10
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,870
is just nod.

11
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,789
Then everything will get easier.

12
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:26,543
A safe, solid fence...

13
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:29,797
That's what I need.

14
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:33,467
Are you saying you can give me that?

15
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:41,433
I'll give you anything.

16
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:44,603
Can you prove what you just said?

17
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:51,318
You need proof for my words?

18
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,154
Say it anyway.

19
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,908
That if I take your hand

20
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:02,204
I'll be able to do everything I want.

21
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:12,965
Shit.

22
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,384
You okay?

23
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,147
Move!

24
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,608
We have to get out of here.

25
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,372
Are you okay?

26
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,999
We need to move.

27
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,978
I promise you, Ah-jin.

28
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,023
Come to me.

29
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:38,008
EPISODE 10: THE MONSTER IN THE MIRROR

30
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,514
Is Boss still not picking up?

31
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,435
I need to go.

32
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:49,519
To her place?

33
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,146
Yes.

34
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:54,650
This is definitely connected to her.

35
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:00,948
Yes, Mr. Hong.

36
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,622
I understand.

37
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:22,594
I should get going.
Grandpa's in critical condition.

38
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:25,931
Can you try to find Ah-jin?

39
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:27,099
Please.

40
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,725
Okay, I'll take care of it.

41
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,988
REST IN PEACE

42
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,326
THE LATE YOON SEUNG-MO
GRANDSON: YOON JUN-SEO

43
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,192
Gosh, I can finally digest a little.

44
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:26,987
When it's time to go

45
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:32,826
dying at the right time is
also a blessing.

46
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,119
Excuse me!

47
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:35,996
Here!

48
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,999
One bowl of stew here!

49
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,460
Gosh.

50
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:44,379
Jeez, you're so slow.

51
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:55,849
I got through to the boss.

52
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,643
It seems like nothing's wrong.

53
00:07:58,727 --> 00:07:59,978
She says she'll call later.

54
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:01,897
Okay.

55
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:07,819
I'm off.

56
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:20,290
Seriously, a new bag drops
even before a whole season passes.

57
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:23,126
It's like they don't want me
to keep the ones I have.

58
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,132
And all I see at the department store
are the exact same bags.

59
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:32,385
Right.

60
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,305
They seem to be in good condition.

61
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:38,642
And most of them are
close to new, so...

62
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:40,435
So?

63
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:45,398
How much are they?

64
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:48,735
Ms. Sim Sung-hee?

65
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:51,571
- Yes?
- Hello.

66
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,244
Judging by that reaction,
you're definitely guilty.

67
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,162
You know why we're here, right?

68
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,293
How would I know?

69
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:09,881
Okay.

70
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,216
Sure.

71
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,260
That was Ah-jin, right?

72
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:16,304
She admitted she gave them
to me, didn't she?

73
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:18,515
Let her go.

74
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:20,684
Yes, sir.

75
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:26,815
Have a good day, guys.

76
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,450
Do I have to pick up calls
from the police because of you?

77
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,290
I was just...

78
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,586
I mean, you don't have a job now

79
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,838
so I figured
I'd sell things to help you out.

80
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:51,840
By selling my stuff?

81
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:57,178
You're a known celebrity.

82
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:59,472
It'd be embarrassing for you
to show up with these.

83
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:01,224
So, I was just helping you out.

84
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,894
Hey, I wasn't going to keep it all.

85
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:08,064
I was at least going to split it
50-50 with you.

86
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:11,484
You're unbelievable, Sung-hee.

87
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:15,780
If you don't like 50-50, then 60-40.

88
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:19,909
If you don't like 60-40, then 70-30!

89
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,037
I'm fine with only 30 percent.

90
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:34,007
Mr. Hong!

91
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:36,134
I've been waiting ages for you.

92
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,427
Have a drink with me.

93
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,763
No, ma'am. I have work to do.

94
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,097
What work?

95
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:43,433
It's not like the dead man will care.

96
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,768
Sit.

97
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,228
Sit down.

98
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,647
Do you know how long I waited?

99
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,440
All right.

100
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,777
Have a drink. Loosen up a bit.

101
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,320
Cheers.

102
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,452
You're quite the professional.

103
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,795
So, how was the inheritance settled?

104
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:15,924
I'm the only daughter-in-law
of this family, after all.

105
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:21,221
There was no mention of your share.

106
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:26,476
Out of all that money,
not a single piece for me?

107
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,311
Not even ten won?

108
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:34,150
Most of it was left
to your son, Jun-seo--

109
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:36,736
He's the grandson.
Of course, he gets something.

110
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,446
I'm talking about me.

111
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:41,616
How...

112
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,161
How could a man who doted
on his grandson, whom I raised

113
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:46,621
do this to me?

114
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,289
How could he?

115
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:51,084
Ma'am, legally and morally

116
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,794
there's no reason
you'd receive an inheritance.

117
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,921
Jun-seo gets it, but why not me?

118
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:56,798
I'm not asking for the same amount.

119
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:59,384
Even a quarter or a tenth!

120
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,845
He should have considered me
at least that much!

121
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,648
Strictly speaking

122
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,443
you and the late Chairman Yoon
are completely unrelated.

123
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:17,944
Unrelated?

124
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,362
Did you just call me unrelated?

125
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:21,448
Thanks for bringing that up.

126
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,908
Then is he his bloodline?

127
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:25,785
He's also unrelated!

128
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,997
Who do you think continued
this family line with no heirs?

129
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,876
Even if I gave birth to and raised
someone else's child

130
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,004
I made him a grandson worthy enough

131
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:38,256
to be in this family!

132
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,384
Ungrateful old man.

133
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:43,928
I should have killed him.

134
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:47,932
What did you just say?

135
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:52,854
Jun-seo!

136
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:55,732
I raised you!

137
00:12:56,483 --> 00:13:00,987
Now, pay me back,
adjusted for inflation!

138
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,240
A hundredfold!

139
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:23,009
You made me part of this family's
bloodline for inheritance?

140
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,721
And you lied to me my whole life?

141
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:32,936
Yes, I did.

142
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,270
So what?

143
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,481
Why?

144
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:42,070
Why do you always live like this?

145
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,155
That's how everybody lives.

146
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,533
Those people in that funeral hall?

147
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:50,578
They're all circling for scraps
from the old man's estate.

148
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:55,416
They only pretend to be noble
on the outside.

149
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,752
- Mom.
- I'm not the only one who lied.

150
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,337
She also knew.

151
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,464
Baek Ah-jin, that skank, knew.

152
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:05,927
That little nine-year-old
started threatening me since then.

153
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:07,887
She drove

154
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:11,558
a wedge between us

155
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,601
and toyed with you.

156
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:16,312
Is that why you hit her?

157
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:20,984
You lied about me
being this family's son

158
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,527
and brought her
into the house for that.

159
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,737
It was all you.

160
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:30,994
I...

161
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:34,581
always knew...

162
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,627
you were a bad person.

163
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:43,423
Yet I still pitied you.

164
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:47,594
I thought, "She must be struggling.

165
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:49,888
That's why she's like that."

166
00:14:55,852 --> 00:15:00,982
I tried to understand you.
I tried so hard.

167
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:04,819
And with Ah-jin,
I thought I should pay the price.

168
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:08,156
But why did you do that to me?

169
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:24,172
It was for you.

170
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:31,137
So you could live with a good father.

171
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:35,391
I didn't want you
inheriting my poverty.

172
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:43,066
So, from the very beginning

173
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,654
I was never
the true grandson of Grandpa

174
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:50,114
and the wounds she's carried
all her life were because of me.

175
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:05,672
Sure. Keep thinking that.

176
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,008
Haunted by the past forever.

177
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:13,012
Pathetic.

178
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:31,656
Hey.

179
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,491
Get out.

180
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:35,535
Baek Ah-jin.

181
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:37,912
You know this, right?

182
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:41,958
After I dropped out of high school,
my family collapsed.

183
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,169
That's when everything went
wrong for me.

184
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,921
So?

185
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,048
What's that got to do with me?

186
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:52,927
Why did you do that to me back then?

187
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,806
I want an apology, though it's late.

188
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:58,808
Sung-hee.

189
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,437
Apologies are for people
who did something wrong.

190
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:07,191
Are you not even a little sorry?

191
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,571
Why would I be?

192
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:15,074
You lost because you got greedy
trying to beat me.

193
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,161
You were clueless, stupid

194
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,788
and had no awareness
of your place or the situation.

195
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,250
And you kept poking at me.

196
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:31,674
You just got unlucky.

197
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:35,970
Happy?

198
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:47,440
Bitch.

199
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,426
Why are you here this late?

200
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,553
And where are you going this late?

201
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,472
I heard about your grandfather.

202
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:21,224
I was going to call later--

203
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:24,352
You won't even take my calls now.
When exactly is later?

204
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:32,026
Your mom got a kidney from you

205
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,278
your grandfather died

206
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,322
and now you come
to take it out on me?

207
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:40,034
Do I have to pick up your calls
on command?

208
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,702
Sorry

209
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,330
but I don't have the luxury
of waiting by the phone for you.

210
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:46,040
I told you to wait.

211
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,418
If you waited, I would come to you.
That was the one thing I asked you.

212
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:51,003
And you couldn't even do that?

213
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,800
You knew I was an illegitimate child

214
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:01,639
and that I had
a different biological father.

215
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:04,684
Is that true?

216
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,771
It's not, right?

217
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:11,524
So, you finally found out.

218
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:16,946
Now you know
why I went through all that.

219
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,324
How does it feel now?

220
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:22,827
Relieved?

221
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,254
Why did you lie to me?

222
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:34,338
Jun-seo.

223
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:38,259
I never lied to you.

224
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:41,053
I just didn't tell you.

225
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:44,307
And shouldn't you be grateful to me?

226
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,435
Because you were kept in the dark

227
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:50,313
you got help from your grandfather

228
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,648
lived in a nice home,
and wrote in peace.

229
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,443
If I had told you then

230
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,863
how different
would your life have been?

231
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:02,909
You would have run away,
hidden, or suffered

232
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:04,076
like an idiot.

233
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:07,246
So...

234
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,085
you're saying you did that for me?

235
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,420
Yes.

236
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:16,881
Can you say I'm wrong?

237
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:21,135
Everything you enjoyed
because you were Yoon Jun-seo.

238
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,845
Can you deny all of that?

239
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:27,225
This is why I didn't tell you.

240
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,561
Because you wouldn't be able
to handle it.

241
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:31,979
I would have endured.

242
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:37,443
If you hadn't lied
or hid it from me...

243
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:43,157
If you had told me
that you suffered because of me...

244
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:48,913
I would have endured
anything for you.

245
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,084
Somehow.

246
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:37,355
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, ma'am.

247
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,031
Actress Baek Ah-jin
and CEO Moon Do-hyuk

248
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:13,868
have officially tied the knot,
holding a wedding ceremony

249
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,786
at a cathedral in Sicily.

250
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,123
As the marriage between a top actress
and a chaebol businessman

251
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:21,167
their union has been dubbed
the wedding of the century

252
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,003
drawing widespread attention.

253
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:26,547
Speculation continues about
where the newlyweds will establish...

254
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:29,550
She's out of the picture.

255
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:32,511
- What?
- Kid.

256
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:34,180
My instincts are razor sharp.

257
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:36,599
Baek Ah-jin. She's the broom, right?

258
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,061
Hey.

259
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:45,691
- Do you know this man?
- Of course.

260
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:48,527
Who in Korea doesn't know
Moon Do-hyuk?

261
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:50,654
He's rich, handsome, and competent.

262
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:51,739
He's perfect.

263
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:56,327
Anyway, it's over now that
she married into a chaebol family.

264
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,956
She achieved every woman's dream.
Just wish her well now.

265
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:03,167
Once she's with a guy like that...

266
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:07,588
even stalkers would give up.

267
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,549
You should let her go, too.

268
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:16,722
And the office fire turned out to be
a simple electrical short.

269
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,934
Why spin stories
about warnings and threats?

270
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,532
Sure.

271
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:36,951
I guess that's all it was.

272
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:47,628
Can you say I'm wrong?

273
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:52,591
Everything you enjoyed
because you were Yoon Jun-seo.

274
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,177
Can you deny all of that?

275
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:12,403
LENA

276
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:21,287
Will you be gone long?

277
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:23,747
Yes.

278
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:25,416
A very long time.

279
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:28,669
I won't come back at all if I can.

280
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:31,547
Text me if you get bored.

281
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:34,466
I won't.

282
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,846
I might want to come back home.

283
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:41,599
Can I give you a piece of advice?

284
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:45,144
Get away from Baek Ah-jin, too.

285
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:48,147
I'm not telling you to come to me.

286
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:52,860
But I hope that you will live
your own life now.

287
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:56,322
As human Yoon Jun-seo.

288
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:00,826
Yes.

289
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,620
I will.

290
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:07,791
And I'm not going to write anymore.

291
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:11,503
- I doubt it.
- I mean it.

292
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:15,924
I'm putting down writing,
and I'm letting go of Ah-jin.

293
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,469
I want to give myself some time.

294
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:19,845
Good choice.

295
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:22,264
You might finally start acting
like a human being.

296
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,141
Too bad I won't be around to see it.

297
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,936
Take care.

298
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:42,868
I'm leaving.

299
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:59,802
AMEN TO NOTHING

300
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:57,317
I want to look around a bit.
Can you open the door?

301
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:00,863
I'm afraid only Mr. Moon is allowed
into the third-floor study, ma'am.

302
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:06,660
Is that right?

303
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:11,331
I just want to look.

304
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,250
I can't even do that?

305
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,837
Am I not also
the master of this house?

306
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:27,347
Even the previous madam
wasn't allowed.

307
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:29,349
It's entirely
Mr. Moon's private space.

308
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:31,769
That makes me feel weird.

309
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:40,319
If she wasn't allowed,
does that mean I'm also not allowed?

310
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:44,907
I'm a little hurt, Ms. Gong.

311
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:49,036
I'm not her, you know.

312
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,245
If you insist

313
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:54,291
- perhaps you could speak with--
- Forget it.

314
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:16,021
The movie shoot starts
next week, right?

315
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:18,440
How do you feel?

316
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:21,610
It's the project you wanted so badly.

317
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:22,694
Not bad.

318
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:25,447
Thanks to my capable husband

319
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:27,366
I met a skilled director.

320
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:28,826
I guess I'm a little excited.

321
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:48,512
What does it feel like
to get everything you want?

322
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:52,182
Mostly boring.

323
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:54,852
Especially when it's easy.

324
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:56,979
Was I easy to get?

325
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:01,191
You know the answer.

326
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,154
You were someone
I invested a lot of effort into.

327
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,198
So, it felt the best
when I finally had you.

328
00:31:08,282 --> 00:31:12,369
That's why I brought you
a major film so quickly.

329
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:17,291
Do you have any other questions?

330
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:24,715
Can I use your study

331
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:26,174
on the third floor?

332
00:31:30,012 --> 00:31:31,430
The study?

333
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:34,224
Why?

334
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:39,313
It's hard to concentrate
on my script.

335
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:42,232
I want a quiet space to practice

336
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:43,942
but the house is always crowded.

337
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:54,328
The study won't magically make you
practice better, though.

338
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:57,497
I'll practice with you instead.

339
00:31:57,998 --> 00:31:58,999
You will?

340
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:00,542
Yes.

341
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,636
Just read this section.

342
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:14,556
- Let's see.
- But

343
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,224
are you sure you can handle it?

344
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,853
What kind of character
am I supposed to play?

345
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,189
It would help to know
so I can match the tone.

346
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:26,818
He's the real culprit
behind the murder

347
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:28,695
of the protagonist's family.

348
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:32,032
I take revenge on him later.

349
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,077
A murderer, then.

350
00:32:36,578 --> 00:32:38,664
Have you ever killed anyone?

351
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:42,584
- Pardon?
- Or did you have

352
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:44,252
anyone you wanted to kill?

353
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:50,133
Do-hyuk?

354
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,844
Did I ever tell you

355
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:55,597
why I divorced my ex-wife?

356
00:32:57,057 --> 00:33:00,727
She kept saying she wanted to kill me

357
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,854
so I divorced her.

358
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:09,820
I gave her everything she wanted
and treated her like royalty.

359
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:11,405
Maybe that's why.

360
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:14,408
Whenever something went
slightly wrong or didn't satisfy her

361
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:16,034
she couldn't handle it.

362
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:17,536
She blamed everything on me

363
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,913
saying that I made her that way.

364
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:26,044
Eventually,
she had a complete breakdown.

365
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:28,171
Now she's being treated
in a psychiatric hospital.

366
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:34,136
Maybe I treated her too well,
above her place.

367
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,097
It broke my heart.

368
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,311
Did I shock you?

369
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:47,774
I went off track, didn't I?

370
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:49,109
Not really.

371
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:04,291
Ready, action!

372
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:17,637
Sister, I know
who killed your family.

373
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:21,850
It's someone you know.

374
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:42,287
- I'll go ahead and order first.
- Sure.

375
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:56,843
Have you ever killed anyone?

376
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:59,221
- Pardon?
- Or did you have

377
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:00,931
anyone you wanted to kill?

378
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:06,103
What a psycho.

379
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:13,151
They say Baek Ah-jin's husband
got her this role.

380
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:15,862
Figures. I thought it was weird
how public opinion flipped overnight

381
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:18,031
after her image collapsed like that.

382
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:19,533
Someone must have pulled strings.

383
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,120
Man, I wish I had
a rich husband, too.

384
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:24,871
I'd live however I want.

385
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:25,956
Seriously.

386
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:28,250
Life is so unpredictable.

387
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,586
Who knew she'd break up
with Heo In-gang like that

388
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:35,048
and immediately marry
into a chaebol family?

389
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:38,218
She obviously married him for money.

390
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:40,220
It won't last.

391
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:42,389
Bet they'll have
divorce rumors next year.

392
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:45,142
Hey, that was a little harsh.

393
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:49,479
Enjoy your coffee.

394
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:05,495
RIP
THE LATE YOON SEUNG-MO

395
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:24,973
Thank you.

396
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,060
Thank you for taking me in...

397
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,397
and raising me.

398
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,153
And I'm sorry.

399
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:43,200
I don't think I can come back.

400
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:25,450
FOR MENSTRUAL CRAMPS

401
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:34,602
Who brought this here?

402
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:56,833
You're home.

403
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,794
You're early today.

404
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:02,005
Yes.

405
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,508
How was today's shoot?

406
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:06,676
Did you do well?

407
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:09,012
Of course.

408
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:13,433
You look a bit tired.

409
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:15,185
Are you feeling unwell?

410
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:18,438
Do-hyuk.

411
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:21,316
There's something I want to ask.

412
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,698
Never mind. Maybe I'm just tired.

413
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:34,204
You don't seem to have a fever.

414
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,539
Are you sure you're okay?

415
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,376
It's just fatigue.

416
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,336
I'm fine.

417
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:42,420
All right.

418
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:44,964
Then I'll go shower.

419
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,216
Get some rest in the meantime.

420
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,989
Since when was it like this?

421
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:11,449
I apologize, ma'am.

422
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,660
I noticed it was broken this morning

423
00:40:13,743 --> 00:40:15,995
but I forgot
because things got hectic.

424
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,497
I'll fix it right away.

425
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:45,733
You're just waiting
for time to pass, aren't you?

426
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:46,818
But too bad for you.

427
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:52,198
The moment you want so badly
will never come.

428
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:09,901
What happened to you?

429
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:11,694
You never call me out first.

430
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:21,120
You okay?

431
00:42:23,998 --> 00:42:25,917
You look better than I expected.

432
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:35,552
I thought you'd be moping around
like some lost puppy.

433
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:36,636
This guy.

434
00:42:39,097 --> 00:42:40,098
What is it?

435
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:42,225
Why did you call me?

436
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,143
Something's going on, right?

437
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:47,564
I called you to drink.
We're at a bar. Why else?

438
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,317
You're too old
for teenage turmoil now.

439
00:42:55,113 --> 00:42:56,197
What about you?

440
00:42:56,614 --> 00:42:58,575
I've always wondered.

441
00:42:58,658 --> 00:43:00,577
How do you sacrifice your whole life

442
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,454
just for the sake of another person?

443
00:43:09,294 --> 00:43:11,504
My life isn't worth

444
00:43:12,755 --> 00:43:14,048
betting on.

445
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,343
I'm the delinquent son
who killed his own dad.

446
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:19,762
No family wants me

447
00:43:21,055 --> 00:43:22,807
nor do I have a clue what I live for.

448
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:24,934
Who's going to complain

449
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:28,896
if I bet a life like that
on someone else?

450
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:44,037
You should start

451
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:46,456
living your own life.

452
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:52,045
So you don't end up like me,
not knowing where to go.

453
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:53,713
Idiot.

454
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:57,133
You're so fucking drunk right now.

455
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:01,304
Excuse me.

456
00:44:01,596 --> 00:44:03,473
I'll handle my life.

457
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:06,017
You deal with yours.

458
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,019
You're the one acting pitiful.

459
00:44:08,102 --> 00:44:09,354
Who's the lost puppy here?

460
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:10,772
Unbelievable.

461
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:13,566
Jun-seo.

462
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:16,027
If you don't know where to go

463
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:18,279
do you want me to show you?

464
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:28,873
Let's go for Round Two.
You're paying.

465
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,541
Deal?

466
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:44,931
Lady!

467
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:47,558
Lady, are you done yet?

468
00:44:47,642 --> 00:44:49,769
Gosh, you're so slow.
Hurry up already.

469
00:44:49,852 --> 00:44:50,853
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:45:02,782 --> 00:45:03,783
I'm here.

471
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:05,868
You came.

472
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:08,204
Good.

473
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:22,343
- Ms. Baek, please say a word!
- A comment, please!

474
00:45:22,427 --> 00:45:24,262
- Will there be another movie?
- About your return!

475
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:25,346
Ms. Baek Ah-jin!

476
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:30,518
- Just one comment!
- Ms. Baek Ah-jin!

477
00:45:44,282 --> 00:45:45,283
Excuse me.

478
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,131
Long time no see.

479
00:46:05,636 --> 00:46:08,139
How did you recognize me?

480
00:46:08,514 --> 00:46:11,476
How could I not?
You were staring at me from there.

481
00:46:15,313 --> 00:46:17,148
But what brings you here?

482
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:19,275
Nothing, well...

483
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:21,819
You just stopped contacting me

484
00:46:21,903 --> 00:46:24,405
and I haven't seen you in a while.

485
00:46:24,822 --> 00:46:27,909
So, I just wanted to check
if you were doing okay.

486
00:46:33,706 --> 00:46:34,999
You are okay, right?

487
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:37,919
You look pale.

488
00:46:38,002 --> 00:46:39,712
There's no life in your face
as if you're sick.

489
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:41,839
I'm not sure

490
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,634
if I'm doing okay.

491
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:49,680
It's just that I've been having
nightmares every night.

492
00:46:50,348 --> 00:46:51,349
I'm just tired.

493
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:01,275
What?

494
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,944
Did you fall for me or something?

495
00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:04,904
Stop staring.

496
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:08,157
Hey, Jae-oh.

497
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,244
Can you look
into Moon Do-hyuk for me?

498
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,162
Moon Do-hyuk?

499
00:47:14,121 --> 00:47:15,331
Your husband?

500
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:20,962
I knew it.

501
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:23,214
That bastard was up to something,
wasn't he?

502
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:24,590
It's not that.

503
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:26,342
I just have a weird feeling.

504
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:29,178
Find out about his ex-wife in detail.

505
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:31,264
And where she is now.

506
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:33,182
Even better
if I can talk to her in person.

507
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:34,308
Hold on.

508
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:36,227
He had an ex-wife?

509
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,937
So, he's been married before?

510
00:47:40,231 --> 00:47:41,232
Jeez.

511
00:47:42,024 --> 00:47:44,193
I knew I hated that guy from day one.

512
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:46,571
Why are you getting mad?

513
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,198
Why did you marry

514
00:47:49,448 --> 00:47:52,076
someone like him?
You're way out of his league.

515
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,370
Cut the nonsense.

516
00:47:54,453 --> 00:47:56,706
- Can you do it or not?
- Don't even bother asking.

517
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:00,501
Just wait. I'll dig up everything
and won't leave a single detail out.

518
00:48:17,476 --> 00:48:21,480
Ma'am, have some warm tea before bed.

519
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:24,692
I don't want any.

520
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:31,741
After that day,
Mr. Moon insisted that you drink it.

521
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:40,791
If you refuse, he'll get on my case.

522
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,513
Where's Ah-jin?

523
00:51:10,649 --> 00:51:13,527
Such lovely weather, ma'am.

524
00:51:14,236 --> 00:51:16,530
I wish every day were like this.

525
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:18,824
Right?

526
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:33,297
"I pray that every path I take
be cursed with blood."

527
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:09,708
AMEN TO NOTHING

528
00:53:49,683 --> 00:53:52,686
It fucking pissed me off even more
when I thought about it.

529
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:56,649
I crawled into your house
just to watch you fall

530
00:53:57,399 --> 00:53:58,859
and this is how you treat me?

531
00:54:00,945 --> 00:54:03,489
My whole life is ruined
because of you.

532
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:05,366
And you...

533
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:06,742
It's not fair

534
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:12,039
you get to rise even higher
and live in this mansion.

535
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,960
Who said you could?

536
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:19,296
You will never get away from me!

537
00:54:28,013 --> 00:54:30,307
Why you?

538
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:33,477
Why does a devil like you
get to do well?

539
00:54:36,313 --> 00:54:37,314
Sung-hee.

540
00:54:37,898 --> 00:54:41,527
You failed because you were stupid.
Don't blame other people.

541
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:45,030
Fine. If I can't be like you
because I'm stupid

542
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:47,074
you can become like me.

543
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:49,618
Right? That's easier, isn't it?

544
00:54:49,702 --> 00:54:51,328
