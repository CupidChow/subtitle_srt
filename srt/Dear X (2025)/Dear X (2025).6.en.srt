00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:54,011
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:02,269
Jun-seo.

5
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:06,648
Help me.

6
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,947
I want to learn to love him.

7
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,911
Heo In-gang.

8
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:25,959
LENA
YOU HAVE TO STAY AWAY FROM HER

9
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:28,837
SHE'S A COMPLETE PSYCHO

10
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,923
TEN PLANET RYU JI-HYEOK
HEY, CONGRATS ON THE AWARD

11
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:32,841
I ENJOYED YOUR NEW MOVIE

12
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,676
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
STILL IN THE SHOWBIZ

13
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,261
IS EVERYTHING GOOD?

14
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,479
Why are you here?

15
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:31,233
I asked you a question.
Didn't you hear me--

16
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:32,985
What's this?

17
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:34,903
Get out!

18
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,531
Get your hands off me.

19
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:40,617
I'm no longer someone
you can lay hands on.

20
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,871
So you've got a pretty face
and a few seconds of fame.

21
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:46,415
How long do you think you'll last
in a place you don't belong?

22
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:47,916
Go ahead. Thrash around.

23
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:52,546
You think you can hide the fact
that you killed your parents?

24
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:55,090
The one thrashing is you.

25
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:59,720
It must burn you up
that a nobody like me is thriving.

26
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:03,974
It makes me laugh

27
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,101
when you do this now.

28
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,520
You little--

29
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,195
Why do you think I came to Jun-seo?

30
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,574
You should have kept quiet
if you didn't want to see me.

31
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:22,159
What was your plan

32
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,119
going to my boss?

33
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:25,746
Do I have to spell it out?

34
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:29,833
To expose your ugly truth.

35
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,668
People deserve to know

36
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:35,172
that you've got
way too much dirt to be on TV.

37
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:38,258
I'm going to tell them all.

38
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,929
Your smiles and your tears...

39
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,222
They're all fake.

40
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,391
You act helpless and pitiful
when it benefits you.

41
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:49,019
And now you're acting
like nothing's wrong.

42
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,359
You think I don't know
you killed both your parents?

43
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,527
You little devil. Die!

44
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,863
Die! Die already!

45
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:00,989
Die!

46
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,951
- You--
- What are you doing?

47
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:05,661
Ah-jin.

48
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,162
Jun-seo.

49
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:08,538
Jun-seo.

50
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:11,124
Did you see that?

51
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,966
I'm still stuck in that hell.

52
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,178
Now you get it.

53
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:26,890
Ah-jin.

54
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:28,725
Ah-jin.

55
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,520
Jun-seo...

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,856
Ah-jin.

57
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,276
Let me drive you home.

58
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,721
EPISODE 6: SETTING THE TRAP

59
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,242
Cut. Great work today.

60
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:11,244
- Good job, everyone.
- Good work.

61
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,707
Good job.

62
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,417
- Good work.
- Good work, guys.

63
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,086
- Thank you, everyone.
- Good work.

64
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,587
- Good job.
- Great job.

65
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,089
- Thank you.
- Great work.

66
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,132
I learned a lot, thanks to you.

67
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,801
Great work today.

68
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:29,638
Ah-jin.

69
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,100
Do you have a minute?

70
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:41,983
You know I used to be in an idol band

71
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:43,527
right?

72
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,156
There was a member, Ji-hyeok

73
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:51,451
who was more popular than me.

74
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:54,621
One day at lunch

75
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,875
he ate some macarons
from a fan and got sick.

76
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:03,088
I was rushed in as a substitute host.

77
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:07,801
The broadcast folks
noticed me that day

78
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:09,803
and that's how I ended up here.

79
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:14,349
But...

80
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:20,272
I knew from the start

81
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:23,150
that those macarons contained nuts.

82
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,864
I saw him eating them

83
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:32,242
but kept my mouth shut.

84
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:36,413
He left the industry
and does something else now.

85
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:41,168
But whenever he sees me on TV,
he sends messages to cheer me on.

86
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,505
Every time he does that, I wonder.

87
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:52,053
"Does he know
that I knew and said nothing?

88
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:57,767
Is he getting back at me
by texting me

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,604
or does he really wish me well?"

90
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:05,275
Whichever it is,
both are hell for me.

91
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:09,571
What are you trying to say?

92
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,324
The video at the anniversary party.

93
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,284
I enjoyed it.

94
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,460
Watching you claw your way up

95
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:27,130
reminds me of my younger self,
so here's some advice.

96
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,634
You're going to do fine without that.

97
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,429
I just don't want you to end up
regretting it like me.

98
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,015
As your senior

99
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,060
I'll always be rooting for you.

100
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,091
NO CALLER ID

101
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:16,054
NO CALLER ID

102
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,597
DECEMBER 25, SATURDAY

103
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:25,355
NO CALLER ID

104
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:28,775
Ms. Baek Ah-jin.

105
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:31,695
I need you to come here.

106
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,488
How did you get my number?

107
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,156
It wasn't so hard.

108
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:38,368
Anyway, that's not the point.

109
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:41,538
We need to finish our talk
from last time.

110
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:44,207
I've got nothing to say.

111
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,253
Then who should I tell
your secret to?

112
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:50,297
Ms. Baek.

113
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,508
Are you okay with me
spilling your past

114
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,678
to whomever I want, huh?

115
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:01,433
Fine, send me the address.

116
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,781
Honestly, I don't get it.

117
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,702
All the other groups still hang out
after they disband.

118
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:21,870
But look at us.

119
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,705
We always meet separately.

120
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,000
So?

121
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,835
What's your point?

122
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:31,963
Frankly, you're the one
I don't get most.

123
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:33,048
Right.

124
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:35,800
It's not like Ji-hyeok ending up
at the ER was your fault.

125
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:38,136
And you filling in
as a substitute host?

126
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:40,305
Dude, that was ages ago.

127
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:43,725
You done?

128
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,645
You're really not going to see him?

129
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:50,607
He misses you.

130
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:52,275
You know that.

131
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,875
Man, this feels good.

132
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:32,167
Enjoying the view?

133
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,295
What the heck are you doing?

134
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,172
I thought about it

135
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:40,133
and I figured I should show you
rather than tell you.

136
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:42,844
Take a good look.

137
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:44,429
That's your future.

138
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,265
See the kid in the blue hoodie?

139
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,605
Doesn't he look familiar?

140
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,275
When he was a rookie,
his bullying past came out

141
00:12:57,358 --> 00:12:58,985
so his career died instantly.

142
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:00,695
He was finished.

143
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,614
But people already knew his face.

144
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:04,866
He was young but had no skills.

145
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,618
Yet he still wanted to party.

146
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,244
So, what happens?

147
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:11,331
He starts bouncing around clubs,
popping whatever he finds.

148
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:13,291
Then he ran into me.

149
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,462
You're next, Ah-jin.

150
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:21,966
Look forward to it.

151
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,552
As much as my life burned down

152
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,848
your life will also

153
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:30,809
come to an end.

154
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:55,667
I hoped I was wrong.

155
00:13:57,877 --> 00:13:59,379
But it really was you, Ah-jin.

156
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:09,389
Does Ms. Seo know?

157
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,101
That you're slipping
in and out of VIP rooms?

158
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:17,438
I didn't want to be there.

159
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:20,525
Someone called me there.

160
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,611
So, if someone calls

161
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,780
you go no matter the place?

162
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,366
Why do you phrase it like that?

163
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:30,702
No, why do you live like that?

164
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:32,078
If you think it's unfair, tell me.

165
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,706
Who summoned you to that VIP room?

166
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,712
Of course, you won't say.

167
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:42,922
Get out of my car.

168
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:50,013
You can go to whoever calls you.

169
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,477
I said, get out.

170
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,255
Well, well.

171
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,300
Jae-oh is finally working with me.

172
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,594
Why the sudden change of heart?

173
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:30,887
Nothing.

174
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,890
I heard I'd make good money
if I worked for you.

175
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:36,935
Plus, you're human, too.

176
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:40,188
There's got to be
something I can learn from you.

177
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,314
What did you say?

178
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:46,277
I just want to be useful for once.

179
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,575
Anyway, this job.

180
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,369
It's legit, right?

181
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,412
It's not illegal or anything?

182
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:58,915
You punk. I'm done with that stuff.

183
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:02,418
We help people who need it
and get paid fair.

184
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:05,380
And you can find anyone
if you work for me.

185
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:06,464
Even your girl.

186
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,549
Gosh.

187
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,218
What girl?

188
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:12,428
You know, the broom.

189
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,098
How do you know about the broom?

190
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:18,810
That girl with the broom-head hair
you sketched in lockup every day.

191
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:21,020
I've got eyes, kid.

192
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:23,064
I don't need to look for her.

193
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,233
I already know where she is.

194
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,986
What good is knowing
if you can't even meet her?

195
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,237
You never know.

196
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,155
Maybe someday I'll meet her.

197
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,741
That's why I'm busting my ass now!

198
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:34,993
Okay, then.

199
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:38,579
To hardworking Jae-oh,
it's time for your first gig.

200
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,791
What is it?

201
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,257
A police officer?

202
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,552
You said it wasn't illegal!

203
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,846
He's a substation cop.

204
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:57,849
The client wants everything.
Dig up every bit of information

205
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:59,934
real or not.

206
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:05,064
Jeez.

207
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,734
How do I even find
information on a cop?

208
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:12,363
- We need more kimchi.
- Coming right up.

209
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,118
Ma'am, do you have an empty table?

210
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,746
You'll have to sit with someone else.
Is that okay?

211
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,830
Sure.

212
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,713
Excuse me.

213
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:40,016
One radish soup, please.

214
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,100
Sure thing.

215
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:53,196
Oh, man. I'm so sorry.

216
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,822
- My bad.
- Be careful.

217
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,824
- I'm really sorry.
- Jeez, never mind.

218
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,333
Gosh.

219
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,088
I apologize.

220
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:11,172
Forget it.

221
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:16,719
- I'll pay now.
- Okay.

222
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:20,640
Thank you for coming.
Have a nice day.

223
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,199

You took mine, right?

231
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:01,305
- Yes.
- Here.

232
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:02,890
They looked exactly the same.

233
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,449
Lieutenant Park Dae-ho?

234
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,243
I'm here.

235
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,162
- Reporter Lim?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

236
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,246
Hi.

237
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:26,873
Have a seat.

238
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:35,590
One iced Americano, please.

239
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,300
That will be 4,000 won.

240
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:43,806
You know who Baek Ah-jin is, right?

241
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:45,850
I know her very well.

242
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:49,020
We were really close, she and I.

243
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:50,229
Right.

244
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:53,024
I can tell from your tone
that you two were close.

245
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,651
- You think so?
- Yes.

246
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:59,739
- Who hired you for this?
- What?

247
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:01,908
Who hired you
for that background check on the cop?

248
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:06,913
- Hello?
- What's this?

249
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:09,832
"Nojeong-dong rooftop house murder"?
"Baek Ah-jin"?

250
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,418
Who am I speaking to?

251
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:13,878
We need to meet up.

252
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,171
Who the heck are you?

253
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:16,839
Did you forget my voice?

254
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:18,007
It's Kim Jae-oh.

255
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,095
Explain.

256
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:26,265
Why did Ah-jin's name come up
with a murder case?

257
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:28,184
- You know something?
- Sit.

258
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:29,727
I'll explain.

259
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:35,650
She didn't exactly kill him.

260
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,444
But it's not like she didn't, either.

261
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:40,613
It makes you curious, right?

262
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:43,115
Other reporters found it hilarious.

263
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,576
You have proof, yes?

264
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,994
I'm a police officer.

265
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,122
We're going to crush her
for good, right?

266
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,294
Is this real?

267
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,380
Did she actually kill--

268
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:59,048
No, definitely not.

269
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:02,385
Someone else did it,
and he's in prison now.

270
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:05,346
A cop tried to frame her back then,
got punished

271
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,181
and has held a grudge ever since.

272
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,683
That cop is

273
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:10,226
Park Dae-ho?

274
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:11,686
Yes.

275
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,149
So, does that mean
Ah-jin almost got arrested?

276
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:21,237
What were you doing
while all that happened to her?

277
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:24,156
There was nothing I could do then.

278
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,286
Don't tell me
you're also suspecting her.

279
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:31,163
She was cleared without a charge

280
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:33,040
and there hasn't been
a problem since.

281
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,626
She'll be in trouble
if the press gets wind of this now.

282
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,920
And that cop is nasty.

283
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:39,672
Who knows what he might try?

284
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:47,096
I only saw her on TV

285
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:49,765
so I thought she was doing fine.

286
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:54,312
Tell me what to do.

287
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:56,397
I'll help.

288
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,198
How is it going with Lieutenant Park?

289
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:08,200
I'm still on it.

290
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,037
I have most of his movements
mapped out.

291
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:15,708
He'll go wild
if you poke him carelessly.

292
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,710
Do it right.

293
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:20,463
Don't worry. We've got help.

294
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:21,672
Help?

295
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:22,965
Open the door.

296
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:27,428
Open it!

297
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,388
You'll be glad to see him, too.

298
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,271
Took you long enough.

299
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,899
Do you know how long I waited
out here because of you?

300
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:41,984
I almost froze to death for beer.

301
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,362
Well, you back now, so say hi.

302
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,073
But it's so late. Say hi to who?

303
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,459
It's been a long time, Jae-oh.

304
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,465
You scared me.

305
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:12,848
I got out last December.

306
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,768
I served four full years.

307
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,437
What do you do now?

308
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,565
Well...

309
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:26,112
I just take action
when the office gives me an order.

310
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:30,241
Deliveries, transfers, transport...

311
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:31,617
All kinds of stuff.

312
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:38,499
DIRECT SOLUTION

313
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:40,042
And I do background checks.

314
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:44,046
And some odd jobs
when there's nothing else.

315
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:49,844
Hey.

316
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,306
I thought you'd ignore me
now that you're a celebrity.

317
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,724
You're pretty loyal.

318
00:23:58,561 --> 00:23:59,728
Back off.

319
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:01,730
No.

320
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:07,153
I want a good look at my friend.
What's wrong with that?

321
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:10,156
"Friend"?

322
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:13,200
Since when were you my friend?

323
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:16,203
You're right.

324
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:18,122
Boss?

325
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:23,669
Make time for me sometime.
The boss will buy you dinner.

326
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:25,004
Are you for real?

327
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:28,507
Then I'm asking
for a very expensive meal.

328
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:30,134
Like what?

329
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:33,512
Trouble pasta.

330
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:36,557
You mean "truffle," idiot.

331
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:38,559
That stuff is crazy expensive.

332
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:42,021
- Name it. It's on me.
- More?

333
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:43,856
- What else?
- Chuck flap tail?

334
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:45,357
Chuck flap tail?

335
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,067
Burgers, pizza.

336
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,736
- That's what you want?
- Jjajangmyeon.

337
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,738
- And this.
- What is that?

338
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:53,324
- You know, they drop it like this.
- What?

339
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:31,070
Get in.

340
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,454
What's this?

341
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,664
It's for you.

342
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:43,249
It's a burner phone.

343
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,501
Drive safely, sir!

344
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:03,519
Hey.

345
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:05,896
Come to think of it

346
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,274
you didn't want me
to talk to you in school.

347
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:10,442
Didn't you hate me back then?

348
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,736
I still do.

349
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:20,202
Then why did you let me see her?

350
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:24,331
Don't you like Ah-jin?

351
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,002
Does it look like it?

352
00:26:29,044 --> 00:26:30,671
Wow, you're serious.

353
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:32,256
That pisses me off.

354
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:35,718
I just want her to live
an ordinary life.

355
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:37,886
That's why I need you.

356
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:42,099
Because she's more likely to live
a normal life

357
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:46,478
through you, rather than me.

358
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:50,149
What are you talking about?

359
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,901
Make it simple for me to understand.

360
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,737
Didn't you see her smile earlier?

361
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:58,282
She rarely smiles like that.

362
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:09,752
How does she usually smile?

363
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:22,765
Hi everyone, I'm Baek Ah-jin.

364
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,770
Today is my first shoot with Dazy.

365
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:30,606
Fashionable and trendy style...

366
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:44,995
He didn't stand out at first.

367
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:48,540
But he took off after being
a substitute host on a music show.

368
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:49,625
HEO IN-GANG WINS AT BLUEDRAGON AWARDS

369
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:52,419
Then he switched to acting,
met Longstar's CEO, Seo Mi-ri

370
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:53,671
and became a star.

371
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,131
Maybe because
he's been working nonstop

372
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:59,510
he's dealing with depression,
panic disorder, and maybe alcoholism.

373
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:05,557
He still feels guilty about that
substitute host gig from years ago.

374
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:09,311
He must think he's being punished.

375
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:12,648
Both his parents died
when he was little.

376
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:15,651
His dad died in a car accident
when he was eight.

377
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:17,319
A year later,
on his dad's memorial day

378
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:18,612
his mom took her own life.

379
00:28:19,071 --> 00:28:22,116
He and his younger brother were
raised by their maternal grandmother.

380
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,659
I LOVE YOU, GRANDMA
I MISS YOU

381
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:26,120
He's still really close to her.

382
00:28:27,746 --> 00:28:30,332
He always goes to his grandma's
on days off.

383
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:35,254
No matter how tired he is,
he always answers her calls.

384
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:40,134
Kitty.

385
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:42,219
Why did you come alone?

386
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,346
It's well-known among his fans.

387
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:47,474
For In-gang, his grandma is

388
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:49,268
the only real anchor.

THE SPIRIT OF THE LATE LIM SUN-YE

397
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,924
I've never seen anyone
come alone to perform memorial rites.

398
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:03,383
Maybe she has no family.

399
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,761
I heard she's an actress.

400
00:30:05,844 --> 00:30:07,805
- An up-and-comer, they say.
- Yes.

401
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:10,224
She's mostly in films,
so we wouldn't know.

402
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:11,600
I see.

403
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:16,104
Yesterday's move
must have been rough.

404
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:18,732
Yes, I haven't even
finished unpacking.

405
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,651
Thanks for finding me the place.

406
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:22,903
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

407
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:24,947
It's close to the office
and super nice.

408
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:29,034
Tell me if you need anything else.

409
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:31,328
I'll bring it as a housewarming gift.

410

JINSIU RICE CAKE

411
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:46,009
Hey, Ah-jin.

412
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:48,262
Goodness.

413
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:49,513
Wait.

414
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:50,931
What's all this?

415
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:52,516
Sorry.

416
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,728
I ordered by text when I was busy
and typed the wrong number.

417
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,940
This is a four-story building.
I'll give these out on the top floor.

418
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,903
Promise me you won't tell Ms. Seo.

419
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:07,281
I promise. Let's go inside.

420
00:31:10,242 --> 00:31:15,914
HOME: UNIT 401, BUILDING B,
K APARTMENT, YEONDU-DONG

421
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,521
Hello.

422
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:42,733
I just moved in downstairs
and brought some rice cakes.

423
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:44,735
Oh, my. Thank you.

424
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:47,571
What a sweet young lady.

425
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:50,490
Not at all. I hope you enjoy them.

426
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:55,621
Did you happen to visit
Eungwan Temple not long ago?

427
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:58,248
Yes, I did.

428
00:31:58,332 --> 00:32:00,459
What a nice surprise.

429
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,877
We meet again.

430
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:04,296
Do you live here?

431
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:06,965
No, a friend of mine just moved in.

432
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:13,513
Do you have time?

433
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:16,934
Today's the day my daughter visits

434
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:19,937
so I cooked way too much.

435
00:32:20,896 --> 00:32:24,983
If it's not a bother,
would you come in for a quick meal?

436
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:31,573
Yes, Grandma.

437
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:32,991
I'm on my way now.

438
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:35,702
Aunt might be late.

439
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:37,454
Did you cook a feast again?

440
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,959
I told you not to wear yourself out.

441
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:45,712
What?

442
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:48,006
Who's at your place?

443
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:57,891
It's my daughter's memorial today.

444
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:02,562
She was in such a hurry
to leave this world

445
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,564
that she went before me.

446
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:07,567
It's the one day in a year she comes

447
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:11,113
so I made all her favorite dishes

448
00:33:11,196 --> 00:33:13,031
and I overdid it again.

449
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:14,616
Oh, dear.

450
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:16,660
Thank you for the food.

451
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:19,705
Help yourself.

452
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,221
What's wrong?

453
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,265
There's nothing you like?

454
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,035
Ah-jin.

455
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:00,704
Step outside.

456
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,080
In-gang, what are you doing?

457
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:03,457
Don't be rude to a guest.

458
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,256
Get up.

459
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:19,848
In-gang!

460
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:33,236
What's this?

461
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:36,239
Is this really
the kind of person you are?

462
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:38,992
In-gang.

463
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:41,328
There's been a misunderstanding.

464
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:43,371
- She and I met by chance--
- By chance?

465
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,501
You're unbelievable.

466
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,380
What did I do wrong?

467
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:55,801
I don't see why you're so angry.

468
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:56,885
You seriously don't?

469
00:34:58,345 --> 00:34:59,471
Then explain it.

470
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:05,143
Why are you in my grandma's house,
and with what intention?

471
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,903
Hyang-i moved in here.

472
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:18,365
I came to help her
hand out rice cakes

473
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:20,117
and ended up going inside.

474
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,245
I had no idea
it was your grandma's place.

475
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:26,873
Do I need to explain more?

476
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,376
So, you didn't know?

477
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,796
All of this was a coincidence?

478
00:35:34,214 --> 00:35:36,383
- You expect me to believe that?
- I'm sorry

479
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,886
but your grandma invited me first.

480
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,681
She said she cooked a lot
for her daughter's memorial

481
00:35:42,764 --> 00:35:43,849
and asked me to join.

482
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:45,851
How could I say no?

483
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:49,146
I guess you don't care
about her opinion at all.

484
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:50,897
I don't want to hear anymore. Go.

485
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,024
Leave.

486
00:35:57,362 --> 00:35:59,156
At least one thing's clear.

487
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:03,827
You're still haunted.

488
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:08,290
What?

489
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,794
The advice you gave me last time.

490
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,923
You told me to stop torturing myself.

491
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,971
But you're the one tightening
the noose around your neck.

492
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:28,727
The one who's overstepping
and tormenting me

493
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,271
is you.

494
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,903
Then what did you mean
when you said that to me?

495
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:43,783
You exposed your flaws
to give me advice

496
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:45,702
so I mistook it for something more.

497
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:49,539
Why would you push me away like that?

498
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:51,416
I guess...

499
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:54,669
that's how you've lived
your whole life.

500
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,259
Are you saying I'm the one at fault?

501
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,765
Do you know
what people say about you?

502
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:10,518
That you'll die soon.

503
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,606
That you look lonely and on edge.

504
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,069
They act concerned behind your back

505
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:20,737
but no one has the guts to tell you.

506
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:23,406
But I...

507
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:27,535
genuinely worry about you.

508
00:37:29,663 --> 00:37:32,290
You look unstable,
so I can't pretend I don't see it.

509
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,213
I didn't ask you to.

510
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:42,634
Don't show up in front of me again.

511
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:47,806
I really liked you...

512
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:51,810
as a person

513
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:53,395
and respected you as an actor.

514
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:58,191
I guess I was wrong.

515
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:02,654
You're nothing but a coward.

516
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,126
Anyway, I'm sorry
for causing a misunderstanding.

517
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:17,335
That's on me.

518
00:38:19,671 --> 00:38:20,755
I apologize.

519
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:46,156
Isn't it time you told me your plan?

520
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,200
What are you trying to do
with Heo In-gang?

521
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:50,702
Jun-seo.

522
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:54,205
I told you. I'm going to date him.

523
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:02,797
I thought I've done enough
for two years, but I was wrong.

524
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:07,052
You know

525
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:10,180
how anxious I am right now.

526
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:19,189
And Heo In-gang is

527
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,109
just a step that I need
in my current situation.

528
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:26,279
A lovely set of steps

529
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:28,323
that will help me get to the top.

530
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:48,093
THE SPIRITS OF THE LATE
MS. KIM AND MR. HEO

531
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:00,498
I told you not to let
just anyone in here.

532
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:02,083
Why don't you ever listen?

533
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,460
She was my guest.

534
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,253
Even if I'm old

535
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:08,256
I can still tell
who's approaching me with a purpose.

536
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,175
You made a big mistake today.

537
00:41:10,508 --> 00:41:12,969
Apologize when you see
that young lady again.

538
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,095
You're wrong.

539
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,599
There are so many dangerous people
in this line of work.

540
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:19,350
You have no idea.

541
00:41:20,226 --> 00:41:21,478
You know what?

542
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:23,813
Heo In-gang blew up at me today.

543
00:41:24,522 --> 00:41:28,026
He grilled me about whether
I approached his grandma on purpose.

544
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,825
To be honest, it was annoying.

545
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:39,412
My original plan was
to meet his grandma only.

546
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:43,917
I lost my temper
and said whatever came to mind

547
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:46,377
and his face changed.

548
00:41:47,128 --> 00:41:48,463
I wonder

549
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:49,923
which part of what I said

550
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,426
touched his heart.

551
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,388
Did it make him sad

552
00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:00,058
or surprised?

553
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:07,065
Grandma, I'm heading out.

554
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:12,946
Take this with you.

555
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:19,911
I should have put myself
in your shoes.

556
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:21,287
I'm sorry.

557
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:25,875
But you can't go through life
being too calculating

558
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:28,253
and pushing people away.

559
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:30,129
Well, you know...

560
00:42:31,172 --> 00:42:33,049
I'm at the end of the road

561
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:36,970
but you kids have a long way to go.

562
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:38,638
In the end

563
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:40,765
you'll have to lean on other people.

564
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:46,980
Just

565
00:42:47,772 --> 00:42:50,817
listen to your heart and follow it.

566
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:56,239
I will.

567
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:35,862
Today was a win.

568
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:41,200
I'll find out how he reacts
tomorrow or the next day.

569
00:43:42,994 --> 00:43:44,162
I can't wait.

570
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:51,127
Ah-jin.

571
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:55,214
Don't worry, Jun-seo.

572
00:43:55,673 --> 00:43:57,467
I'll date him for exactly a year.

573
00:43:58,551 --> 00:43:59,969
That's all I need.

574
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:18,905
GEUMHWADANG BAKERY CAFÉ

575
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:29,374
Director Sung suggested
that we meet here, so I said okay.

576
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,543
Are you sure you're fine?

577
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:34,837
I'm fine. Who cares?

578
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:43,429
- We'll meet again next time.
- Sure.

579
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,056
Take care.

580
00:44:45,932 --> 00:44:46,974
In-gang.

581
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:54,190
I booked Geumhwadang like you asked

582
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:56,818
but I'm not sure about this.

583
00:44:56,901 --> 00:44:58,111
Thanks for your work.

584
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:00,238
Anyway, I did as you asked.

585
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,574
Even if anything goes wrong,
leave me out of it.

586
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,703
I'll handle whatever comes.

587
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:08,579
Don't you worry.

588
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:30,685
This is our new dessert.

589
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:31,811
Try it.

590
00:45:37,942 --> 00:45:40,069
It took a lot of trial and error
to nail the taste.

591
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:41,946
It reminded me of our trainee days.

592
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:44,574
I thought being an idol singer
was the toughest job back then

593
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:46,284
but once I lived another life

594
00:45:46,784 --> 00:45:48,619
I realized that nothing was easy.

595
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:51,706
- Are you doing well?
- Of course.

596
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,751
That's why I came to see you.

597
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:56,669
And I had something to say.

598
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:00,631
I actually knew it back then.

599
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:04,719
That the macarons had nuts inside.

600
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:09,557
And I knew you saw it
and said nothing.

601
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:11,934
But you know what?

602
00:46:12,727 --> 00:46:14,854
I ate them on purpose
from the first place.

603
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:17,732
Because I was living in hell.

604
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:23,905
The music on stage
made it hard to breathe.

605
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:27,366
I felt like I'd die if I didn't quit.

606
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,118
So, I ate them

607
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,121
knowing they had nuts in them.

608
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:36,709
So, stop carrying guilt
about stepping in

609
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:39,712
as a substitute host that day.

610
00:46:41,964 --> 00:46:43,925
Is this some sudden confession?

611
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:48,095
I knew my messages
would make you suffer.

612
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:50,681
So, I'm sorry
for sending them anyway.

613
00:46:51,724 --> 00:46:53,392
I'm getting married soon.

614
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:55,311
I'm more at peace than ever.

615
00:46:56,354 --> 00:46:57,355
Maybe it's time...

616
00:46:58,898 --> 00:47:00,483
you let go.

617
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:06,197
No, In-gang.

618
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:08,199
Calm down.

619
00:47:19,293 --> 00:47:20,670
Was her name Baek Ah-jin?

620
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,630
She came to see me.

621
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,423
I don't know how she knew

622
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:26,759
but she asked about back then.

623
00:47:27,385 --> 00:47:30,721
"Does he know
that I knew and said nothing?

624
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:33,808
Is he getting back at me
by texting me

625
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:36,686
or does he really wish me well?"

626
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:39,564
Whichever it is,
both are hell for me.

627
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:43,359
So, I told her,
and she asked me for help.

628
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:46,696
She said you were tormented
and that she wanted my help.

629
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:48,739
She seemed like a good person.

630
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:50,491
It also looked
like she really cared for you.

631
00:47:54,078 --> 00:47:55,079
I'm sorry.

632
00:48:09,343 --> 00:48:10,469
In-gang, what's wrong?

633
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:18,978
I went to the awards and shot a drama
with her because you asked

634
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:21,355
but I don't want to be involved
with Baek Ah-jin anymore.

635
00:48:21,981 --> 00:48:25,067
You never complained,
whatever the gig was.

636
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:27,445
But this one bothers you?

637
00:48:28,696 --> 00:48:29,697
Why?

638
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:31,574
Did she make a mistake?

639
00:48:32,033 --> 00:48:35,036
Somehow, she keeps overstepping.
It makes me uncomfortable.

640
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,788
And I broke up with Lena for good,
so put out the breakup news soon.

641
00:48:39,624 --> 00:48:40,666
Got it.

642
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:42,960
Thanks.

643
00:48:43,044 --> 00:48:45,046
No need to thank me. That's a given.

644
00:48:54,096 --> 00:48:56,265
Actors Heo In-gang and Lena
have ended

645
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:58,768
their public relationship
after a year.

646
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:01,562
Their agency, Longstar Entertainment

647
00:49:01,854 --> 00:49:04,857
said their busy schedules
created distance

648
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:08,235
and they decided to return
to being colleagues.

649
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,780
Many fans are disappointed

650
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:13,115
as the two were seen
as a great match.

651
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:16,035
What are you doing?

652
00:49:16,118 --> 00:49:18,829
Are you even looking into it?
Why is it taking so long?

653
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:22,500
And stop whining!

654
00:49:25,002 --> 00:49:26,754
Don't you realize
the monthly support I give you

655
00:49:26,837 --> 00:49:28,297
is more than your salary?

656
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:30,841
Do your job right before I fire you.

657
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:33,135
Damn it.

658
00:49:34,595 --> 00:49:35,596
That bitch...

659
00:49:36,847 --> 00:49:37,974
Goddamn it!

660
00:49:48,526 --> 00:49:49,568
It's me.

661
00:49:50,027 --> 00:49:52,154
The materials we discussed are ready.

662
00:49:52,738 --> 00:49:54,865
Can we meet where we did last time?

663
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:55,950
In about an hour.

664
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:57,868
Okay.

665
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,385
Gosh.

666
00:50:16,637 --> 00:50:18,097
You're that guy from before.

667
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,223
So what?

668
00:50:19,306 --> 00:50:21,434
- Happy to see me?
- Yeah, sure.

669
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:24,729
How dare you do this
in broad daylight--

670
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:29,442
You took bribes to bury a case
when you were on the narcotics squad.

671
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:32,528
My life's already in the gutter!

672
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:34,613
But it's a different story
with a celebrity.

673
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:38,617
One word from me, and Baek Ah-jin
will disappear without a--

674
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:44,290
Your daughter
did drugs in the States.

675
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:48,669
Try burying that one, too.

676
00:50:48,753 --> 00:50:50,546
PERSONAL DETAILS

677
00:50:52,757 --> 00:50:54,300
PARK DAE-HO

678
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:59,096
The suspicions about Baek Ah-jin

679
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,098
in the Nojeong-dong murder case
aren't true.

680
00:51:01,182 --> 00:51:02,641
There's no file.

681
00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:05,811
The person you've called
can't be reached--

682
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:07,271
Shit.

683
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,648
She probably got to him first.

684
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:10,941
I told you so.

685
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:13,027
She's not an easy target.

686
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,403
This won't be simple.

687
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:17,073
That's what amateurs say.

688
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:19,867
I wire you ten million won
every month

689
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,912
but all you do is
leave a few comments on my articles.

690
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:24,455
Aren't you taking it a bit too far?

691
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:27,500
Don't get touchy
about hearing this from your cousin.

692
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,794
It's not a small amount
to let pride get in the way.

693
00:51:31,128 --> 00:51:34,507
Also, don't you dare
whine in front of me again.

694
00:51:35,716 --> 00:51:37,051
Earn

695
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:39,345
what you're paid.

696
00:51:40,638 --> 00:51:42,598
That reporter
Lieutenant Park was trying to contact

697
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:45,684
only writes hit pieces on Boss.

698
00:51:47,561 --> 00:51:48,604
Lim Hee-kook?

699
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:50,439
Yes, that's his name.

700
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:53,943
He writes nothing but good things
about Lena or something.

701
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:56,695
It turns out they're related.

702
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:00,741
I'll talk to Lena.

703
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,661
What?

704
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:05,663
You know her?

705
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:08,290
I hear she's been bullying Ah-jin.

706
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:09,375
What?

707
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,794
Jeez, she's unhinged.

708
00:52:11,877 --> 00:52:14,171
Why keep poking Ah-jin
when she's done nothing?

709
00:52:16,924 --> 00:52:19,885
By the way,
Ah-jin says she'll date him.

710
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:21,720
Is that true?

711
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:23,514
That's her next move.

712
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:25,349
I thought you two were
into each other.

713
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:32,773
You're pathetic.

714
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,233
If I were you...

715
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:38,362
You know what?

716
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:40,614
Forget it.

717
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:45,786
Man.

718
00:52:54,795 --> 00:52:56,213
Oh, how did you...

719
00:52:57,131 --> 00:53:00,843
I couldn't get you off my mind
after that night.

720
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:03,012
Take a seat.

721
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,101
I should have come to you first.

722
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,853
I wanted to apologize.

723
00:53:12,062 --> 00:53:14,273
And to see you again.

724
00:53:15,316 --> 00:53:16,650
I'm sorry.

725
00:53:16,734 --> 00:53:18,819
My boy has been hurt before.

726
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:22,364
I told him not to do that.

727
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,033
Please don't hold it against him.

728
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:27,786
He lost his parents in his childhood

729
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:30,164
and I raised him.

730
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,208
Yes, I know.

731
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:36,420
I understand.

732
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:41,342
I also lost my parents
when I was little.

733
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:44,261
Oh, I see.

734
00:53:46,597 --> 00:53:50,392
But can I ask you something?

735
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:52,061
Of course.

736
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:55,272
Why did you cry that night?

737
00:53:59,526 --> 00:54:03,697
Because it reminded me
of my late mom.

738
00:54:04,823 --> 00:54:09,161
She used to love spring greens.

739
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,455
MY DAUGHTER EUN-A'S FAVORITE FOOD
SPRING GREENS, FRESH KIMCHI...

740
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:17,253
Sorry, I can't stop myself.

741
00:54:18,045 --> 00:54:20,130
Please don't worry
about what happened.

742
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:35,688
Don't worry, Jun-seo.

743
00:54:36,647 --> 00:54:38,524
I'll date him for exactly a year.

744
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:41,151
Don't go.

745
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,660
Just stay with me.

746
00:54:51,537 --> 00:54:53,205
That's all I need.

747
00:55:09,221 --> 00:55:11,390
Do you know
what people say about you?

748
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:13,267
That you'll die soon.

749
00:55:20,524 --> 00:55:22,276
That you look lonely and on edge.

750
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:25,029
I genuinely worry about you.

751
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:26,989
I didn't ask you to.

752
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:29,074
I really liked you

753
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:31,452
as a person

754
00:55:31,535 --> 00:55:32,870
and respected you as an actor.

755
00:55:32,953 --> 00:55:34,371
I guess I was wrong.

756
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,503
You're nothing but a coward.

757
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,805
You'll stay with me, right?

758
00:55:54,683 --> 00:55:56,727
Don't ever leave me again.

759
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:13,827
I'm sorry about the other day.

760
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:15,746
How about dinner tonight?

761
00:56:24,797 --> 00:56:26,965
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER DAY
HOW ABOUT DINNER TONIGHT?

762
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:44,733
I'll be free around nine o'clock.

763
00:56:44,817 --> 00:56:46,151
How about Pavilion?

764
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:56,078
No way.

765
00:56:57,371 --> 00:56:58,414
It's Ah-jin.

766
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,382
Gosh.

767
00:57:08,465 --> 00:57:12,261
Kim Jae-oh is a big shot now,
visiting a celebrity's place.

768
00:57:17,182 --> 00:57:18,392
What's with the suit?

769
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:20,436
Where were you?

770
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:23,021
My brother's graduation.

771
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:27,359
Shouldn't you be eating with him
instead of coming here?

772
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:30,070
I wish I could

773
00:57:31,488 --> 00:57:32,948
but he won't see me.

774
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,201
Well...

775
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:39,329
I get it, though.

776
00:57:40,164 --> 00:57:41,165
Why?

777
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:43,333
Because you're a murderer?

778
00:57:49,047 --> 00:57:50,257
Your brother is an idiot.

779
00:57:50,716 --> 00:57:53,010
I would have kept you close.

780
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:54,761
Am I wrong?

781
00:57:55,262 --> 00:57:56,889
A brother who would do
anything for me.

782
00:57:57,222 --> 00:57:58,682
I'd stick with him for life.

783
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:00,851
Your brother's a fool.

784
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:09,818
You're definitely something else.

785
00:58:09,902 --> 00:58:10,903
You really are.

786
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:15,574
But for the record,
he's smart as hell.

787
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:17,659
His grades are amazing.

788
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:20,162
He's nothing like me.

789
00:58:25,918 --> 00:58:26,919
So, why am I here?

790
00:58:27,669 --> 00:58:28,712
What's up?

791
00:58:28,795 --> 00:58:30,130
Jae-oh.

792
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:31,840
Can I ask you a favor?

793
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:34,927
Of course, anything for you.

794
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:13,692
Shit.

795
01:00:14,526 --> 01:00:17,779
Who turns the wheel like that
out of nowhere?

796
01:00:18,363 --> 01:00:19,573
Are you okay?

797
01:00:19,656 --> 01:00:22,993
Call Longstar, and they'll handle it.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

798
01:00:23,076 --> 01:00:24,161
Hold up.

799
01:00:24,995 --> 01:00:25,996
You're a celebrity.

800
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,875
You are. Right, you're Heo...

801
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:31,168
Heo.

802
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:32,794
Gosh.

803
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:35,213
I've never met a celeb in real life.

804
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:37,758
I thought you'd be crazy handsome.

805
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:40,302
Not so impressive, though.

806
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:44,973
Your tire's blown.

807
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:47,684
Wait, wow.

808
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:50,604
Jeez, this is bad.

809
01:00:53,398 --> 01:00:57,027
Anyway, it looks
like I'm partly at fault.

810
01:00:59,112 --> 01:01:00,822
Even my phone's cracked.

811
01:01:01,573 --> 01:01:04,201
Let me borrow your phone
to call the insurance.

812
01:01:04,826 --> 01:01:06,828
No, it's fine. I'm late.

813
01:01:06,912 --> 01:01:07,996
Stop.

814
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:09,790
Where do you think you're going?

815
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:13,085
You're going to call the police
and say I'm a hit-and-run, right?

816
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:14,628
I won't.

817
01:01:15,087 --> 01:01:16,505
And I won't charge you
for the repair.

818
01:01:16,588 --> 01:01:17,923
You can just go.

819
01:01:21,176 --> 01:01:23,053
Stall him as long as you can.

820
01:01:23,136 --> 01:01:24,763
Whatever it takes.

821
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:27,766
Just make sure
he's late to the restaurant.

822
01:01:46,451 --> 01:01:48,870
Come on. Just let me use your phone.

823
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:50,080
Jeez.

824
01:01:57,504 --> 01:01:58,755
I didn't do it.

825
01:01:59,506 --> 01:02:02,467
I was just holding it,
and you knocked it out.

826
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:03,760
- Got it?
- Seriously.

827
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,723
What do we do now?

828
01:02:07,806 --> 01:02:09,224
Shoot.

829
01:02:30,454 --> 01:02:32,038
What's gotten into you?

830
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:35,250
You called me first.

831
01:02:37,544 --> 01:02:39,254
I figured you could use a friend.

832
01:02:40,422 --> 01:02:43,133
You don't strike me
as someone with a big circle.

833
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,429
What's the truth

834
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:49,473
with you and Ah-jin?

835
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:51,349
Be honest.

836
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:54,311
When we were kids

837
01:02:55,979 --> 01:02:57,606
our parents remarried

838
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:01,109
and we lived together briefly.
She's my younger sister.

839
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:03,945
"Oh, I see.

840
01:03:04,696 --> 01:03:06,656
She was your sister."

841
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:08,950
Did you expect me to say that?

842
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:10,952
Please.

843
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:15,457
That's not how a man looks
at his little sister.

844
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:20,337
You got me.

845
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:22,756
Darn.

846
01:03:25,717 --> 01:03:26,968
So, it's love, huh?

847
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:15,767
Sir, I'll get off here.

848
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:23,358
Ma'am, we close at ten o'clock.

849
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:24,860
Okay.

850
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:12,616
Isn't that Baek Ah-jin?

851
01:05:13,158 --> 01:05:16,578
Man, her face and body are unreal.

852
01:05:16,661 --> 01:05:18,788
She's the pure and glamorous type.

853
01:05:18,872 --> 01:05:21,583
No wonder guys go crazy.

854
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:23,793
With a body like that

855
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:26,963
shouldn't she dress lighter
for the people?

856
01:05:27,047 --> 01:05:29,466
Spend the night with me, girl.

857
01:05:30,133 --> 01:05:31,134
Wait, who are--

858
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:35,764
In-gang.

859
01:05:39,976 --> 01:05:41,061
You piece of--

860
01:05:45,982 --> 01:05:47,734
Come here. Let go.

861
01:05:47,817 --> 01:05:49,361
Fucking let me go!

862
01:05:49,444 --> 01:05:50,487
Come here.

863
01:06:02,165 --> 01:06:03,875
Hey.

864
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,710
Move, hey!

865
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:07,754
- Get lost!
- What?

866
01:06:07,837 --> 01:06:10,590
Get out of here!

867
01:06:11,049 --> 01:06:13,051
You two are lunatics.

868
01:06:14,678 --> 01:06:17,138
Jun-seo, are you okay?

869
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:20,183
Jun-seo, wake up.

870
01:06:20,433 --> 01:06:22,310
Have you been waiting
this whole time?

871
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,188
I couldn't reach you,
and I was worried.

872
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:26,898
I couldn't just leave.

873
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,566
I'm sorry.

874
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,485
I got into a minor accident
on the way.

875
01:06:30,568 --> 01:06:32,862
My phone fell into a sewage

876
01:06:32,946 --> 01:06:34,781
and I couldn't remember your number.

877
01:06:34,864 --> 01:06:37,575
You should have gone home
if you couldn't reach me.

878
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:39,744
You waited for me
in this freezing weather?

879
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,497
I didn't want to miss you.

880
01:06:43,206 --> 01:06:44,708
You're here now, so it's fine.

881
01:06:49,504 --> 01:06:51,673
By the way,
why are you dressed so lightly?

882
01:06:52,465 --> 01:06:53,591
Aren't you cold?

883
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:03,810
Wear a scarf next time.

884
01:07:03,893 --> 01:07:07,439
I know it's stuffy,
but it keeps you warm.

885
01:07:11,317 --> 01:07:13,278
Am I nagging?

886
01:07:15,321 --> 01:07:17,282
Is this too much?

887
01:07:39,345 --> 01:07:40,722
Yoon Jun-seo!

888
01:07:45,685 --> 01:07:48,563
You missed me, didn't you?

889
01:08:21,763 --> 01:08:23,556
Hi, I'm Baek Ah-jin.

890
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,100
I'm Yoon Jun-seo.

891
01:08:37,195 --> 01:08:39,614
Jun-seo, help me.

892
01:08:41,783 --> 01:08:43,493
I'm always on your side.

893
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:51,209
Help me.

894
01:08:56,548 --> 01:08:58,383
I want to learn to love him.

895
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,341
DEAR X
