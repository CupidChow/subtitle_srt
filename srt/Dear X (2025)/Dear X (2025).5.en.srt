1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:54,053
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,182
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,109
BUSAN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL

5
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:17,576
Here comes actor Heo In-gang
on the red carpet.

6
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:20,162
He will be presenting
the Best Actor Award tonight

7
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:22,247
at the Busan International
Film Festival.

8
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,999
Please welcome him
with a big round of applause.

9
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:31,650
Take my hand.

10
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:47,833
Baek Ah-jin is now walking in
gracefully with Heo In-gang's escort.

11
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,085
As one of the most promising
next-generation stars

12
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,713
leading the future of Korean cinema

13
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:55,924
Baek Ah-jin captivates everyone
with poise and elegance

14
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,509
rarely seen in a rookie actor.

15
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:03,891
The two are walking down the carpet
dazzling under the camera flashes.

16
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:06,268
Please give them a warm welcome.

17
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,564
Hello, In-gang.

18
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:11,648
Hello.

19
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:16,361
You're the most coveted star in film
and advertising worldwide right now.

20
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:19,740
Everyone in the country is curious
to see just how far

21
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,951
your fame and success will go.

22
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,745
How does it feel?

23
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:29,875
It really sinks in
now that I'm here at the BIFF.

24
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,171
And here with superstar Heo In-gang
is Baek Ah-jin.

25
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,007
Hello, I'm Baek Ah-jin.

26
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:45,933
You must be nervous about being
on the red carpet for the first time.

27
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,019
Yes, I was very nervous

28
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:54,358
but thanks to In-gang's
advice and guidance

29
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:55,901
I've relaxed a little.

30
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:58,987
I think I'll be able
to enjoy the night

31
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,198
with a happy heart.

32
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:03,909
Then, you should stay
close by his side tonight.

33
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:06,787
But did you get permission from Lena?

34
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:12,125
Oh, Lena and I
are really close friends.

35
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,587
And she's a generous person

36
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,673
so I'm sure she'll understand.

37
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,788
Did I wake you?

38
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:51,415
Sorry.

39
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:53,959
I wanted to have a drink
with you tonight.

40
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,380
You're the best.

41
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,844
I told you to stop
coming to my place.

42
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,351
Then why didn't you change
the door code?

43
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,856
I know you don't mean it.

44
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:24,990
Oh, right.

45
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,242
Is this the hand that Ah-jin held?

46
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,286
I'll disinfect it for you.

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,121
Here we go.

48
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:34,708
It was Mi-ri's favor.

49
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,924
You mean Baek Ah-jin's favor.

50
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,093
Did you see the look in her eyes?

51
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:46,928
They're so creepy.

52
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:51,350
She acts innocent, polite,
and sweet to everyone

53
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,560
but I get chills
when I look into her eyes.

54
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:56,063
I can't tell
what emotions she's feeling.

55
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,899
Lena, how much longer
do I have to wait?

56
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,611
Wait for what?

57
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,156
About when I broke up with you?

58
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,283
You know I didn't mean that!

59
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:09,910
Why would you...

60
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,414
I've done this countless times.
Why won't you let it slide this time?

61
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,667
I thought I was being considerate
by waiting for you to accept it.

62
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,297
But maybe my kindness
gave you false hope.

63
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,216
Baby.

64
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:35,560
Baby.

65
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:38,605
Baby, I'm sorry.

66
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:44,069
I'll be so lonely without you.

67
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,738
Can you give me one more chance?

68
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,323
I'll try harder.

69
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:51,618
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

70
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,589
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

71
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,051
Bye.

72
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:10,554
Sleep tight.

73
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:21,648
Please help me.

74
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:27,529
What's going on?

75
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:29,614
Cut! Lena!

76
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,491
Director.

77
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:33,243
Her acting is completely off.

78
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,665
Hey, what's with that cheesy acting?

79
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:40,417
Didn't you rehearse it?

80
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:42,252
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:46,381
I wouldn't make that face
even if a cockroach were chasing me.

82
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,176
She's right, Ah-jin.
This isn't a difficult scene.

83
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:52,053
Hyang-i, get me a bottle of water.
I'm thirsty.

84
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,597
Just a moment.

85
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,182
Hey.

86
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,808
Go get it now.

87
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:58,852
But Ah-jin might catch a cold.

88
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:00,270
Now.

89
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:04,065
Okay.

90
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:07,194
Let's take five.

91
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:09,362
Take three!

92
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,657
Help.

93
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:14,409
Please help.

94
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:16,244
Take five!

95
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:19,080
- Ready.
- Take ten!

96
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,127
Please help me.

97
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,462
- Take 12!
- Take 15!

98
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:27,339
- Take 20!
- Please help.

99
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,093
This is nuts.

100
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:39,017
Are you glaring at me now?
Your eyes could cut steel.

101
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,728
Director, did you see
the look in her eyes?

102
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,481
How am I supposed to act
when she looks at me like that?

103
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:46,149
Lena!

104
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,735
Let's not make this harder, okay?

105
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:52,531
I can't get into character at all.

106
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:55,116
Can I just go home?

107
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:56,785
This is too much.

108
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,497
I've never seen anyone like her.

109
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,876
You know why
she's acting like that, right?

110
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:09,923
I suggest you just apologize
and smooth it over.

111
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:11,883
She's your senior, after all.

112
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,094
If we shut down this shoot today

113
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,846
we'll lose a fortune.

114
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,100
Please, I'm begging you.

115
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,269
I'm sorry, Director.

116
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:24,813
I'll do better.

117
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:29,401
We have zero chemistry.

118
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:31,486
I can't get into the scene with her.

119
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:38,702
Why does everyone act
like I'm doing it on purpose?

120
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,412
Why would I do that?

121
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,544
BAEK AH-JIN REPLACES LENA
FOR JIN SOJU

122
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:50,547
COSMETICS MARKET SLOWS,
YET THE BAEK AH-JIN EFFECT PERSISTS

123
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,631
A GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS?

124
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,179
Hey, In-gang, you're here.

125
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,851
Thanks for going
to the film festival with Ah-jin.

126
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:11,276
I helped you out,
so it's your turn now.

127
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,527
What is it?

128
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:15,739
You must know, but I broke up
with Lena a long time ago.

129
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:19,868
She couldn't accept it
and needed time to process

130
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,536
but this can't go on.

131
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:23,872
I need you to help end it.

132
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:25,498
In-gang.

133
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,127
The Hadere deal is almost signed.

134
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:30,795
Just wait a little longer.

135
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,673
Hadere requires
real couples as models.

136
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,009
No matter how much money's involved

137
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:37,969
I don't want to lie to the public.

138
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,389
I know how you feel.

139
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,183
I really do.

140
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,978
But could you think about it
once more?

141
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,980
I've done everything you asked.

142
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,233
But this time, I really can't.

143
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:56,363
All right, then.

144
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,531
I'm leaving.

145
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,534
Right.

146
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:04,579
Look after Ah-jin
during next week's shoot.

147
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,082
She's new and doesn't know much yet.

148
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:10,669
Treat her like family, okay?

149
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,338
Bye.

150
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,598
Hey.

151
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:26,017
Lena did what?

152
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,080
Do you think I'm a child?

153
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:49,582
Don't try to calm me down
with cheap candy.

154
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,086
Do you think
all I've got for you is candy?

155
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:54,713
Drunk driving.

156
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,090
Switching drivers afterward.

157
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,885
If that comes out,
your career is over.

158
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,186
Mi-ri!

159
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,479
Wait, I'm sorry.

160
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,651
Thanks.

161
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,656
Mi-ri, I was wrong.

162
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:23,950
Lena!

163
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,203
Please think.

164
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:28,872
Okay?

165
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:31,958
I knew she'd get what's coming.

166
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,085
Even if it's Ms. Seo

167
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:37,338
I still don't understand
how Lena acts that way.

168
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,299
There's always a reason.

169
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:41,801
Ms. Seo has been
in this industry for years.

170
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:45,138
This won't be her first time
handling someone as arrogant as Lena.

171
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,223
She prepares everything in advance.

172
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,852
Mi-ri, you can't just
leave like that.

173
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:52,562
Prepare for what?

174
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:55,648
I've heard about it.

175
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:58,902
She keeps a file that works
as shackles on every actor.

176
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,696
Stuff that could ruin
not just their careers

177
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,199
but also their lives if revealed.

178
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,368
You'd think it's a rumor

179
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,120
but when I look at Lena like that

180
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:10,830
- Mi-ri!
- it may not be a rumor.

181
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:12,582
Oh, jeez.

182
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:13,917
Mi-ri, please.

183
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,336
- She really asked for it.
- Gosh.

184
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:35,438
EPISODE 5: GRANT ME THE POWER
TO RISE TO THE TOP

185
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:06,928
Makeup looks great today.

186
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,973
Your face did it all, Ah-jin.

187
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,691
Oh, right.
We even go to the same salon.

188
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,152
We have so much in common.

189
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,029
One would think
we were a package deal.

190
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,823
You're even making me look bad.

191
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:29,534
Get me something to drink.

192
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:32,829
While you're at it,
give us the room for five minutes.

193
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:34,414
Sure.

194
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,252
I wonder why you irritate me so much.

195
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,629
Why do you think that is?

196
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:43,214
Well, I also wonder

197
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:45,633
why you absolutely despise me.

198
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:50,722
Rookie, you should be thinking
of a reason, not asking me.

199
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:53,182
You should very well know

200
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:56,477
the film festival pairing was
Ms. Seo's decision.

201
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:57,770
It wasn't something I could refuse--

202
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:00,106
And you wanted to refuse?

203
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,108
No.

204
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,069
I'd be a fool to refuse.

205
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,447
I had no reason to turn it down.

206
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,576
It was such a good opportunity.

207
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:15,371
Do you think you're untouchable
because Mi-ri is backing you?

208
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,376
Lena.

209
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:24,589
What dirt does she have on you
that makes you tremble like that?

210
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:28,134
Hyang-i turned herself in
and said it was her fault.

211
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:31,012
You're just here to give a statement,
so watch what you say.

212
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:32,138
Have a nice day.

213
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:37,060
I've been so curious
that I've lost sleep over this.

214
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,730
Would you tell me, too?

215
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:42,482
You.

216
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,402
Don't ask me for reasons.

217
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:47,654
Look for the reasons...

218
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:51,699
in yourself.

219
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:54,577
That's the only way
you won't be replaced next time.

220
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:57,830
Ah-jin, are you heading out?

221
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:01,125
My manager's waiting downstairs.
See you.

222
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,002
Bye.

223
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:11,678
That bitch.

224
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:21,604
Delivery.

225
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:40,850
If and when you become
more useful than you are now

226
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,727
I might have a use for you.

227
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:44,729
Then we could meet again.

228
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,531
Man.

229
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,374
I really missed you.

230
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:29,524
Hyang-i, you said
you used to be Lena's manager, right?

231
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:30,608
Yes.

232
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,195
Is that why she mistreats you?

233
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:36,906
Who knows what's in her head?

234
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:39,408
I thought I did my best.

235
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:40,910
Why do you ask?

236
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:43,788
Because you're my manager now.

237
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:47,416
Imagine how I'll feel
if anyone talks down to you.

238
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:51,462
Especially Lena.
She already hates me.

239
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:54,423
Maybe that's why
she takes it out on you.

240
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:59,512
If she ever does that again,
make sure to tell me, okay?

241
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:00,638
Don't worry.

242
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:03,057
Remember the shackle file
I mentioned last time?

243
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:06,644
I asked around, and they said
Ms. Seo keeps it in her desk drawer.

244
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:08,521
If things go south,
we can just take that.

245
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:17,697
Hyang-i.

246
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,660
We're the same age.
Why do you keep using the honorifics?

247
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,622
You can drop it when it's just us.

248
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:28,958
You sure?

249
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:43,014
YOON SEOK-HA'S FIRST BOOK SIGNING

250
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,390
CO-OFFENDER Y

251
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:45,975
A JOURNEY THROUGH STORIES
WITH AUTHOR YOON SEOK-HA

252
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:48,102
NUMBER 1 BESTSELLER FOR 7 WEEKS

253
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,937
WINNER OF THE 2021
LITERARY SQUARE NOVEL AWARD

254
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:21,969
Get out right now!

255
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,262
How dare you come here?

256
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:25,514
Father.

257
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:28,726
Do you think I'd come here
if I had any other choice?

258
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,186
Don't "Father" me!

259
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,773
I warned you not to jump
into a business you can't handle.

260
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,733
Now you took out loan-shark money?

261
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:37,568
Are you out of your mind?

262
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:39,946
Would I be here
if I were in my right mind?

263
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:41,822
Father.

264
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,200
I feel like I'm going to die.

265
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:47,828
People shouldn't have to die
over money.

266
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,373
Help me out this once--

267
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:51,874
You think I don't know you?

268
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,626
Get out
if you're here to spew nonsense.

269
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,294
I can't stand the sight of you.

270
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:02,969
Then I'll go to Jun-seo and beg him.
Is that what you want?

271
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:05,179
What did you say?

272
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:07,890
How dare you--

273
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:10,726
It's not like you can take
that money with you when you die!

274
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:15,147
Let's be honest.

275
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:18,109
I'm his mother.
I have the right to ask him for this.

276
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:21,362
I raised your precious grandson
with these hands!

277
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:24,740
I raised the child that you dote on

278
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:27,994
but you won't spare a single penny
for the daughter-in-law?

279
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:29,787
Does that make sense?

280
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:33,374
Soo-hyuk, get her out now.

281
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:34,625
Ma'am, let's go.

282
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,168
I'm not going anywhere.

283
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:37,253
- Calm down.
- Get off me.

284
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:39,380
- This way.
- You can't do this to me.

285
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:41,173
You'll be punished for this!

286
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:42,842
Let go of me!

287
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:44,510
Father!

288
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:59,191
How long has she been coming here?

289
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:00,901
It's none of your concern.

290
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:02,987
Is this all the books you brought?

291
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,741
This won't even cover
a fraction of my contacts.

292
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,951
Next time, bring a whole bundle.

293
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,544
NAMYEONG BANK

294
00:22:23,424 --> 00:22:24,884
I gave you my account number.

295
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:27,553
Do you have to show up at the house?

296
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:30,348
You know your uncle will flip
if he finds out.

297
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,141
- Auntie, I just--
- Sure.

298
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,770
I get that you want to help
your little brother.

299
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,229
I won't stop you from doing that.

300
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,482
But put yourself in his shoes.

301
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:44,278
Who would want to see a brother
who killed their own dad?

302
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,576
Why do you have to make me
say these things?

303
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:59,001
I get it, so don't worry.

304
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:02,505
I'll transfer the money next time.

305
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,601
Auntie.

306
00:23:16,852 --> 00:23:19,230
You'll keep sending me
Jae-hun's photos, right?

307
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,275
I heard he's doing
great in school, unlike me.

308
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,363
If he wins any awards
or gets good grades, send them to me.

309
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:31,784
Thank you

310
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:34,161
for not abandoning him

311
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:36,288
and raising him well.

312
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,292
And I'm sorry.

313
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:42,753
I'll spend the rest of my life

314
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:45,548
making it up to you.

315
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:52,346
So, don't cry over being harsh to me.

316
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:54,890
Just be happy.

317
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,101
Okay?

318
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:44,106
Auntie, I'm home.

319
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,958
Hello, please take
good care of In-gang.

320
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,877
- Thank you.
- Grab some snacks.

321
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,004
Isn't he amazing?
Please take good care of him.

322
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:08,172
- Thanks for the snacks.
- Sure.

323
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:09,882
- Help yourselves.
- Thank you.

324
00:25:09,965 --> 00:25:11,091
Hi!

325
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:14,553
Have some coffee.

326
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:17,431
- It's on me today.
- Thank you so much.

327
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,434
You know the publishing industry
has been rough these days.

328
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:23,521
But your book is bucking the trend.

329
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:26,607
We'll need aggressive promo
to keep the momentum

330
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,317
and we'll need your help.

331
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,694
I'll do whatever I can to help.

332
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,071
Great.

333
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:34,406
I'll green-light
the booking requests, then.

334
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,491
Sure.

335
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:37,535
We're moving in one minute.

336
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:38,869
Get ready, everyone.

337
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:41,956
It's gotten busy here
with that drama shoot.

338
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,833
You must come here often
to have picked this place.

339
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,085
Sorry for the hassle.

340
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:48,045
No, I picked it on purpose.

341
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:49,421
I wanted to take a look.

342
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:53,050
Oh, is it for your next book?

343
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:57,471
Then the TV promo will help
with your writing.

344
00:25:58,138 --> 00:25:59,473
I think so.

345
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,475
- Shall we head out?
- Yes.

346
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:17,157
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?

347
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,242
No, it's fine.

348
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:20,953
- Director, I'm here.
- Was traffic bad?

349
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:22,329
Parking took forever.

350
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,123
Did you wait long?

351
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:28,294
Look.

352
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:29,920
We need to talk.

353
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:33,716
Let's talk outside.

354
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:40,055
Cut!

355
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:42,016
One more time.

356
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:45,060
- Gather up!
- Everyone, gather!

357
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:47,646
Quickly!

358
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,649
That was great,
but we need more movement.

359
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:11,962
Jun-seo.

360
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,514
I finally tracked you down

361
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:26,644
and you're still clinging to Ah-jin,
who treats you less than a rat?

362
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,979
You're pathetic!

363
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:33,275
"Still"?

364
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,780
So, there was something
between him and Baek Ah-jin before?

365
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:40,574
Get off me.

366
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:43,202
When did you get back?

367
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,454
When you get back,
you call your mother first.

368
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:47,331
Do I have to find out
from your advertisement?

369
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:49,708
Why is it so hard
to see my own son's face?

370
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:53,837
Did you keep your promise to me?

371
00:27:55,214 --> 00:27:56,215
What promise?

372
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:58,634
To apologize to Ah-jin.

373
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,970
How long are you going to pretend
nothing happened?

374
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:04,973
She ended up miserable,
all because of you.

375
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,976
I can barely stand

376
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:10,562
to look at you.

377
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,951
Lena.

378
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:25,869
What are you doing here?

379
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,496
Introduce me to this author.

380
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:29,748
Sorry?

381
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:33,752
I'll post on Instagram and everywhere
that I loved his book.

382
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:35,254
I don't care
if it's on TV or the radio.

383
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:38,424
We can tell them to make a segment
like "Meet the Author."

384
00:28:39,883 --> 00:28:41,218
Why the sudden interest?

385
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,429
My soju deal is gone

386
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:45,556
so I can hand back
the "Korea's Little Sister" title.

387
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:50,352
I think it's time to rebrand
as sophisticated and intellectual.

388
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:52,855
So, are you doing it or not?

389
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:55,149
This is your job.

390
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,569
I'll make some calls now.

391
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,282
I am Ah-jin's mother.

392
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:05,617
You still need to call ahead--

393
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,245
What mother calls ahead?

394
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:11,165
- You can't just barge in--
- Quiet.

395
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:13,917
- Where's the CEO's office?
- What?

396
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,252
Ah-jin's mother?

397
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,383
As far as I know,
her mother passed away.

398
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:24,511
I guess she hasn't told you.

399
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,056
I was her stepmother,
but I raised her with love.

400
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:32,186
I fed her well
and gave her a good bed

401
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,645
as if she were my own child.

402
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:34,980
Yes, I heard.

403
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:38,942
You lovingly raised her
and threw her out.

404
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:40,027
She said that?

405
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:42,112
She left on her own.

406
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:44,573
Why are you here?

407
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:47,284
Keep her off TV.

408
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:49,912
Let me live.

409
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,914
You know that's impossible.

410
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,415
What do you really want?

411
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:56,794
Money?

412
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:05,135
I have money.

413
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:10,140
Hello.

414
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:11,433
Ah-jin.

415
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:13,018
Your mother is here.

416
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:14,770
Her, an actress?

417
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:17,189
Don't make me laugh.

418
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:21,443
She's not the type to wear
nice clothes and soak up applause.

419
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:24,112
She's lowborn by nature.

420
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:26,031
An alcoholic for a mother

421
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:28,200
and a criminal for a father.

422
00:30:28,283 --> 00:30:29,910
What more do you need to know?

423
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:31,703
Excuse me?

424
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:35,833
Do you know how her father died?

425
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:39,211
He was killed.

426
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,631
Someone else served time,
but I know the truth.

427
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,718
Ah-jin did it.

428
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:53,016
Just thinking about it
makes my heart race

429
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,560
and terrifies me.

430
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,188
And now, she's on TV everywhere

431
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:00,440
so I'm too scared

432
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:02,568
to even breathe.

433
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:11,326
It's best you stay away
from that bitch.

434
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,370
Ignore me if you want

435
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:17,791
but you'll see what I mean
once she devours you.

436
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,712
Most people only get it
after she's taken an arm

437
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:25,632
because of how cunning she is.

438
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,141
Long time no see.

439
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:35,809
How have you been?

440
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:36,894
Great, thanks to you.

441
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:40,439
Since you beat me everywhere
but the face to put me on camera.

442
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:41,565
Why are you here?

443
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:42,941
I'm not here to see you.

444
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:45,485
I came so I won't have to see you
ever again.

445
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:51,283
I hope you get my drift.

446
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,410
Let's not meet again.

447
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:05,130
Sorry about that.
That must have been unpleasant.

448
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:08,508
It wasn't fun, but I'm used to it.

449
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:11,303
It's also my job
to handle these things.

450
00:32:11,386 --> 00:32:14,514
And it's the reason
you need to earn well.

451
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:17,809
I understand.

452
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:21,855
I'll climb steadily
so this doesn't happen again.

453
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:32,032
What kind of life have you lived?

454
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,243
Even your own mother
isn't on your side.

455
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,334
Your past must be fascinating.

456
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:44,336
I'm dying to know.

457
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:47,756
If you keep this up

458
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:51,426
you'll only end up more upset.

459
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:58,308
- Are you worried for me?
- Yes.

460
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:03,605
Because I want you to keep working
in this field for a long time.

461
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:05,691
Worry about yourself.

462
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:09,403
I'm busy figuring out
what'll finally make me feel better.

463
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:13,407
Look forward to it.

464
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:28,922
SPECIAL GUESTS
AUTHOR YOON SEOK-HA, ACTRESS LENA

465
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:33,635
Hey, Lena.

466
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:37,055
This is the author
you'll be appearing with. Say hi.

467
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,935
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

468
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,271
You're really handsome for an author.

469
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,064
Thank you.

470
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,275
Do you have a girlfriend?

471
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,360
Or you had one?

472
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:52,779
Someone you can't get over?

473
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:57,492
I'm joking.

474
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,828
Do you want to grab dinner after?

475
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:02,706
No, thank you.

476
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,712
We'll bring you both in together
in five minutes.

477
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:14,843
CO-OFFENDER Y

478
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,928
"'Let me find the highest place.

479
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:20,390
Let every moment become a chance

480
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:22,559
to paint myself.

481
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:27,898
And let my finished portrait hang

482
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:30,984
at the very top of the world.'

483
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:33,862
This was her prayer

484
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:37,032
and I prayed it wouldn't be answered.

485
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:40,952
I prayed that the child
I failed to save

486
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,914
somehow escaped the savagery

487
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:48,293
and now rests in quiet days."

488
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:51,254
Okay, I got it.

489
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,173
Ah-jin, you must be hungry.

490
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:56,760
- Who was that on the phone?
- The agency.

491
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:58,428
There will be
a building inspection today.

492
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:01,098
Power's out from six o'clock,
so everyone's heading home early.

493
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:03,183
Great work, everyone.

494
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,893
- Great work.
- Thank you.

495
00:35:04,976 --> 00:35:07,187
You two were fantastic.

496
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,981
- The live reactions were amazing.
- That's great.

497
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:11,066
- See you next time.
- Yes.

498
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:12,526
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

499
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:15,946
If dinner's a no, do you like drinks?

500
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:19,366
- Hong-sik.
- Yes?

501
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:22,160
He's taking me home tonight,
so you can clock out first.

502
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:23,245
Okay.

503
00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:25,997
I can't drive.

504
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:28,041
Be my chauffeur.

505
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,418
Are you bored, or just naturally--

506
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:31,586
Naturally a psycho?

507
00:35:32,337 --> 00:35:33,547
Think whatever you want.

508
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:36,633
I'll wait on the first floor.

509
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:47,394
Hyang-i.

510
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:49,437
You must be tired.

511
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:54,860
Don't you have to take the car back
to the office after you drop me off?

512
00:35:56,194 --> 00:35:57,362
You know what?

513
00:35:58,321 --> 00:36:00,991
Just let me off there,
then go straight home.

514
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:03,535
It's fine. I'm okay.

515
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:08,373
And if I drop you off at the office,
how will you get home?

516
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:10,834
That's what taxis are for.

517
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,212
You said everyone left early, anyway.

518
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:16,673
You should go home and get some rest.

519
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:18,592
Should I?

520
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,438
HYANG-I

521
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:37,861
I'LL TELL HER
THE BUILDING WILL BE UNDER INSPECTION

522
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:40,238
Actually

523
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,741
I should swing by the office.

524
00:36:43,825 --> 00:36:46,244
I left something really important.

525
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:47,537
Mind if I go grab it?

526
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:50,540
I'm scared someone might take it.

527
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:20,862
Power's out from six o'clock,
so everyone's heading home early.

528
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:44,010
Wait here.

529
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:45,887
I'll be right back.

530
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:47,801
Looking for this?

531
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:50,970
BAEK AH-JIN MATERIALS

532
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:54,057
KANG LENA MATERIALS

533
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,350
Or this one?

534
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:00,397
Wow, you're sweating.

535
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:03,108
Did you walk all the way up here?

536
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:06,194
The central elevator runs
even in emergencies.

537
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:07,695
I guess you didn't know.

538
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:11,908
Anyway, thanks to that,
I beat you here.

539
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:14,202
Now, they're both in my hands.

540
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:30,135
Lena.

541
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:31,678
Lena!

542
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,891
You.

543
00:40:40,145 --> 00:40:41,896
Were you going to use these
to bring me down?

544
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:47,777
Hate to break it to you,
but you're the one who's screwed now.

545
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:50,822
Should we see
who really gets screwed?

546
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:00,039
Get on your knees and beg.

547
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,041
"Lena

548
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:04,544
spare me.

549
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:07,797
I'm sorry."

550
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,884
Do it.

551
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,511
Easy, right?
It costs no money or effort

552
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:15,054
as long as you swallow your pride.

553
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:24,022
I guess you're not desperate yet.

554
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,150
You want to keep your pride?

555
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:28,318
Then, how about this?

556
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:42,665
No wonder In-gang is fed up with you.

557
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,792
This fucking bitch.

558
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:46,586
What did you say?

559
00:41:48,796 --> 00:41:49,797
This psycho.

560
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:22,330
Let's go.

561
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:20,263
No need to be alarmed.

562
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:23,766
It was just a senior giving
an arrogant junior a lesson.

563
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:25,643
You call that a lesson?

564
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,729
Are you a Baek Ah-jin fan?

565
00:43:27,812 --> 00:43:29,606
You seem oddly concerned.

566
00:43:30,398 --> 00:43:34,527
Even if I weren't,
it wasn't normal behavior.

567
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:36,362
It sounds like you know her.

568
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:39,616
Do you know how insane she is?

569
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:42,702
She screwed me over
every chance she got.

570
00:43:43,578 --> 00:43:44,787
But today

571
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:46,831
I won.

572
00:43:57,258 --> 00:43:58,760
Are you sure you won?

573
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,012
You bet.

574
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:02,847
I feel great.

575
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,145
What are you doing on Christmas Eve?

576
00:44:11,731 --> 00:44:13,816
It's our agency's anniversary.

577
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,276
Come with me.

578
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:17,111
Why should I?

579
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:19,947
Actually, my ex is going.

580
00:44:20,323 --> 00:44:23,076
I want to make him jealous
and win him back.

581
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:24,661
Help me out.

582
00:44:27,538 --> 00:44:29,165
And Ah-jin will be there.

583
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,432
CO-OFFENDER Y

584
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:04,033
I like being in the spotlight.

585
00:45:04,617 --> 00:45:07,537
But I also love observing people.

586
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:14,168
Using and sharing emotions
is very fascinating.

587
00:45:14,252 --> 00:45:16,504
And I think I have a gift for it.

588
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:20,216
What do I treasure most? Myself.

589
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:26,848
I want to be a chameleon-like actress
who can turn into any color.

590
00:45:52,915 --> 00:45:54,000
Hello.

591
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:56,377
- Ms. Seo!
- Hi!

592
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:57,962
- Hello.
- Congrats.

593
00:45:58,045 --> 00:45:59,756
Thank you for coming.

594
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,300
We will now begin

595
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:06,220
Longstar Entertainment's
Seventh Founding Anniversary

596
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:10,224
and the 2021 Year-End Party.

597
00:46:13,144 --> 00:46:18,483
First, greetings
from CEO Seo Mi-ri and our guests.

598
00:46:19,192 --> 00:46:21,486
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

599
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:22,653
Thank you.

600
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:25,198
- Thank you very much.
- Congratulations.

601
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,366
- Congratulations.
- I appreciate it.

602
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,118
Thank you.

603
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:36,417
Hello, I'm Seo Mi-ri,
the CEO of Longstar Entertainment.

604
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:38,211
The year's already over.

605
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:39,295
Looking back

606
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:42,507
every single moment...

607
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:09,867
You take this without water?

608
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:40,940
Thank you for hanging in there
so well this year.

609
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:45,236
To everyone who's here...

610
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,292
Ah-jin.

611
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:11,053
Did you get home safely that day?

612
00:48:11,137 --> 00:48:12,847
It was a bit of discipline
from senior to junior

613
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,515
so don't take it personally.

614
00:48:14,765 --> 00:48:16,684
Don't worry, Lena.

615
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:20,396
Say hi.

616
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,316
He's the hottest name
in publishing now.

617
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:24,400
This is Yoon Seok-ha.

618
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:28,487
Come on. Say hello.

619
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:32,283
Hello.

620
00:48:32,992 --> 00:48:34,327
I'm Yoon Seok-ha.

621
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:37,914
And this is my junior actress,
Baek Ah-jin.

622
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:39,790
Nice to meet you.

623
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,336
This isn't your first meeting, right?

624
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,384
You saw each other last time.

625
00:48:52,136 --> 00:48:53,137
In the parking lot.

626
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:00,770
Thanks for earlier.

627
00:49:11,906 --> 00:49:15,117
Next up is a video reel

628
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:19,163
featuring seven years of Longstar's
growth through joys and sorrows.

629
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:20,748
Let's watch it together.

630
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:09,296
You're ignoring me.
If you had basic human decency

631
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,548
you wouldn't.

632
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:13,426
What else do you want me to do?

633
00:50:14,093 --> 00:50:16,053
I told you I had no choice.

634
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,061
Lena.

635
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:25,688
Lena!

636
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:31,068
Should we see
who really gets screwed?

637
00:50:33,988 --> 00:50:35,072
Get on your knees and beg.

638
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:49,211
Turn it off.

639
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,559
It was so realistic
that I almost thought it was real.

640
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:04,727
You must be startled.

641
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:08,481
This is how dedicated our actors are.

642
00:51:08,564 --> 00:51:10,691
Please give them a big hand!

643
00:51:33,172 --> 00:51:34,882
- Hyang-i.
- Yes?

644
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:36,926
What about after you get off work?

645
00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:38,803
Will you report to Lena?

646
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:45,226
That shackle file in Ms. Seo's desk.

647
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:47,144
Did Lena ask you to tell me about it?

648
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,688
Ah-jin, how did you--

649
00:51:49,772 --> 00:51:52,316
Exactly which parts
did she tell you to say?

650
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,860
I swear I didn't want to.

651
00:51:55,986 --> 00:51:58,197
I honestly didn't want to do it.

652
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,909
But she loaned us money when my dad
had stomach cancer surgery

653
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:05,454
and threatened me to pay it back.

654
00:52:05,538 --> 00:52:09,125
So, I'm supposed to go through
Ms. Seo's desk to find the file?

655
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:11,043
That's what she wants, right?

656
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:15,131
I'm on your side.

657
00:52:15,214 --> 00:52:17,550
You know I'm nothing like her.

658
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,761
If you're really sorry

659
00:52:22,012 --> 00:52:23,264
you start helping me now.

660
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:26,308
I fell into her trap

661
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:29,019
and you moved the way she told you.

662
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:48,164
Wasn't it fun?

663
00:52:49,748 --> 00:52:50,833
I thought it was.

664
00:52:55,337 --> 00:52:56,338
What?

665
00:52:57,464 --> 00:53:01,135
"Superstar Lena Gets Caught
Assaulting a Rookie."

666
00:53:01,218 --> 00:53:02,344
That can be the title.

667
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:04,555
If this video gets out

668
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:06,515
the public will go wild.

669
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:11,437
Massive reputation damage,
commercial penalty fees

670
00:53:11,812 --> 00:53:15,608
a lifetime of hate,
mockery, and insults...

671
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:20,196
- What else?
- Hey.

672
00:53:30,664 --> 00:53:31,790
If you don't want that

673
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:34,418
how about you kneel and beg?

674
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:37,588
Get on your knees and beg.

675
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:39,548
"Lena."

676
00:53:39,632 --> 00:53:40,758
"Ah-jin

677
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:42,676
I'm sorry."

678
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:44,053
"Spare me."

679
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:45,346
"Spare me."

680
00:53:47,097 --> 00:53:48,098
Say it.

681
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:51,560
You said it was easy.

682
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,270
It costs no money or effort.

683
00:53:53,354 --> 00:53:55,272
Easy, right?
It costs no money or effort

684
00:53:55,564 --> 00:53:57,066
as long as you swallow your pride.

685
00:53:57,149 --> 00:53:59,109
As long as you swallow your pride.

686
00:54:00,527 --> 00:54:01,528
Listen.

687
00:54:06,492 --> 00:54:07,952
You should see the look on your face.

688
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:14,291
I'm kidding, Lena.

689
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:18,087
As long as you don't bother me

690
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:21,173
I've got no reason
to post that video.

691
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:28,180
Let's get along from here on out.

692
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:43,946
Would you like one?

693
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:56,166
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

694
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:01,005
I always repay what I'm given.

695
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:04,425
I've been wondering
how to pay you back.

696
00:55:05,592 --> 00:55:08,095
And look where you are.
Perfect to get knocked off.

697
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:10,306
Ms. Baek Ah-jin.

698
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:14,018
I'll do everything
to convict you of this murder.

699
00:55:16,061 --> 00:55:20,107
Plenty of people here would love
to know your little secret.

700
00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:23,610
Get out.

701
00:55:23,694 --> 00:55:26,363
Have you checked in
on Choi Jung-ho lately?

702
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:36,415
You already forgot? He's the guy

703
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:38,167
whose life you fucked up.

704
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:41,086
A baseball bat to your dad's head.

705
00:55:56,727 --> 00:55:57,728
Ah-jin.

706
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,774
We need to wrap up. Come over here.

707
00:56:56,995 --> 00:56:58,455
NEWSHOUND HEE-KOOK
CHECK THIS PERSON OUT

708
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:04,962
Hey, Hee-kook.

709
00:57:05,587 --> 00:57:08,674
Baek Ah-jin looks like she got caught
and is being blackmailed.

710
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:10,259
Look into it.

711
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:14,680
Yes, she seemed to know the guy.

712
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:21,186
I'd like to thank Ms. Seo,
who believed in me

713
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:25,149
and to our agency family
as well as the senior actors.

714
00:57:25,732 --> 00:57:27,609
I'll work even harder.

715
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:31,196
To Longstar Entertainment's
boundless growth!

716
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,781
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

717
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:55,424
It's cold.

718
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:00,053
I'll get you something warm.

719
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:18,071

01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:30,459
My misfortune

721
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:33,629
turned into your commodity.

722
01:00:33,712 --> 01:00:35,464
I PRAYED THAT THE CHILD I FAILED
TO SAVE SOMEHOW ESCAPED THE SAVAGERY

723
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:57,402
You really missed me, didn't you?

724
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:06,578
It hurt...

725
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,248
a lot.

726
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,421
Of course, it did.

727
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:20,550
It also hurt me a lot.

728
01:01:23,845 --> 01:01:25,681
I thought you'd be at ease by now.

729
01:01:28,642 --> 01:01:30,227
I've always suffered.

730
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:35,732
I thought I had escaped

731
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:38,902
but I was always in the same place.

732
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:45,200
I'm sick of it.

733
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:01,425
Jun-seo.

734
01:02:02,759 --> 01:02:04,094
Help me.

735
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:11,143
I want to learn to love him.

736
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:14,020
Heo In-gang.

737
01:02:47,888 --> 01:02:52,100
DEAR X

738
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:13,575
