1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:54,011
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,432
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,828
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

5
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:21,163
I will. Thank you.

6
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:25,793
Are you all right, Mr. Choi?

7
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:28,545
Did you really ditch the shop
to go after that thief?

8
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:30,047
That was so brave.

9
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,757
Why do you keep going after
those guys?

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,760
- I'm fine. It was nothing.
- You should just become a cop.

11
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:36,011
Don't be so dramatic.

12
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,221
Go. I'm fine.

13
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:48,107
BASEBALL PRODIGY CHOI JUNG HO RETIRES
AFTER A STRING OF SETBACKS

14
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,943
FORMER BATTING TITLE CONTENDER
ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

15
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,530
I sometimes look back

16
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,200
on those moments just before
she opened the gates of hell.

17
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:07,042
Was Ah Jin's encounter with that man
just a coincidence?

18
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:10,671
Or was it fate?

19
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:13,882
- I'll see you next week.
- Take care.

20
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,302
I start work next week.

21
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:20,931
Isn't it a little too soon
to start a part-time job?

22
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:23,600
I just want to clear my head
for a while.

23
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:31,650
I found you a place.
Here's the address and the door code.

24
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:37,406
It's too far from my school,
so I'll be staying with a friend.

25
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,242
- The place is empty, so you can...
- No.

26
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,537
I'm going back to my place.

27
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,831
But he knows where you live.

28
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:48,792
He'll come looking for you again
and ask for money.

29
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,752
I'm going to give him the money.

30
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:55,591
If I pay him regularly,
he won't beat me up.

31
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,927
That's the best I can do.

32
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:08,729
Bye.

33
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:10,230
You're moving out?

34
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:13,692
Why are you doing all this for her?

35
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,027
Get a grip, Jun Seo.

36
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,654
She's not part of your life anymore.

37
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:19,948
You're the one who did this.

38
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:23,744
You're the reason I can't let her go.

39
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,454
What did I do?

40
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,122
When her dad tried to do
those awful things

41
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,457
you went along with it.

42
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,042
After he went to prison

43
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,128
you threw her out on the streets
in the middle of winter.

44
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:35,339
You did that.

45
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:40,719
I did what I had to do.
I had to raise you.

46
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:42,763
I was trying to take care of you.

47
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:48,810
Stop making excuses.

48
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,231
You were just another abuser to her.

49
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:55,817
Jun Seo, don't do this to me.

50
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,445
Jun Seo.

51
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:02,282
Jun Seo, I can't live without you!

52
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,077
Jun Seo.

53
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,995
This is all because of her.

54
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,081
That devil.

55
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,462
EPISODE 3: BREAKING THE SHACKLES

56
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:16,922
We begin with our top story.

57
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:18,757
Random killings are on the rise

58
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,927
alongside a recent wave
of stalking-related crimes.

59
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,804
In Nojeong-dong,
a string of murder victims

60
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:29,893
were all found to have suffered
ongoing stalking before their deaths.

61
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,603
Now for the weekend forecast.

62
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:34,648
Most regions will see daytime highs
approaching 30 degrees

63
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,275
as the heat continues
through the week.

64
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,249
If you've finished, turn it in,
and you're free to go.

65
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,875
- Okay.
- Okay.

66
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,093
Did you see that girl at the cafe?

67
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,886
- Yes, I saw her.
- She's gorgeous.

68
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,847
I know, right? She's a knockout.

69
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,932
- Do you want to go see her?
- Do you?

70
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,350
- Are you down?
- Let's go.

71
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,521
Enjoy your drinks.

72
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,899
Excuse me. Do you have a boyfriend?

73
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:19,776
Yes, I do.

74
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,278
How about trading him for this guy?

75
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,739
- He's good-looking and he's tall.
- Stop it.

76
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:27,242
- Stand up. He's almost 190cm.
- Dude, what's wrong with you?

77
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:33,290
I'm really sorry,
but my boyfriend's better-looking.

78
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:34,958
I see.

79
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,085
Okay.

80
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:41,965
Thank you.
Let me know if you need anything.

81
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,050
Sure.

82
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,057
How many times
have you been hit on today?

83
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,641
All the customers are guys.

84
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:53,643
"Do you have a boyfriend?"

85
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,479
Oh, right.

86
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:58,315
Your photos are on social media.

87
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,942
They're all over the internet.

88
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,671
SHE'S LITERALLY FLAWLESS
I'M SO JEALOUS

89
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:23,340
SHE'D OUTSHINE LE NA IF SHE DEBUTED

90
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:25,008
WHY ISN'T SHE A CELEBRITY ALREADY?

91
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,176
SHE'S GORGEOUS

92
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,476
Do you remember her?

93
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:38,146
Wait, isn't she the one
who turned us down

94
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,732
when we tried to scout her
a few years ago?

95
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:41,817
That's right.

96
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:43,860
Here she is again.

97
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:45,904
It looks like
she's not with an agency yet.

98
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,532
Check again, just in case.

99
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:52,285
Aren't you worried about your photos
spreading online?

100
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,080
Should I ask them to take them down?

101
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:58,792
Just leave it.
It's good publicity for the cafe.

102
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,754
You're really pretty,
and you've got a great attitude.

103
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:05,132
No wonder Mr. Choi likes you.

104
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:12,889
By the way,
what is he always watching?

105
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:15,976
You don't know?

106
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:19,146
He was the legendary .400 hitter
and home run king.

107
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,482
One swing and it was over.
It was an automatic home run.

108
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,901
That's right.

109
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,653
"One swing and it was over"?

110
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:27,737
Yes.

111
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,990
He was huge back then.

112
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,200
What's he doing here, then?

113
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,955
Kwak Eun Hyeok
went for a reckless slide

114
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,082
and Mr. Choi broke his wrist
trying to tag him out.

115
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,876
Three surgeries
and a year of rehab later

116
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,252
he still couldn't make a comeback.

117
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,545
That was the end of his career.

118
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:50,051
He ended Mr. Choi's career,
but everyone still cheered for him.

119
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:55,557
If I were him,
I wouldn't be able to watch baseball.

120
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:57,184
You'd think so, right?

121
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,437
Proud of you, my friend. Good job.

122
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,773
He roots for the guy who ruined
his career and calls him a friend.

123
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,902
Who knows what he's thinking?

124
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:10,739
Welcome.

125
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:12,449
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

126
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,994
- I come bearing good news.
- Hello.

127
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,624
Who's that?

128
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:23,376
He's Im Seung Yong, CEO of PB Agency.

129
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:26,505
Just between us

130
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,174
Mr. Choi might be signing
a new contract.

131
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,595
I really hope he makes a comeback.

132
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:41,728
- You came a long way.
- Thank you.

133
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,314
He's a good man through and through.

134
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,443
Why do you think

135
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:52,197
I met someone like him
at this point in my life?

136
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,160
Maybe he's your guardian spirit.

137
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:02,290
- My guardian spirit?
- Yes.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,212
Isn't it better to believe
guardian spirits exist?

139
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,717
If you think they're giving you
these trials for a greater purpose

140
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,096
it makes life a little easier.

141
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:22,727
If they really exist, like you said,
I wonder what their intention is.

142
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:31,444
Hello, this is Xanadu Coffee.

143
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,408
Did the girl working there
finish her shift?

144
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:38,577
Who's calling?

145
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:40,370
None of your business.

146
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:43,707
Can I get her number?

147
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,668
Excuse me.

148
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,004
You need to tell me
who you are first.

149
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,257
Also, I can't just give out
personal information...

150
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,556
Damn, what a lunatic.

151
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,640
Who was that?

152
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:03,727
Just another guy
asking for Ah Jin's number.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,522
At least be polite
if you're going to ask.

154
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,275
Ah Jin.

155
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:12,986
Yoo Sik and I
will throw that out later.

156
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:15,530
You should go home.
It's getting late.

157
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,157
It's okay. I can do it.

158
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,409
What if you miss the last bus?

159
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,120
Sir, we're closed.

160
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:24,456
We're closed for the day.

161
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,293
But your sign is still lit.

162
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,796
Sorry. Please come back tomorrow.
We have to lock up soon.

163
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,760
But I want to see her.

164
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:37,844
Where's Ah Jin?

165
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,305
- Has she gone home yet?
- Well...

166
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:44,559
Sir, please step outside.
You can come back tomorrow.

167
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:45,810
Why are you pushing me?

168
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:49,105
- We have to close up now.
- Can you tell Ah Jin that...

169
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,774
Sorry, sir.

170
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:53,276
Please come again tomorrow morning.

171
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,028
Sorry about that.

172
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:14,464
Did you move out?

173
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:17,300
I only helped since I didn't want you
living with your mother.

174
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,678
Don't expect me
to keep supporting you.

175
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:23,723
When I die,
you won't get a single penny from me.

176
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,393
I understand.

177
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:32,148
Writers barely make any money.

178
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:35,193
How do you expect to make a living?

179
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,989
You still can't kill
a single ant, can you?

180
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:43,159
Every living creature
has a reason to live.

181
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,413
You sound just like him.

182
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:50,208
Did you just laugh?

183
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:55,338
I was just glad to hear
I take after my dad.

184
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,465
Who else would you take after?

185
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:19,881
JUN SEO

186
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:42,946
Ah Jin?

187
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,531
Ah Jin.

188
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,961
What took you so long?

189
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:02,131
Do you know
what almost happened to me?

190
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:03,925
Ah Jin.

191
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:11,891
Are you okay?

192
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,269
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

193
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:15,770
Are you hurt?

194
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,438
Jun Seo.

195
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:18,523
Yes.

196
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:23,111
How far would you go for me?

197
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:30,952
Answer me.

198
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,955
How far would you go for me?

199
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:35,832
I'd do anything for you.

200
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,626
As long as it doesn't involve
killing someone

201
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:41,212
I'll do anything you ask me.

202
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:46,634
So you're letting your conscience
decide where the line is?

203
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:50,471
- That's not what I mean.
- Don't worry.

204
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:53,099
I never expected you
to go that far in the first place.

205
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:00,773
If you were brave enough
to kill a man for me

206
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,443
I'd have asked you
to start with Baek Seon Gyu.

207
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,453
You can kill anything
besides a man for me then, right?

208
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,630
Help...

209
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,381
Help me.

210
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,176
Please.

211
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:34,724
If you want to spare your life,
forget what happened tonight.

212
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:38,770
If you promise
to keep your mouth shut

213
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:40,855
I can call you an ambulance.

214
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,523
I won't say a word.

215
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:43,608
I promise.

216
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,152
There's a man injured
in the second alley

217
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:47,570
behind the Nojeong-gu townhouses.

218
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:50,740
It looks like a random assault.
He's losing a lot of blood.

219
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:43,793
Did you put the money
under the second flowerpot?

220
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:57,473
Hey.

221
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,519
She's easy on the eyes.

222
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,148
Get me a contact.

223
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,901
Put her in front of a camera
or ship her off to some island.

224
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,362
Just make sure it pays top dollar.

225
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:18,870
I might have to sell an organ
to pay off the interest.

226
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:23,207
I'm her father.
It's the least she can do for me.

227
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,919
I made that girl.
I brought her into this world.

228
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,880
She belongs to me.

229
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:32,425
I'll do whatever I want with her.
Got a problem with that?

230
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,470
Ah Jin.

231
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,566
What?

232
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:51,903
Were you going to push me off
this building?

233
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:54,697
Don't do anything stupid.

234
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:58,868
If you kill me, you'll be ostracized.

235
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,371
Your life will be over, you bitch.

236
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:14,175
You're pathetic.

237
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:17,678
I get you hate your old man,
but how dare you?

238
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,807
I can see right through you, bitch.

239
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:27,522
Next month, I want double the money.

240
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:35,548
Hey.

241
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:39,510
I'm saying this
out of old times' sake.

242
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:41,971
Stay away from that girl.

243
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,098
She's bad news.

244
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:47,435
Don't let her ruin your life, okay?

245
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,414
What did he do to you?

246
00:20:15,338 --> 00:20:16,422
Jun Seo.

247
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:19,592
Can you hit me?

248
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:21,093
What?

249
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,929
It has to look like
a stalker attacked me.

250
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:25,681
Just hit me a few times.

251
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,730
No.

252
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,649
I can't do that.

253
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:36,651
I won't.

254
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:38,527
You won't?

255
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,529
I won't.

256
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:43,449
Are you serious?

257
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:44,784
I should ask you that.

258
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:48,496
Are you seriously asking me
to hit you?

259
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:49,997
It's nothing new.

260
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,793
You've seen me get hit before.

261
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:56,837
That's exactly why I can't hit you.

262
00:20:56,921 --> 00:21:01,050
It tore me apart,
and it still haunts me.

263
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,395
Fine.

264
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:16,232
I won't force you to do it.

265
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:19,610
Jun Seo.

266
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:24,615
I don't care if you get hurt

267
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,702
but I don't want to be the one
who hurts you.

268
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:30,204
I don't want to lose you.

269
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:37,128
You know I don't treat you
like I treat everyone else.

270
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:47,930
Ah Jin.

271
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,225
Sometimes, you scare me.

272
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:57,481
But I think it's because
you weren't loved growing up

273
00:21:58,524 --> 00:22:00,359
so I don't know what to do.

274
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,532
Ah Jin.

275
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:11,704
I'll handle this.

276
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:49,742
Did something happen?

277
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:50,826
Pardon?

278
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,872
No, nothing happened.

279
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:56,457
It's just a little scratch.

280
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,709
You know you can tell me anything.

281
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:01,170
Don't bottle it up.

282
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:05,758
Believe it or not, I'm pretty strong.

283
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:09,095
I've never lost a fight before.

284
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:10,221
Okay?

285
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:15,142
You don't believe me?

286
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:17,144
I do.

287
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,189
I may be the boss

288
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:23,109
but you and Yoo Sik
are like family to me.

289
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:29,532
So whatever it is,
go ahead and use me, okay?

290
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,410
Use you?

291
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:36,997
That's right. Whatever it is.

292
00:23:38,124 --> 00:23:40,418
But you're my boss.

293
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:43,963
That's what bosses are for.

294
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:48,050
Since Jun Seo has classes
late at night

295
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,718
I worry about you going home alone.

296
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:52,179
You said it's just you
and your father, right?

297
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:55,516
Yes, but my father lives far away.

298
00:23:57,226 --> 00:24:01,063
I'd feel a lot more at ease
if your father lived close by.

299
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:03,232
What does he do?

300
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,068
He just works at a company.

301
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:07,695
He works the night shift.

302
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:11,282
WOMEN'S RESTROOM

303
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:18,998
Shit.

304
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:52,406
How much would we make
if we used an actress

305
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,492
instead of planting hidden cameras?

306
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:57,870
She's drop-dead gorgeous.

307
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:00,789
Yeah?

308
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:07,588
So I just need to drug her
and drop her off for a few hours?

309
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:11,217
Shit.

310
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,599
I found a hidden-camera offender.
I have proof, and I'm in pursuit.

311
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:39,995
You little punk!

312
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:44,083
If you hadn't called the cops
back then

313
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,585
I wouldn't have gone to prison!

314
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:51,840
My life is fucked up because of you!

315
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,301
Baek Ah Jin.

316
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:57,054
She's your daughter.

317
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:02,893
I brought her into this world,
so I'll do what I want with her.

318
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,604
Stay out of it.

319
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:25,708
She belongs to me
until the day she dies, you bastard.

320
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:28,168
Die!

321
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:22,640
Police! Step away!

322
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,894
You're under arrest for assault.

323
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:32,733
Sir, are you okay?

324
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:34,568
I think so.

325
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:39,990
Can you stand?

326
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:44,495
This way.

327
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:49,958
YEONGDONG POLICE STATION

328
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,336
So you two were step-siblings.

329
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:56,882
After your parents split up,
you kept stalking Baek Ah Jin.

330
00:27:57,841 --> 00:28:01,679
And when her father found out,
you threatened to kill him?

331
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:04,139
Ah Jin.

332
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:08,560
Do you have proof
that he's been stalking you?

333
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,020
Text messages, perhaps?

334
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:14,066
A few days ago,
he was hiding at my place.

335
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,531
And he did this to me.

336
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:27,121
No, this man was the one
who did that to her.

337
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:30,624
He collects hidden-camera footage
from restrooms and gambles illegally.

338
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:34,545
I spoke with Detective Jin Dong Gyu
so I could hand over the evidence.

339
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:37,715
He did reach out to us.
So do you have the evidence?

340
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:39,842
I do.

341
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:43,220
It's on my phone.

342
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,514
Looking for this?

343
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:23,635
Show me the evidence.

344
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:26,430
You said it was on your phone.

345
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:28,682
Show me.

346
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:32,603
If you filed a false report,
the charges will be even heavier!

347
00:29:42,237 --> 00:29:44,031
I'll be coming into some money soon.

348
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:46,867
I'll contact you,
so don't reach out to me until then.

349
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,620
You're not bluffing, right?

350
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:53,582
If I'm lying,
you can do whatever you want to me.

351
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:58,670
You've grown up. You really have.

352
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:02,216
Call me.

353
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:08,138
Damn it.

354
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:18,106
Detective.

355
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:23,737
May I have a moment with Jun Seo?

356
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,864
I'm afraid not.

357
00:30:25,948 --> 00:30:29,284
It's against protocol for the victim
and the offender to have contact.

358
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,912
Before all this happened,
we were siblings.

359
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:35,541
I only need a minute. Please.

360
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:45,551
What are you doing?

361
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:49,513
If we go with your plan
and pin him as a petty offender

362
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:51,306
he'll be out in a few years.

363
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,350
It won't change a thing.

364
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,395
Don't be reckless.
You can't beat him.

365
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,858
I said I'd handle it.

366
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:03,694
You should've smashed his head
with that brick.

367
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,779
But you hesitated.

368
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:09,032
That's why you can't beat him.

369
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,118
So stay out of it.

370
00:31:14,663 --> 00:31:16,832
Ah Jin.

371
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:18,500
Ah Jin.

372
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:35,809
Mr. Choi was
a professional athlete, right?

373
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,186
One swing and it was over.
It was an automatic home run.

374
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,938
"One swing and it was over"?

375
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,565
Don't do anything stupid.

376
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:45,485
If you kill me, you'll be ostracized.

377
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:49,156
You and Yoo Sik
are like family to me.

378
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,328
Whatever it is,
go ahead and use me, okay?

379
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:18,393
- Hey, Ah Jin.
- Good morning.

380
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:20,687
What happened to your face?

381
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,606
I fell.

382
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:26,652
You expect me to believe that?
That's not from a fall.

383
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:28,070
I'm okay.

384
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:32,491
Tell me the truth.
Who did this to you?

385
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:34,910
And that scratch on your neck.

386
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:37,079
Tell me what really happened.

387
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:38,288
Well...

388
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:41,416
The thing is...

389
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:45,337
I didn't say anything
because I didn't want you to worry.

390
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,425
But some guy has been following me
for a few days now.

391
00:32:52,052 --> 00:32:54,763
We had a bit of a scuffle last night.

392
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:56,056
Did you call the police?

393
00:32:56,515 --> 00:33:01,228
They said, unless he assaults me
or commits a crime

394
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:04,481
there's not much they can do
if the stalker denies it.

395
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:10,696
Jun Seo is staying with his grandpa
for a few days

396
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:12,489
so I am a little worried.

397
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:19,496
This won't do.

398
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,081
- Yoo Sik.
- Yes?

399
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:23,625
- Close up by yourself for now.
- What?

400
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,585
I'll take her home
for the time being.

401
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:28,547
- But...
- Thank you, Mr. Choi.

402
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,471
Take it.

403
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:38,724
What's this?

404
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:43,061
It's pepper spray. You might need it.

405
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:48,025
Thank you for looking out for me.

406
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:52,279
I hope you never have to use it.

407
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:56,616
Do you ever regret it?

408
00:33:57,409 --> 00:33:59,786
Regret what?

409
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:05,125
Helping someone
when it isn't really your problem.

410
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:09,296
Sacrificing yourself for no gain.

411
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:14,968
Forgiving and rooting for the friend
who ruined your career.

412
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:19,014
I don't know.

413
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:20,849
Do I regret it?

414
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:24,311
Not really.

415
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:27,856
I'm not the type to dwell on regrets.

416
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,442
It's just how I am.

417
00:34:34,696 --> 00:34:38,700
What if it backfires
and you end up hurting yourself?

418
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:42,871
I just follow my conscience.

419
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:46,583
I can't get anything done
when my conscience feels heavy.

420
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:52,047
Even if I end up getting hurt,
if that's the result of my choice

421
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:54,049
then so be it.

422
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:02,182
I hope you never change.

423
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:05,227
It's better for you that way.

424
00:35:07,687 --> 00:35:11,399
You're a good person.

425
00:35:15,654 --> 00:35:17,364
Hey, kiddo.

426
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:20,033
He's a good adult.

427
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:24,246
He's driven by justice
and willing to help others.

428
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,622
Is that a compliment?

429
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:29,042
He's the kind of adult
I need right now.

430
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:44,975
Thank you.

431
00:35:45,517 --> 00:35:47,018
You live here alone?

432
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:54,192
I'll get you a studio near the cafe.

433
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:56,111
You should move.

434
00:35:57,863 --> 00:35:59,865
You can't live here by yourself.

435
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,954
The rent might be higher,
but safety comes first.

436
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:07,497
That's a bit...

437
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:11,585
You don't need to worry
about the deposit.

438
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,547
Think of it as an advance
on your severance.

439
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:20,844
I appreciate your concern.
I'll think it over.

440
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:23,555
Okay.

441
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:25,599
Get home safely.

442
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:39,362
What's wrong? What is it?

443
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,323
Shoot.

444
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,242
What kind of psycho...

445
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,413
What's that?

446
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,290
YOU'RE NEXT

447
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:51,416
"You're next"?

448
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:01,551
Hey!

449
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:04,638
Ah Jin, go inside and lock the door.

450
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:33,833
Stop right there!

451
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:35,835
Stop!

452
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:56,690
What are you doing out here?

453
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,566
I told you to go inside
and lock the door.

454
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:02,696
You went after the stalker,
so I couldn't just sit still.

455
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:04,656
Are you okay?

456
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,491
I'm fine.

457
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:10,537
But I lost him.

458
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:13,581
It's getting late.
You should go home.

459
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:16,543
I can't leave you here alone.

460
00:38:18,044 --> 00:38:20,297
Let me at least take you
to a sauna or...

461
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,423
I'm okay.

462
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:24,509
I already asked a friend
to come over.

463
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:26,594
Don't worry.

464
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:29,556
You should go. I'll head in too.

465
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:31,599
All right.

466
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:26,321
I left a bat by your door.

467
00:39:26,404 --> 00:39:28,656
It's better to be safe than sorry.

468
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:32,118
Everything has its use.

469
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:39,501
Even small things, if used right,
can turn into an opportunity.

470
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:42,670
How about some beer
and fried chicken?

471
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:44,589
- I'm too full.
- What do you say?

472
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:45,757
Come on, let's go.

473
00:39:48,426 --> 00:39:49,719
I need to buy cigarettes.

474
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:52,931
Where are you going?

475
00:39:53,014 --> 00:39:55,225
Hey, it's Ah Jin.

476
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:08,571
Where do you think you're going?

477
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,865
- Wait, I know her.
- Let's hit the karaoke.

478
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,159
- I know her. Get off me.
- Let's go.

479
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:15,620
Come on.

480
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:17,997
- What are you doing?
- I'm not going home.

481
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:19,916
Hurry up.

482
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:22,544
Where's Ah Jin?
Has she gone home yet?

483
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:25,213
- Let's go!
- What's the holdup?

484
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:27,340
- Hurry up.
- I'm coming.

485
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:28,425
Let's go.

486
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:30,718
- What are you looking at?
- Hurry up.

487
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:23,688
I'll give you the money.
Be at my place by 8 p.m.

488
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:27,817
People only come to their senses
when they're scared.

489
00:41:33,698 --> 00:41:37,869
"Fortune may turn into misfortune.
Tread carefully."

490
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:41,080
What the hell? How annoying.

491
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:53,718
Morning.

492
00:41:54,928 --> 00:41:57,347
Ah Jin, someone's looking for you.

493
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:01,309
You know her?

494
00:42:10,443 --> 00:42:11,444
Hello.

495
00:42:13,738 --> 00:42:17,534
Ah Jin, are you sure
you don't want to give acting a try?

496
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:19,494
Why me?

497
00:42:20,828 --> 00:42:23,540
Aren't there tons of people
desperate to be actors?

498
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:26,626
You were born with something
others don't have.

499
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:29,087
Be honest with me.

500
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:32,215
You have thought about it,
haven't you?

501
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:36,094
You're right. You've been on my mind.

502
00:42:38,137 --> 00:42:40,890
But I can't right now.
I have to take care of something.

503
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:43,393
Can I ask you what that is?

504
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,105
It's a family matter.

505
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,693
If you're looking after
a sick family member, we can help.

506
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,280
No, it's something
I have to do myself.

507
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:57,740
Oh, well.

508
00:42:59,826 --> 00:43:01,661
That's a shame.

509
00:43:02,453 --> 00:43:05,164
But you seem set on your decision.

510
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:07,709
If you ever change your mind

511
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:10,336
promise you'll work with me,
not anyone else.

512
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,257
I'll treat you better
than any other agency.

513
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,134
I appreciate it.

514
00:43:16,718 --> 00:43:19,554
All right, then. I'll see you around.

515
00:43:26,853 --> 00:43:28,479
- Thank you for coming.
- Goodbye.

516
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:33,943
Should I get your autograph now?

517
00:43:35,236 --> 00:43:37,155
I turned it down.

518
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:38,281
Why?

519
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:40,742
You'll be famous and rich.
What's not to like?

520
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:43,244
I just like the way it is now.

521
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:47,040
Jun Seo better watch out.

522
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:50,126
His girlfriend might become
a superstar.

523
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:53,129
Girlfriend? I'm not his girlfriend.

524
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:57,884
You're not? Then what's the deal?

525
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:03,306
Still no guardian?

526
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:12,315
Nothing happened last night, right?

527
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:18,237
I was too scared,
so I spent the night at my friend's.

528
00:44:19,447 --> 00:44:23,534
But when I got home this morning,
my place was a mess.

529
00:44:23,618 --> 00:44:25,495
I think someone broke in.

530
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,670
Does Jun Seo know about this?

531
00:44:34,754 --> 00:44:37,507
I didn't want him to worry,
so I didn't tell him.

532
00:44:38,257 --> 00:44:40,176
I'll tell him
when he gets back tomorrow.

533
00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:41,761
I'm also thinking of moving.

534
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:44,514
- What about tonight?
- Tonight?

535
00:44:45,556 --> 00:44:47,225
I'll have to manage.

536
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:53,856
Then...

537
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:58,444
Let's do this.
Sleep at my place tonight.

538
00:45:00,321 --> 00:45:02,448
I'll sleep somewhere else.

539
00:45:03,616 --> 00:45:06,160
I can stay at my parents' house.

540
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:09,622
No, it's okay.

541
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:15,712
You don't seem to get it.
This could be really dangerous.

542
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:20,425
Don't you have a meeting
with your agent tonight?

543
00:45:20,508 --> 00:45:21,509
I do.

544
00:45:21,592 --> 00:45:23,928
I'll go to my parents'
after the meeting.

545
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:27,724
So stay at my place tonight.

546
00:45:29,892 --> 00:45:32,937
Jun Seo will be back tomorrow,
so just until then.

547
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:38,192
You should also reconsider moving
to a studio that's near the cafe.

548
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:40,319
I will, Mr. Choi.

549
00:45:51,122 --> 00:45:53,124
It's raining cats and dogs out there.

550
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,753
In movies, bad things happen
when it rains like this.

551
00:45:57,336 --> 00:45:59,505
You watch too many movies.

552
00:46:07,346 --> 00:46:09,098
What's wrong?

553
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,600
Nothing.

554
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:12,810
What is it?

555
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:20,109
I think I saw the stalker
in the beanie last night.

556
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:21,903
Where?

557
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:24,572
At a convenience store.

558
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:27,700
And he was with...

559
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,953
Who was he with?

560
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,261
What happened?

561
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:50,640
I'm sorry.
I didn't sleep so well last night.

562
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:55,311
Wait here. I'll grab some ointment.

563
00:47:03,611 --> 00:47:05,780
Didn't you say you had
a memorial service to get to?

564
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:08,366
Shouldn't you be on your way?

565
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:11,410
You're right. I should.

566
00:47:55,746 --> 00:47:56,956
To Gudeok-dong?

567
00:47:57,748 --> 00:47:58,749
Get in.

568
00:48:00,585 --> 00:48:02,545
It's Building A, Unit 504.

569
00:48:02,628 --> 00:48:05,298
I'll text you the door code.
Just punch that in and go inside.

570
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,550
Thank you.
Good luck with your meeting.

571
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:09,260
Text me if you need anything.

572
00:48:09,343 --> 00:48:10,344
Okay.

573
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:29,614
Sir.

574
00:48:29,697 --> 00:48:33,451
Could you take me to 13 Nojeong-dong
instead of Gudeok-dong?

575
00:48:44,712 --> 00:48:48,925
Mr. Choi, I need to stop by my place
to grab a few things.

576
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:57,767
What? Right now?
Are you going to be okay?

577
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,518
I would have gone with you, then.

578
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:06,817
It'll only take a minute.

579
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:10,404
I just need to grab my wallet and ID.

580
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:16,953
Ask the driver to wait
in front of your place.

581
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:19,497
Call me if anything happens.

582
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,615
I thought you ran off.

583
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:58,160
You told me to be here at this time.
What took you so long?

584
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:02,415
You must be mad I kept you waiting.

585
00:50:03,749 --> 00:50:05,710
You weren't the only one
who had to wait.

586
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:08,170
I've also been waiting
for this moment.

587
00:50:09,255 --> 00:50:11,173
Cut the crap and give me the money.

588
00:50:11,549 --> 00:50:13,676
I'll give you the money.

589
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:17,638
But can you put this on first?

590
00:50:18,973 --> 00:50:20,099
What's this?

591
00:50:20,182 --> 00:50:21,392
It's a gift.

592
00:50:23,227 --> 00:50:25,563
Ever since I was little

593
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,315
I used to wonder

594
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:33,529
how nice it'd be if we got along
and had a good relationship.

595
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:41,203
Now that I'm earning money,
I wanted to get you something nice.

596
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:45,166
I'll give you the money,
so put this on.

597
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:46,625
It's your birthday gift, Dad.

598
00:50:47,793 --> 00:50:49,003
You've lost your mind.

599
00:50:49,795 --> 00:50:51,255
Calling me "Dad"?

600
00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:53,883
What are you up to?

601
00:50:53,966 --> 00:50:55,718
Just try it on.

602
00:50:55,801 --> 00:50:58,220
It's not that difficult.

603
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:01,682
Just put it on for me.

604
00:51:02,183 --> 00:51:04,351
If you do that,
I'll give you the money.

605
00:51:11,692 --> 00:51:13,027
Did you put poison on this?

606
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:14,904
I'll put it on for you.

607
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:25,456
Dad.

608
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:32,797
You look so good.

609
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:36,842
It really suits you.

610
00:51:52,441 --> 00:51:55,736
All right. I put it on.
Now, give me the money.

611
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:16,090
You've changed.

612
00:52:16,423 --> 00:52:19,593
You used to be so spiteful.
Maybe you're finally growing up.

613
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:23,389
You need to toughen up.

614
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:26,892
You have to be ruthless to survive.

615
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:29,186
It's a cruel world out there.

616
00:52:29,728 --> 00:52:33,065
It can turn on you in a second.

617
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:08,893
You crazy bitch.

618
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,028
Did you actually think
I'd give you the money?

619
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:21,822
You'll just take the money and leave.

620
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:30,748
But you know what?
I need you today, Dad.

621
00:53:31,707 --> 00:53:34,793
Tell me. Do you want to kill me now?

622
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:41,842
If that's what you want,
I'll kill you.

623
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:43,135
You little...

624
00:53:45,304 --> 00:53:46,597
Come here.

625
00:53:52,853 --> 00:53:54,480
Did you have fun?

626
00:53:55,439 --> 00:53:57,399
You should smile. This is fun, right?

627
00:53:58,025 --> 00:53:59,193
Stand up.

628
00:54:01,028 --> 00:54:03,364
- Hey, Ah Jin.
- I'm calling the police!

629
00:54:03,447 --> 00:54:05,324
Go ahead. Call them.

630
00:54:05,407 --> 00:54:07,785
- Help!
- Hello? Ah Jin?

631
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:09,870
Ah Jin...

632
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:37,481
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message...

633
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:40,234
YEONGDONG POLICE STATION

634
00:54:42,152 --> 00:54:44,196
CALLING AH JIN

635
00:54:53,831 --> 00:54:54,915
Get over here.

636
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,543
MR. CHOI

637
00:54:58,043 --> 00:54:59,044
Shit.

638
00:55:08,053 --> 00:55:10,973
- This is the police.
- There's been a break-in.

639
00:55:11,598 --> 00:55:12,808
What's the address?

640
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:14,101
Nojeong-dong.

641
00:55:14,184 --> 00:55:15,561
Are you near Nojeong Station?

642
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,314
No, not near the station.

643
00:55:18,897 --> 00:55:20,566
Could you give me the exact address?

644
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:23,986
I don't know the exact address.

645
00:55:31,535 --> 00:55:33,078
I have to endure this.

646
00:55:33,162 --> 00:55:35,789
It takes ten minutes
to get here from the cafe.

647
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:39,501
I just need to hold on
for ten minutes.

648
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:45,090
Hey.

649
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:48,177
Hey...hey!

650
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,432
I won't let you die so easily.

651
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,976
I don't have the money in my hands.

652
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,062
Why did you have to piss me off?

653
00:56:02,483 --> 00:56:03,776
Damn it.

654
00:56:12,743 --> 00:56:15,996
What? Do you want some more of this?

655
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:21,502
I'll give you the money!

656
00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:43,357
Shit.

657
00:56:58,205 --> 00:56:59,206
Shit.

658
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:03,794
Damn it!

659
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:12,594
Fuck.

660
00:57:13,554 --> 00:57:15,639
Fucking bitch!

661
00:57:36,827 --> 00:57:39,913
Do I have to break your hand
for you to be a good girl?

662
00:58:37,137 --> 00:58:40,641
You were pretty
even when you were a baby.

663
00:58:46,939 --> 00:58:48,023
Cry.

664
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:51,485
Wah.

665
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:53,779
Come on.

666
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:58,492
Cry for me.

667
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,831
That's it.

668
00:59:14,049 --> 00:59:15,425
That's what I'm talking about!

669
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:19,721
Ah Jin wagered her life
in a gamble with God.

670
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:40,576
You crazy bastard! Get off her!

671
00:59:45,956 --> 00:59:48,792
Ah Jin, are you okay?

672
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:51,962
Fuck you!

673
01:00:00,971 --> 01:00:03,432
She's young enough
to be your daughter!

674
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:10,981
Ah Jin, are you all right?

675
01:00:11,648 --> 01:00:13,400
Can you hear me?

676
01:00:14,151 --> 01:00:15,444
Look at you.

677
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:21,074
You son of a bitch!

678
01:00:57,486 --> 01:00:58,987
And in that wager

679
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:02,741
God took her side.

680
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:25,305
My dad...

681
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,435
Please come and help my dad.

682
01:01:31,728 --> 01:01:35,065
He's bleeding so much.

683
01:01:36,566 --> 01:01:38,110
My dad...

684
01:01:38,735 --> 01:01:40,821
It's 13 Nojeong-dong, Nojeong-gu.

685
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:43,281
The rooftop house.

686
01:01:44,658 --> 01:01:47,202
Please save my dad's life.

687
01:01:51,456 --> 01:01:53,208
Please hurry.

688
01:02:17,232 --> 01:02:22,988
And so, she offered up a sacrifice
and broke free from her shackles.

689
01:03:19,044 --> 01:03:23,465
DEAR X
