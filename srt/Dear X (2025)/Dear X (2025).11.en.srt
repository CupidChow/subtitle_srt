00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,969
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:56,722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,390
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,310
Your husband...

5
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:35,844
Sung-hee.

6
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:55,883
Baek Ah-jin!

7
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:58,844
Ah-jin!

8
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,686
EPISODE 11: SAVE ME, MY GOD

9
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:14,902
Don't worry about anything
and get some more sleep.

10
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:50,979
Yesterday afternoon,
actress Baek Ah-jin was attacked

11
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:54,650
by her high school classmate,
Ms. Sim, who claimed to be a fan.

12
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,818
Baek was taken to the hospital
for treatment.

13
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:00,364
- While her life is not in danger...
- Sim Sung-hee. That bitch.

14
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:03,575
...she is said to be suffering
severe psychological shock.

15
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,785
Bitch!

16
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:07,287
The assailant, Sim,
suffers from schizophrenia

17
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,705
and has been receiving...

18
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:12,292
Actress Baek Ah-jin was attacked
by a female fan the same age as her.

19
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:14,002
What do you make of this?

20
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,337
It says the assailant was Sim

21
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,673
a former classmate
who suffers from schizophrenia.

22
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:19,049
And as soon as I read that

23
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:23,178
a case from 2023 that briefly
made headlines came to mind.

24
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,429
What case was that?

25
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,598
There was a classmate
who used the nickname "Simsim."

26
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:29,017
She posted an exposé on Ah-jin's past

27
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,811
only to delete it immediately.

28
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:32,688
Don't you smell something fishy?

29
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,773
- It smells very fishy.
- So it's not just me.

30
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,660
Yes, Ah-jin.

31
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:50,664
Other than the injured area,
the doctor says you're doing fine.

32
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:54,001
As for your movie,
I've coordinated things

33
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,586
so you can resume filming
once you've healed.

34
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,671
Are you okay with that?

35
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,299
It's not a serious injury.

36
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:05,053
If I take too much time off,
it'll only create unnecessary rumors.

37
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,472
I'll get back to work
after a short break.

38
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:10,642
About the crazy woman
who attacked you...

39
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,104
The police requested
a psychiatric evaluation

40
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,356
and the diagnosis was schizophrenia.

41
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:21,028
She'll be kept in a mental hospital,
so you won't have to see her again.

42
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,697
That's a relief.

43
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:27,326
So don't worry about anything now.

44
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:29,286
Just rest.

45
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:31,496
I'll take care of everything.

46
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:33,498
Okay?

47
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:35,500
Thank you.

48
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:38,128
I feel a bit more at ease,
thanks to you.

49
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,341
Good.

50
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:44,843
Let's talk again later.

51
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,730
I guess she misses me.

52
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:07,240
If you undergo laser treatment
every three to four weeks

53
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:10,202
the scar should become
barely noticeable over time.

54
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:12,204
The procedure takes
around 15 minutes.

55
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,791
Just relax your body
and stay comfortable.

56
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,602
I found Sim Sung-hee.

57
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:38,230
The classmate who stabbed your broom.

58
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:39,898
Here.

59
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:46,905
What happened to the reporter
who spread weird rumors on YouTube?

60
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:50,033
That's the thing. I looked into him.

61
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:53,161
But ever since that stream,
he's vanished without a trace.

62
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,663
Might've even left the country.

63
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:57,124
What? When did he disappear?

64
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,626
The day he live-streamed on YouTube.

65
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,711
And check this out.

66
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,381
Sim Sung-hee is being held
at Haemil Hospital.

67
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,508
You know Do-hyuk's ex-wife?

68
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,386
She was admitted
to that same hospital

69
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:11,847
after their divorce.

70
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:16,601
Wait a minute.

71
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:20,480
If I go to this Haemil place,
can I meet his ex-wife?

72
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:22,566
I'm afraid not.

73
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,069
No one's seen her
at the hospital for about a year.

74
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:29,239
So she's missing.
Gone without a trace.

75
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,074
Pretty much.

76
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:32,951
I pulled a few days' worth

77
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:35,787
of security footage
from Haemil Hospital.

78
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,956
I gave it a quick scan,
but nothing stood out.

79
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,877
NURSING RECORDS
NAME: SIM SUNG-HEE

80
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:48,300
MOON DO-HYUK, CEO OF SATURN

81
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:51,261
MOON PULLS OFF
ANOTHER MAJOR ACQUISITION

82
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:54,389
KNOWN FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE M&A STRATEGY
ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS

83
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,057
HE RECENTLY ACQUIRED HAEMIL HOSPITAL

84
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,843
What the hell is he doing there?

85
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:34,554
Have you thought about
what you want to do next?

86
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:38,475
Not yet. I'm planning
to think things through.

87
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:41,394
Good. You've got plenty of time.

88
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:48,693
To be honest,
I never liked you writing books.

89
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:52,030
People say that
artists starve for a reason.

90
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:54,241
You might get lucky
and write a bestseller

91
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:56,910
but there's no guarantee
it'll keep selling.

92
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:58,828
I think the same.

93
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:04,334
I've been cooped up at home
for too long.

94
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:07,712
Let's finish this
and get some fresh air.

95
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,219
Jun-seo.

96
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:18,723
Help me out here.
Which one looks better on me?

97
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:23,728
I think they both suit you.

98
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:24,813
Really?

99
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:30,569
It's exhausting
when everything looks good on me.

100
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,530
Having to choose is so tough.

101
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,411
We'll take both of these.

102
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:40,495
Sure.

103
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,958
I'll ring you up.

104
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,796
- He must be your son.
- He is.

105
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:52,549
You two look so sweet.

106
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,342
Thank you.

107
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:58,638
I never thought I'd see the day
my son spoils me like this.

108
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,266
Are you finally
trying to be a good son?

109
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,060
You seem to be in a good mood.

110
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:06,688
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

111
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:09,441
I knew you'd come back eventually.

112
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,568
You were just under her spell.

113
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:14,946
If not for that,
we would've gotten along just fine.

114
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,031
Don't you agree?

115
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,491
Do you honestly believe that?

116
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:19,743
Of course, I do.

117
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:24,039
Wait. Aren't you Mr. Yoon Seok-ha,
the author?

118
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,376
I'm Han Ji-gyu, a producer.

119
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:32,339
I've been trying to reach you,
but I couldn't get through.

120
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,549
I can't believe I ran into you here.

121
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:40,555
If you're done shopping,
may I have a moment of your time?

122
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,015
It won't take long.

123
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:45,352
- I'm here with someone right now--
- Son.

124
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:48,647
I'm fine,
so go ahead and talk to him.

125
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:50,857
He must be desperate
if he's doing this

126
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,567
in the middle of a department store.

127
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,403
I'll leave you two alone.

128
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,697
Thank you. I appreciate it.

129
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,617
See you at home.

130
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,623
I'm a big fan of your work,
Co-Offender Y.

131
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:09,417
How did you write something like that
at such a young age?

132
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,002
I was very impressed.

133
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:14,047
Every character in that book
has such depth.

134
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:17,634
But while reading your book

135
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:22,013
I couldn't help thinking
of the rumors about an actress.

136
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,391
- Rumors?
- Yes.

137
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:28,895
Recently, there have been rumors
about actress Baek Ah-jin.

138
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:33,733
You know she was recently attacked
by a high school classmate, right?

139
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,444
Hold on. She was attacked?

140
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,738
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

141
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:42,826
She wasn't seriously injured,
but the shoot had to be put on hold.

142
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:47,747
Anyway, after that attack,
rumors about her went viral.

143
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,712
Here.

144
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,547
THE SCARY TRUTH BEHIND TOP STAR B

145
00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:01,177
Your book lines up perfectly
with these rumors.

146
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:07,183
So I wanted to ask whether your book
was based on a true story.

147
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,107
If it's actually about Baek Ah-jin

148
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,943
we're considering covering it
on our show.

149
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:21,906
I'm sorry,
but that book is purely fiction.

150
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,868
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.

151
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,746
Please wait.

152
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,878
Was Ah-jin really attacked?

153
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:36,671
Did you just find out?

154
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,840
Is that why you called me?

155
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,675
It's in hundreds of articles already.

156
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,471
Why are you asking me
when you're the one who ghosted me?

157
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:45,722
She's not badly hurt, is she?

158
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,307
Are you worried about her?

159
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,642
If you really want to know,
ask me in person.

160
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,491
RUMOR HAS IT THAT TOP STAR B

161
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,951
HAS SHOWN SOCIOPATHIC TENDENCIES
SINCE CHILDHOOD

162
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:10,663
SHE MANIPULATES THOSE AROUND HER
TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS

163
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,250
THE SCARY TRUTH BEHIND TOP STAR B

164
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,481
Ma'am?

165
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:39,901
Do you need something?

166
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:43,947
I have a bad headache.

167
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,575
If I ask for alcohol,
you won't give me any.

168
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:51,079
So could you make me
a cup of tea instead?

169
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,666
I'll prepare it right away.

170
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,056
How many people have died
because of her?

171
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,892
She deserved to get stabbed.

172
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,602
Shameless bitch.

173
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:26,197
Ma'am, are you all right?

174
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,658
Here's your warm herbal tea.

175
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,918
Right. Thank you.

176
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:07,614
I was just drinking tea.

177
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:06,774
Ma'am.

178
00:17:08,484 --> 00:17:10,653
Why are all the doors broken?

179
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,867
The kitchen was a mess, too.

180
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,456
Don't you remember?

181
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:23,416
Remember what?

182
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,002
The doors to the study
and the kitchen...

183
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:28,880
You're the one who did that.

184
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:31,716
What are you talking about?

185
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,302
Do you really not remember?

186
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:38,222
You don't remember
a single thing you did?

187
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:28,022
She kept saying she wanted to kill me

188
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,357
so I divorced her.

189
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:35,446
Eventually,
she had a complete breakdown.

190
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,450
Now she's being treated
in a psychiatric hospital.

191
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:46,958
Maybe I treated her too well,
above her place.

192
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,434
Ma'am.

193
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,687
Ma'am.

194
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:12,900
Would you like to go
to the hospital with me?

195
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,113
Do I look insane to you?

196
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:20,992
No, that's not what I meant--

197
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,076
I must have...

198
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:25,997
I must have drunk too much.

199
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:29,375
I must have blacked out.

200
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:31,502
It's nothing serious.

201
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:35,506
So I don't need
to go to the hospital.

202
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,799
Don't worry.

203
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:41,429
I won't lose my mind.

204
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,268
I told you.

205
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,146
I'm not like her.

206
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:51,772
I'm different.

207
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,651
So don't mention
the hospital ever again.

208
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:58,112
You can tell Do-hyuk

209
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:02,283
that I got drunk and made a mistake.

210
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:04,202
That's what happened.

211
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,828
Understood?

212
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:06,913
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,992
INCOMING CALL

214
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:06,555
INCOMING CALL

215
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:39,422
Ah-jin, are you okay?

216
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:42,800
I was really worried
after reading the articles.

217
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:47,096
I'm so glad you're back on set
and filming again.

218
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:49,307
Thank you for worrying about me.

219
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:52,143
I'm so excited for this film.

220
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:55,438
With everything that's happened,
this might be our big break.

221
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:57,648
See you later!

222
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,991
Lord.

223
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,201
I spent...

224
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:14,874
every day drowning in my own tears.

225
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,461
I tried to let it all go

226
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,297
to forgive and move on.

227
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:26,135
Yet he lived on.

228
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,804
And I...

229
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:33,601
was left to suffer
in this agonizing Hell.

230
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:37,938
Is this

231
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:41,609
your answer?

232
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:03,547
Boss.

233
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,393
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

234
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:17,186
You called me.

235
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,941
What do you mean, I called you?

236
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,111
Wait.

237
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:27,530
You seriously don't remember?

238
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,074
What did I say on the phone?

239
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:33,619
You were really anxious.

240
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:35,830
You said everything felt wrong
and that you needed help.

241
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:38,416
You said Do-hyuk
was doing something to you

242
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:40,209
but you didn't know what exactly.

243
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:43,421
Do-hyuk was doing something to me?

244
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:51,011
I don't remember saying that.

245
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:56,934
Ah-jin.

246
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:58,978
Are you okay?

247
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:04,817
Everything you're going through...
The nightmares, the memory loss...

248
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,736
This is clearly connected to Do-hyuk.

249
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,947
I'm sure of it. This is his doing.

250
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,367
I looked into his ex-wife.

251
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:15,494
She lost her mind after marrying him

252
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:18,247
and ended up in a mental hospital
after the divorce.

253
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:20,624
Now, she's missing.

254
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,627
- She's missing?
- Yes.

255
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:26,046
I also looked into Sung-hee.

256
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,174
A few days before she attacked you

257
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:30,593
she told people
she suddenly had a lot of money.

258
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:34,263
She even bragged
that she had met Do-hyuk.

259
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:38,559
What are you saying?

260
00:24:40,394 --> 00:24:45,107
Sung-hee met Do-hyuk
before attacking me?

261
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,860
Do you know
which mental hospital she's in?

262
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,531
Haemil Hospital.

263
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,952
Do-hyuk acquired it a few years ago.

264
00:24:57,036 --> 00:24:58,662
You think that's all a coincidence?

265
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:00,206
But Ah-jin...

266
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:05,878
Do you think your marriage is
a blessing or a curse?

267
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:08,339
Your husband...

268
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:14,303
So what if it isn't a coincidence?

269
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,306
What am I supposed to do?

270
00:25:18,974 --> 00:25:20,059
Divorce him?

271
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:21,852
I can't.

272
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:23,938
I won't.

273
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:25,731
Why not? Why won't you?

274
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:28,359
- You could be in danger--
- Do you know what I did

275
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:29,944
to get here?

276
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:32,780
Everything I have,
I fought for with everything in me.

277
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:34,698
If I divorce him,
it all comes crashing down.

278
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:36,158
You want me to go back?

279
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:39,328
Back to people throwing eggs
and pointing fingers?

280
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:40,913
- Ah-jin.
- No.

281
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,167
No. I don't want that.

282
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:47,586
Why do I always have to suffer?

283
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,630
Why only me?

284
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:53,384
Why do I have to suffer?

285
00:25:55,594 --> 00:25:57,721
All right. I understand.

286
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,692
I just want to live.

287
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,950
I want to protect
everything I've achieved.

288
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,411
I don't want to lose...

289
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:24,164
any of it.

290
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:27,543
Okay.

291
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,130
I'll help you.

292
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:37,261
Look at me.

293
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:40,306
If divorce isn't an option

294
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:43,559
we just have to put a leash on him

295
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:46,478
so he can't mess with you again.

296
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,606
Right?

297
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:46,807
I let it slide
when you broke the study door.

298
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,393
But this time, I need an explanation.

299
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:52,479
Why did you do it?

300
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:54,898
You even hurt your hand.

301
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:08,370
It doesn't look like you drank.

302
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,248
Is something bothering you?

303
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:19,256
Are you still scared that
Sim Sung-hee might come back?

304
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,009
It's not that.

305
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:24,303
Then...

306
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:28,766
are you dissatisfied

307
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:31,393
with our marriage?

308
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,817
That would hurt my feelings.

309
00:29:43,655 --> 00:29:45,407
Because I really like you.

310
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:49,411
I want you...

311
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,999
to rely on me more.

312
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,130
I already am relying on you.

313
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:06,261
You don't want me
to become a helpless fool

314
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:09,056
who can't do anything
without you, do you?

315
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:17,981
If I become someone
indispensable in your life

316
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:20,609
I'd be honored.

317
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:27,533
Anyway, will you be able
to shoot tomorrow?

318
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:30,035
I'm worried.

319
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,538
Maybe I should get you
some herbal medicine.

320
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:38,877
Of course, I can. I'm not badly hurt.

321
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:44,049
Good.

322
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:49,513
But I'm still worried,
so I'll stop by the set tomorrow.

323
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:52,057
And I'll drive you home afterward.

324
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,809
Is that okay?

325
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:31,889
Long time no see.

326
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:36,351
- You doing all right?
- How is Ah-jin?

327
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:37,853
You're unbelievable.

328
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:40,522
If you were so worried,
why are you showing up now?

329
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:43,525
She's in danger.

330
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,777
What do you mean, she's in danger?

331
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:47,154
It's her husband.

332
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,324
Do-hyuk, that bastard,
is completely insane.

333
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:51,909
He's shady in more ways than one.

334
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:54,202
I think Ah-jin fell into his trap.

335
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:57,706
Do you have proof
for what you just said?

336
00:31:57,789 --> 00:31:58,916
That's the problem.

337
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:01,752
I don't have any evidence
to prove that he's nuts.

338
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:05,881
Ah-jin called me not long ago,
saying something felt off about him.

339
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,634
But she doesn't even remember
making that call.

340
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:11,303
That's why you and I
need to help her.

341
00:32:11,386 --> 00:32:12,888
Do you get what I'm saying?

342
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:15,766
I'm not sure.

343
00:32:17,142 --> 00:32:19,394
It feels like we'd be interfering
with her life.

344
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:21,730
What part of what I just said
did you not understand?

345
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:22,856
Her husband--

346
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,025
You just said you had no proof.

347
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:28,028
Maybe you're the one
getting dragged around by her.

348
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:29,655
What?

349
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:30,781
You know how she is.

350
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:32,824
She's not easily satisfied.

351
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,455
She's living comfortably now,
and I don't want to disrupt that.

352
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:43,210
We don't fucking know
how she's living right now!

353
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:44,294
Jae-oh.

354
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:48,048
You think she's doing well?

355
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:50,634
Sure. Her life is fucking perfect.

356
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:54,930
Then why is she losing weight
and having nightmares every night?

357
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:59,935
She's trembling in fear because
she can't remember what she said!

358
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:02,104
- You need to calm down.
- Let go of me.

359
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:06,066
Fine. I'll handle this alone.

360
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:08,318
You can stay out of this, asshole.

361
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:11,196
Fucking jackass.

362
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:22,582
If divorce isn't an option

363
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,044
we just have to put a leash on him

364
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:28,296
so he can't mess with you again.

365
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,051
Hi, Ah-jin.

366
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:35,762
There's been a change in the script.
See you soon.

367
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,109
Director.

368
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:52,821
Why was the script changed?

369
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:55,907
We just had to change it
all of a sudden.

370
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:36,990
Ah-jin.

371
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:39,117
Have you been well?

372
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:43,622
You've really grown.

373
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,334
I missed you.

374
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:52,839
Ah-jin, are you okay?

375
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,050
Ah-jin?

376
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:58,053
Is there a problem?

377
00:34:58,845 --> 00:34:59,846
No.

378
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:15,153
Ready, action.

379
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,312
Cut. Let's go again.

380
00:35:56,194 --> 00:35:58,738
Ready, action.

381
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,718
Cut.

382
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:23,805
I'm sorry. I'll do that again.

383
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:30,353
Ready, action.

384
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,474
I need a short break.

385
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:15,273
Come on.

386
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,069
You weren't the one who killed him.

387
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:24,032
You can do this.

388
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:25,951
Yes, you can.

389
00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:41,800
Let's go again. I'm ready now.

390
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:43,718
Sure, okay.

391
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:45,053
ACTRESS BAEK AH-JIN

392
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:46,263
Get ready, guys.

393
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:48,306
- We're ready.
- Ready.

394
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:50,308
Action.

395
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:28,054
Ah-jin!

396
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:29,389
Ah-jin.

397
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:45,780
Cut!

398
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:49,034
Cut.

399
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:52,912
Go and stop her!

400
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,040
Ah-jin!

401
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,293
Check if he's okay.

402
00:38:58,376 --> 00:38:59,586
Su-hoon, are you okay?

403
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:01,880
Wake up.

404
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:02,964
Excuse me...

405
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:04,049
Is he okay?

406
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,427
Su-hoon, are you all right?

407
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:48,051
ACTOR HWANG SU-HOON
CRITICALLY INJURED DURING FILMING

408
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:50,387
THE CAMERAS STOPPED ROLLING,
BUT SHE DIDN'T

409
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,639
BAEK AH-JIN IS CRAZY
VS IS BEING IN CHARACTER A CRIME?

410
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:53,848
MIXED REACTIONS ONLINE

411
00:39:55,016 --> 00:39:57,685
Director, let me ask you one thing.

412
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,773
That rooftop house scene
wasn't in the original script.

413
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,067
Why was it suddenly changed?

414
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,488
The investor suddenly threatened
to pull their funding

415
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:10,448
and started making strange demands.

416
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:11,533
The investor?

417
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:12,909
Saturn.

418
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:15,161
The company your husband runs.

419
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:18,415
Ma'am?

420
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:20,917
Ma'am.

421
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,628
Mr. Moon just stepped out.

422
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:25,088
Where did he go?

423
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:27,382
He went to work out.

424
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:51,614
You got here earlier than I expected.

425
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:58,580
Why did you have the script changed?

426
00:40:58,663 --> 00:40:59,664
Right.

427
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:02,000
I already told you.

428
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:05,753
I want you to rely on me completely

429
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:08,047
but you clearly have
no intention of doing that.

430
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,553
Turns out

431
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:15,972
I have to push you this hard

432
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:19,476
for you to come running to me.

433
00:41:20,602 --> 00:41:21,603
Figures.

434
00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:25,607
I guess leaking those cheap
tabloid articles wasn't enough.

435
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,068
So those articles were your doing.

436
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:31,571
Why are you doing this to me?

437
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:38,536
I gave you everything you wanted,
didn't I?

438
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:43,791
The least you can do
is make me happy in return.

439
00:41:45,376 --> 00:41:47,086
I've always done my best for you.

440
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:49,589
This is really hurtful.

441
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:57,931
Take those articles down now.

442
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:00,558
If I take them down

443
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:05,438
does that mean you'll behave
the way I want you to?

444
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:08,399
Why should I live my life
the way you want?

445
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:11,694
Because I like you.

446
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:21,246
Unfortunately,
my ex-wife broke too easily

447
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:24,040
for all the effort I put into her.

448
00:42:24,499 --> 00:42:27,669
But I feel like
you will stay by my side

449
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:30,255
with that pretty face of yours.

450
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:35,760
You'll keep me entertained,
just like you always have.

451
00:42:36,135 --> 00:42:38,888
That's why I took you in
when you were so pitiful.

452
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:43,476
Fuck you.

453
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:51,901
You son of a bitch.

454
00:42:57,657 --> 00:42:58,700
If you feel wronged...

455
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:02,996
Right. Think of it as punishment.

456
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:04,539
"Punishment"?

457
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,207
You said it yourself.

458
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,586
I thought I was being punished.

459
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:12,630
Why do you think
you're being punished?

460
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:18,678
When my mom begged me to save her

461
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:21,055
I just stood there and watched.

462
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:24,142
I thought all of this
was punishment for that.

463
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:31,441
You don't remember?

464
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:34,152
Is this a dream?

465
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:36,613
You didn't come to me before.

466
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:39,782
You acted as if
you'd never see me again.

467
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:42,744
Of course, this is a dream.

468
00:43:44,037 --> 00:43:45,204
When you wake up

469
00:43:46,414 --> 00:43:47,957
you won't remember any of this.

470
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:52,045
So?

471
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:55,923
Is it starting to come back to you?

472
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:02,263
Ah-jin,
I have plenty of ways to corner you.

473
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:04,974
Your past could be exposed
at any time.

474
00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:07,727
And when that happens,
that fall is going to hurt.

475
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:14,776
That's the end of my patience.

476
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:18,488
If you don't want to lose
everything I've given you...

477
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:21,532
If you want to stay
right where you are

478
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:27,121
then I'm sure you know
exactly what you have to do.

479
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:35,797
Ah-jin.

480
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:38,675
You're a smart girl.

481
00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:23,219
Shit.

482
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,935
This is Moon Do-hyuk.

483
00:45:31,018 --> 00:45:32,478
You know who I am, right?

484
00:45:32,895 --> 00:45:35,606
What is this about?
How did you get my number--

485
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,025
My wife isn't doing so well right now

486
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:40,653
so I'd like you
to look after her for me.

487
00:45:43,114 --> 00:45:44,949
I'm a little tired after my workout

488
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:47,577
so I'm thinking of sleeping
at a hotel tonight.

489
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:49,495
Where is Ah-jin right now?

490
00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:52,081
Just come to the address
I'm sending you.

491
00:46:10,558 --> 00:46:11,559
Ah-jin.

492
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,020
You...

493
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:30,077
Let's get you out of here.
You'll catch a cold.

494
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,378
Jun-seo.

495
00:46:43,257 --> 00:46:45,343
Do you know what I realized today?

496
00:46:50,264 --> 00:46:51,349
I realized...

497
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:55,937
I could still be thrown away.

498
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:04,445
After all I've done...

499
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:08,783
After all I've done to climb up here

500
00:47:10,368 --> 00:47:14,497
how can I still be someone
who gets thrown away?

501
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,333
How is that even possible?

502
00:47:19,085 --> 00:47:22,046
Ah-jin, you need to calm down.

503
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,050
This is so humiliating!

504
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,189
I'm going to take it.

505
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:42,817
I'm going to take Do-hyuk's position.

506
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:47,363
I'm going to get rid of him
and take his place.

507
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:50,199
I can do it.

508
00:47:50,283 --> 00:47:51,325
Right?

509
00:47:52,243 --> 00:47:55,830
Jun-seo, help me. Please?

510
00:47:55,913 --> 00:47:58,875
This is the man who had his ex-wife
locked up in a mental hospital.

511
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:01,669
He tracked down my number
and called me to come get you.

512
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:04,422
You know exactly how dangerous he is.

513
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:05,840
So what?

514
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:09,594
- What about it?
- You're the one who will break!

515
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:12,471
You're going to break before he does.

516
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:14,807
Why don't you see
how dangerous he really is?

517
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,100
It's not fair.

518
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:20,938
Why is he allowed to do
whatever he wants, and I'm not?

519
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,066
Why am I always the one
who has to suffer?

520
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:29,196
Why am I the only one
who has to fear hitting rock bottom?

521
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:32,742
Why?

522
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:37,038
Why?

523
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:41,959
I can do it.

524
00:48:44,795 --> 00:48:45,880
I've got this.

525
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:47,548
Right?

526
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:51,385
I will...

527
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,055
I'll get rid of that jerk.

528
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:33,427
Why did I...

529
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:55,992
Ah-jin, what's going on?
Are you okay?

530
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:57,535
Where are you?

531
00:49:57,618 --> 00:49:58,953
Jae-oh.

532
00:50:00,913 --> 00:50:02,748
I can't hold on anymore.

533
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,211
Ah-jin.

534
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:10,047
Don't worry.
I'm going to fix everything.

535
00:50:11,549 --> 00:50:12,717
I'm ready.

536
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:22,059
Jae-oh.

537
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:27,314
Why do you do all this for me?

538
00:50:32,903 --> 00:50:35,156
You don't expect anything from me.

539
00:50:39,493 --> 00:50:42,705
And you do whatever I ask you to.

540
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:49,003
It feels strange.

541
00:50:52,173 --> 00:50:53,591
I don't understand it.

542
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,640
I just like being by your side.

543
00:51:03,684 --> 00:51:06,020
Maybe it's because
I don't have much in my life

544
00:51:07,563 --> 00:51:09,106
but you're everything to me.

545
00:51:13,944 --> 00:51:16,238
Every time I help you
get what you want...

546
00:51:17,615 --> 00:51:20,159
Every time I make things
easier for you...

547
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:24,830
you have no idea how useful I feel.

548
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,253
So go ahead, Ah-jin.

549
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,131
Use me all you want.

550
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:36,801
That's what I want.

551
00:52:03,911 --> 00:52:07,164
You've finished your IV drip.
Let me take it out for you.

552
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:11,877
All done, ma'am.

553
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,237
You seem to be doing better today.
That's a relief.

554
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:40,447
Do I?

555
00:52:42,324 --> 00:52:43,701
Why is that a relief, though?

556
00:52:44,285 --> 00:52:47,371
After what happened
during the last shoot...

557
00:52:47,454 --> 00:52:48,455
What happened?

558
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:50,916
I don't really remember.

559
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,211
It's best not to dwell
on the unpleasant things.

560
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,882
Forget what happened,
and good luck on your last shoot.

561
00:53:04,513 --> 00:53:05,598
Hi, Do-hyuk.

562
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,322
Is today your last shoot?

563
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:22,740
Yes.

564
00:53:23,324 --> 00:53:26,702
I'm going on a business trip tonight,
so I won't have time later.

565
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,954
But I wanted to congratulate you.

566
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:31,999
Thanks.

567
00:53:41,425 --> 00:53:42,635
Do you feel all right now?

568
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,511
What do you mean?

569
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:46,931
You were mad at me last night.

570
00:53:47,973 --> 00:53:49,350
I kept thinking about it.

571
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:51,810
When we were at the swimming pool,
you called me

572
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:54,271
a son of a bitch.

573
00:53:56,106 --> 00:53:57,274
It was pretty intense.

574
00:54:00,736 --> 00:54:01,820
What's wrong?

575
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,697
You must have dreamed that.

576
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:06,784
When did I go
to the swimming pool with you?

577
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:12,873
You don't remember?

578
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:21,548
Do-hyuk, are you teasing me?

579
00:54:22,716 --> 00:54:25,344
I would never say something
that awful to you.

580
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:28,764
You were the one who held my hand
when I was struggling the most.

581
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,309
Get out.

582
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:15,227
Get out of the car, asshole!

583
00:55:20,607 --> 00:55:22,609
You didn't get hurt
as badly as I'd hoped.

584
00:55:23,277 --> 00:55:24,278
What a shame.

585
00:55:24,653 --> 00:55:26,322
What the hell? Who are you?

586
00:55:28,657 --> 00:55:30,617
You know me, right? Kim Jae-oh.

587
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:33,662
I'm the guy you tried to burn alive
when you set my office on fire.

588
00:55:36,707 --> 00:55:38,459
I almost died that day.

589
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:41,754
So I'm here to return the favor.

590
00:55:47,301 --> 00:55:49,470
I don't know
what you're talking about

591
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,639
but if you value your life,
you'd better drop that idea.

592
00:55:53,057 --> 00:55:54,099
No, thanks.

593
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:56,352
I know everything now.

594
00:55:57,936 --> 00:56:00,439
You're the one with the cross tattoo.

595
00:56:00,522 --> 00:56:01,940
Who was the other one?

596
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:04,276
Moon Do-hyuk.

597
00:56:04,943 --> 00:56:06,528
The obnoxious psycho.

598
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,325
I'll make both your lives
a living hell

599
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:13,243
until the day I die.

600
00:56:14,953 --> 00:56:15,954
How does that sound?

601
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:17,873
Fun, right?

602
00:56:27,716 --> 00:56:28,759
See you around.

603
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:54,410
Yes, go ahead.

604
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:56,078
Sir, we have a problem.

605
00:56:56,453 --> 00:56:57,496
What problem?

606
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:59,039
Kim Jae-oh came to see me.

607
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:02,876
He said he knew everything
about the fire and threatened me.

608
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,629
He even warned me
that he would repay the favor.

609
00:57:06,547 --> 00:57:07,548
So?

610
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:10,217
It looks like
he'll come after you too.

611
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:13,846
Should we eliminate him for good?

612
00:57:14,805 --> 00:57:18,642
Some people don't know their place,
even when we treat them gently.

613
00:57:19,059 --> 00:57:21,645
They never appreciate
how lenient we are.

614
00:57:21,728 --> 00:57:24,857
Take care of Kim Jae-oh
however you want.

615
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,944
Just make sure
I never hear about him again.

616
00:57:29,236 --> 00:57:30,529
I don't want his name

617
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:34,950
ruining another meal with my wife.

618
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:37,995
Get to it, then.

619
00:57:55,804 --> 00:57:57,055
Wait, hold on.

620
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,726
- Come on.
- Seriously.

621
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:02,394
Why do you look so ugly today?

622
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:03,812
Which lane? I'm going jungle.

623
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:05,564
- I'm going jungle.
- Me too.

624
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:07,024
The worst player buys ramyeon.

625
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:10,486
- All right.
- Sounds good.

626
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:11,820
I'm right below Seung-jae.

627
00:58:11,904 --> 00:58:14,114
- I'm safe.
- Isn't Yun-ho the worst, though?

628
00:58:14,198 --> 00:58:16,617
- What are you talking about?
- He's the worst.

629
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,784
That's right, kid.

630
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:20,329
Just keep living like you are now.

631
00:58:21,288 --> 00:58:24,291
Eat well, hang out with your friends

632
00:58:25,042 --> 00:58:28,462
get your diploma
and get into a good college.

633
00:58:29,713 --> 00:58:31,924
- He's the worst jungler.
- Come on.

634
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:37,888
You don't need me anymore.

635
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:40,432
No, he's better.

636
00:58:54,863 --> 00:58:55,864
Hey.

637
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:57,950
We're all set over here.

638
00:58:58,033 --> 00:58:59,535
Okay, thank you.

639
00:58:59,826 --> 00:59:00,953
By the way

640
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:03,705
you set everything up
exactly the way I asked, right?

641
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:05,499
I told you not to worry.

642
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,627
Why are you always so suspicious?

643
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,836
Don't you trust me?

644
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:12,422
It's not that.

645
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:14,508
It's just that
this is really important.

646
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:16,385
Anyway...

647
00:59:17,636 --> 00:59:18,720
Thank you.

648
00:59:56,216 --> 00:59:57,217
Damn it.

649
00:59:57,968 --> 00:59:58,969
Get him!

650
01:00:00,095 --> 01:00:01,597
- Get him!
- Get him!

651
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,681
Stop him!

652
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:05,017
- Get him!
- Catch him!

653
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,019
Ready, action.

654
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:14,693
Open the door.

655
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:17,696
Why is it always so loud in there?

656
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:21,950
I'm settling this today

657
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,244
so stop acting like you're not home
and open up.

658
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:27,331
I knew it.

659
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:30,667
I knew you were home.

660
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:32,753
Why aren't you answering...

661
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:35,088
Oh, my gosh!

662
01:02:01,842 --> 01:02:04,177
Please stop. I beg you.

663
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,326
- Grab him.
- Come here, you bastard!

664
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:56,396
I'll help you get to heaven.

665
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:16,726
DEAR X
