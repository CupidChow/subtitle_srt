1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,969
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:56,889
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:58,515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:03,979
EPISODE 9: NEW HEIGHTS

5
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:07,775
Longstar Entertainment released
an official statement today

6
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,193
announcing that it has terminated

7
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,195
its exclusive contract
with actress Baek Ah-jin

8
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:13,113
effectively ousting her
from the agency.

9
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:14,448
According to Longstar

10
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:18,035
the decision was made
after determining that the trust

11
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:20,871
between the two parties
could no longer be restored.

12
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:24,208
Some speculate that
this may effectively put a halt

13
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,336
to Baek Ah-jin's acting career.

14
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:31,381
Baek Ah-jin has not issued
any public statement

15
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:33,675
and attention now turns to
her next move.

16
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:38,847
Think about it, Mr. Cha.

17
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,934
Why pick up an actress
I've already used and tossed aside?

18
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:46,730
Your company just went public,
so you might want to be more careful.

19
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,316
You must have read the articles.

20
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:54,947
Why do you think I cut her loose?

21
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:58,742
Something big is about to blow up.

22
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,830
So don't even think about
waving a contract at Baek Ah-jin.

23
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,457
Just focus on the people
you already have.

24
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,253
This isn't friendly advice.
It's a warning.

25
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:20,639
You're early.

26
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:25,602
What's with that look?

27
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,522
Do you want to shove me
off this rooftop?

28
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:30,858
Did you have to take it this far?

29
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:34,027
Isn't it nice and cool up here?

30
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:38,824
Figured a little cold breeze
might slap some sense back into you.

31
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,534
So?

32
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,162
Is reality sinking in?

33
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,622
I just don't get it.

34
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,002
All this for In-gang?

35
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:51,837
I've thought about it.

36
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:55,007
About where it all went wrong.

37
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,761
If I hadn't reached out to you
in the first place...

38
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:03,265
If you and In-gang had never met...

39
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:08,854
Would he still be alive?

40
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:11,106
When I told you I was dating him

41
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:13,942
you knew what could come of it.

42
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,571
But you turned a blind eye

43
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:19,865
because the agency
was cashing in on us.

44
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,284
That was you.

45
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,828
So why am I doing this now?

46
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:26,663
I'm not sure.

47
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,001
I'm trying to figure out
how to wash away this guilt

48
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:32,669
I have about In-gang.

49
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,630
And the more I think about it...

50
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:40,219
the answer
keeps circling back to you.

51
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,848
What are you planning to do?

52
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,185
I'll have to undo the knot
I tied myself.

53
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,771
And that means

54
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:56,735
sending you back
to the life you came from.

55
00:03:58,695 --> 00:03:59,780
Just wait.

56
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:06,578
I'm going to tear your life apart.

57
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,671
I'm not letting you walk away.

58
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:21,343
I'll put you right back in the gutter
you crawled out of.

59
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,846
The suspect in her father's murder

60
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,307
Baek Ah-jin.

61
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,438
Go on.

62
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:35,899
Hit me.

63
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,695
If that's what it takes for you
to let it all out, I'll take it.

64
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,658
Is that going to bring In-gang back?

65
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:49,538
Then what?
You want me to get down on my knees?

66
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,581
Will that bring him back?

67
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,334
Then what do you want me to do?

68
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,422
If you jump off this building

69
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,799
I'll call it even.

70
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:09,683
That's funny.

71
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,311
"Funny"?

72
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:17,399
Ms. Seo.

73
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,154
Am I the only one at fault here?

74
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,782
Do you honestly believe that?

75
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:32,539
You stayed by his side
for all those years

76
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:35,792
and you still didn't see it coming?

77
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:38,795
You knew he was falling apart

78
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,631
for a long time.

79
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,719
But you chose to look the other way

80
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,096
because of your greed.

81
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:52,726
And now you're throwing
the blame on me.

82
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,771
So this is who you really are.

83
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:58,148
You blame others--

84
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,316
What do you know?

85
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,026
I know this much.

86
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,280
The one year he spent with me

87
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,824
meant more to him

88
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,370
than the ten years he spent with you.

89
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:46,405
Just wait.
I'm going to tear your life apart.

90
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:51,034
Damn it!

91
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,163
Shit.

92
00:06:56,998 --> 00:06:58,083
Who says you get to?

93
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,671
Don't get in my way
because I'm not going to stop.

94
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,256
Ever.

95
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:27,696
If your company can't take
any follow-up action regarding Ah-jin

96
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,782
I don't see any reason
to keep investing.

97
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,951
We'll forgo the film investment.

98
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,122
Are you saying you have no intention
of protecting Baek Ah-jin?

99
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:39,458
Yes, that's correct.

100
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,378
One last question.

101
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:47,299
You're not planning to stop
at cutting her loose, are you?

102
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,009
A word of advice?

103
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:53,722
If you think there's anything human
left in Baek Ah-jin

104
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,933
anything worth saving at all

105
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,394
let it go.

106
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:03,565
She'll drag everyone around her
straight to hell.

107
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:12,365
Don't you think you're being
a little harsh with me?

108
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,159
I just want to talk to him!

109
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:16,912
The chairman instructed me
not to let you into the house.

110
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:18,455
Please leave.

111
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,751
Mr. Hong, I just need a word...

112
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:31,134
I feel so dizzy.

113
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,720
I need a minute.

114
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,270
SON

115
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,293
What now?

116
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:08,797
You still haven't told Jun-seo?

117
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:11,508
I told you to let him know
that I got on my knees

118
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:13,051
and apologized.

119
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:14,511
Do you know how long it's been?

120
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:16,012
Ms. Hwang.

121
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,641
My head's already killing me,
so don't make it worse.

122
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:22,310
If you want him to know that badly,
go tell him yourself.

123
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:26,856
How am I supposed to tell him
if he won't pick up my calls?

124
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,734
He won't even meet me
when I go to see him.

125
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:34,072
What do you expect me to do?

126
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,658
This level of attachment
isn't healthy.

127
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:37,951
Learn when to stop.

128
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,120
I'm not attached.

129
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,247
I'm sick.

130
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:45,542
I need surgery right away.

131
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,884
Surgery? What kind of surgery?

132
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:59,806
I'm on dialysis,
and I need a transplant.

133
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:01,891
They say family members
usually donate.

134
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,228
It could take years
to wait around for a donor.

135
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,813
And it's not like I have options.

136
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:09,691
I'm drowning in debt
and can't even afford the surgery.

137
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,901
I don't have the money or the kidney.

138
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,945
At this rate, I'm going to die!

139
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,825
Make sure Jun-seo hears that.

140
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:24,372
So all this fuss is because
you need one of his kidneys, right?

141
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:29,419
That's why you came to me
with that pathetic little apology.

142
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,004
Well, perfect timing.

143
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:35,300
He's standing right here,
so tell him yourself.

144
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:37,802
Tell him you got on your knees
and apologized

145
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,388
because you want his kidney.

146
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:43,933
What?

147
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:46,603
You heard her.

148
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,272
Your mom needs a kidney.

149
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:53,276
If you want to save her,
give her your kidney.

150
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:12,253
Don't answer her calls.

151
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,799
Who knows what she'll do if I don't?

152
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,759
You know how she is.

153
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:21,054
Do you really not know

154
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:25,100
or do you just pretend
because she's your mother?

155
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:29,187
The same hands
that used to stroke your hair

156
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,564
are the ones
that shoved my head underwater.

157
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:33,108
Don't forget that.

158
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,281
I met with Ms. Seo.

159
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:43,785
She didn't budge an inch
when I said I'd pull my investment.

160
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,413
Looks like she plans to go
all the way with you.

161
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:50,750
She'll bury you
and make sure you never come back.

162
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,585
I'm not surprised.

163
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,423
She's so blinded by anger
that she can't see straight.

164
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,217
How far do you think she'll go?

165
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,137
I honestly don't know.
She's never gone this far before.

166
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:24,117
I talked to a few agencies,
but Ms. Seo already got to them.

167
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:26,369
It won't be easy to get out of this.

168
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:29,080
When has my life ever been easy?

169
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,707
That's exactly what worries me.

170
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,917
What do you mean?

171
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:34,669
Every time you're cornered

172
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,338
your solution is to cross
yet another line.

173
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,424
I won't sit around like a fool.

174
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:46,014
This is not the time to argue.
Focus on how we fix this.

175
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,643
The shackle file.
Isn't that all we need?

176
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,062
It's useless now.

177
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,905
At this point,
either she dies or I do.

178
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,074
One of us has to go.

179
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:35,814

180
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,611
I'll give you my kidney.

181
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:45,114
I'll pay off the loan sharks
and cover the surgery too.

182
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:47,826
Really?

183
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:50,745
But I have two conditions.

184
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:54,165
First, you never show up
in front of Ah-jin again.

185
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:57,919
Second, you stay away
from Grandpa for good.

186
00:13:58,461 --> 00:13:59,462
What?

187
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:02,006
Once your debts are paid
and the surgery is covered

188
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,635
you won't have any reason
to go to Grandpa for money.

189
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:07,011
And once you have my kidney

190
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:09,681
you won't have to go
stirring things up with Ah-jin.

191
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,350
From where I'm standing,
that seems fair.

192
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:19,065
You make it sound like
I've got a contagious disease.

193
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,693
Don't you think
you're being a little harsh?

194
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:23,319
You don't like it?

195
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,323
The people you keep hurting

196
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:30,577
are the people I care about the most.

197
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,745
So don't hurt Ah-jin or Grandpa

198
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:34,706
ever again.

199
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,376
Those are my conditions.

200
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,308
What do you mean?

201
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:55,852
Who's on the first floor?

202
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,271
For what reason?

203
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,731
Are you sure?

204
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:05,820
What's going on?

205
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,906
Ms. Seo, the police are in the lobby.

206
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:10,074
The police? What do they want?

207
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:15,538
Ms. Seo Mi-ri.

208
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:20,919
We have a warrant for your arrest
and a warrant to search the premises.

209
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,590
This morning, CEO Seo Mi-ri
of Longstar Entertainment

210
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:27,634
was taken into police custody.

211
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,135
Police say they uncovered evidence

212
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:32,138
that she embezzled
several billion won in company funds.

213
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:35,141
Investigators conducted
a five-hour search-and-seizure

214
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:38,519
at the company's headquarters
as part of an expanding probe.

215
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:41,189
Authorities say embezzlement
is only one part of the case.

216
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:44,651
New claims accuse Seo of abusing
and threatening her artists

217
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:48,154
fostering what insiders describe
as a climate of fear.

218
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,698
She allegedly used
the so-called "shackle files"

219
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:53,576
documents containing private details
about her artists

220
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,828
to intimidate and control them.

221
00:15:55,912 --> 00:16:00,124
Police have seized these files
and will verify their authenticity.

222
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,751
Is everything in the file true?

223
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,670
When did you find out
about the shackle files?

224
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:06,631
Additional charges
against CEO Seo Mi-ri have surfaced.

225
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:08,508
Police say they uncovered evidence

226
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:12,553
that she bribed broadcast officials
and entertainment reporters

227
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:15,348
in an effort to promote
her agency's artists.

228
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,934
Police have added breach-of-trust
and bribery charges

229
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:19,644
and are seeking a detention warrant.

230
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:27,902
Yes, Mr. Hong.

231
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:31,948
I'm going into surgery soon

232
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:34,409
so I won't be able
to visit Grandpa for a while.

233
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,164
Please don't tell him
about the kidney transplant.

234
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,293
Yes. Look after him.

235
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,379
I'll contact you again.

236
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,148
What was that about?

237
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,109
A kidney transplant?

238
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,949
I'm giving my kidney to my mom.

239
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:18,453
Are you serious?
How could you not tell me that?

240
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:21,247
If I hadn't come today,
were you really not going to tell me?

241
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:23,499
Lena.

242
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,001
No wonder.

243
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:30,381
Every time I asked you for a drink,
you kept making excuses.

244
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:34,469
I thought you'd come around,
so I waited like an idiot.

245
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:37,513
But did you even care
that I was waiting for your call?

246
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:39,974
Do you like making me feel stupid?

247
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,893
Am I that much of a joke to you?

248
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:46,606
Careful, you'll hurt yourself.

249
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,941
Stop.

250
00:17:58,618 --> 00:17:59,702
You're a jerk.

251
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,486
Your surgery is today, right?

252
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:34,987
Yes.

253
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:37,406
Don't give me anything
to worry about.

254
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:39,826
I hate that.

255
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,494
Okay.

256
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:44,455
I'm relieved
that Seo Mi-ri has been arrested.

257
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:46,916
One less thing for me
to worry about you.

258
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,503
How can it be so easy for you?

259
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,172
You're giving up
a part of yourself for someone else

260
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:54,382
and it's no big deal?

261
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:56,509
You can still smile?

262
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:57,593
Ah-jin.

263
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,180
You don't have to come
to the hospital.

264
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:05,476
Just wait for me,
and I'll come to you.

265
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,980
So don't worry about me.

266
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:11,899
I should go now.

267
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,318
Don't skip your meals, okay?

268
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,320
I'll hang up.

269
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,109
An exclusive management contract?

270
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,154
My public image isn't
exactly great right now.

271
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:02,158
Are you sure you made this offer
with that in mind?

272
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,409
Absolutely.

273
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:05,661
To be honest

274
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:08,247
we're not worried about that at all.

275
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:13,044
We're investing in your future value.

276
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,714
And any image reset can be managed
on our side without difficulty.

277
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,218
Ms. Baek, if you're free now

278
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:22,303
would you mind
stopping by our office?

279
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:24,305
We can have a meeting first

280
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,182
and take our time
discussing the contract.

281
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:46,244
Where are you going?

282
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:49,747
Aren't you going to eat?

283
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:51,582
I ordered your food too.

284
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:55,586
Hey!

285
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,757
You eat it.

286
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:04,470
And put that watch back where it was
before I call the cops.

287
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:06,764
Seriously.

288
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,475
Don't be so stingy.

289
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:13,020
It's fine if I wear it at your place.

290
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,357
Oh, right.
Most of your hate comments are gone.

291
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,442
And the articles trashing you
got deleted too.

292
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:23,572
Look.

293
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,410
Everything got wiped clean.
I told you it would.

294
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,247
Just a few days ago,
there were tons of them.

295
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,623
Isn't that wild?

296
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,877
Do you spend all day
searching for my name online?

297
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:38,963
You have nothing better to do?

298
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:43,384
You really don't get it.

299
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:45,845
Keeping tabs on you
is part of my daily routine.

300
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:47,221
When an article about you drops

301
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,558
leaving the first hate comment
is my little hobby.

302
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,397
Hey, grab some snacks
on your way back.

303
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,024
Something sweet.

304
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,067
It must be nice.

305
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:02,320
Your life just works out
even when you don't try.

306
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:03,404
Must be nice for you too.

307
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:06,991
Every time things get rough,
someone swoops in to save you.

308
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:12,121
Are you dumb, or just immature?

309
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:16,250
A life where someone has to show up
and save you every time

310
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,835
actually looks good to you?

311
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,172
If you like it so much, you take it.

312
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,467
Not that you're on that level.

313
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,219
Hey!

314
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,765
What a brat.

315
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:35,561
I'm here to show you this luxury bag.

316
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:39,023
What do you think?
Isn't my baby gorgeous?

317
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:42,151
It's been so long.

318
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:43,944
It was about ten million won--

319
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:46,989
IT WAS ABOUT TEN MILLION WON
WHEN I BOUGHT IT

320
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,134
This is ten million won?

321
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:11,972
Even used, this must be worth
at least a few million won.

322
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,478
This is insane!

323
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:23,526
Welcome.

324
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:07,570
What took you so long?
The store is right around the corner.

325
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:17,037
Hey.

326
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,707
Did you forget
to microwave the kimchi?

327
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,585
Just eat it.

328
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:25,129
It all turns warm
the second it hits your stomach.

329
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:34,847
You're not eating?

330
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:39,894
You can have it all.
I don't have an appetite.

331
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:46,817
By the way

332
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:50,613
about the black sedan I mentioned,
did you find anything?

333
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:51,989
I gave you the plate number.

334
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:55,618
Oh, that car?
Turns out it's a ghost car.

335
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:56,994
Fake plates and everything.

336
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,500
These guys are pros.

337
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:07,254
If those guys beat you up like that,
they must be dangerous.

338
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,965
Didn't you say
they were tailing your girl?

339
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,467
You should warn her about them.

340
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:14,970
You're right.

341
00:25:15,804 --> 00:25:18,474
Stressing over it alone
isn't going to solve anything.

342
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,354
I should give her a heads-up
and tell her to be careful, right?

343
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:29,276
What does your girlfriend do
that guys like that are after her?

344
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,738
It's none of your business,
so stop prying.

345
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:36,659
Hello?

346
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:42,122
Where are you? I'll come to you.

347
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:44,416
I'm stepping out for a bit.

348
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,085
Where are you going?

349
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:56,804
Sir, it's time to move
to the lecture hall.

350
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:16,073
I almost got into a bad accident
driving alone last time.

351
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:19,243
I've been scared to drive ever since.

352
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:23,414
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.

353
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,501
If you feel uncomfortable driving,
just reach out to me.

354
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:30,796
Jun-seo specifically told me

355
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:33,340
to stick close to you
while he's away.

356
00:26:33,674 --> 00:26:37,595
Also, don't drive so close to people
who drive like maniacs.

357
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,513
You could get dragged
into their accident.

358
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,684
I was that maniac driver.

359
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:46,145
I was the one
who almost caused an accident.

360
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:51,567
Yeah?

361
00:26:57,114 --> 00:27:01,035
Do you still have
that burner phone I gave you?

362
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:03,287
Why?

363
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:08,876
You know how dangerous
the world can be.

364
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:10,836
So keep it on you at all times.

365
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,631
If anything happens,
call me right away.

366
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,842
You're so lame, Jae-oh.

367
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:21,305
So where are we going?

368
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:25,351
An agency meeting.
They asked me to come by the office.

369
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,854
If everything checks out,
I might sign today.

370
00:27:29,146 --> 00:27:30,606
I knew it.

371
00:27:30,689 --> 00:27:33,984
Longstar goes down, and everything
starts working out for you again.

372
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:44,203
Here at DO Entertainment

373
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:47,331
we're a full-service agency
active across multiple fields

374
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:49,917
including drama, films,
and broadcast content.

375
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,961
We're also rapidly expanding
into online content

376
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:55,214
and our label business
is growing aggressively.

377
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:58,634
We'll provide
comprehensive management support

378
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,053
so you can work across
a wide range of projects.

379
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,681
And as you can see there

380
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:07,267
the revenue split is
structured to be beneficial for you.

381
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:12,106
By the way

382
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,610
what kind of relationship do you have
with Mr. Moon Do-hyuk?

383
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:19,196
Mr. Moon Do-hyuk?

384
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:24,284
The person who pushed
the hardest for us to sign you

385
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:26,412
was actually Mr. Moon Do-hyuk,
CEO of Hadere.

386
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:28,205
He's a major shareholder
in our company.

387
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:31,875
And he's got a real eye for talent.

388
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:34,670
I heard he personally cleaned up

389
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:38,298
all the smear pieces about you
ahead of time.

390
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:43,011
So I assumed you knew him personally.

391
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,608
SATURN'S PHILOSOPHY AND VISION

392
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,545
Sir, I have a question.

393
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:19,840
- Yes?
- After meeting you today

394
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:22,092
I found you impressive
not only as a businessman

395
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:25,512
but as someone
who's truly worthy of respect.

396
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:50,245
Thank you.

397
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:52,039
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your time.

398
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:54,249
He's amazing, isn't he?

399
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,293
Thank you for coming.

400
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,463
Thank you.

401
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:16,438
It's nice to meet you.

402
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:19,066
I'm Baek Ah-jin.

403
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:23,529
I'm Moon Do-hyuk.

404
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:28,826
It's our first time meeting,
but we're not exactly strangers.

405
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,828
You seem to know me pretty well.

406
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:33,497
I do. I've been waiting.

407
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:37,626
I honestly thought
we'd meet a little sooner.

408
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:40,838
I wanted to thank you.

409
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,215
You believed in me

410
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:44,883
when everyone else
turned their backs.

411
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:50,472
I always believe in myself
and in my own judgment.

412
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:53,976
I'd like to know
why you're helping me.

413
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:56,812
Shall we sit?

414
00:31:10,242 --> 00:31:11,827
The company I run donates

415
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,122
over 15 percent of its annual revenue
to charity every year.

416
00:31:15,622 --> 00:31:19,042
That money goes
to the underprivileged.

417
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:22,754
I like helping the unfortunate.

418
00:31:23,797 --> 00:31:26,383
I really can't stand
just watching them struggle.

419
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:30,888
In that sense, I've been watching you
fighting to survive

420
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:32,973
for quite some time now.

421
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,978
"What would have become of you
if you had grown up

422
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:40,731
in a normal family
with parental support?"

423
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:43,692
It started from that simple question.

424
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:46,570
And that's what made me
want to become your guardian.

425
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,407
Sounds like you've done
a lot of digging.

426
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:52,659
I can't stand being curious.

427
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:54,870
That's interesting.

428
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:57,915
I never thought my miserable life

429
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:01,001
would captivate anyone.

430
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:07,174
The moments you shone brightest
were when you were acting.

431
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:09,051
I didn't want it to end like this.

432
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:12,512
It looked like you were in a crisis,
so I simply held out my hand.

433
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:14,264
Like I said

434
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:17,517
I get a sense of purpose
from helping talented people

435
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:18,810
with real potential.

436
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:22,522
It seems removing Ms. Seo
from the picture isn't

437
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,441
the end of your plan.

438
00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:29,947
What kind of plan do you have for me?

439
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,743
I can't tell you that yet.

440
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:36,787
It's a surprise.

441
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,123
If you drag out the preview,
it ruins the fun.

442
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,585
I have another appointment today.

443
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,172
Why don't we set a proper time
to meet next time?

444
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:53,553
I'll call you.

445
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:12,864
- Hey.
- Hey, when are you being discharged?

446
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,741
Was it next week?

447
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,702
No, I'm heading out today.

448
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:18,620
My recovery was fast,
so they moved it up two days.

449
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:19,913
Oh, really?

450
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:21,957
That's perfect.

451
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,626
Can you swing by the office
after you get out?

452
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,170
There's a pressing matter
we need to talk about.

453
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,923
Can't we just do it over the phone?

454
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,091
Come on, man.

455
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:32,259
Seriously?

456
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:36,138
Didn't you hear me say
it was a pressing matter?

457
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:38,390
I'd come to where you are

458
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:40,892
but my boss isn't in
because it's the weekend.

459
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:41,977
So if you could...

460
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:46,857
Forget it.
You're a patient, after all.

461
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,735
I'll come to you.
You craving anything?

462
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:53,613
No, I'll just stop by the office
this evening.

463
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:58,827
What?

464
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:21,433
NAME: HWANG JI-SUN

465
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,840
These are Seo Mi-ri's shackle files
that the police obtained.

466
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:57,052
If we delete Ms. Baek's portion
and send it back

467
00:34:57,135 --> 00:34:58,470
this should wrap up quietly.

468
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:01,515
And the reporter?

469
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:04,184
We checked all of his files.
Came up clean.

470
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,564
That leaves two loose ends.

471
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,280
Leave the one who just had surgery
alone for now.

472
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:18,365
Yes, sir.

473
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:20,742
As for this guy...

474
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:24,788
I've grown a bit attached.

475
00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:27,124
I'd rather this one go quietly,
without any noise.

476
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,876
How should we handle it?

477
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:39,594
Since it's cold out...

478
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:42,889
let's keep him warm.

479
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:53,567
They said the police have issued
a detention warrant.

480
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,570
Why are they in such a hurry?

481
00:35:57,028 --> 00:35:58,196
Something's not right.

482
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:00,782
Did you talk to your lawyer?

483
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:03,118
What is he advising you to do?

484
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:06,788
He said when the police
push this hard

485
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:09,958
it usually means
they already have solid evidence.

486
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,460
His advice is to admit to it
and try for a reduced sentence.

487
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:14,754
He said probation is unlikely.

488
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,258
- What do we do?
- Someone's behind this.

489
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:21,803
Otherwise, how would
everything line up so neatly?

490
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:24,514
And the person behind
whoever's pulling the strings

491
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:26,016
must be Ah-jin.

492
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:32,772
Ah-jin!

493
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:34,316
Ah-jin.

494
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:37,360
I need to talk to you.

495
00:36:38,945 --> 00:36:39,946
What's this about?

496
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:43,909
Ah-jin, let Longstar off the hook.

497
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:47,162
Why are you asking me
to save your company?

498
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:48,914
What does it have to do with me?

499
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:50,749
You've come to the wrong person.

500
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:55,378
Ms. Seo regrets what she did to you.

501
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,422
If you help her this once

502
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:00,133
she says she'll let
bygones be bygones.

503
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,178
- Please, Ah-jin.
- Ms. Moon.

504
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:07,933
What makes you think
I could pull something like this off?

505
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,937
She was the one who was after me,
not the other way around.

506
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:17,609
Ah-jin.

507
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,364
We're really sorry.

508
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:25,533
Please.

509
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:28,453
Perhaps she sent you
to get on your knees and beg.

510
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:31,539
Funny thing is,
I tried to beg her for help too.

511
00:37:32,165 --> 00:37:33,458
But she wouldn't hear me out.

512
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:38,755
She just told me
to throw myself off the roof.

513
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:45,887
The shackle files
are already with the police.

514
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:49,224
So if there's no way out

515
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:52,310
she should take her own advice
and kill herself.

516
00:38:09,577 --> 00:38:11,788
ARTIST: BAEK AH-JIN
AGENCY: DO ENTERTAINMENT

517
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:26,112
Should we keep going
or should we stop?

518
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,239
You decide.

519
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:35,705
You really know everything,
don't you?

520
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:41,544
How could I not?
I'm the one who set it all in motion.

521
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:45,507
It's all thanks to you.
I appreciate it.

522
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:50,804
So? How does it feel?

523
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:54,140
Is that good enough for you?

524
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,226
What did you want to discuss?

525
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:09,489
You see these marks?

526
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:11,408
What happened to you?

527
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:18,081
The other day
I saw some shady guys tailing Ah-jin.

528
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:22,252
I followed them,
and they beat the crap out of me.

529
00:40:22,877 --> 00:40:23,878
What?

530
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:28,591
They had several cars on her.
They weren't messing around.

531
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:32,345
But they're all ghost cars.
I couldn't even trace the plates.

532
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:37,392
They're the ones
who gave you a hard time.

533
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:39,436
If you want, I can do worse.

534
00:40:39,686 --> 00:40:43,523
I can send them far away
so they never come near you.

535
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:47,652
Or I can destroy them
so they never cross your mind again.

536
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,494
I don't get it, though.

537
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:01,416
What don't you get?

538
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:04,919
Why you're going this far for me.

539
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:10,383
Are you into me?

540
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:23,271
Does Ah-jin know about this?

541
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:27,817
I was going to tell her
once I knew what was happening.

542
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:32,155
You've lived a rough life.

543
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:36,576
And like I told you,
I can't ignore people like that.

544
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:40,288
Ms. Baek, I know
how hard your life has been.

545
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:46,377
You must have cried a lot as a kid.
Am I right?

546
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,339
How much do you know?

547
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:50,924
How high do you want to go?

548
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,939
I wanted to discuss it
with you first.

549
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:16,115
Hey.

550
00:42:21,955 --> 00:42:23,623
Do you smell that?

551
00:42:23,998 --> 00:42:28,044
I'll help you achieve
anything you want.

552
00:42:31,172 --> 00:42:32,465
So tell me

553
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:35,802
how high you want to go.

554
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:57,824
I'm offering you this opportunity,
so think carefully.

555
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:03,413
Think hard about what choice
you need to make right now.

556
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:12,964
It's not that complicated.

557
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:16,259
You'll star in
Director Park's new film

558
00:43:16,884 --> 00:43:18,803
make your international debut

559
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:21,889
and take home Best Actress
at a major festival.

560
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,101
You'll spend your days
as a brilliant actress.

561
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:29,814
And you'll enjoy all of that
as my wife.

562
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:36,779
Hey.

563
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:37,905
Shit.

564
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,410
You okay?

565
00:43:51,794 --> 00:43:52,837
So?

566
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:54,505
Do you like...

567
00:43:56,507 --> 00:43:57,717
my wedding gift?

568
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:03,473
Wedding, you say?

569
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:09,312
Move!

570
00:44:18,071 --> 00:44:22,408
I'll wipe away
all the stains from your past.

571
00:44:22,784 --> 00:44:25,828
And you'll start over by my side.

572
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:28,414
I promise you, Ah-jin.

573
00:44:32,543 --> 00:44:33,628
Come to me.

574
00:44:37,632 --> 00:44:41,969
DEAR X

575
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:04,445
