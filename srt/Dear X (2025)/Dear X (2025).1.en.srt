1
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:53,969
DEAR X

2
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,805
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,515
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

4
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,314
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT, BUT COULD YOU
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN?

5
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,610
It was the same as usual.

6
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:16,575
My mom was yelling at me
to bring her more drinks.

7
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:23,707
I got smacked a few times, then I got
scared and ran to the bathroom.

8
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,651
Dad.

9
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,113
Can you stop Mommy when she hits me?

10
00:01:54,738 --> 00:01:59,284
She lashes out at me when she's drunk
because you don't do anything.

11
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,496
She's pathetic.

12
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,499
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOUR DAD WAS DOING AT THE TIME?

13
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:11,338
How would I stop your mom
when she's drunk and acting crazy?

14
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:15,259
She threw a total fit, saying
she wouldn't agree to a divorce.

15
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:20,639
It hurts.

16
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:25,269
At first, he tried to stop her
whenever she lost her temper.

17
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,355
But after some time,
he just stayed asleep.

18
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:51,336
Goodbye, my wife.

19
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,485
Don't tell me you threw her.

20
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,159
She got drunk
and fell down the stairs.

21
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:25,204
I know you're fed up with her, too.

22
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,957
I'll get you a new mom.

23
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,877
She's super rich.

24
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:34,880
Nothing like our poor family.

25
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:39,134
Starting now, you do as I say.

26
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:44,014
Or I will throw you
down the stairs, too.

27
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,333
Help...

28
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:55,627
Ah Jin.

29
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,047
Call an ambulance.

30
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:47,262
NAME: BAEK AH JIN
OCCUPATION: ACTRESS

31
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:06,531
NOTABLE TRAITS:
ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER

32
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,158
FOUND IN ABOUT 4 PERCENT
OF THE POPULATION

33
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,786
SHE IS A SOCIOPATH

34
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,589
SHE VIEWS OTHERS AS TOOLS

35
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:25,342
AND MANIPULATES OR USES THEM
TO ACHIEVE HER GOALS

36
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:35,394
SHE HAS DELIBERATELY APPROACHED
ONLY MEN WHO WERE OF USE TO HER

37
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,240
SHE HAS NEVER
PHYSICALLY COMMITTED MURDER

38
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:51,326
BUT SHE CAUSED THE DEATHS
OF TWO PEOPLE, BAEK AND HEO

39
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:04,005
SHE STILL HARBORS
AN UNFULFILLED PLAN TO KILL

40
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,856
SHE IS BAEK AH JIN, AN ACTRESS

41
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,861
EPISODE 1: HER X'S

42
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:26,945
JULY 2016

43
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,572
Hey, it's Ms. Kwak's birthday party.

44
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,782
Let's go! Come on.

45
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:34,369
- Let's go and have cake.
- Cake? I'm in.

46
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,037
- Come.
- Save me a piece!

47
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,789
Get me a slice, too!

48
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,082
So loud.

49
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:44,212
How many?

50
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:46,882
No way.

51
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,011
Did you hear that?

52
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:52,971
- They're getting married?
- Yes.

53
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,308
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

54
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,935
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

55
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,564
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Kwak...
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Kwak...

56
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,774
- This is Singwang High School.
- Singwang High School.

57
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,568
It was posted anonymously, so...

58
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,164
What are these?

59
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:20,665
Explain!

60
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,003
- What's going on?
- What are they?

61
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,925
- What's this?
- Is this for real?

62
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,344
- Who's this?
- It can't be true.

63
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,804
What on earth have you been doing?

64
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:38,141
It's all over the school's website

65
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:41,436
so we're getting numerous phone calls
from the parents!

66
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:44,481
You're placed under probation
until it dies down.

67
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:47,609
We'll contact you
once the situation is resolved.

68
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,654
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

69
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,419
Are you all right, Ms. Kwak?

70
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:13,510
Did you like my gift?

71
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,973
As you always pointed out

72
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:21,309
I'm an underprivileged child
with no parents or guardians

73
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:23,353
so I couldn't get you a nice gift.

74
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:27,399
But I put my heart into this one.

75
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,027
I hope you like it.

76
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,031
Happy birthday.

77
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,377
SIM SUNG HEE, HER X

78
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:54,843
1. BAEK AH JIN
2. SIM SUNG HEE

79
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:59,097
Ah Jin and I both got a two-point
question wrong, but why am I second?

80
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,142
There's a one-point difference
in the art practical test.

81
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:04,311
You two have different ranks,
but you're both in the top grade

82
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:05,937
so it doesn't affect
the overall outcome.

83
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:07,480
The art practical test?

84
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:15,572
What's happening?

85
00:10:17,198 --> 00:10:18,867
Who is Ah Jin with?

86
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,410
Our art teacher?

87
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:26,833
You haven't gone home yet?

88
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,794
I left my umbrella in the classroom.

89
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:31,713
I didn't see any umbrellas.

90
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,548
So, someone took my umbrella?

91
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:34,966
Yes.

92
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,927
Move. Let me look for it.

93
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:41,097
Come. I'll walk you there
before it's too late.

94
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,775
You're a model student, indeed.

95
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,110
Studying even in the middle
of all this chaos.

96
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,530
But who were you with
in the classroom?

97
00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:00,158
Was it the art teacher who supervised
the evening study yesterday?

98
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:05,413
You sure have a lot of interest
in other people's business.

99
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,248
But you're also completely oblivious.

100
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:12,170
You know, people like you
are the first to die in movies.

101
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:15,382
Good for you, though.

102
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:19,344
At least in real life, you won't die
for something like that.

103
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,436
I got chills at that moment.

104
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:30,897
That look on her face.

105
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,274
That tone.

106
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,528
Her true face
that flashed for a split second.

107
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,240
Only I saw it.

108
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:43,618
Ah Jin, congratulations
on ranking first in the whole school.

109
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,954
And Jun Seo, great job
winning the writing contest.

110
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:49,666
Jun Seo and Sung Hee, you'll be
preparing for the debate competition

111
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:50,917
so keep working hard.

112
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,295
I'd like to give my spot
in the debate competition to Ah Jin.

113
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,380
All of a sudden?

114
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,048
Why?

115
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:58,591
Winning the writing contest

116
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:01,219
is enough for me to apply early
as a literature-specialized student.

117
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:02,303
Is that so?

118
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,305
- Have you talked it over with her?
- Yes.

119
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,349
I'd like to participate, if possible.

120
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:09,102
I'll check the eligibility rules
and let you know.

121
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:11,479
Good luck with the rest of the day.

122
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,523
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

123
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:18,653
2016 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE COMPETITION

124
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,490
The debate topic is

125
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,743
the pros and cons
of the death penalty.

126
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,787
As you know, the first part is
a free presentation on the topic

127
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:29,164
and in the second part

128
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:32,083
one representative debates
with students from other schools.

129
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,585
You only need to prepare
for Part One.

130
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:36,880
Yu Bin can help Ah Jin with research.

131
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,382
Ga Yeong, you handle the slides.

132
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,050
I'll write the presentation script.

133
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:43,595
It's more convenient
when the presenter writes it.

134
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:44,679
- Sure.
- Sure.

135
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:50,310
Have you always decided things
this way?

136
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:54,189
Ah Jin, we also agreed
with her plan, so--

137
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:56,524
It was the same
in the last idea-pitching contest.

138
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,276
Sung Hee has good leadership

139
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:59,986
so her way gives us
a better shot at win--

140
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:01,154
No, she's right.

141
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,157
I've been too assuming.

142
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,034
Ah Jin.

143
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,495
How would you like to do it?

144
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,581
I heard cooperation
among team members

145
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:13,541
counts for a high portion
of the score.

146
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,960
To score well in that area

147
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:18,296
isn't it better if we all took part
in Part Two as well?

148
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,760
She has a point.

149
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:27,430
Then let's think
about how to divide the parts

150
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,891
and decide next time. Sound good?

151
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,351
Okay.

152
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:40,777
- Hi.
- Bye, guys.

153
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,529
See you!

154
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,072
Good work today.

155
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,615
So annoying.

156
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:48,034
Are you on your period?
Why the hysteria again?

157
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,828
She kept going on about teamwork

158
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,538
and started showing off
the moment she walked in!

159
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,081
Crazy bitch.

160
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,837
Do you mean Baek Ah Jin,
who pushed you out of first place?

161
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,921
Mom.

162
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,466
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

163
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,719
I've donated so much to your school
every month as the PTA rep.

164
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,721
You think I can't handle that much?

165
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:14,102
Can you find out
what tutoring she's getting?

166
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,563
What are you talking about?

167
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,566
Ms. Kwak said she's an orphan
who can't even afford an academy.

168
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,111
Anyway, I have bribed
Ms. Kwak so much money.

169
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:25,822
But she got fired,
and all that cash went to waste.

170
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,824
Not just money.
She said she needed legal help

171
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:29,659
so even your dad had to step in.

172
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:32,495
Who did she get caught
cheating with, anyway?

173
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,704
Are you sick?

174
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,331
You're feverish.

175
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,876
No, I'm fine.

176
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:03,836
Go on.

177
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,301
It's past eleven. You should go home.

178
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:12,387
I feel more comfortable here.

179
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:16,641
Can I borrow your literature notes?

180
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:17,725
Yes, hold on.

181
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:22,647
Here.

182
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:35,535
Jun Seo.

183
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,745
Did Ah Jin ask you

184
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:40,289
to give up the debate spot?

185
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,084
No, I just thought it didn't suit me.

186
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,795
Still, we're the president
and vice-president.

187
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:47,505
It'd look better if we went together.

188
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:50,049
If Ah Jin takes my spot

189
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,051
it will help the team win.

190
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,512
But you're a good writer.

191
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:57,098
I'm sure you will be
of better help to the team.

192
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,850
Can you say you'll join back?

193
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:00,893
Let's talk about it later.

194
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,027
She even gave you
something like this?

195
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,945
DEAR JUN SEO
HI, IT'S SUNG HEE

196
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,196
Was that in my bag?

197
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,324
I had no idea.

198
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:16,743
YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED,
BUT I THINK I LIKE YOU

199
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:18,119
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME?

200
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:22,165
Why are you reading it so seriously?
Just throw it away.

201
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,834
THINK ABOUT IT AND WRITE ME BACK
I'LL BE WAITING!

202
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,878
You should still reply.

203
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,298
I'll do it for you.

204
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:40,349
Did you hear the rumor this morning?

205
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:43,394
- About Ah Jin?
- She doesn't have a mom.

206
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:48,691
That was about Ah Jin, right?

207
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:49,984
Yes.

208
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,652
Hey, Ah Jin.

209
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,282
Yesterday, Sung Hee told Yu Bin

210
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,160
that you live alone
without your parents.

211
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:02,830
And she knows
Yu Bin can't keep her mouth shut.

212
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:06,125
It's not just our class anymore.
The whole school will know.

213
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,710
What are you going to do?

214
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:11,380
About the debate competition...

215
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,716
There's not much time left.

216
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,843
And we've been getting
complaints from parents

217
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:18,888
saying it'd be too hard
to align opinions with a new member.

218
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:20,389
So, the principal decided

219
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:23,017
only the three original members
should participate.

220
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:25,311
Which parent

221
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:27,188
objected to my joining?

222
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,690
This is my dad.
You've seen him on TV, right?

223
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:32,860
- Yes, I've seen him.
- Right?

224
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,821
And this is my mom.

225
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:37,532
- Oh, my.
- She's so beautiful.

226
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:39,534
You look just like her.

227
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:41,244
- I'm so jealous, Sung Hee.
- It's an article.

228
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,121
- Your family's rich.
- Doesn't she look good?

229
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:55,883
By the way

230
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,593
do you really have no parents?

231
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:04,642
Ah Jin!

232
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:06,477
Ah Jin!

233
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,645
I'm sorry, sweetie.

234
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:17,738
I heard you got dropped
from the debate team.

235
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:21,117
Apparently, Ga Yeong
and Yu Bin's moms were against it.

236
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,703
Are you into Jun Seo?

237
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,127
Did he say that to you?

238
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,550
He asked me to give this to you.

239
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,594
He probably feels bad
doing it himself.

240
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:50,188
NO ONE LIKES YOU
YOU'RE ANNOYING, SO STOP ACTING UP

241
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:54,859
Sung Hee.

242
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,278
The homeroom teacher
is looking for you.

243
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,280
We just got a notice
from the competition organizers

244
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:01,949
that our entire school
is disqualified.

245
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,160
They said someone made a report

246
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:06,954
and that they didn't want
any controversy.

247
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,582
It looks like
we'll have to drop out this year.

248
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,463
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE COMPETITION

249
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:18,591
BRIBERY BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS
AND JUDGES

250
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:20,051
A PARENT OF A CONTESTANT
FROM SINGWANG HIGH SCHOOL

251
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:21,510
BRIBED A JUDGE
TO ENSURE THEIR CHILD'S WIN

252
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:24,138
THE SAME PARENT PAID OFF A TEACHER
TO SECURE THEIR CHILD'S PARTICIPATION

253
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:27,016
THE STUDENT HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY
REPLACING OR EXCLUDING TEAMMATES...

254
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,064
Damn it.

255
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:34,899
It has to be her!

256
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:36,359
Because she was cut off

257
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:38,736
she spread the rumor
and got all of us disqualified.

258
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:40,529
Gosh.

259
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:43,282
Don't worry, Mom.

260
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,326
You know me.

261
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:49,080
Anyone who's ever crossed me
always paid for it.

262
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:53,709
I wonder what happens
to those who cross you.

263
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:58,798
Aren't you the one who spread
the rumor that I'm an orphan?

264
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:03,803
Thanks. My school life just got
a lot more entertaining.

265
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:07,098
I heard welfare kids like you
get free rice from the government.

266
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,351
And your tuition fee is free, right?

267
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,144
That rice you eat

268
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,814
is paid for by my dad's taxes.

269
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:18,609
Thanks.

270
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,172
NO ONE LIKES YOU
YOU'RE ANNOYING, SO STOP ACTING UP

271
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:41,632
IT CONNOTES FUTILITY...

272
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:43,843
YOU'RE ANNOYING

273
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:45,720
CONNOTES
ANNOYING

274
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:48,639
Fuck, the handwriting's the same.

275
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:51,017
That bitch.

276
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,728
- HAVEN'T YOU CHECKED THE LEDGER?
- I'M STUDYING FOR THE TEST

277
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:57,231
- I'LL CHECK AFTER CLASS
- OKAY

278
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,733
Kim Byeong Jin from Class Five

279
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,651
keeps skipping payments.
What do you want me to do?

280
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:09,243
Follow the manual.

281
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:21,964
CHINESE CUISINE DOWONJANG
FAST DELIVERY

282
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:44,612
You.

283
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:49,283
Stop acting so damn important, okay?

284
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,160
Heard me?

285
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:53,704
If you piss me off,
you're the one who'll regret it.

286
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,040
You understand?

287
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,459
You're nothing.

288
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:16,060
So, you're friends with my son?

289
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:17,978
He and I are

290
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,772
pretty much brothers.

291
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:22,441
I even...

292
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,487
lent him 250,000 won
of my hard-earned money.

293
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,655
What?

294
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:30,199
Byeong Jin borrowed money?

295
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:32,701
Take a look if you doubt me.

296
00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:35,037
It's an IOU.

297
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:41,710
Apparently, he broke
a friend's headset or something.

298
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:44,046
Anyway, it's 300,000 won,
including interest.

299
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:46,424
He was supposed to pay back
5,000 won a day.

300
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:48,426
But it's so funny.

301
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,094
He vanished after ten days.

302
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:51,387
You're a student.

303
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:52,805
You should be studying, not this!

304
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:57,685
Ma'am.

305
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:01,105
Just tell me.

306
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:03,190
Are you paying or not?

307
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:07,027
The theory that humans are born good.

308
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:08,571
The four virtues

309
00:24:08,654 --> 00:24:09,947
- of human nature are...
- Jun Seo.

310
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,659
- Forget about the money.
- Jun Seo!

311
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:17,621
...righteousness, propriety,
and wisdom.

312
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:22,251
It's a concept that these four
complete a human's moral nature.

313
00:24:22,793 --> 00:24:24,712
Now, the theory
that humans are inherently evil.

314
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:27,965
It shouldn't be taken to mean
that people stay evil forever.

315
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:32,303
You were born evil, so you're evil
until the day you die? Not at all.

316
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:35,431
The philosopher Xunzi argued...

317
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,020
Sorry I'm late.

318
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:55,576
I'll take her to the nurse's office.

319
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:00,456
- What happened to her?
- Jun Seo's so cool.

320
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,583
Quiet down.

321
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,294
Gosh, this damn weather.

322
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:09,590
I swear it's gone insane.

323
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:11,967
Jeez, how many raindrops
per second is this?

324
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:14,803
Man, I washed this uniform yesterday.

325
00:25:16,096 --> 00:25:17,097
What is it?

326
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:19,058
Are you two skipping class?

327
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:21,227
Why are you soaked?

328
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,436
Did you shower or something?

329
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:25,397
Looks like you're the one
who got rained on.

330
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:28,067
I'm sure I told you
not to talk to us at school.

331
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:31,529
Just go to class
when you're at school.

332
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:33,989
Who the fuck do you think you are,
telling me what to do?

333
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:36,283
And you're the one skipping class.

334
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:38,160
We're not skipping.
We're going to the nurse.

335
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,038
And those AirPods.

336
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:43,249
Shouldn't you be keeping
those out of sight?

337
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:50,130
Aren't these expensive?

338
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:58,514
You swear you won't tell anyone?

339
00:25:58,931 --> 00:25:59,974
Why?

340
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:02,601
I don't want to get involved
in something that's not my problem.

341
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:03,811
A model student like you

342
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,854
wouldn't gain anything
from getting involved with me.

343
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:08,524
You need anything?

344
00:26:08,607 --> 00:26:10,234
If you want something

345
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:11,652
I can steal one for you.

346
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:16,240
I don't need stuff.
But I do need a person.

347
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,909
- A person?
- It's a perfect fit for you.

348
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:21,203
This is good. You'll even get paid.

349
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,582
160,000 WON
BONG SU HUN, CLASS 2-8

350
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,418
BOSS

351
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:29,670
I'm going home
after I'm done in the nurse's office.

352
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:31,589
I'll check the ledger tomorrow.

353
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,844
You're not even pretending
to pay attention now?

354
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,387
What's this?

355
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,555
"Touch me and you're dead"?

356
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:41,056
What's this, Jae Oh?

357
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,433
You punk.

358
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:44,727
Jeez.

359
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:46,812
Stop!

360
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:50,399
You're dead when I catch you!

361
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:53,277
What just happened?

362
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,165
What is this?

363
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:09,460
PRESS TO UNLOCK

364
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:14,131
"Collections"?

365
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:15,341
I'LL CHECK THE LEDGER TOMORROW

366
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:16,925
"Ledger"?

367
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:20,763
What is this about?

368
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:21,889
Sim Sung Hee?

369
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:24,058
Why would she do that to you?

370
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:26,018
Why do you think?

371
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:29,229
She can't stand seeing me
hang out with you.

372
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:34,943
Whatever her reason is,
this is too much.

373
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:36,153
Let's tell the teacher.

374
00:27:36,236 --> 00:27:37,529
Forget it. I'm not a child.

375
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:41,325
She's been spreading rumors
about me, anyway.

376
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:43,327
I'll handle it my way.

377
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,247
You should lie down.

378
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,166
Your hair's still wet.

379
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:51,877
You'll catch a cold.

380
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:56,131
Jun Seo.

381
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,343
To be honest, I'm scared.

382
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:03,222
I don't know what she'll do next.

383
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,267
You'll help me, right?

384
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,542
Baek Ah Jin!

385
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:34,586
Ah Jin, good morning!

386
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,046
Are you feeling okay?

387
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,215
I'm totally fine. Thanks for asking.

388
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:40,008
Hey.

389
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,553
You didn't hear since you left
early yesterday, right?

390
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:45,973
It turns out Jae Oh has been running
a loan-sharking scheme with students

391
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,600
and the ethics teacher
caught him yesterday.

392
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:50,561
And the total amount was huge.

393
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:51,979
The homeroom teacher yelled so loudly

394
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:53,856
- that it echoed through the hallway.
- It did.

395
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,441
Is that right?

396
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:15,377
Hey, there.

397
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:23,010
I was going to just leave
after five more minutes.

398
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,352
You get the situation, right?

399
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:35,981
But still

400
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:38,567
I never said your name.

401
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:40,944
Now, I don't owe you anything--

402
00:29:53,415 --> 00:29:54,541
Thanks.

403
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:58,796
I knew you'd do that for me.

404
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:10,516
Wait.

405
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,767
My ribs.

406
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,649
Did you get hit again?

407
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,493
I honestly don't get it.

408
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,538
Every time you get hit by your father

409
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:35,123
it makes me angry
because you look so pathetic.

410
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:39,628
Aren't you sick of living like that?

411
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:44,216
If it were me, I would find a way
to get away from him.

412
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:47,344
Not just let him hit you
like an idiot.

413
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:49,471
I never knew
you were so interested in me.

414
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:51,390
No wonder.

415
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,893
I knew you were looking at me
in a strange way.

416
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,395
I looked pathetic to you.

417
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:58,397
Is that it?

418
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:03,569
I'm only letting him hit me.

419
00:31:04,611 --> 00:31:07,030
Or he'll go and make trouble
somewhere else.

420
00:31:08,282 --> 00:31:11,159
And no matter how useless I am

421
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:13,161
I can't beat up my own parent.

422
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:14,997
Yes, you can.

423
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:19,084
What's so wrong
with protecting yourself?

424
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:23,839
Jae Oh.

425
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:27,342
You're not useless.

426
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,428
At least, not to me.

427
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:08,800
- It's finally lunchtime.
- I was starving!

428
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:12,471
Can I get one more?
I love grilled patties.

429
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:14,556
Thank you, ma'am.

430
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:16,975
Why do you have four patties?

431
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:19,019
Because the lunch lady loves me.

432
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:20,979
Right, Ah Jin.
You'll chip in, too, right?

433
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:22,272
For our teacher's wedding gift.

434
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:24,149
Of course, I will.

435
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:26,443
She'll be so happy, right?

436
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:27,527
Oh, my.

437
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:33,825
No, you do not pay.

438
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:35,077
Are you out of your mind?

439
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,703
- What are you doing?
- Sung Hee!

440
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:38,872
Ah Jin, are you okay?
It splashed everywhere.

441
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,249
I'm fine, guys. I'll head out first.

442
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:47,005
- Hey, Ah Jin!
- Ah Jin!

443
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:00,519
So, you're Kim Jae Oh's boss.

444
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,526
You just got caught.

445
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:10,862
By me.

446
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:13,323
You really are his boss.

447
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:17,119
You're the mastermind
behind Kim Jae Oh's scheme.

448
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:19,496
You act like a perfect student

449
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:22,290
then shake kids down for cash
behind their backs.

450
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,210
Imagine how happy
the homeroom teacher will be

451
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,879
when she hears the gift was paid for
with dirty money.

452
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,881
Right?

453
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,135
What now?

454
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:36,096
You'll absolutely hate
coming to school now.

455
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,269
- Hey, stop right there.
- Sung Hee.

456
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:45,647
Do you have a minute?

457
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:51,153
What do you want to talk about?

458
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:55,782
It's about your letter.

459
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:59,202
You probably know already,
but Ah Jin answered on her own.

460
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,873
I apologize on her behalf.

461
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:04,875
Sorry.

462
00:34:06,168 --> 00:34:07,294
Save it.

463
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:10,213
Tell her to say it to my face
if she wants to apologize.

464
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:15,761
I know you're angry

465
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:18,472
but I hope you don't get
the wrong idea.

466
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,849
I like you.

467
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:24,394
What?

468
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:27,647
What did you just say?

469
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,024
You said you liked me.

470
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,777
I like you, too.

471
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:38,241
So, are we dating now?

472
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:45,499
About that.

473
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:49,336
The people I hate the most
are the ones who cross the line.

474
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,715
I don't want my girlfriend
to be that kind of person.

475
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:55,884
What do you mean?

476
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:57,719
I never crossed the line.

477
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:01,223
Things between you and Ah Jin
have been tense.

478
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:04,726
As you know, I've been friends
with her for a long time.

479
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,686
If you truly like me

480
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:10,315
I don't want you to bully her
while we're together.

481
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,651
You're wrong.

482
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,861
We're super close.

483
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,031
Don't worry. I'm not like that.

484
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:20,575
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

485
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:21,910
Good, then.

486
00:35:22,828 --> 00:35:24,162
Are you free this weekend?

487
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:25,831
How about a movie?

488
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:28,875
What should we watch?

489
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,294
Whatever you like.

490
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,588
What I like?

491
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:35,674
I like everything.

492
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:39,803
It's me.

493
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:41,513
Who's this?

494
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:43,723
Who do you think?
Did you already forget my voice?

495
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:44,850
Kim Jae Oh?

496
00:35:45,183 --> 00:35:47,686
I got a used phone.
Call this number from now on.

497
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,062
Just telling you that.

498
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,689
- I'm hanging up.
- Wait.

499
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:52,524
Don't hang up.

500
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:55,569
I need you right now.

501
00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:09,624
How come you mouth off to me
but let others walk all over you?

502
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,960
I think

503
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:14,421
Sim Sung Hee found out
about the ledger.

504
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:17,048
Found out what?

505
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:19,718
Even the fact
that you own the ledger?

506
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:23,430
And she has your lost phone.

507
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,558
I'll go get it right now.

508
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:29,853
Don't.

509
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:33,523
She already sees me
as a thorn in her side.

510
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:38,403
It's only a matter of time
before the whole school finds out.

511
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:41,948
They'll talk behind my back
when they see me.

512
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:43,533
Fuck.

513
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:51,958
Does Yoon Jun Seo
also know about this?

514
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,002
What is that jerk doing now?

515
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:55,253
You know how he is.

516
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:58,840
Even if he stepped up

517
00:36:59,591 --> 00:37:02,260
he couldn't handle
someone like Sung Hee by himself.

518
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,637
For now...

519
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:07,390
I just need your support.

520
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:19,945
Ah Jin, look at me.

521
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:24,950
You know I read the room fast
because I live with beatings.

522
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:27,911
Ah Jin, you said you needed me.

523
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,038
You're smart.

524
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:32,457
I know you've
already worked out a plan.

525
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:34,542
Tell me.

526
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:37,587
What do you want me to do?

527
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:43,426
Guys, hurry and pay
the wedding fund for our teacher.

528
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:49,224
You?

529
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:50,642
- Hey.
- It's 5,000 won.

530
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:52,686
I heard Ah Jin and Sung Hee

531
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:55,647
grabbed each other's hair
in the cafeteria yesterday.

532
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,649
- Really?
- No, they didn't fight.

533
00:37:57,732 --> 00:38:00,777
Sung Hee suddenly poured
strawberry milk on her lunch tray.

534
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,612
- Strawberry milk?
- Is she crazy?

535
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,244
- I'll pay now.
- Ah Jin.

536
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:10,912
I don't think you need to pay.

537
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:11,997
Why not?

538
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,083
We have enough collected, and...

539
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,418
Is it because of the rumor?

540
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:18,086
- That I'm an orphan?
- No.

541
00:38:18,169 --> 00:38:19,713
That's not why.

542
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:22,382
Do you know who started that rumor?

543
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,761
Seriously?

544
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,097
What's with that response?

545
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,473
Is there something wrong?

546
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:33,810
No, it's just random that you two
started dating so suddenly.

547
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:37,480
He still wants to date you,
knowing you poured milk on Ah Jin?

548
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:39,691
I didn't pour it.
I spilled it by mistake.

549
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,527
Not a drop hit her face.

550
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:47,115
Anyway

551
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:49,659
don't bring up her name
in front of me again.

552
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:53,580
See you.

553
00:38:58,501 --> 00:38:59,586
What's up with her?

554
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:01,546
She was always dying
to badmouth Ah Jin.

555
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:08,470
Nice.

556
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:10,889
How are things with Jun Seo?

557
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,683
You scared me.

558
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:16,144
You two looked cute together.

559
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:21,149
So what?

560
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:23,068
I'm happy for you. He's a good guy.

561
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:30,992
BOSS

562
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:33,328
PASSCODE 1004
FRIDAY, 4TH PERIOD, PE

563
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:35,372
Her passcode reads as "angel"?

564
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:37,916
That crazy Sung Hee has no shame.

565
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,377
Unbelievable.

566
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,797
FRIDAY
4TH PERIOD, PE

567
00:39:58,395 --> 00:39:59,396
Jun Seo.

568
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,942
I booked the movie for the weekend.

569
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:05,110
Thanks.

570
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:07,570
I hate PE.

571
00:40:07,946 --> 00:40:09,030
It's hot and sweaty.

572
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:11,991
I wish we could just do self-study.

573
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,120
If you hate it so much,
why don't we skip and hang out?

574
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:19,082
Tell the teacher you're going
to the nurse's office like Ah Jin did

575
00:40:19,165 --> 00:40:20,625
and come to the classroom quietly.

576
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:23,128
Don't tell anyone.

577
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:24,212
Okay.

578
00:40:33,346 --> 00:40:35,306
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's up, Sung Hee?

579
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:37,851
I have a terrible stomachache.

580
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,561
I also feel nauseous.

581
00:40:39,894 --> 00:40:41,187
You can't hold it?

582
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,606
I tried, but I just couldn't.

583
00:40:44,524 --> 00:40:46,860
I think I should get some medicine
at the nurse's office.

584
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,863
Okay. Go on. You can go alone, right?

585
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:50,989
Yes.

586
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,077
Okay, I'll drop by
with Seon Hui this weekend.

587
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:57,829
Got it.

588
00:40:58,246 --> 00:40:59,330
Take care, sir.

589
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:00,498
Bye.

590
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,793
You always take calls here.

591
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,841
I heard your voice
on the way to the nurse's office.

592
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:11,384
Are you feeling unwell?

593
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:13,720
I feel a little under the weather.

594
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:15,180
I see.

595
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:16,347
Get going, then.

596
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:20,185
If you're free

597
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:22,979
could we talk for a moment?

598
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:38,870
COME TO THE ART ROOM
MAKE SURE TO ERASE THIS

599
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:18,243
SIM SUNG HEE

600
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:21,955
This girl.

601
00:42:24,499 --> 00:42:26,501
Sim Sung Hee just left the classroom.

602
00:42:29,337 --> 00:42:30,338
Ah Jin.

603
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:32,340
Do we have to wait longer?

604
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:35,927
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

605
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,346
Just feel free to tell me. It's fine.

606
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:39,931
Could...

607
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,476
Could you hold my hand?

608
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:45,979
Your hand?

609
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:49,274
My hands shake when I get nervous.

610
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:10,920
I know you've been
looking out for me.

611
00:43:11,754 --> 00:43:13,464
So, I also thought a lot about it.

612
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:19,262
About what you told me before.

613
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:20,972
True Love.

614
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:26,728
No freaking way.

615
00:43:28,646 --> 00:43:29,814
Back then

616
00:43:30,732 --> 00:43:33,026
I was looking out for you.

617
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:35,445
Now, I understand your feelings.

618
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:38,031
"Your feelings"?

619
00:43:41,075 --> 00:43:44,579
I was afraid my friends would
find out, so I tried to deny it.

620
00:43:44,662 --> 00:43:46,331
But I've been regretting it.

621
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:50,460
It must have been hard for you
to tell me first.

622
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:51,628
No.

623
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,297
I just want you to--

624
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,591
I'll do whatever you ask.

625
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:00,386
I think I'm ready now.

626
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:16,402
Thanks for the help.

627
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:18,279
It would have taken forever
by myself.

628
00:44:18,363 --> 00:44:20,365
Don't mention it.
It's not a big deal.

629
00:44:20,448 --> 00:44:22,784
The bell's about to ring.
Let's head in.

630
00:44:26,204 --> 00:44:27,955
But I'm not sure if it's all right.

631
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:29,749
What do you mean?

632
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:31,334
Didn't we finish the equipment check?

633
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:34,128
It's not that.
You know I'm on duty today.

634
00:44:34,212 --> 00:44:35,672
I was going to lock up our classroom

635
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:38,091
but I couldn't find the padlock,
so I just left.

636
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,177
You know our class is extra sensitive

637
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,179
because it's been broken into
a few times.

638
00:44:43,262 --> 00:44:44,889
Should you be announcing that?

639
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:46,349
What?

640
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:48,101
If our room actually gets robbed

641
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:50,978
isn't it partly on you
for not locking it?

642
00:44:51,062 --> 00:44:53,606
If we never catch the person,
like last time

643
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,275
the classmates might blame you.

644
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:00,780
You never know.

645
00:45:00,863 --> 00:45:02,865
Better safe than sorry.

646
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,034
Man, it's hot.

647
00:45:05,118 --> 00:45:06,661
Changing out of PE gear
is such a hassle.

648
00:45:06,744 --> 00:45:08,037
Dude, you stink.

649
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:09,789
Sung Hee, didn't you go to the nurse?

650
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:11,249
What happened to my desk?

651
00:45:11,332 --> 00:45:13,459
Someone went through it.

652
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:14,585
You didn't do it?

653
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:15,753
Where's the envelope?

654
00:45:18,923 --> 00:45:20,425
- The envelope.
- What's wrong?

655
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:22,385
The envelope's gone.

656
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:25,596
No way. I'm sure
you put it somewhere else.

657
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,683
No, I didn't.
I tucked it in my notebook.

658
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:32,603
I always keep it there.
It was there before PE for sure.

659
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,231
Sung Hee.

660
00:45:35,648 --> 00:45:37,233
Why were you alone in the classroom?

661
00:45:37,608 --> 00:45:40,278
I wasn't feeling well,
so I got some rest.

662
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:42,405
How did you open the door?

663
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,824
It was already unlocked.

664
00:45:44,907 --> 00:45:46,659
I definitely locked it.

665
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,953
He says he locked it!

666
00:45:49,036 --> 00:45:50,955
You should have gone to the nurse
if you were sick.

667
00:45:51,038 --> 00:45:53,124
- Why rest here?
- Exactly.

668
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:55,877
Didn't she tell the PE teacher
she was going to the nurse?

669
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,380
Sung Hee, just answer me straight.

670
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:01,841
- Did you steal it?
- Goddamn it.

671
00:46:01,924 --> 00:46:03,259
Are you being serious right now?

672
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:05,678
What if there's nothing in my bag?

673
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,763
Then what?

674
00:46:07,805 --> 00:46:09,891
What if there's nothing?

675
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:12,059
Then, I won't let it slide.

676
00:46:17,148 --> 00:46:18,316
Here.

677
00:46:18,816 --> 00:46:21,152
Look for yourself.

678
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:23,696
Is it there?

679
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,906
Take a look.

680
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:26,616
- Hey.
- There's no envelope.

681
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:28,659
We haven't checked her locker yet.

682
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,289
You even put a padlock.

683
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:35,333
Is there something important?

684
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:38,252
Important? There's nothing.

685
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,506
Don't violate my privacy.

686
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:44,634
Privacy, huh?

687
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:58,105
Isn't this my phone?

688
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:03,110
I was keeping it safe
after you lost it.

689
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:06,197
But you never came to school,
so I couldn't give it to you.

690
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,406
Then, what about this?

691
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:11,869
Aren't these the class rep's AirPods
and the cash envelope?

692
00:47:11,953 --> 00:47:14,330
- Is this for real?
- So creepy.

693
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:21,754
Sung Hee, do you still deny it?

694
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:25,508
It wasn't me.

695
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:27,134
I swear!

696
00:47:27,218 --> 00:47:29,262
I've got no reason to steal them!

697
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:31,013
It's not like my family's poor.

698
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:34,016
You used to steal in middle school
due to your klepto episodes.

699
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,351
- Seriously?
- No way.

700
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,186
Shouldn't we call the police?

701
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,729
- She's nuts.
- That's crazy.

702
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:45,403
Don't cry. It's not over yet.

703
00:47:46,737 --> 00:47:50,116
Baek Ah Jin!
I got caught in her trap!

704
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:54,203
What the hell?

705
00:47:57,164 --> 00:48:00,585
She's worse trash than I am.

706
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:03,796
You all need to know
what she really is!

707
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:06,215
Kim Jae Oh's ledger?

708
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:08,175
The real owner is her.

709
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:11,888
It was all her, you fucking idiots!

710
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:13,472
What are you talking about?

711
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:15,099
Hey.

712
00:48:15,182 --> 00:48:16,392
That ledger's mine.

713
00:48:17,518 --> 00:48:18,644
Who says it's hers?

714
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:21,397
Do you have proof?

715
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,232
I saw the texts on your phone.

716
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:27,320
Stuff about collections with a boss,
with the kids' names listed!

717
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:30,323
Do you think we're close enough
to text each other?

718
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:32,533
I saw it, damn it.

719
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:35,578
Here.

720
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:40,374
Where are these texts, then?

721
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,251
MESSAGES

722
00:48:43,044 --> 00:48:44,045
Why?

723
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,466
If it were true,
shouldn't they be on this phone?

724
00:48:49,342 --> 00:48:52,261
But this is my first time
touching my phone

725
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:53,804
since you stole it.

726
00:48:53,888 --> 00:48:57,433
Fuck, it's starting to piss me off.

727
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:00,144
You stole my phone

728
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:01,729
and snooped through my messages?

729
00:49:04,649 --> 00:49:07,360
That bitch is in a relationship
with the art teacher.

730
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:08,444
I saw it.

731
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:10,029
I really did.

732
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:11,405
They were holding hands.

733
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:14,617
They were talking about true love.

734
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,160
It was quite a show.

735
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:17,370
Sim Sung Hee!

736
00:49:19,872 --> 00:49:21,040
Ma'am.

737
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:22,458
Watch your mouth.

738
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,085
What a psycho.

739
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:25,962
I'll tell you a secret, too.

740
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:28,297
Do you know
who our homeroom teacher is marrying?

741
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:29,757
It's the art teacher.

742
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,051
How dare you speak of such a thing?

743
00:49:32,677 --> 00:49:33,886
Calm down, please.

744
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:37,223
Ah Jin, you explain.
What is this about?

745
00:49:38,766 --> 00:49:43,145
The art teacher was really worried
about me and suggested counseling.

746
00:49:43,854 --> 00:49:47,400
He introduced me
to the True Love Counseling Center.

747
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:51,070
- She must have heard that.
- What a liar.

748
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:55,116
You heard that and claimed

749
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,369
that they were in a relationship
and caused this scene?

750
00:49:58,452 --> 00:50:01,330
Also, did you really steal all these?
Answer me!

751
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:03,416
No, I didn't!

752
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:06,002
You were the only one
in the classroom during PE.

753
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:08,546
Why were you here alone
if you had no reason to steal?

754
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:11,048
I heard you told the PE teacher
you were going to the nurse!

755
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:16,303
That's...

756
00:50:18,764 --> 00:50:20,516
I was supposed to meet Jun Seo.

757
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:22,393
Yoon Jun Seo.

758
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:24,812
Is this true?

759
00:50:26,272 --> 00:50:30,443
I was in the equipment room
the whole time with the PE captain.

760
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:31,569
He was.

761
00:50:32,194 --> 00:50:34,321
How could you do this to me?

762
00:50:38,576 --> 00:50:40,369
How could you do this to me, Jun Seo?

763
00:50:42,913 --> 00:50:46,876
I warned you
to quit messing with Ah Jin.

764
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:55,801
That's it, Sung Hee.

765
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,011
Come with me.

766
00:50:58,679 --> 00:50:59,680
Now!

767
00:51:00,931 --> 00:51:03,142
I'm not going!

768
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:08,773
- That was epic.
- I know, right?

769
00:51:08,856 --> 00:51:10,316
- Should we post this online?
- Post it.

770
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,828
Aren't these the class rep's AirPods
and the cash envelope?

771
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:24,330
I swear!

772
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:26,415
I've got no reason to steal them!

773
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:28,292
It's not like my family's poor.

774
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:31,462
You used to steal in middle school
due to your klepto episodes.

775
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:41,597
THE TRUTH OF SIM SUNG HEE,
ATTORNEY SIM GEUN SEOP'S DAUGHTER

776
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,266
SHE TRIED TO GET ALONG WITH HER
CLASSMATES UNLIKE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL

777
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,478
SIM GEUN SEOP

778
00:51:47,561 --> 00:51:53,776
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY

779
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:59,281
THE TRUTH OF SIM GEUN SEOP'S DAUGHTER

780
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:04,954
COMPLETE

781
00:52:05,037 --> 00:52:06,330
LEGAL CONSULTING PROFESSIONALS

782
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:08,749
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY

783
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:11,710
THE TRUTH OF SIM GEUN SEOP'S DAUGHTER

784
00:52:11,794 --> 00:52:12,837
YOU DON'T GET TO CRITICIZE CRIMINALS

785
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,088
TEACH YOUR DAUGHTER
SOME DECENCY FIRST

786
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:16,423
STILL GOING TO PRACTICE LAW
AFTER THIS?

787
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:17,800
She's not my child!

788
00:52:17,883 --> 00:52:20,594
How could you do this to me?
Did you have fun with that woman?

789
00:52:20,678 --> 00:52:22,012
"Have fun"?

790
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,514
Keep your dignity, okay?

791
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:25,766
"Dignity"?
Keep some dignity for yourself!

792
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,476
Did you sleep with her?

793
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,825
- Leaving early?
- What?

794
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,160
Get out of my face.

795
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:46,912
I told you.

796
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,666
In movies, the clueless ones
like you always die first.

797
00:52:52,293 --> 00:52:54,086
Shut up, you bitch.

798
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,588
Because of you--

799
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:57,256
Don't say it's because of me.

800
00:52:58,382 --> 00:52:59,383
This is all on you.

801
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,011
You touched my stuff

802
00:53:02,094 --> 00:53:03,470
poured water on me

803
00:53:03,554 --> 00:53:05,806
and even trashed my lunch tray.

804
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,934
But I let it all slide.

805
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:12,897
Do you think I don't know
that you framed me as a thief?

806
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,274
If you had been a bit less stupid

807
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:17,234
this might have gone differently.

808
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:18,819
What?

809
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:21,113
Do you honestly think

810
00:53:21,572 --> 00:53:23,741
that handwriting on the board
was Jun Seo's?

811
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:27,620
At this point,
it doesn't matter who wrote it.

812
00:53:27,703 --> 00:53:31,749
What matters is
that no one will listen to you

813
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:34,752
that no one will believe you...

814
00:53:36,921 --> 00:53:39,590
and that no one will like you.

815
00:53:40,841 --> 00:53:43,469
You psycho freak.

816
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:46,055
You never once doubted Jun Seo?

817
00:53:46,597 --> 00:53:49,391
Did you genuinely think
he was into you?

818
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:53,479
In your dreams, Sung Hee.

819
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,523
That's why

820
00:53:57,358 --> 00:53:59,276
you should have known your limits.

821
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,321
Fighting me only hurts you.

822
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:05,199
I've got powerful parents.

823
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,743
And you don't.

824
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,704
Since you're an orphan.

825
00:54:10,788 --> 00:54:12,122
Fuck.

826
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:14,250
- You think I'll let this slide?
- Sung Hee.

827
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:19,004
Who do you think
Ms. Kwak had an affair with?

828
00:54:23,217 --> 00:54:25,052
That Ms. Kwak.

829
00:54:25,135 --> 00:54:27,471
She got fired,
and all that cash went to waste.

830
00:54:27,554 --> 00:54:29,723
Who did she get caught
cheating with, anyway?

831
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:32,685
She said she needed legal help,
so even your dad had to step in.

832
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:34,728
Did you like my gift?

833
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,570
Once your father gets branded
as an adulterous lawyer...

834
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,992
even his law firm won't protect him.

835
00:54:48,075 --> 00:54:50,452
His reputation will be tainted

836
00:54:50,536 --> 00:54:54,290
and you'll become the thief daughter
of an adulterous lawyer.

837
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:57,918
Will your parents still stand
behind you when that happens?

838
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,631
Can you live with that label
for the rest of your life?

839
00:55:03,757 --> 00:55:07,761
You really thought
you could beat me, didn't you?

840
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:12,474
You can't, Sung Hee.

841
00:55:15,394 --> 00:55:16,895
As you said

842
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:19,315
I'm practically an orphan.

843
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:23,485
But it's not like I was born
without parents.

844
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:43,839
Help...

845
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:49,720
I just remember her as my first X.

846
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:55,851
LIM SUN YE: HER FIRST X

847
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:03,150
Sung Hee.

848
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:08,614
Thank you for being my target.

849
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:14,495
Truly.

850
00:56:16,163 --> 00:56:18,290
You made school life
so much less boring.

851
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:35,516
What do I think of Baek Ah Jin?

852
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,062
Her acting has
always been exceptional.

853
00:56:42,022 --> 00:56:44,983
She switched masks
whenever it suited her needs.

854
00:56:47,444 --> 00:56:49,488
She's a devil.

855
00:56:50,614 --> 00:56:52,574
A devil

856
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:54,827
wearing human skin.

857
00:56:57,287 --> 00:57:01,750
DEAR X

858
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:23,809
