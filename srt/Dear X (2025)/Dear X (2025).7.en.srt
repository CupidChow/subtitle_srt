1
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:56,722
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,432
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

3
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:49,483
Boss.

4
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:53,445
That really hurts.

5
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,073
So that's what love does to people.

6
00:01:56,698 --> 00:02:00,160
You really got that fired up
over a few insults?

7
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,206
Just out of curiosity

8
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,127
did you really think
you could take those guys?

9
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,672
I just wanted to get my ass kicked.
Hard enough to knock my senses out.

10
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:14,591
You're a pervert, aren't you?

11
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:18,220
You're totally my type.

12
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:40,909
NEWSHOUND HEE-KOOK

13
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:44,454
What's going on
between Ah-jin and In-gang?

14
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:45,539
Did you call for a driver?

15
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,377
They were making out.
Did he dump you for her?

16
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:54,173
Lena, are you there?

17
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:56,175
Are you in shock?

18
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:33,629
Be careful.

19
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:38,133
Lena's cousin, reporter Lim Hee-kook,
knows about you and In-gang.

20
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:59,071
EPISODE 7: THE WHEEL OF FATE

21
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:03,450
Do you know how damaging
a scandal like this can be for you?

22
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:08,830
I'll try to keep the press at bay,
but you need to end things with him.

23
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:11,250
It's better to end it now

24
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,669
than let a messy relationship
make things awkward at work.

25
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:15,796
Ms. Seo.

26
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,633
This isn't some casual fling.

27
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:22,010
We really like each other.

28
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,095
Are you joking?

29
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,890
You're a smart girl,
so stop acting like you don't get it.

30
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:29,518
This isn't the right time
for you to be dating.

31
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,647
Did you get this photo
from Lim Hee-kook?

32
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,731
Why do you ask?

33
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,108
I'll talk to him.

34
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,068
He doesn't like you. You know that.

35
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:40,529
If he reached out to you
before running the story

36
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,656
he must be after something.

37
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,867
I'd like to talk to him in person.

38
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,494
What are you going to do?

39
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:48,912
I'll hear him out

40
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,873
and if the terms are acceptable,
I'll cut a deal.

41
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:06,596
I'll see myself out
so the two of you can talk.

42
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:25,324
What happened?

43
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:30,370
You said yourself
you wanted nothing to do with her.

44
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,956
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

45
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,543
I didn't expect this to happen.

46
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,378
Forget about her for a second.

47
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:41,131
Do you know how bad this scandal
will make you look?

48
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:43,508
You just announced
your breakup with Lena.

49
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:46,720
People will call it a rebound,
and you'll get slammed for it.

50
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,847
Things like this
don't sit well with the public.

51
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,724
How are you going to handle that?

52
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:52,309
Mi-ri.

53
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,145
I'm no longer afraid of that.

54
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,190
I'm not taking this lightly either.

55
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,068
I'll take whatever comes.

56
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,612
- You really--
- I'd really love it

57
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:06,281
if you could give us your blessing.

58
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,077
Give us your support.

59
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,289
You'll do that, right?

60
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:34,184
I heard you're good at your job

61
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,311
so I wanted to treat you to a meal.

62
00:06:37,854 --> 00:06:41,274
You know how touchy folks are
about scandals these days.

63
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,903
He started dating you
the moment he broke up with Lena.

64
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:49,699
That's the kind of thing
that can ruin a beloved actor.

65
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,787
You're not very good
at making threats.

66
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,331
Save that speech for In-gang.

67
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,167
I don't have much to lose
from this relationship.

68
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:02,003
If anything,
it might even spark some curiosity.

69
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,130
Fine.

70
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:04,881
In that case

71
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:08,343
I'll release this article as well.

72
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:13,515
BAEK AH-JIN BECOMES
HEO IN-GANG'S GIRL

73
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,352
Don't you think
that headline is a little tacky?

74
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:19,604
- Excuse me?
- Change the headline

75
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:22,023
to "Baek Ah-jin, the woman
who captured In-gang's heart."

76
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,486
Listen, Ms. Baek.

77
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:31,199
Mr. Lim, I hear you're Lena's cousin.

78
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,161
Cousins hang out when they're kids.

79
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:36,246
And as adults,
exchange occasional texts.

80
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:39,958
So why don't you leave it at that
and get friendly with me instead?

81
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,918
I don't need friends.

82
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,755
But I'm all ears
if you're offering something else.

83
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,840
Do you mean money?

84
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,890
You're already getting a salary,
so I don't need to pad your pockets.

85
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,642
You know how it is.

86
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:01,271
People are always curious
about celebrity relationships.

87
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:04,774
Someone else's love life
is always more entertaining.

88
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:08,278
I was hoping you'd be the one
to write those entertaining pieces.

89
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,489
So? What's the catch?

90
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:13,366
If you accept my offer right now

91
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,413
I'll give you the exclusive rights
to our love story.

92
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,708
Of course, this stays between us.

93
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,421
You can use the photos
in this flash drive.

94
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:32,469
Who took these photos?

95
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:35,263
I'm giving them to you
so you don't have to tail me.

96
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,516
And I'll keep them coming.

97
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,143
You won't regret this.

98
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:42,771
I guarantee you

99
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:46,566
that my love story will be fiery
and impossible to ignore.

100
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:51,071
Rising star Baek Ah-jin
and actor Heo In-gang

101
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:54,533
were spotted
on a private outing in Gangnam.

102
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:58,495
As news of their blossoming romance
sweeps across the country

103
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:00,872
fans appear split.

104
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:04,751
Some are thrilled,
saying the two look perfect together.

105
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,087
Others, however,
are criticizing the timing

106
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,340
accusing him of moving on too quickly
after his breakup with Lena.

107
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:14,261
Whatever the truth may be,
it's a new beginning for the couple.

108
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:18,139
So rather than dragging them down,
we should show them a little support.

109
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:24,813
- Hyang-i.
- Yes?

110
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,816
- Are you going on a date today?
- No.

111
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,695
Come on.
It's written all over your face.

112
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:33,863
Is it a blind date?

113
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,407
Something like that.

114
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,741
What time?

115
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:37,826
It's at 7 p.m.

116
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,452
Why do you ask?

117
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,496
I'll let the salon know.

118
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,748
Get your hair done nicely
and have fun.

119
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,626
Thank you so much, Ah-jin!

120
00:09:47,502 --> 00:09:50,005
- And don't drink too much.
- I won't.

121
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:52,048
You get way too honest
when you drink.

122
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,675
Okay, I promise.

123
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,594
I'll watch my mouth.

124
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:59,306
Why are you so handsome?

125
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:02,350
You're a manager

126
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,103
so you must meet
a lot of good-looking celebrities.

127
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:08,315
Being a manager
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

128
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:11,735
You have no idea
how much dirt we have to deal with.

129
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:15,739
Did you take the blame
for someone else's crime?

130
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,407
How did you know that?

131
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,912
No. You didn't hear it from me.

132
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,498
Don't do that to me.

133
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,334
I'll keep it to myself, so tell me.

134
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:28,418
No.

135
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:35,592
Hyang-i.

136
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,223
Talking to someone can help you
get things off your chest.

137
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,018
I promise I'll keep it a secret.

138
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,110
You can't tell anyone about this.

139
00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:00,575
A few years back...

140
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,065
- Hyang-i.
- Yes?

141
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,401
Thanks for telling me.

142
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:37,612
Don't tell anyone else.

143
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:43,284
I'm supposed to take a break?

144
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,995
- There must be scripts coming in.
- There are.

145
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,875
But the other actors turn it down
when they find out you're the lead.

146
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,335
You have to accept it.

147
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,088
Who would want to work with
an actress who beat up a junior?

148
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,339
Seriously.

149
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:58,174
I slapped her once.

150
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:00,218
Twice, tops.

151
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:01,970
And I had my reasons.

152
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:04,472
Do you know how she got back at me?

153
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,349
You know how ruthless she is.

154
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:07,892
What am I going to do with you?

155
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:09,602
What's with that look?

156
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,896
You still haven't come
to your senses.

157
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,566
Get out of here.

158
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:37,046
When Lena got caught driving drunk

159
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,842
I covered for her
and said I was the one driving.

160
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,428
I was even interrogated

161
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:46,055
for supposedly
driving under the influence.

162
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,474
Lena.

163
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:58,985
Why do you look so surprised?

164
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:11,331
Well, I warned you

165
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:13,792
not to mess with me.

166
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:17,629
Why won't you ever listen?

167
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:23,718
It kind of kills the fun
if you're already making that face.

168
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:27,013
Tell me you didn't
release this video yet.

169
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,141
You didn't, right?

170
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:31,643
Oh, dear.

171
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,605
Is that what you want to know?

172
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:39,442
Please, Ah-jin.
If this goes public, I'm finished.

173
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,194
You can take everything from me.

174
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,612
Just help me.

175
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,490
Who says you're finished?

176
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:51,830
You're not.
This is just the beginning.

177
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,290
Hell doesn't end with a single blow.

178
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,851
See?

179
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:14,894
This won't be ending anytime soon.

180
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:24,112
That's why you should've
listened to me.

181
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,325
I wouldn't have taken it this far
if you had left me alone.

182
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,497
Don't ever think about
coming back to this business.

183
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,082
And spare yourself the fantasy

184
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:38,459
that you can disappear
for a few years and sneak back in.

185
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,336
Don't beg me to save you either.

186
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,714
Because I won't.

187
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:45,925
Own it, Lena.

188
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,012
Or let yourself crumble.

189
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:55,935
No.

190
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,898
What do I do?

191
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:26,716
Did you see the video?

192
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:32,639
This is all because you couldn't keep
your mouth shut.

193
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:36,392
I told you to watch what you say.

194
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:41,022
This isn't going to work between us.

195
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:45,443
How am I supposed to trust you
after what you spilled?

196
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:47,487
Wouldn't you agree?

197
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,908
Consider today your last day.

198
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:55,662
Ah-jin.

199
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:01,626
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

200
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,504
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

201
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:06,673
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
HONG KYUNG-SUK

202
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,885
This is my favorite color.

203
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,470
I'm glad you like it.

204
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:13,805
Thank you, Ah-jin.

205
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:17,141
All right. One, two, three.

206
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:21,312
This has been such a lovely birthday.

207
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,491
WINTER SLEEP

208
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,937
How was your trip?

209
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:09,110
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN'S OUTFITS
AT THE AIRPORT

210
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:26,044
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN
ON SUMMER VACATION

211
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:55,364
I'm deeply in love with her.

212
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:57,658
So, I hope you guys understand.

213
00:17:57,742 --> 00:17:59,744
Show my Ah-jin some love.

214
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:01,662
LIVE

215
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,522
HEO IN-GANG AND BAEK AH-JIN
CAUGHT ON THE CUTEST DATE

216
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,524
#LOVESTAGRAM #COUPLE
#BAEKGANG #COUPLEVIBES

217
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,409
Were you writing again?

218
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:42,411
I knew it.

219
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,833
You obviously skipped breakfast.
Don't tell me you also skipped lunch.

220
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,043
I brought you lunch just in case.

221
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,629
I'm finishing up. You can eat first.

222
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,506
Why don't you just join me?

223
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:55,842
I bought this for you.

224
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:03,474
Ta-da.

225
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:05,184
Here.

226
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,479
Are you busy tonight?

227
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:09,981
No. Why?

228
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,484
Let's go to the premiere
of the movie Ah-jin is in.

229
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,823
I just want to see if she's any good.

230
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:20,783
I'll laugh at her if she's bad.

231
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:23,369
Eat up.

232
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,670
Hi, I'm Baek Ah-jin.

233
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:34,255
VIP SCREENING
THE WOMAN WITH A SUITCASE

234
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:37,049
I played Myo-hui.

235
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,969
We had a lot of fun
filming this movie.

236
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:45,099
Watching Myo-hui spiral into madness
should give you chills.

237
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,435
Thank you for coming.
I hope you enjoy the movie.

238
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:48,519
Thank you.

239
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,824
THE WOMAN WITH A SUITCASE

240
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:18,299
Jun-seo, you'll help me, right?

241
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:25,139
Don't worry, Jun-seo.

242
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,018
I'll date him for exactly a year.

243
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,315
That's all I need.

244
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:48,120
Reporters who saw the screening
are already writing their pieces

245
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:49,622
and they're pretty favorable.

246
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,668
I'm proud of you, Ah-jin.

247
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,430
You smell nice.

248
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:08,557
What cologne did you use today?

249
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:11,978
I forgot to put any on.

250
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:16,899
Then keep it that way.

251
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,487
I like your natural scent
better than any cologne.

252
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:27,827
I like you better than anything.

253
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:44,176
Out gallivanting
instead of writing until this hour?

254
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:48,723
Keep acting like a wife,
and I'll change the door code.

255
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:52,935
Honey, what does "co-offender" mean?

256
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,186
You don't need to know.

257
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:56,939
I'll just look it up.

258
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:03,904
"A person who, together with others,
directly carries out an act

259
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:06,115
that satisfies the elements
of a criminal offense

260
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:08,409
of the act itself"?

261
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,289
Why the sudden interest in my book?

262
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,544
I'm suddenly interested in you.

263
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,636
Did Ah-jin call you?

264
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:30,097
She doesn't call me nowadays.

265
00:22:33,517 --> 00:22:34,685
I guess she's happy.

266
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:41,442
No.

267
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,569
When the boss needs me

268
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:46,530
it means something bad
has happened to her.

269
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,325
So no news means good news.

270
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:51,410
But...

271
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:03,047
If I'm being honest,
I wish she would call me.

272
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,467
I don't know.

273
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:11,097
Want to grab a drink?

274
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:12,932
No.

275
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:15,393
Go home.

276
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,817
I don't have a home.

277
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,277
And if I leave, you'll die.

278
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:28,239
Of boredom.

279
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:47,049
MOM

280
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:50,553
Pick up your phone. It's so loud.

281
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:52,930
I'm trying to read here.

282
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:01,230
Why won't you pick up?

283
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:06,777
MOM

284
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:09,697
Dude.

285
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:11,907
You can't do that to your mother.

286
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:15,161
How bad is it between you two
that you keep dodging her calls?

287
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:18,372
You're a horrible son.

288
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:29,341
Why aren't you answering my calls?

289
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,927
The money you send me
is downright insulting.

290
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:38,893
Jun-seo.

291
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:41,937
I'll give you a week.

292
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:45,274
Wire the money within a week.

293
00:24:57,077 --> 00:25:01,332
Don't let my mom know
about Grandpa's condition.

294
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,669
If she comes by, just send her away.

295
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,339
Do you get what I'm saying?

296
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,217
Yes, I do.

297
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,052
Don't worry, Mr. Yoon.

298
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:32,571
All done, ma'am.

299
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:35,407
Thank you.

300
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:07,147
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT

301
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:08,691
LONGSTAR ENTERTAINMENT

302
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,538
Did you put him up to it?

303
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:25,082
You made him invest
in your company, didn't you?

304
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,668
You haven't changed one bit.

305
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,587
Doesn't it get tiring?

306
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,755
You talked him into it.

307
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,632
You only play the mother
because you're after

308
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:35,050
your illegitimate
child's inheritance.

309
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:36,677
So you have no right
to say that to me.

310
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:41,140
That doesn't work on me anymore.

311
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:43,392
So, you want Jun-seo to die.

312
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:45,394
Don't you know

313
00:26:45,894 --> 00:26:49,315
how much he loves
his dad and grandpa?

314
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:52,526
If he finds out
he isn't the biological son

315
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,777
what do you think will happen?

316
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:57,197
If you're set on destroying him

317
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:58,949
be my guest.

318
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:03,078
I'm sick of this.

319
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:12,588
Hi.

320
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,635
Thank you.

321
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:20,721
- Can we get a photo?
- Just one photo.

322
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:21,805
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

323
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:24,516
One, two, three.

324
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:28,354
Don't cry.

325
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,148
It's not over yet.

326
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:36,028
You all need to know
what she really is!

327
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:39,156
It was all her, you fucking idiots!

328
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:54,672
You really thought
you could beat me, didn't you?

329
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:59,343
Thank you for making my school life
so much less boring.

330
00:28:05,307 --> 00:28:07,893
I'm exposing
who Baek Ah-jin really is.

331
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:12,439
We were classmates in 11th grade.

332
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,525
She was the devil.

333
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:19,655
She extorted money
from the other students at school.

334
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:23,325
And she framed me for theft,
so I even had to transfer schools.

335
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:29,790
What kind of messed-up world
lets someone like her be a celebrity?

336
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,000
It's absurd.

337
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:35,087
None of this is a lie.

338
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:38,465
I'll answer any questions
you have for me.

339
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:41,009
EXTORTION, BLACKMAIL
FALSE ACCUSATION

340
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:42,302
RAN A STUDENT LOAN SCHEME...

341
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:43,512
STIRRED UP TROUBLE...

342
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,433
Is this for real, guys?

343
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:51,270
Baek Ah-jin's shocking past
has been brought to light.

344
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:54,231
A single post
on a forum is blowing up.

345
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:56,692
"I'm exposing
who Baek Ah-jin really is.

346
00:28:56,775 --> 00:28:59,695
We were classmates in 11th grade.

347
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:01,071
She was the devil."

348
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:03,782
You can tell from the first line
that this is big.

349
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,451
But this is where...

350
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:07,995
I think I know who this is.
Are you Sim Sung-hee?

351
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:09,371
Wait, I think I remember her.

352
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:12,916
She stole stuff and spread rumors,
so she was transferred.

353
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,836
Everyone who grew up in Nojeong-gu
knows who she is.

354
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,172
If you have a conscience,
delete this post.

355
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:19,715
Wow, she's still at it.

356
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:23,135
Sung-hee,
you're still the same crazy bitch.

357
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,054
It's not true.

358
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,599
You saw how it was deleted instantly.

359
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:31,226
I was a model student back in school.

360
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,774
Fine. I'll take your word for it.

361
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:40,861
Fortunately, it doesn't look like
the media will blow it up.

362
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:44,782
We'll chalk it up to
some hater acting out.

363
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:49,411
On the bright side,
I'm receiving positive comments too.

364
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:50,954
I get a little shy reading them.

365
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,750
You think this is funny?

366
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,713
You're really stressing me out here.

367
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:03,050
Things like this
could come back to bite you.

368
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,803
And that would be a real headache.

369
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:07,596
Especially the reporters.

370
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,682
Be careful around them, okay?

371
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,685
I will. Don't worry.

372
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:16,855
I'm trusting you on this.

373
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:22,820
Will you be okay sleeping without me?

374
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:24,655
Should I ask my grandma to come over?

375
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,532
No, it's fine.

376
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:29,451
I'll get some sleep
and call you later.

377
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:34,122
Okay. Sleep tight.

378
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:24,548
Ah-jin.

379
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:31,722
Ah-jin.

380
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:35,517
Ah-jin?

381
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:42,441
- Ah-jin.
- Ah-jin!

382
00:31:53,368 --> 00:31:54,786
Ah-jin!

383
00:31:58,081 --> 00:31:59,166
Ah-jin.

384
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,044
Ah-jin?

385
00:32:43,377 --> 00:32:45,128
How sick are you?

386
00:32:46,171 --> 00:32:48,715
What brings you here?

387
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:55,889
You should have told me
if you were sick.

388
00:32:58,266 --> 00:32:59,476
Grandma.

389
00:33:00,435 --> 00:33:04,815
You should've rung the doorbell.
How long were you out there?

390
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:06,608
Think about yourself right now.

391
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:11,113
Do I have to hear from In-gang
that you're sick?

392
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,533
It must've been cold out there.

393
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,912
You get used to the cold
when you're old.

394
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,877
You must've been scared, dear.

395
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,174
Being alone
when you're sick is scary.

396
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:32,259
Come on.

397
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:41,018
Go on. Eat up.

398
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:09,337
Once you get better,
let's go get some fresh air.

399
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:52,214
I fed a stray once.

400
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,220
And the next day,
she came back with her kitten.

401
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,933
She must've wanted me to help.

402
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,728
She must've wanted me
to help her kitten.

403
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,315
Even that tiny creature was a mother.

404
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:14,402
That's just how mothers are.

405
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:20,117
She's such a pretty little thing.

406
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:25,205
I'll show her to you someday.

407
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:28,125
Okay.

408
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,381
Ah-jin.

409
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:38,844
No matter what happens,
I'm on your side.

410
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:44,558
Even if everything
they wrote about you was true

411
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:50,272
I know you must've had your reasons.

412
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:59,364
I know how gentle and kind you are.

413
00:36:03,785 --> 00:36:05,162
Everyone...

414
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:10,750
says I'm a bad person.

415
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:18,633
What am I...

416
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,179
to you?

417
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:31,688
A gift...

418
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:37,527
A gift from my daughter.

419
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,447
Just like In-gang and In-mo

420
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:43,450
you're my child.

421
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:14,314
Grandma.

422
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:15,857
Yes?

423
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:18,693
It's 1-2-2-5.

424
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:20,779
What do you mean?

425
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:23,448
It's my door code.

426
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:27,369
You can come in anytime next time.

427
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:29,996
Don't wait in the cold
like last night.

428
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:31,748
It's 1-2-2-5.

429
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:34,584
That's the day Jesus was born.

430
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,211
He's Buddha's friend.

431
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:41,192
How did you even get here?

432
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,779
I tagged along on your business trip
as a little vacation.

433
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:48,908
I missed you so much, In-gang.

434
00:38:51,536 --> 00:38:52,537
Hey.

435
00:38:52,912 --> 00:38:55,206
You looked great out there today.

436
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,876
You literally killed it.

437
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,753
I know you better than that.

438
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:06,593
Why are you really here?

439
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:13,391
It's about Director Yong's new work.

440
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,853
We need to get back to him
by the end of the week.

441
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:18,980
When are you going
to give me an answer?

442
00:39:19,064 --> 00:39:20,607
I knew you didn't just drop by.

443
00:39:21,149 --> 00:39:22,317
What's the holdup?

444
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:25,070
You said you liked the script.

445
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:28,323
Mi-ri.

446
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:29,449
Yes?

447
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,453
I'm thinking of doing something else.

448
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:36,081
Something other
than dramas and movies?

449
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:38,416
Do you want to be on variety shows?

450
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,709
No, it's not that.

451
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:41,294
Then what?

452
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:45,340
Do you think I'm allowed to be happy?

453
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,635
Oh, my goodness.

454
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:51,429
What are you talking about?

455
00:39:53,014 --> 00:39:55,225
Lately,
I keep finding myself thinking

456
00:39:57,102 --> 00:39:58,853
"I'm happy.

457
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:02,357
This is what happiness feels like."

458
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:06,069
Hold on to that feeling
and stay happy at work.

459
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:08,530
When I'm with Ah-jin

460
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:11,282
it feels like a dream.

461
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:14,869
I catch myself smiling for no reason.

462
00:40:16,037 --> 00:40:17,455
People say I've gone mad.

463
00:40:18,998 --> 00:40:20,291
But I'm happy.

464
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:24,587
I'm so happy that it scares me.

465
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,341
I'm scared that this will end.

466
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,760
I'm afraid I'll be the one...

467
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:36,099
who destroys this happiness.

468
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:46,568
Don't tell me you're...

469
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:49,737
No. Stop jumping to conclusions.

470
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:54,826
I went to the department store
to buy Ah-jin a birthday gift

471
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:56,744
and happened to see some baby shoes.

472
00:40:57,495 --> 00:40:58,705
They were so cute.

473
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:02,625
I didn't even need them

474
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:06,212
but I couldn't walk away
from these tiny shoes.

475
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:07,797
So I bought them.

476
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:16,931
Are you considering marrying Ah-jin?

477
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:23,229
Does she want to marry you?

478
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:26,566
I'm not sure.

479
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,653
I hope she does.

480
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:35,492
Look how small it is.

481
00:41:53,718 --> 00:41:54,719
Ah-jin.

482
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:17,450
You seem surprised.

483
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:22,247
No, I'm glad to see you.

484
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:28,670
When did you get out?

485
00:42:29,003 --> 00:42:30,255
Not long ago.

486
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:33,383
I was released sooner than expected.

487
00:42:38,846 --> 00:42:40,723
You look healthy.

488
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:48,815
Are you at peace now?

489
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,986
Yes, a little.

490
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:54,862
And you got what you wanted?

491
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:01,869
All thanks to you.

492
00:43:04,664 --> 00:43:06,165
And how do you think I am?

493
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:10,086
You're a good person.

494
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:14,757
I'm sure you can make it
through anything.

495
00:43:15,675 --> 00:43:16,801
"Good person"?

496
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:21,639
How long do you think
I can stay that way?

497
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:27,812
Look who it is!

498
00:43:28,688 --> 00:43:30,064
Jung-ho, is that you?

499
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:32,317
What brings you here?

500
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:36,904
You told me it was a beautiful temple
and said that I should stop by.

501
00:43:37,196 --> 00:43:38,197
How have you been?

502
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:39,991
When did you get out?

503
00:43:40,074 --> 00:43:41,200
A couple of weeks ago.

504
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:44,537
Goodness. You went through so much.

505
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:47,457
This is my grandson.

506
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:52,170
And she's
my older grandson's girlfriend.

507
00:43:52,253 --> 00:43:54,881
Ma'am, we've already met.

508
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:56,799
You two know each other?

509
00:43:58,134 --> 00:43:59,135
Yes.

510
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:02,305
I had to make ends meet
after graduating from high school

511
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,098
and he helped me out a lot.

512
00:44:04,182 --> 00:44:05,183
I see.

513
00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:09,020
And I worked part-time
at his café for a year.

514
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:16,110
How do you know Mrs. Hong?

515
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:21,991
Well, we met at a temple...

516
00:44:22,075 --> 00:44:23,284
She came

517
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:27,038
to volunteer at the prison I was in.

518
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,336
Ma'am, I'll see you again soon.

519
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,297
I've always wanted to buy you a meal.

520
00:44:36,381 --> 00:44:38,508
I'd love that.

521
00:44:38,591 --> 00:44:40,385
Hold on.

522
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:43,179
- Give me your number.
- Sure.

523
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,267
Here you go.

524
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:50,853
I really hope we meet again.

525
00:44:51,604 --> 00:44:53,856
What a small world, you and Ah-jin.

526
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:20,717
He still hasn't come home?

527
00:45:23,886 --> 00:45:24,887
You're home.

528
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:26,806
What took you so long?

529
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,891
I missed you like crazy.

530
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,820
Who are you?

531
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:50,288
Who are you?

532
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:52,081
Why did you barge into
someone else's home?

533
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:54,083
Exactly! What are you doing
in someone else's house?

534
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:57,670
- What a pervert.
- "Pervert"?

535
00:45:58,045 --> 00:45:59,380
Why did you hug me?

536
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:01,591
You hugged me from behind!

537
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:02,800
Unbelievable.

538
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:10,975
Seriously.

539
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:15,438
You hide in a man's house
and hug him.

540
00:46:16,105 --> 00:46:18,816
Check his face first
if you're going to hug him.

541
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:22,445
I don't let just anyone
touch my body.

542
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:27,950
Did I steal a kiss
or take your pants off?

543
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:31,078
All I did was hug you from behind.

544
00:46:31,162 --> 00:46:32,413
I'm the one who's offended.

545
00:46:32,872 --> 00:46:34,332
But I'm the victim.

546
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:39,504
Jun-seo, that inconsiderate jerk.

547
00:46:40,004 --> 00:46:41,756
He should have warned me.

548
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:44,050
Guess he doesn't
tell you much either.

549
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,805
Let me ask you something.

550
00:46:49,722 --> 00:46:50,973
What are you two?

551
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:56,229
You know what? Never mind.

552
00:46:56,312 --> 00:46:57,647
I don't even have to ask.

553
00:46:58,147 --> 00:47:00,566
You wait for him at home and hug him.

554
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,360
That says it all.

555
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:04,362
I'm out.

556
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:05,905
What's your name?

557
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:09,617
Why do you ask?

558
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:14,956
We may be strangers,
but we did share a hug.

559
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:18,251
- Excuse me?
- I've never met his friend before.

560
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:23,381
I didn't know he had any friends,
so I figured I should get your name.

561
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:25,091
Ask him yourself.

562
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:33,683
Haven't we met before, though?

563
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:36,352
Not "we". You must've seen me.

564
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:38,062
On TV.

565
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:40,314
TV?

566
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:45,444
Right?

567
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:46,654
The celebrity!

568
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:49,156
The has-been--

569
00:47:56,664 --> 00:47:57,665
Sorry.

570
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,100
Hey, boss!

571
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:18,394
Is it really you?

572
00:48:19,145 --> 00:48:21,272
It's been a while, Jae-oh.

573
00:48:23,024 --> 00:48:24,150
Is something wrong?

574
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:27,236
No. Not yet.

575
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:31,449
What is it? You can tell me.

576
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:35,202
Okay.

577
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:38,080
All right.

578
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:41,000
Send me his info
as soon as you get it.

579
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:43,127
All right.

580
00:48:59,477 --> 00:49:00,645
Did Ah-jin call you?

581
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:03,356
How did you know?

582
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:06,984
You make a certain face
when you talk to her.

583
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:08,486
What face?

584
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:12,531
That's a face I want to punch.

585
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:13,824
Imagine how I felt.

586
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:20,665
If she's calling me

587
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,085
that means something's up.

588
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:26,128
Something doesn't feel right.

589
00:49:26,587 --> 00:49:27,964
How did she sound?

590
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:30,883
More depressed than usual.

591
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:35,596
Maybe I'm mistaken.

592
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:40,393
What did she want?

593
00:49:42,603 --> 00:49:44,522
She told me not to tell you.

594
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:52,780
Also, don't go home tonight.

595
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:54,240
There's a crazy girl.

596
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:23,644
There's good news shaking
both the literary and film worlds.

597
00:50:23,728 --> 00:50:25,813
A bestselling novel
that stirred major buzz

598
00:50:25,896 --> 00:50:28,274
is finally headed to the big screen.

599
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:31,068
Author Yoon Seok-ha,
winner of the Ennoble Literary Award

600
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:33,195
has announced that his latest work,
Winter Sleep

601
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:35,072
is being adapted into a film.

602
00:50:35,156 --> 00:50:37,533
Winter Sleep is a novel
about a man and a woman

603
00:50:37,616 --> 00:50:39,618
who reunite after parting ways

604
00:50:39,702 --> 00:50:44,874
slowly healing their past wounds
and rebuilding their love together.

605
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:48,627
Meanwhile, Yoon Seok-ha was spotted
on a date with actress Lena

606
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:50,254
sparking romance rumors.

607
00:50:50,337 --> 00:50:53,007
With Lena's name being mentioned
as the heroine of Winter Sleep

608
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,968
the online communities
are buzzing with speculation.

609
00:50:57,845 --> 00:50:59,555
CEO YOON JUN-SEO

610
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:16,322
You're Mr. Yoon Jun-seo, right?

611
00:51:17,698 --> 00:51:18,991
Do you know me?

612
00:51:20,826 --> 00:51:24,497
We haven't met,
but I know enough about you.

613
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:33,672
It's surprising enough that you,
the author of Winter Sleep

614
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:37,218
had been an anonymous investor
in Longstar for the past year.

615
00:51:37,676 --> 00:51:41,097
But it turns out you were
Ah-jin's secret benefactor too.

616
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,266
Is Ah-jin doing okay?

617
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:46,644
So you haven't seen her lately?

618
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:49,355
Are you curious
about her and In-gang?

619
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:52,108
I just want her happy.

620
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:57,571
She's confident and ambitious.
And she's loaded with talent.

621
00:51:57,655 --> 00:52:00,282
When she wants something,
she goes straight for it.

622
00:52:00,366 --> 00:52:03,244
And she can be mesmerizing
when needed.

623
00:52:03,327 --> 00:52:05,579
Is actor Heo In-gang okay?

624
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:09,708
Thanks for asking about him too.

625
00:52:11,085 --> 00:52:15,714
I was worried myself,
but he's happier than ever.

626
00:52:18,926 --> 00:52:22,221
In-gang isn't just one of our actors.

627
00:52:22,304 --> 00:52:24,515
He's like a brother
I deeply care about.

628
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:28,769
I would never let anything
make him unhappy.

629
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:31,814
I would never let anything
make Ah-jin unhappy, either.

630
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:34,191
You also need to honor
the contract terms.

631
00:52:34,942 --> 00:52:35,943
We will.

632
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,364
Ah-jin's burnt out,
even if she won't say it.

633
00:52:40,447 --> 00:52:41,866
She needs rest.

634
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:44,076
She's in her mid-20s.

635
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,370
She should be working, not resting.

636
00:52:47,037 --> 00:52:48,998
It's not about age.

637
00:52:49,415 --> 00:52:51,709
Don't tell me you're
seriously considering marrying her.

638
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:55,713
She has a big future ahead of her.

639
00:52:56,213 --> 00:52:58,215
Don't think about tying her down.

640
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:01,510
Why does it have to be her
for that show?

641
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:04,263
That was the author's condition.

642
00:53:04,346 --> 00:53:06,849
Studios are desperate
to adapt Winter Sleep

643
00:53:06,932 --> 00:53:09,268
so the competition was fierce.

644
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:13,480
What let our company win the bid
was exactly that condition.

645
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,735
This is hard, In-gang.

646
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:19,778
Let's talk later.

647
00:53:31,457 --> 00:53:32,541
Author Yoon Seok-ha?

648
00:53:33,584 --> 00:53:34,585
What about him?

649
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:36,170
You didn't see the news?

650
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:38,672
They say he's dating Lena.

651
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:40,549
Really? Good for them.

652
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:48,265
He's insisting that you star
in the drama adaptation of his work.

653
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:52,353
That was his condition
for investing in our company.

654
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:55,272
I heard.

655
00:53:57,358 --> 00:53:58,359
You knew?

656
00:53:58,692 --> 00:54:00,402
The script was decent.

657
00:54:00,986 --> 00:54:03,113
So I told him
I'd discuss it with you.

658
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:06,867
It seems that Ms. Seo
really wants me to do it.

659
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:08,869
What do you think?

660
00:54:10,913 --> 00:54:14,458
Let's think it over for one week.

661
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,126
Okay.

662
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:46,365
You're late.

663
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:51,120
You're the one who's late.

664
00:54:52,037 --> 00:54:53,706
It's been over a year.

665
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:57,543
You promised you'd come back.

666
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:02,881
Congratulations, you pulled it off.

667
00:55:05,718 --> 00:55:08,929
You blackmailed Ms. Seo with money,
poked at In-gang

668
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:10,639
and made me come to you.

669
00:55:12,808 --> 00:55:13,809
I'm impressed.

670
00:55:14,268 --> 00:55:16,395
You're the one making me this way.

671
00:55:19,273 --> 00:55:20,649
Ms. Seo told me.

672
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:23,944
Why?

673
00:55:25,696 --> 00:55:26,864
I wanted to help you.

674
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,034
That's my duty, isn't it?

675
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:33,162
It always has been.

676
00:55:33,245 --> 00:55:36,206
- What do you want me to do?
- That's my question.

677
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,918
Isn't it time to end it with In-gang?

678
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:41,962
Why?

679
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:45,466
Did you actually
fall in love with him?

680
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:55,893
What about you?

681
00:55:57,102 --> 00:56:00,022
I heard you were dating Lena.

682
00:56:00,439 --> 00:56:01,440
Yes.

683
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:03,317
Why?

684
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:06,528
- Does it bother you?
- She used to torment me.

685
00:56:07,279 --> 00:56:08,947
You don't know what she'll pull.

686
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:10,991
All the more reason
to keep her close.

687
00:56:11,075 --> 00:56:13,660
So I can stop her
from getting to you.

688
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,959
Something's different

689
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:23,253
about you.

690
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:25,589
People...

691
00:56:30,302 --> 00:56:31,387
change.

692
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:47,653
You didn't eat, right?

693
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:55,119
Hi, Lena.

694
00:56:57,162 --> 00:56:58,247
Why are you here?

695
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,458
Explain.

696
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:03,877
- We were talking.
- "Talking"?

697
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:06,547
Then, do it outside, not here.

698
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:10,592
Does In-gang know you're here?

699
00:57:11,468 --> 00:57:12,469
Actually...

700
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:16,014
Can you two
even make your relationship public?

701
00:57:19,143 --> 00:57:20,227
Do as you please.

702
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:21,854
Hey.

703
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:23,939
You think I won't?

704
00:57:24,022 --> 00:57:26,316
Let go! This is so wrong!

705
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:33,240
I tailed him for a few days.

706
00:57:33,323 --> 00:57:36,034
He went to pay respects to your dad.
He cried and apologized.

707
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:37,995
He still hasn't changed.

708
00:57:38,662 --> 00:57:39,663
Is that all?

709
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:42,583
He usually does volunteer work
in the afternoon and goes home.

710
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,043
He doesn't drink or meet his friends.

711
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:47,671
When there's no volunteer work,
he goes to the gym

712
00:57:48,255 --> 00:57:49,673
or reads at a café.

713
00:57:50,716 --> 00:57:52,050
I don't think you need to worry.

714
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,261
Okay.

715
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:01,226
Is dating fun?

716
00:58:02,603 --> 00:58:03,604
Why do you ask?

717
00:58:06,064 --> 00:58:07,065
Because it looks like it.

718
00:58:07,858 --> 00:58:09,067
You don't call me

719
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:12,029
because you're doing well.

720
00:58:13,363 --> 00:58:16,200
Yes, I'm doing well. I'm happy.

721
00:58:28,378 --> 00:58:29,963
Did you look into
that exposé about Ah-jin?

722
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:31,256
How did it go?

723
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,967
It was deleted
an hour after it was posted.

724
00:58:34,051 --> 00:58:35,677
And the source is unverified.

725
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:37,471
"Can't and won't."

726
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,641
You think I pay you to hear that?

727
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:43,352
When did I ever say
that I can't or won't?

728
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:46,313
Give me some time. I'm still digging.

729
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:49,483
Dong-gyu, it's me.

730
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:51,193
Lena.

731
00:58:51,944 --> 00:58:54,905
Do you know
where In-gang is right now?

732
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:03,914
Where are we going?

733
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:07,626
You'll see. It'll be fun.

734
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:26,770
Happy birthday, Ah-jin.

735
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:28,313
Thanks.

736
00:59:45,372 --> 00:59:48,166
This might be cringe

737
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:50,836
so please don't laugh.

738
00:59:51,962 --> 00:59:53,046
What's it about?

739
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:55,173
Go on.

740
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:02,723
I'm so grateful

741
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:05,559
you were born

742
01:00:06,643 --> 01:00:08,562
and that you came into my life.

743
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:15,694
It's been a year,
and when I'm with you

744
01:00:17,529 --> 01:00:18,614
my heart still races.

745
01:00:19,781 --> 01:00:25,454
This might be sudden,
but I hope you won't say no.

746
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,586
They must have told me
the wrong floor.

747
01:00:36,882 --> 01:00:37,883
In-gang.

748
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:41,845
What are you doing here with Ah-jin?

749
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:47,309
- Can't you tell?
- A date?

750
01:00:47,392 --> 01:00:48,894
Oh, it's your birthday.

751
01:00:50,604 --> 01:00:52,189
Happy birthday.

752
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:56,526
I'm also here on a date.

753
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,529
Since we're all here,
why don't we celebrate together?

754
01:01:00,906 --> 01:01:02,616
Is that okay, Jun-seo?

755
01:01:07,204 --> 01:01:08,664
Mind if I sit?

756
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:10,707
Take a seat, Jun-seo.

757
01:01:28,225 --> 01:01:32,854
That's right. I heard you two
used to be classmates.

758
01:01:34,022 --> 01:01:35,774
We live in such a small world.

759
01:01:36,817 --> 01:01:38,110
What a coincidence.

760
01:01:40,612 --> 01:01:41,613
Classmates?

761
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:44,908
Technically

762
01:01:45,992 --> 01:01:47,285
we were siblings.

763
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:50,288
Our parents remarried
when we were young.

764
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,379
It's not exactly my favorite memory.

765
01:01:58,755 --> 01:01:59,756
Yeah?

766
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,341
Why?

767
01:02:02,509 --> 01:02:07,556
My mother didn't treat her
so well back then.

768
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:10,642
Because of that

769
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,604
I still feel guilty

770
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:18,024
and am willing to do
anything for her.

771
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,068
You don't have to.

772
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:22,154
I've gotten over it.

773
01:02:25,615 --> 01:02:26,616
I'm fine.

774
01:02:28,118 --> 01:02:29,119
You're right.

775
01:02:31,455 --> 01:02:33,457
You look fine. I'm happy for you.

776
01:02:35,584 --> 01:02:36,668
Happy birthday.

777
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:46,762
I should congratulate
you two as well.

778
01:02:46,845 --> 01:02:48,263
We're just friends.

779
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:53,310
He's right.

780
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,063
We're only using each other.

781
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:04,237
By the way, why did you come
to Jun-seo's place the other night?

782
01:03:04,821 --> 01:03:06,281
It was so late at night.

783
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:08,408
You really scared me.

784
01:03:09,117 --> 01:03:10,202
That was

785
01:03:11,828 --> 01:03:13,121
because

786
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,959
I wanted to politely turn down
Winter Sleep.

787
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:22,547
What's wrong?

788
01:03:23,715 --> 01:03:26,259
How do you tell such a blatant lie
with a smile on your face?

789
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:30,514
That was not the vibe
I picked up from them.

790
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:34,726
It's her birthday.

791
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:38,146
Take it down a notch.
We're here to celebrate.

792
01:03:42,776 --> 01:03:44,110
You'll have to excuse us.

793
01:04:00,836 --> 01:04:03,088
I want you to be straight with me.

794
01:04:04,214 --> 01:04:05,382
Is it me or Ah-jin?

795
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:07,843
Do you even want to help me?

796
01:04:08,426 --> 01:04:09,845
Whatever you do

797
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:13,306
- In-gang won't go back to you.
- I know that.

798
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,975
You think I'm doing this
to win him back?

799
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:19,062
Why her, though,
out of all the women?

800
01:04:20,063 --> 01:04:21,439
There's something wrong with her.

801
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:24,109
Didn't you see how brazen she was

802
01:04:24,192 --> 01:04:26,444
when her relationship
with you was exposed?

803
01:04:26,778 --> 01:04:29,698
She's a really bad person.

804
01:04:29,781 --> 01:04:31,449
Do you really not see it?

805
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:34,703
Why does no one see it but me?

806
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:00,896
Oh, dear.

807
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:37,766
Are you two really siblings?

808
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:39,935
Yes.

809
01:05:40,685 --> 01:05:41,686
We were.

810
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,772
Why didn't you tell me?

811
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:50,654
I didn't tell you
because you never asked.

812
01:05:51,738 --> 01:05:53,573
You can ask me anything.

813
01:05:54,115 --> 01:05:55,241
I'll answer.

814
01:06:01,164 --> 01:06:02,415
Just siblings?

815
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,542
Not anymore.

816
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:08,296
Our parents got divorced.

817
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:10,882
I'm sorry.

818
01:06:13,343 --> 01:06:14,594
For what?

819
01:06:16,763 --> 01:06:17,764
One second.

820
01:06:20,266 --> 01:06:21,851
Hey, In-mo. What's up?

821
01:06:26,022 --> 01:06:27,023
What?

822
01:06:28,316 --> 01:06:29,401
She found it?

823
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:32,070
What is it?

824
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:34,739
My grandma found the notebook
she lost last year.

825
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:38,410
She did?

826
01:06:39,452 --> 01:06:40,453
Okay.

827
01:06:41,287 --> 01:06:42,288
All right.

828
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,085
The notebook?

829
01:06:47,752 --> 01:06:51,673
She used to write in it like a diary,
but she lost it last year.

830
01:06:52,257 --> 01:06:53,258
She found that.

831
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:57,512
She went to your place
to cook a birthday meal for you

832
01:06:57,595 --> 01:07:00,807
but now she's lying down
and hasn't eaten anything.

833
01:07:01,474 --> 01:07:05,437
In-mo's out of town, so she's alone.
And I have to catch a flight tonight.

834
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:10,358
Ah-jin.

835
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:13,028
Can you check on her for me?

836
01:07:22,829 --> 01:07:24,998
It feels like we crashed
your birthday party.

837
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,334
Ah-jin.

838
01:07:30,086 --> 01:07:31,421
Happy birthday.

839
01:07:32,505 --> 01:07:35,050
We'll head out. Have a great time.

840
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:08,583
It's 1-2-2-5.

841
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:11,753
You can come in anytime next time.

842
01:08:57,841 --> 01:08:58,925
Wait out here.

843
01:10:03,531 --> 01:10:04,532
You're here.

844
01:10:27,055 --> 01:10:28,056
How did it go?

845
01:10:28,806 --> 01:10:29,807
Nothing yet.

846
01:10:46,616 --> 01:10:47,617
Ah-jin.

847
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:14,329
DEAR X
