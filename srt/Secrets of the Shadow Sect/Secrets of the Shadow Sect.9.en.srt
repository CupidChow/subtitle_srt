[Secrets of the Shadow Sect]

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,820
[Episode 9]

13
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,340
Master.

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,420
What's the matter?

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,660
In the stream of
the Shadow Sect's valley,

16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,460
many corpses were found there.

17
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,580
They served Madam Yu.

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,860
What caused their death?

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,740
Their meridians were shattered
by internal energy.

20
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,460
These skilled practitioners

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,540
were killed by one fatal move.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,380
I'm afraid only very few people
in the martial arts world

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,220
possess such prowess.

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,060
It's a possible move

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,500
if someone

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,260
mastered the Wanxin Manual.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,300
Are you suspecting Young Master?

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,180
But according to what you said,

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,100
her dantian was empty.

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,140
It doesn't seem like she has practiced
the Wanxin Manual.

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,340
By the way,

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,660
about the shadow guard
you planted by Xuan's side,

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,220
didn't you tell me

34
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,340
he would stay in the Xuantian House
to search for the Wanxin Manual?

35
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,180
Why did he come with Xuan instead?

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,140
It's my mistake.

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,180
Has he given you any news

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,340
these days?

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,740
Not yet.

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,580
Please calm down, Master.

41
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,460
I shouldn't have spared him that day.

42
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,260
I will make amends.

43
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,980
Tomorrow,

44
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,860
I will lead the Shadow Sect
to besiege the Xuantian House.

45
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,260
Even though the mute is robust,

46
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,220
we outnumber them.

47
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,980
I will make sure
to bring you the Wanxin Manual.

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,900
And?

49
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,900
You make a big fuss about it

50
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,580
and everyone knows

51
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,540
that I

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,860
deceived my wife, killed my daughter

53
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,620
and caused internal strife
in the Lingtian Palace

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,620
for the sake of
the manual of another sect.

55
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,100
I wasn't considerate enough.

56
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,940
Please punish me.

57
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,060
Forget it.

58
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,460
Get up.

59
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,100
In a few days,

60
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,540
it will be my fiftieth birthday.

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,180
Although it's a significant year,

62
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,860
I prefer it to be simple.

63
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,780
I would like

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,980
to have

65
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,580
a family banquet.

66
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,140
About what happened last night,

67
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,460
what would you do

68
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,980
if you were me?

69
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,900
Well,

70
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,140
let's stop here.

71
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,900
You are indeed a martial genius.

72
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,740
You pick up every move I taught so fast

73
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,340
and use it flexibly.

74
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,500
You must have been slacking off, right?

75
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,260
Nonsense.

76
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,060
I would've died if I had slacked off.

77
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,140
Look.

78
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,020
My clothes

79
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,660
are too short for you now.

80
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,900
Because

81
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,380
I grow faster than you do.

82
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,340
Initially,

83
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,020
I just wanted to repay the favor.

84
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,740
But now...

85
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,700
The grudges
between the Medicine King Valley and me

86
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,140
need to be dealt with.

87
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,700
Take this cup of wine

88
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,820
as my apology.

89
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,980
Just now, the main hall
sent a message.

90
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,340
Master Ling's birthday banquet
will be a simple one this year.

91
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,260
Disciples won't be celebrating it.

92
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,420
It's a family banquet.

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,060
This time,

94
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,060
you will have to go by yourself.

95
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,940
It seems Ling Yuanzheng
is getting impatient.

96
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,620
It's fine.

97
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,980
I'm getting as impatient.

98
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,940
Let's have a spare.

99
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,700
Be honest.

100
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,020
Are you loyal to me?

101
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,860
I have already given you
my life long ago.

102
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,140
Your life alone

103
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,420
isn't enough.

104
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,340
I want more than your life.

105
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,900
I want you.

106
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,980
Master.

107
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,260
You want me, don't you?

108
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,260
