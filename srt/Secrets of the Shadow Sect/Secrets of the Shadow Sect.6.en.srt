Soul-shattering Pill?

49
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,180
It's a drug
masters use to control subordinates.

50
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,660
It only requires a drop of
the drug maker's blood

51
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,860
as the leading ingredient,

52
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,300
which is combined with a secret formula.

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,220
This makes

54

55
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,220
only loyal to one master.

What if they don't take the pill
on time?

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,700
They will suffer the backlash
every month.

59
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,660
Initially,

60
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,260

62
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,100

too many times,
