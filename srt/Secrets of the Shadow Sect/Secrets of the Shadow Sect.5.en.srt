Since she knows I'm in contact
with the Shadow Sect,

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,700
why did she allow me

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,100
Young Master, are you saying

128
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,660
that Yingshi barged into
Master Ling's room

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,260

Ling Yuanzheng spared him.

138
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,260
It means Chiye has informed him
about this.

139

Ling Yuanzheng
has always been wary of us.

Your shadow guard barged into his room,

00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,340
but he let it slide

142
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,260
and allowed him to take you out.

143
