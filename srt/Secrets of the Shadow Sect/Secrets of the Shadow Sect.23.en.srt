[Episode 23]

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,820
I had never heard

14
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,060
the effect of the Soul-shattering Pill
would go down so quickly.

15
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,180
Also, why do I feel

16
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,540
my meridians expanded?

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,780
She didn't give me
the Soul-shattering Pill.

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,140
She never intended to control me
with drugs

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,020
from the get-go.

20
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,180
Mr. Ya,

21
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,100
why are you hurt so badly?

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,300
Second Young Master conspires
with Medicine King Valley

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,020
and compels Master Ling to abdicate.

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,300
She is poisoned.

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,020
Many in the palace

26
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,500
have already switched sides.

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,060

are also hostile toward us.

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,740
Hurry and save Master Ling.

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,340
that triggered the Soul-shattering Pill
to take effect early.

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Most of the sect members drank it.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,020
These are the only ones left

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,820
who can still fight.

37
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,220
Let's go to the main hall.

whoever covets you

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,140
must die.

44
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,620
But don't worry.

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,460
Medicine King Valley

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,460
is just a pawn in my game.

47
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,540
I will make sure they are eliminated.

48
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,740
This is our Lingtian Palace.

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,380
Outsiders mustn't stir up trouble here.

50
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,060
How are you related

51
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,180
to Medicine King Valley?

52
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,940
My mother is the martial junior

53
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,060
of the former leader
of Medicine King Valley.

54
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,940
To help me gain control
of Lingtian Palace,

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,380
she had been waiting
beside Ling Yuanzheng

56
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,260
for years.

57
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,940
I made a deal with Zhan Yuechi
using shadow guards.

58
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,780
By then,

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,540
Lingtian Palace will be mine,

60
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,660
and you will be his.

61
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,580
He's just too stupid

62
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,180
to believe this.

63
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,380
You are mine.

64
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,060
No one can come between us.

65
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,340
You are insane.

66
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,540
You disgust me.

67
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,260
Let go of me.

68
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,460
Probably, you don't know

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,020
that I genuinely liked you

70
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,980
when I was little.

71
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,220
But I'm the son of a maidservant.

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,820
So, I went to great lengths,

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,540
hoping to be on par with you.

74
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,940
But later,

75
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,220
they told me

76
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,420
you were my sister.

77
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,460
My biological sister.

78
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,140
What could I do?

79
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,140
I'm an illegitimate child,

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,220
being dumped among servants

81
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,020
and bullied by others
without the right to blame.

82
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,860
I even had to be grateful

83
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,220
when Ling Yuanzheng
acknowledged me as his son.

84
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,380
Did anyone ever ask if I wanted this?

85
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,580
Being the second young master
of Lingtian Palace

86
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,860
might sound great.

87
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,260
But in reality,

88
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,260
I'm nothing but a tool
my mother used to gain power

89
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,820
and a puppet Ling Yuanzheng
used to restrict you.

90
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,460
Be it this identity,

91
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,540
Ling Yuanzheng,

92
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,020
or Mother,

93
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,460
they make me sick.

94
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,660
So,

95
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,420
everything was your plan.

96
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,420
When Ling Yuanzheng used
the Soul-shattering Pill

97
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,060
to control the Shadow Sect,

98
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,220
your plot started,

99
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,540
right?

100
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,780
The blood Father used
as the leading ingredient for the pill

101
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,380
had already been swapped.

102
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,740
In fact,

103
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,260
the leading ingredient

104
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,060
is Zhan Yuechi's blood.

105
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,180
I underestimated you.

106
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,940
You are more cunning

107
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,700
than your mother and Ling Yuanzheng.

108
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,140
Not really.

109
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,980
Because

110
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,620
I'm not Ling Yuanzheng's son.

111
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,380
What did you say?

112
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,020
When I first found out

113
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,900
you were my sister,

114
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,180
I brought myself to admit it.

115
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,180
I thought I would just be your brother

116
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,540
and protect you. That's enough for me.

117
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,620
But ironically,

118
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,140
two years ago, my mother told me

119
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,220
I was not
Ling Yuanzheng's biological son.

120
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,180
This is ludicrous.

121
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,700
I have been forced

122
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,340
to do all of this.

123
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
