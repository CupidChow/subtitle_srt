195
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,460
Go on and do your thing.

196
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,060
Go ahead.

197
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,620
You are here.

198
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,140
Ling'er was out there,

199
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,340
and she couldn't decide on
the lip color.

200
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,260
So I made the decision for her.

201
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,740
Let me help you

202
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,260
with this lip paper.

203
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,380
No need.

204
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,820
I will do it myself.

205
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
The auspicious hour has arrived.

206
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,820
Allow me

207
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,580
to escort you, Xuan.

208
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,660
Let's go.

209
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,820
♪If hand waves are
the prelude to farewell♪

210
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,420
♪If words hold no intention to stall♪

211
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,670
♪Goodbye♪

212
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,740
♪Should be reserved
for when our lives are at stake♪

213
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,350
♪If time rushes swiftly
like wind and dust♪

214
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,060
♪If tears come before words
after waking up♪

215
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,740
♪May you not be drowned in bitterness♪

216
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,340
♪I only wish your eyes♪

217
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,420
♪As pure as snow♪
