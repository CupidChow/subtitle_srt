Master.

The assassins Madam sent are all dead.

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,540
Young Master killed them.

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,380
That's more like my dear sister.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,940
What about that shadow guard?

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,900
Indeed.

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,820
It wasn't convenient

21
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,020
when Xuan was there.

22
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,780
You may go.

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,100
Yes.

24
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,580
Who are you to touch Xuan's hand?

You are up?

26
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,500
Why?

It's too late.

Now, you are mine.

31
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,180
I deserve a thousand deaths.

32
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,140
Not that serious.

33
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,300
You served me quite well.

34
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,940
And I enjoyed it.

Why don't you

become my male escort?

Am I right?

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,060
I wouldn't dare.

39
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,380
There are many male escorts
in Xuantian House.

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,580
I crossed the line last night.

Are you jealous?

I like seeing you get jealous.

If you say yes,

How does that sound?

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,380
You aren't serious about this.

48

Today,

49
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,740
you can dismiss others for me.

50
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,100
But someday later,

51
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,940
I could suffer the same fate.

00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,170
Is that

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,780
a no?

I'm grateful to you.

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,420
I will do everything I can to repay you.

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,660
You weren't unwell last night.

59
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,260
I'm responsible for that.

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,060
It's not entirely your fault.

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,420
Don't worry.

62

You may go.

Why are you angry?

How could Yingshi

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,340
just walk away?

66
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,740
I drove him away.

67
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,380
He is unromantic

68
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,700
and boring.

69
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,060
This is ridiculous!

70
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,820
I can't believe

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,780
that lucky man

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,180
can so be unappreciative.

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,620
Why did you

74
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,860
defend him?

75
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,460
Young Master, you are untouched,

76
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,740
and none of those male escorts

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,260
could really get close to you.

78
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,260
He is ignorant.

84
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,140
What do you think of

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,780
Yingshi's appearance?

86
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,740
Not bad.

87
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,820
That's it, then.

88
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,980
It's always

89
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,780
about willingness,

90
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,500
not worthiness.

91
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,220
By the way,

92
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,540
how are the bodies of those assassins

93
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,740
from last night?

94
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,380
Rest assured, Young Master.

95
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,860
Mr. Ya took care of that.

96
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,660
I'm worried

97
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,060
Master Ling's spies
still find out about it,

98
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,140
even though
we have handled it discreetly.

99
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,220
I know.

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,300

102
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,500

who followed Ling Xuan

104
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,660
returned.

105
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,740
If so,

106
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,740
you should send more men
to look for them.

107
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,460
Why make a fuss about this?

108
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,460
They are skilled.

109
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,100
Besides, no matter what happened,

110
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,380
I must see their bodies
even if they died.

112
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,260
Something must be up.

113
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,780
Also, let me be frank with you.

114
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,940
Once your father
obtains the Wanxin Manual

115
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,100
and removes Ling Xuan,

116
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,940
the position of the young master
will be yours.

117
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,540
You know very well

118
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,060
our relationship
with the Medicine King Valley.

119
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,140
If we get the support of
the Medicine King Valley,

120
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,900
the heir might change.

121
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,020
Mother, you can send a message
to the Medicine King Valley

122
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,940
to seek their help.

123
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,100
You are right.

124
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,940
Rong.

125
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,460
I will go and write the letter.

Later,

129
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,580
intercept the messenger pigeon
Madam Yu sends out

130

and see what she writes in the letter
to the Medicine King Valley.
