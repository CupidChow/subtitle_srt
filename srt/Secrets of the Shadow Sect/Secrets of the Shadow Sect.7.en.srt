[Secrets of the Shadow Sect]

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,820
[Episode 7]

13
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,500
What's wrong with me?

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,900
Why do I feel so stirred up?

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,020
Could it be

16
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,140
because of the Soul-shattering Pill?

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,380
But I have never heard

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,940
that the pill has an aphrodisiac effect.

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,100
This can't go on.

20
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,940
Yingshi.

21
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,100
You ignored my summon.

22
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,220
Mother!

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Mother!

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,500
Mother.

25
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,780
Xuan.

26
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,260
I'm going to tell you
where the manual is.

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,900
Keep that in mind.

28
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,860
You should hide

29
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,420
the techniques I taught you.

30
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,980
Don't let anyone know about them,

31
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,260
especially your father.

32
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,780
Understood?

33
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,940
Yes,

34
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,740
Mother.

35
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,900
I can't hold on much longer.

36
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,140
Your father will soon find this place.

37
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,940
Go and hide.

38
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
Go now.

39
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,260
Master.

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,180
It's dangerous at night.

41
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,140
Let me protect you.

42
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
Calm down, Master.

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,220
The shadow guards

44
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,780
should always stay beside their masters.

45
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,460
I just think

46
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,260
that it wasn't your intention

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,580
to hurt innocent lives.

48
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,020
If you regret it now,

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,580
I can let you go.

50
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,780
I

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,500
have no regrets.

52
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,420
I made it.

53
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,620
I couldn't break through
all these years

54
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,460
because my resentments ran so deep

55
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,420
and my mind was never at peace.

56
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,660
Yingshi.

57
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,100
Missing members of those sects
haven't been found yet.

58
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,380
I have dispatched more men
for the search.

59
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,060
Noted.

60
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,020
Young Master, have you completed

61
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,740
the cultivation of the Wanxin Manual?

62
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,340
Mother is gone.

63
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,660
I'm left without guides.

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
Whether or not I have accomplished it,

65
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,220
I can't be sure of it.

66
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,980
But I hope so.

67
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,020
Well,

68
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,060
my father's fiftieth birthday

69
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,980
is around the corner.

70
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,220
Are you suggesting...

71
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,140
Finally, this moment has arrived

72
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,700
after waiting in the wings for years.

73
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,180
Young Master.

74
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,780
Yingshi suddenly left just now.

75
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,180
He was heading towards the gate.

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,100
He walked hurriedly.

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,300
I have no idea what he was up to.

78
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,340
Oh, no.

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,420
Stay here.

80
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,540
Don't follow me.

81
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,140
Why?

82
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,580
Have you regretted your choice
and wanted to escape

83
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,100
just after one day?

84
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,980
Master.

85
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
That Soul-shattering Pill...

86
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,620
You have already taken it.

87
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,220
It's no use to change your mind now.

88
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,300
What's wrong with you?

89
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,660
Are you feeling unwell?

90
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,460
Should I send for a physician?

91
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,460
You may return to the palace first.

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,060
Found them.

93
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,420
According to Master,

94
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,300
no survivors.

95
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,940
Charge!

96
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,620
No survivors?

97
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,180
What a coincidence.

98
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,300
That's what I thought as well.

99
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,940
Fess up.

100
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,660
Who sent you?

101
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,660
It's...

102
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,180
It's Master Ling.

103
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,700
Your martial arts skills

104
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,460
have already reached this level.

105
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,660
You have quite some nerves

106
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,500
to pry my secret.

107
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,940
Master.

108
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,500
There is one thing

109
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,620
I would like to confess to you.

110
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,300
What is it?

111
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,620
You asked me

112
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,580
why the Shadow Sect summoned me.

113
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,700
I didn't tell you the truth.

114
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,540
Before I graduated
from the Shadow Sect,

115
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,620
Mr. Chiye instructed me

116
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,500
to recognize you as my master

117
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,700
and search for the Wanxin Manual
in secret

118
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,580
and to assassinate you.

119
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,300
You betrayed the Shadow Sect

120
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,260
and lied to me.

121
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,060
If I didn't say yes,

122
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,180
I couldn't have come to your side.

123
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,780
Since you are honest with me...

124
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,740
To bear the cultivation with my body,

125
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,020
I have been taking medicine

126
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,660
for long,

127
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,820
my meridians, bones, and blood
are different from ordinary people.

128
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,620
I didn't expect it

129
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,540
to affect you.

130
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,340
Don't come any closer.

131
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,940
I insist.
