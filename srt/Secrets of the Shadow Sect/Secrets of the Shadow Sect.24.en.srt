00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,820
[Episode 24]

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,670
[One month later]

14
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,020
I told Madam Yu a lot.

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,900
You

16
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,140
are virtuous and elegant.

17
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,380
And I adore you.

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,100
If I could stay by your side
in this lifetime,

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,260
I wouldn't ask for more.

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,540
But I'm using the drug on you.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,660
It's different for me.

22
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,060
How is it different?

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,820
I took it willingly.

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,460
To me,

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,020
tying the knot is a ceremony.

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,620
It's a commitment

27
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,020
when a couple vows

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,700
to be together forever
till death do them part.

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,060
I would like

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,020
to ask

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,820
if you are willing

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,140
to have this ceremony with me.

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,180
It can be simple.

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,980
Just you and me.

35
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,300
Chiye is highly skilled.

36
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,300
Even Ling Yuanzheng is wary of him.

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,540
I know this is dangerous.

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,340
But like I said,

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,220
I

40
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,740
won't fail you in life or death.

41
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,220
No news yet?

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,420
Yes.

43
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,780
They only found Second Young Master's

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,860
corpse.

45
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,820
Take care of him properly

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,580
and bury him well.

47
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,900
Stop drinking, Master Ling.

48
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,420
Your internal injury hasn't recovered.

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,380
Your body can't hold on longer

50
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,260
like this.

51
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,300
You see,

52
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,220
even a sword can be found.

53
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,180
How come there is no sign

54
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,700
of him?

55
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,300
Don't worry too much, Master Ling.

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,300
If Yingshi is still alive,

57
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,460
he will definitely come back to you.

58
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,980
Shadow guards sent to scout
Medicine King Valley

59
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,220
have sent news back.

60
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,780
After Zhan Yuechi died,

61
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,300
Medicine King Valley lost its leader
and descended into chaos.

62
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,460
Our shadow guards

63
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,980
disguised themselves as the disciples

64
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,940
and snuck in.

65
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,780
They discovered...

66
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,060
What is it?

67
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,740
Zhan Yuechi had had a blood disease

68
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,980
since birth.

69
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,180
To sustain his life,

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,940
his father deceived many children

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,300
into coming to Medicine King Valley
under the guise of adoption.

72
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,060
They were called adopted children,

73
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,820
but in fact, they were blood slaves.

74
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,140
The disappearance
of those martial arts members

75
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,820
is also Medicine King Valley's doing.

76
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,980
Yingshi...

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,500
He is said

78
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,460
to have the most compatible blood

79
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,220
with Zhan Yuechi's

80
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,860
and suffered greatly because of it.

81
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,100
Fortunately, he escaped.

82
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,500
The former Mr. Zhan was furious.

83
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,300
Medicine King Valley.

84
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,180
What a rightful sect.

85
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,340
Pass my order.

86
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,740
Ask Shadow Sect to spread
the news of the drugged subjects

87
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,460
throughout the martial arts world.

88
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,460
They are despicable and evil.

89
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,140
They must be punished.

90
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,660
Master Ling!

91
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,420
Master Ling!

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,060
Master Ling,

93
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,700
we have news about Yingshi.

94
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,340
What?

95
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,900
We have news about Yingshi.

96
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,140
Sir,

97
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,260
you are back.

98
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,260
How was the clinic I recommended?

99
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,420
I noticed

100
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,940
you are moving around more easily.

101
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,460
Right.

102
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,740
Thank you so much.

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,900
Lingtian Palace
really went all out this time.

104
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
I think

105
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,380
the mysterious martial artist

106
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,460
is stranger.

107
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,900
It's said he had already

108
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,020
secretly rescued

109
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,300
all the blood slaves

110
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,820
held by the Medicine King Valley

111
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,100
before Lingtian Palace's men arrived.

112
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,940
Medicine King Sect is pure evil.

113
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,460
The righteous martial artist

114
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,780
punishes them for their heinous deeds.

115
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,540
After that, several secretive branches

116
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,780
scattered across the martial arts world

117
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,060
were wiped out

118
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,100
one by one.

119
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,220
It seems

120
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,660
to be done by the same person.

121
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,300
Well,

122
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,500
let's not pry

123
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,060
that righteous martial artist.

124
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,460
Li,

125
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
let's drink.

126
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
Where have you been?

127
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,500
Since you are alive,

128
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,260
why didn't you come back
to Lingtian Palace?

129
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,620
Yingshi.

130
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,140
Do you know I have been out of my mind
trying to find you?

131
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,780
Miss,

132
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,340
you have confused me with someone else.

133
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,580
I'm Tang Yan,

134
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,300
not Yingshi.

135
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,980
If you want,

136
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,860
we can start over again.

137
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,860
Tang Yan.

138
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,180
Good name.

139
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,860
Mr. Tang,

140
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,260
your handsome face

141
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,780
is to my liking.

142
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,740
I wonder if you are married.

143
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,660
If not,

144
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,660
I might just

145
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,660
take you.

146
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,780
Xuan.

147
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,500
Yan.

148
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm afraid I can't stand any longer

149
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,220
if you don't let me sit down soon.

150
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,500
Did you hurt your legs
from falling off the cliff?

151
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,620
Let me see.

152
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,140
I'm fine now.

153
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,140
The bones are reattached.

154
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,700
I just need time for recovery.

155
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,580
Why don't you go back
to Lingtian Palace?

156
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,300
Mr. Ya can check on your injuries.

157
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm not going back.

158
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,380
I don't want to go back

159
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,060
because

160
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,940
I have one more wish to fulfill.

161
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,460
I promised Bai Chen

162
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,060
that I would visit his sister in Yuzhou

163
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,660
once I'd regained my freedom.

164
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,660
Now,

165
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,140
it's time to fulfill that promise.

166
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,900
Once this is done,

167
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,660
I won't have

168
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,020
any burden from the past.

169
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,740
Let me go with you, then.

170
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,460
You have always wanted
to travel around, right?

171
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,940
I will go with you.

172
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
We can

173
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,660
explore together along the journey.

174
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,860
After we reach Yuzhou

175
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,900
and meet his sister,

176
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,900
we can travel even further.

177
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,620
To vast deserts,

178
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,220
scenic lowlands,

179
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,420
and picturesque cities
with frequent showers.

180
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,540
Yan,

181
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,660
wherever you go,

182
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,300
I will be with you.

183
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,780
You promise?

184
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,340
I promise.
