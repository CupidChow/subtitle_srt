[Episode 17]

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,380
Master Ling!

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,580
Something terrible has happened.

15
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,140
It's you.

16
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,980
Xuan will soon find out

17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,780
that your blood

18
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,060
can't detoxify the poison
of the Soul-shattering Pill.

19
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,540
But I'm afraid

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,580
that you have been

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,220
kept in the dark all along, Father.

22
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,980
When the Medicine King Valley
refined the pills,

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,380
they secretly changed
the leading ingredient.

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,100
What?

25
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,260
You and your mother

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,140

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,180
Compared to this,

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,700
there is another truth you need to know.

They were once

Ling Yuanzheng's personal guards.

39

Ling Yuanzheng's blood

48

isn't the leading ingredient
to the Soul-shattering Pill.

50
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,660

What again?

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,020

that the former Master Ling

54
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,700
killed himself.

55
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,300
All of his meridians are broken.

He

57
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,700
committed suicide.

58
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,340
I have truly

59
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,340
underestimated him.

60
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,100
The way he died

61
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,300
is the same as Mother's.

62
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,300
But he feared death.

63
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,060
Why did he have the courage

64
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,580
to break his meridians?

65
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,380
Perhaps

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,740
he feared you would force him

67
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,820
to reveal the owner of the blood
in the Soul-shattering Pill

68
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,460
and the whereabouts
of those sect members.

69
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,580
Bury him.

70
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
Now that he's dead,

71
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,740
we lose track of the leading ingredient.

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,460
- as the leading ingredient?
- Where are you going, Master?

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,140
He got suspicious all the time.

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,820
The leading ingredient is important.

77
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,180
He wouldn't entrust it to anyone.

78
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,260

Don't blame yourself.

84
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,020
Why would I blame myself?

85
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,980
Did he think

86
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,140
he could stop me with his death?

87
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,220
This is ludicrous.

I can give up
on detoxifying those shadow guards.
