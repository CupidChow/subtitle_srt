00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,900
What else

14
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,860
are you going to say next?

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,980
Young Master.

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,940
Not for me.

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,420
You are the Lady of
the Lingtian Palace now.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,820
How could I

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,660
skip your toast?

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,660
The second cup of liquor

21
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,660
is for Madam Yu.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,060
You used

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,820
to serve my mother,

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,380
but both of you were close as sisters.

25
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,940
She saved you from the fire,

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,220
yet you betrayed her

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,140
and stole her husband
behind her back.

28
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,420
You gave birth to a spawn

29
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,660
and plotted against her.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,140
You are

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,180
such a shameless and vicious woman.

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,580
Madam Yu,

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,780
you are truly unparalleled.

34
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,980
Master Ling...

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,060
Let her continue.

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,140
The third cup of liquor

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,620
is for my mother,
who mistrusted those around her.

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,260
She gave her heart

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,380
to an undeserving man

40
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,460
and devoted her sincerity

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,820
to her betrayed friend.

42
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,180
Only she

43
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,460
remained loyal

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,260
to her marriage

45
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,980
and friendship.

46
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,060
Xuan.

47
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,820
You are insolent!

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,860
Insolent?

49
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,860
Father.

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,380
Today is your birthday.

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,940
It's also my mother's deathday.

52
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,660
Did you forget about it?

53
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,540
Seven years ago,

54
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,740
the pair of you ganged up

55
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,260
against my mother.

56
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,580
She lost her hope

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,780
and took her own life
in sorrow and anger.

58
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,020
How pitiful.

59
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,900
To avoid your birthday,

60
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,010
she couldn't even have
her true death anniversary.

61
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,580
I believe

62
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,060
she wouldn't have rested in peace

63
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,260
over these years

64
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,940
had she known about this.

65
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,940
You are as sly as your mother.

66
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,500
You have been
putting up an act all along!

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,460
As a daughter,

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,980
I couldn't fulfill my filial duty
in her lifetime or even after her death.

69
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,940
Today,

70
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,740
on my mother's death anniversary,

71
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,580
I will seek justice for her.

72
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,780
Today,

73
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,420
no one

74
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,020
is leaving the room.

75
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,700
You!

76
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,660
Do you think you can hide

77
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,940
those dirty things you have done?

78
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,820
What a shame.

79
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,020
I was hiding in a cabinet

80
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,660
in your secret practice room then.

81
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,700
Ling Yuanzheng.

82
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,340
It's not me who wants your life today,

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,540
but my mother

84
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,900
is demanding what you owe to her.

85
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,380
Fine.

86
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,620
I would like to see

87
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,540
if you have mastered

88
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,340
the Wanxin Manual.

89
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,100
Silver needles are injected
into your body.

90
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,500
You are weak now.

91
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,940
You can't fight me.

92
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,660
Considering the past,

93
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,540
I will spare you

94
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,060
if you beg for my forgiveness
on your knees.

95
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,660
Did you forget

96
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,860
the shadow guards you trained

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,940
always fight desperately to survive?

98
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,500
You have a death wish!

99
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,900
I will

100
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,900
send you to your demise.

101
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Ungrateful child.

102
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,620
Even if you want to kill me,

103
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,460
you should consider

104
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,700
if you are capable of that.

105
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,540
You crave the Wanxin Manual, don't you?

106
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,580
Fine.

107
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,500
I will give you that.

108
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,540
You actually acquired

109
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,020
this magnificent technique.

110
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,780
But

111
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,980
it's not enough.

112
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,980

Who else

116
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,340
dares challenge me?

117
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,820
Congratulations, Mr. Yingshi.

118
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,980
Congratulations, Mr. Yingshi.

119

Xuan.

121
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,860
Give up.

122
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,620
The entire Lingtian Palace
is under my control.

123
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,380
You can't escape

124
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,660
this death trap alone.

125
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,260
Is that so?

126
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,020
I will give it a try.

127
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,730
Stubborn.

128
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,780
Even though
the Wanxin Manual is powerful,

129
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,740

130
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,900

you can handle

133
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,260
with your immature cultivation.

134
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,740
You need to know this.

Time and experience

136
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,180
is a huge barrier
