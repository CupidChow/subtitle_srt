[Secrets of the Shadow Sect]

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,820
[Episode 18]

13
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,140
Master.

14
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,380
Why are you here?

15
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,260
This place is quiet.

16
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,220
I feel at peace here.

17
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,020
I heard

18
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,580
you sent your men to investigate
the death of Ling Yuanzheng.

19
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,220
Did you find anything?

20
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,380
Forget it.

21
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,980
You drank right after waking up.

22
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,500
Don't ruin your health.

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,940
You are getting

24
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,220
more and more bold now.

25
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,820
You put me to sleep yesterday.

26
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,900
Now, you stop me from drinking.

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,500
You must be punished.

28
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,420
How will you punish me?

29
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,020
If you can't decide,

30
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,500
I have a suggestion.

31
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,300
Would you like to hear it?

32
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,220
Go on.

33
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,140
In a few days,

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,460
it's the New Year.

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,140
Lotuses in the pond by the mountain
will bloom.

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,180
It is going to be a beautiful scene.

37
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,900
In every prefecture,

38
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,820
there will be hanging lanterns

39
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,620
and night markets.

40
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,620
It is going to be fun.

41
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,980
Please punish me

42
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,580
by accompanying you down the mountain

43
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,900
and taking a stroll

44
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,220
on streets.

45
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,580
What do you say?

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,540
Look at you now.

47
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,780
You can be charged with

48
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,900
bewitching the master.

49
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,180
Bewitching

50
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,540
the master?

51
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,460
If you insist

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,060
on charging me with that,

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,340
then

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,260
I will

55
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,500
plead guilty.

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,580
It's indeed lively here.

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,660
During festivals,

58
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,140
the government cancels the curfew.

59
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,380
The night market

60
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
starts at nightfall

61
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,980
and ends after midnight.

62
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,900
You seem

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,420
to be quite familiar
with the night market lantern show.

64
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,420
Have you come here
with someone else before?

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,220
During my training in the Shadow Sect,

66
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,100
I struggled to survive.

67
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,780
I didn't have time for this.

68
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,420
I just happened to see it

69
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,820
when I went down the mountain

70
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,220
for missions.

71
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,780
I had never been here either.

72
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,100
This is my first time.

73
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,300
Nice?

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,460
Yes.

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,780
It smells good.

76
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,740
Sir.

77
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,580
What is this?

78
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,780
Good eye, miss.

79
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,500
This is a secret drug from Persia.

80
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,500
It helps

81
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,740
in romantic matters...

82
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,300
I think

83
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,100
you and this young man
are a good match.

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,180
Do you want

85
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,380
to buy one?

86
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,220
You will witness its effect
upon trying it.

87
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,300
No.

88
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,100
Give him the money.

89
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,220
Have a good day, miss.

90
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,420
Keep the change.

91
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Thank you, mister.

92
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,380
How beautiful.

93
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,580
What is this?

94
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,500
It's the wedding ceremony

95
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,900
of the newlyweds.

96
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,020
Wedding?

97
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,260
When two people fall in love
with each other,

98
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,380
they will tie the knot.

99
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,580
Marriage

100
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,260
is a natural thing.

101
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,140
Is it?

102
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,540
But my mother

103
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,860
had a grand and proper wedding ceremony

104
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,940
when she married Ling Yuanzheng.

105
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,260
The former Master Ling is dead.

106
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,700
Grudges of the past generations
should end.

107
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,180
Master.

108
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,020
You have your own life.

109
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,740
I told you

110
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,300
you are different from him.

111
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,500
Tonight,

112
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,900
there is no master or guard.

113
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,820
Just you and me.

114
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,060
Sure.

115
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,700
Ling Xuan.

116
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,500
That's stiff.

117
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,500
People might think

118
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,060
you are here for revenge.

119
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,820
I remember

120
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,180
you used

121
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,100
to be called Bai Chen.

122
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,180
I will call you Chen from now on.
All right?

123
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,340
I don't think so.

124
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,380
I'm more comfortable
with Yingshi.

125
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,660
It's strange

126
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,540
to be called another name suddenly.

127
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,780
Xuan.

128
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,820
Look at that.

129
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,500
It's really lovely.

130
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,740
It is.

131
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,180
There seem to be fewer people today.

132
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,940
Yingshi.

133
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,540
I don't care about conventional customs

134
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,900
like tying the knot

135
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,460
or marriage.

136
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,940
But

137
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,500
I trust you.

138
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,380
- Yingshi.
- Xuan.

139
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,100
- If I...
- If I...

140
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
You first.

141
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,860
Xuan.

142
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,340
To me,

143
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,860
tying the knot is a ceremony.

144
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,540
A commitment

145
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,300
when a couple vows

146
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,940
to stay forever
until death do them part.

147
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,140
I would like

148
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,060
to ask you

149
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,820
if you would be willing

150
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,220
to have this ceremony with me.

151
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,140
It can be simple.

152
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,860
Just you and me.

153
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,860
This is my answer.

154
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,820
Xuan.

155
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,140
I said,

156
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,780
I trust you.

157
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,700
Yingshi?

158
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,340
In life or death,

159
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,100
I will never

160
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,100
