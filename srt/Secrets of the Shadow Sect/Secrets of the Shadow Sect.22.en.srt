[Secrets of the Shadow Sect]

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,820
[Episode 22]

13
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,580
What are you looking at?

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,860
Don't you all have work to do?

15
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,500
Go back.

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,780
So,

17
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,500
what Zhan Yuechi said is true?

18
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,540
Yes.

19
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,740
So,

20
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,380
you don't want me to call you Bai Chen

21
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,500
because you are not him.

22
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,220
Yes.

23
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,980
Do you know

24
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,220
what I have always hated the most?

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,380
Ling Xuan.

26
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,140
I...

27
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,580
I

28
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,620
am cold and suspicious.

29
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,260
I've given you
all the little trust I had.

30
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,660
In the end,

31
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,500
it is all fake

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,140
from the beginning!

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,060
No!

34
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,380
I did deceive you
using Bai Chen's identity,

35
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,380
but everything afterward was real.

36
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,660
Guards!

37
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
Yingshi betrayed my trust

38
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,100
and showed disrespect.

39
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,100
Imprison him

40
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,900
until further judgment is made.

41
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,620
How did those from Medicine King Valley
come in here?

42
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,900
It's Second Young Master.

43
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,500
He has the palace token.

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,660
The gatekeepers didn't dare to stop him.

45
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,740
You still see me as the leader
of the Shadow Sect?

46
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,420
Shadow Sect values capability.

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,380
It's true that you proposed
the life-and-death trial

48
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,300
and killed Chiye.

49
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,420
Zhan Yuechi has ill intentions.

50
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
There must be more than meets the eye.

51
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,260
I don't think Master Ling
would trust me anymore.

52
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,980
Go to the Shadow Sect.

53
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,780
Yes.

54
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,580
Young Master,

55
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,100
I know

56
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,060
Yingshi is unforgivable
for concealing his identity.

57
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,980
But both Mr. Ya and I

58
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,260
reviewed what happened this morning
many times,

59
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,100
and we found that something was fishy.

60
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,100
Why did those from Medicine King Valley

61
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,700
choose to come today?

62
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,940
Master Ling!

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,100
Mr. Ya,

64
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,780
is her heart affected
by the sudden anger?

65
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,060
She is poisoned.

66
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,220
Poisoned?

67
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
How is that possible?

68
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,300
Master Ling hasn't taken anything
since this morning.

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,780
Food and water

70
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,100
aren't the only media for poison.

71
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,580
Fortunately,
the poison doesn't kill her.

72
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,100
It paralyzes her nerves,

73
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,860
making her numb for a long time

74
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,220
and preventing movement.

75
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,140
Take care of Master Ling.

76
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,340
I'm heading back to get my needles

77
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,620
to force out the poison in her.

78
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,700
Why is this happening?

79
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,700
Why did the Soul-shattering Pill

80
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,940
react

81
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,500
ahead of time?

82
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,660
What did you do today,

83
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,980
or what did you eat together?

84
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,340
What is going on here?

85
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,660
It's Jing.

86
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,060
Jing brought us

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,380
wedding liquor.

88
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,980
All of us...

89
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,980
All of us drank it.

90
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,980
Jing?

91
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,020
Drats.

92
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,660
It's impossible for Zhan Yuechi to reach

93
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,900
the faraway Lingtian Palace.

94
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,700
Since he found out I'm here,

95
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,620
someone in this palace

96
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,900
must have conspired with him.

97
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,420
Ling Rong?

98
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,740
Hang on.

99
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,540
He doesn't look at Xuan

100
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,820
like a brother would at his sister.

101
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,900
His target is

102
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,380
Xuan.

103
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,020
I only remember

104
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,620
today is our wedding day.

105
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,660
I forgot

106
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,500
it's also time to take
the Soul-shattering Pill tonight.

107
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,300
This

108
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,820
could not be a worse timing.

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,140
Don't worry.

110
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,860
I will bring Ling Xuan back
to Medicine King Valley tonight.

111
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,860
From then on,

112
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,060
the entire Lingtian Palace is yours.

113
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,020
Tang Yan is nothing.

114
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,620
How dare he covet your sister.

115
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,020
Choose a day

116
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,100
and send those blood slaves
to the valley.

117
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,340
After ten years of sleepless nights,

118
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,140
my wish has finally come true.

119
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,500
Are you sure the poison in her

120
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,620
is enough?

121
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,900
She mastered the Wanxin Manual

122
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,100
and inherited years of inner energy
from her mother.

123
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,580
If she is still fine,

124
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,780
I'm afraid

125
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,780
she is able to retaliate,

126
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,420
even if we drug
the entire Lingtian Palace.

127
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,180
Don't worry, Mr. Zhan.

128
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,060
I saw Xuan

129
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,180
use the lip paper myself.

130
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,300
Is this how you treat your guests?

131
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,900
I thought

132
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,980
you had already achieved
the highest level of cultivation

133
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,460
and the secretive drug
of Medicine King Valley

134
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,220
wouldn't work for you.

135
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,900
Turns out

136
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,300
you are weak on the inside.

137
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,460
Why?

138
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,020
You say Yingshi doesn't deserve me.

139
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,780
Is Zhan Yuechi

140
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,660
a better husband you've chosen for me?

141
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,660
Do you like him?

142
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,900
I might like him

143
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,140
if you cut him into pieces.

144
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
As you wish.

145
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,420
Just now, you said

146
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,700
Yingshi doesn't deserve
to covet my sister.

147
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,620
You are only half right.

148
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,060
He doesn't deserve her.

149
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,860
And you

150
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,660
are even less deserving.

151
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,020
In this world,

152
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,540
no one deserves to covet my sister.

153
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,380
What makes you so sure

154
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,980
