Letter from the Lingtian Palace.

17
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,780
It writes

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,380
that Ling Yuanzheng planned
to do something on her daughter

19
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,420
to get the Wanxin Manual.

20
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,140
Interestingly,

21
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,580
according to Madam Yu,

22
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,340
Ling Xuan is likely
to have mastered the Wanxin Manual.

Yes.

It's a folk melody

50
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,420
that is widely circulated.

51
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,820
I often heard it played
when I was little.

52
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,980
So I learned it.

53
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,940
I didn't like to sleep when I was young.

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,540
My mother often played it for me.

55

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,060
that you are my only master.

when we used to play outside the palace,

76
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,980
you always bought this flavor.

77
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,700
But I wanted it,

78
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,780
so you always gave me

79
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,740

and so do tastes.

100
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,540
because you look stupid and pitiful,

101
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,060

quite outrageously.

114
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,940
I'm afraid he might...

115
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,500
What's there to worry about?

116
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,190
He is disappointed
because I'm lazy

117
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
and slow in my cultivation.

118
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,380
At most, he will scold me.

119
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,300
I have been scolded much

120
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,500
over the years.

121
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,620
This time is different.

122
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,380
Please listen to me.

123
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,500
You ought to be cautious.

124
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,100
You must be joking, Second Young Master.

125
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,820
Why should I be cautious about him, our father?

126
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,660
It's his fiftieth birthday.

127
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,860
As his daughter,

128
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,020

sending him my wish?

129
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,060
You may leave now.

130
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,380
