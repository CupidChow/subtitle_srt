[Episode 4]

13
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,180
Young Master.

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,020
Drop the formalities.

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,420
Thank you, Master.

16
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,620
Your wounds are swollen.

17
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,300
Why didn't you use medicine?

18
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,420
It's the rules of the Shadow Sect.

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,140
Those who are punished

20
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,220
are not allowed to use medicine.

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,580
Lie down.

22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,980
Let me help you.

23
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,780
I can do it myself.

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,620
Why?

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,380
Do you want to defy me?

26
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,300
I wouldn't dare.

27
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,020
Does it hurt?

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,420
Master.

29
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,300
Have you trained an eagle before?

30
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,780
Why did you ask this?

31
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,660
If the best hunter on the grassland

32
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,580
wants to tame

33
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,620
the wildest eagle,

34
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,300
it will be a test of willpower.

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,420
Be it the hunter or the eagle,

36
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,860
both of them

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,980
couldn't sleep
for several days and nights.

38
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,420
Master.

39
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,500
Did you know?

40
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,580
I haven't had a peaceful sleep

41
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,140
in the Shadow Sect

42
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,940
over the past ten years.

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,220
At first, I was afraid of
killing someone.

44
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,940
Then, I was afraid of being killed.

45
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,900
I was frequently injured

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,700
and almost died multiple times.

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,460
So, Master,

48
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,340
injuries caused by thirty lashes

49
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,660
is just common

50
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,500
to me.

51
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,180
This isn't working for me.

52
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,900
I won't be easily manipulated

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,980
by you.

54
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,740
I find

55
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,420
that words from your mouth

56
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,580
aren't pleasing.

57
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,060
I learned only combat techniques

58
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,420
in the Shadow Sect.

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,700
I haven't been trained

60
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,780
to please anyone.

61
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,420
No?

62
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,980
Very well.

63
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,700
Let me teach you, then.

64
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,180
I knew your mouth

65
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,940
is more attractive

66
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,460
when you don't speak.

67
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,700
Young Master.

68
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,180
I don't think such intimacy

69
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,980
is appropriate.

70
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,580
I'm used to being unconstrained.

71
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,460
Everyone here knows.

72
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,100
Haven't you heard about it?

73
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,780
I only know

74
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,540
the young girl

75
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,860
who once saved me and my sister

76
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,900
isn't the one you described.

77
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,020
The Xuantian House

78
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,420
doesn't keep shadow guards
who act on their accord.

79
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,700
If this happens again,

80
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,700
you won't need to come back.

81
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,020
Do I make myself clear enough?

82
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,100
Thank you for sparing me.

83
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,380

84
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,780
What's the matter?

85
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,100
Someone from the main hall came.

Master Ling

87
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,420
wants to see you now.

88
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,660
All right.

89
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,220
Reply to them

90
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,380
that I will come over
after changing my clothes.

91
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,020
Yes.

92
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,860
By the way,

93
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,700
that Pipa player betrayed her master.

94
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,420
She should've been killed.

95
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,620
But I'm willing to respond
to your request.

96
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,620
I have someone

97
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,020
feed her son with an Oblivion Pill

98
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,820
and send him back to Yongzhou

99
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,700
to reunite with his mother.

100
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,460
Master.

101
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,420
Master.

102
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,420
It's getting dark.

103
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,300
The main hall is dangerous.

104
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,140
Allow me to walk you there.

105
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,500
Are you sure you want to come with me?

106
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,340
The road at night can be difficult.

107
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,620
Please let me protect you.

109
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,300

If you don't come out by then...

115
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,100
Please try some.

116
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,660
Come on.

117
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,500

- Just eat some.
- Father.

120
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,740
You summon me here at this late hour.

121
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,140
Is there something important?

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,140
Why?

123
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,900
Can't I invite

124
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,660
my precious daughter over

125
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,020
to have a chat

126
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,940
with me

127
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,780
for no good reason?

128
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,220
Please don't say that.

129
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,340
I couldn't be happier

130
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,940
that you miss me.

131
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,780
Take a seat.

132
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,660
Let me brew you some tea.

133
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,620
Sure.

134
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,980
You look terrible.

135
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,740
Did your servants

136
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,580
not take good care of you?

137
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,220
They wouldn't dare to mistreat me.

138
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,100
Maybe

139
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,820
because I have been practicing
so hard lately

140
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
and exhausted.

141
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,140
It's a shame
that I'm not competent enough.

142
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,300
There has only been

143
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,140
little improvement.

144
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,620
I'm afraid I might

145
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,020
disappoint you again.

146
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,300
Practicing martial arts

147
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,540
isn't something
you can achieve overnight.

148
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,620
You have to keep a good balance
between cultivation and rest.

149

You are my only daughter.

150
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,180
You mustn't overstrain yourself.

00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,700
I will be worried about you.

152
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,180
You are so kind to me, Father.

153
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,900
Look.

154
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,900
Your complexion is dull,
and your lips are pale.

155
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,500
It seems you lack vitality and blood.

156
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,700
Let me read your pulse.

157
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,580
I will ask the servants
to prepare a tonic for you.

158
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,180

159
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,220

She lacks vitality and blood.

163
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,460
I'm checking her pulse

164
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,900
and have the servants
prepare a tonic for her.

165
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,660
What brings you here?

166
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,140
Master has had a poor appetite recently.

167
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,740
So I prepared

168
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,860
some refreshing supper.

169
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,540
I brought it here for you.

170
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,140
Since you are here,

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,700
let's eat together.

That's good.

No need.

Madam Yu, you were once a maid.

175
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,340
You have means and ways

176
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,660
to serve.

177
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,740
But I'm not used to that food.

179
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,980
I have something to talk to Xuan.

180
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,980

I'm really tired.

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,660
more worried now.

195
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,620
Well.

196
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,820
I know you love me the most.

197
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,740
Fine.

198
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,620
As you wish.

199
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,380
If worst comes to worst,

200
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,460
none of us will win.

201
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,780
You are not allowed in.

202
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,980
Back off.

203
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,620
♪If hand waves are
the prelude to farewell♪

204
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,220

205
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,500

206

♪Should be reserved
for when our lives are at stake♪

207
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,150
♪If time rushes swiftly
like wind and dust♪

208
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,860
♪If tears come before words
after waking up♪

209
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,540
♪May you not be drowned in bitterness♪

210
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,140
♪I only wish your eyes♪

211
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,220
♪As pure as snow♪
