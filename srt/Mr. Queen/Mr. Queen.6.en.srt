00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,240
Oh, here.

00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,790
According to the second book of "Mubiji," in the first chapter of "Strategy,"

7
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,470
it says when your allies are fewer in number than your enemies,

8
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,410
you should escape to an area with the toughest roads.

9
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,410
And if you're in a situation where you can't protect yourself,

10
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,910
<i>you'd better retreat and prepare the next attack.</i>

11
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,200
<i>She is really a strange woman.</i>

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,260
Look here, Your Majesty.

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,280
<i>Her weird behavior... </i>

14
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,090
♪ When do you begin the classy royal music? ♪

15
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,400
I was in the Special Ops Forces!

16
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,180
<i>- Her way of speaking is very arrogant.</i>
- Come at me!
- Look at you, acting like a king!

17
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,450
I am the king!

18
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,390
- Many thanks.
- What the... Are you nuts?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
No, fine, it doesn't matter anymore.

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,230
Get lost!

21
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,380
<i>And however unruly her behavior is...</i>

22
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,100
<i>She sometimes makes a decision that Buddha would make. </i>

23
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:16,000
Therefore, no innocent person's blood should be shed.

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,190
<i>At other times, she gets angry like a demon. </i>

25
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,190
If I don't get angry in this situation,

26
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,390
it means I'm not human, but Buddha!

27
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,920
<i> In some ways, she is very human.</i>

28
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,810
<i>So, understanding a woman whom I can't understand...</i>

29
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,290
It is too late for you to be understanding now.

30
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,870
<i> Is it really too late? </i>

31
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,970
Was my explanation too difficult?

32
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,450
What did you say?

33
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,110
You were thinking about something else!

34
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,900
What were you thinking about while studying your favorite book of military strategy?

35
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,510
You must have been thinking about Eui Bin!

36
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,820
No, I was not!

37
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sure I'm right. The look in your eyes shows

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,110
that you were thinking of a woman.

39
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,870
- I was thinking about the queen.
- What?

40
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,890
So please refrain from saying such uncomfortable things.

41
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,120
The queen is a woman,

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,160
but you know that I do not see her as one.

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,560
It makes sense. Since she is so unpredictable,

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,650
you are no doubt bothered by her.

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,780
The queen is the most peculiar and strangest person

46
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,710
among all the people I've met in my life.

47
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,870
As if she came from a different world.

48
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,730
Then a word that best describes the queen is...

49
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,600
Let me see.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,790
Using the characters in "extra" meaning outside and "terrestrial" as in the world,

51
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,340
together they are "extraterrestrial."

52
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,140
- Extraterrestrial?
- Yes.

53
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,440
Somehow, it fits her very well.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,960
Extraterrestrial.

55
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,000
Has it finally stopped raining?

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,350
It was raining so hard.

57
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,800
I hope that no one suffered any damage.

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,080
I agree.

59
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,540
I am truly worried.

60
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,580
<i>How long are you going to keep using that strange way of speaking? </i>

61
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,490
<i>Only till tonight. Just only until tonight. </i>

62
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:27,170
<i>Tomorrow, everything will be back in its original place! Yeah!</i>

63
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,890
Impossible!

64
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,150
Your Majesty!

65
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,190
Open the gates! This is a royal order!

66
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,250
<i>- Open the gates!
- Open the gates!</i>

67
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,050
<i>[I came for no reason and I am leaving. Jang Bong-hwan]</i>

68
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,660
Are you hurt?

69
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,300
What are you trying to do? Didn't you try to kill me not too long ago?

70
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,310
What are you doing, right now!

71
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,370
I cannot believe you tried to take your own life again!

72
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,170
Have you lost your mind?

73
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,860
Why do you care if I die or not?

74
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,470
isn't that what you wanted?

75
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,020
So don't interfere and get lost.

76
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,080
It is not too late for me to understand you.

77
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,810
Let's do as you said.

78
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,400
"No touch."

79
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,120
That's right. No touch!

80
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,090
- No!
- What is wrong with you?

81
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,890
What are you doing? Let go of me!

82
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,660
Damn it!

83
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,050
You agreed to "no touch," but why are you still trying to give up on life?

84
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,060
You have a heavy death wish, don't you? How dare you touch me!

85
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,820
It makes sense that you are angry.

86
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,770
I have committed a great sin to you and I owe you a debt that I cannot repay.

87
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,240
I know any of my words will sound like excuses,

88
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,040
but there was a misunderstanding.

89
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,320
Misunderstanding or not, I don't care about your situation.

90
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,240
Please hear me out, even if they are excuses.

91
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,940
I already said I didn't want to listen to your excuses.

92
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,990
- Move!
- No, you can't!

93
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,590
Since I agreed to "no touch,"

94
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,990
I will not leave you alone!

95
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,700
Do you even understand what "no touch" means?

96
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,510
I do.

97
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,790
I remember what you said.

98
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,790
"No touch" means living a happy and fun life.

99
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,490
So you must live!

100
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,870
You missed out on the most important word. Separately!

101
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,020
You live as you want and I will live as I want!

102
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,770
The emphasis is not on the word "live,"

103
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,690
but on the word "separately."

104
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,180
I will do everything I can to maintain your "no touched" rule.

105
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,970
I will find a way for both of us to live.

106
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,170
- Forget it! I won't do any no-touching rule.
- Why not?

107
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,620
The "no touch" that I am talking about is completely different from yours.

108
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,710
One small difference has made them completely opposite.

109
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,210
They are not different. I will prove it to you!

110
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,240
So let's do it, "no touch."

111
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,800
I won't do "no touch"!

112
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,120
Let's do it, "no touch"!

113
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,980
Damn it!

<i>Are you in there?</i>

124
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,920
Yes, Father.

125
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,700
You're ready with the attire already.

126
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,920
Did you have a good night?

127
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,280
Yes. As this is the first day you're entering the palace in an official position, my eyes opened so easily this morning.

128
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,970
Not bringing any trouble to the honor of you and our family,

129
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,860
I will do my best.

130
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,630
Thankfully, the rain stopped so the road won't be difficult. Finish your preparations.

131
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,210
Yes, Father.

134
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,160
<i>Now even with His Majesty the King... What happened? You went to the lake so early in the morning. </i>

135
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,970
Are you still taking your time to mop the floor?

136
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,090
I-I-It's done now, Ma'am.

137
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,250
I was definitely standing guard out there, but when did you get out?

138
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,170
Impossible... Did you jump into the lake again?

139
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,300
It's not what you're thinking.

140
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,660
Your Majesty, here I brought new clothes to change into.

141
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,600
Then, why are you soaking wet?

142
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,270
Just because... When I saw the lake after such a long time,

143
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,810
I got excited so I enjoyed going swimming.

144
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,760
- What!
- Swimming with His Majesty all alone?

145
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,000
- You should never do such a—
- What if you caught a cold while doing so?

146
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:19,200
<i>Perhaps... the lake is not the gate to getting back? </i>

147
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,050
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

148
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,540
<i>Your Majesty! Oh, you're here.</i>

149
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,580
I searched everywhere in the palace. Why did you run out so urgently?

150
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,890
Huh? Why are you so wet?

151
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,520
It's nothing serious.

152
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:38,150
This sinful life, I will live for the day when I can be a help to you, My Lady.

153
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,320
I'm sorry, I didn't see you coming.

154
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,080
Did you really not see me?

155
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,400
If a powerless person knows too much, that person ends up dead.

156
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,490
That's the logic in this place, the palace.

157
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,980
But I must survive... Her Ladyship told me to live through...

158
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:52,340
Early in the morning, Her Majesty the Queen fell into the lake again.

159
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,000
But this time, His Majesty the King went in with her.

160
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,120
It seems that no one knows why they did so.

161
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,850
With this much information,

162
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,370
will I be useful to you?

163
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,450
Relay this news to Queen Dowager.

164
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,450
Shall I tell her every detail of the queen's actions?

165
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,020
While relaying this news,

166
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,570
you shall also report back to me every little detail you hear and see on that side, without missing anything

167
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,720
Don't judge what will be useful, yourself.

168
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,420
I'll keep that in mind, My Lord.

169
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:38,490
Going forward, you will work under the court lady who is closest to the queen, and wait outside the queen's bed chamber.

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,290
The court lady closest to the queen?

171
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,020
That's a position with high pay. Thank you, My Lord!

172
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,500
That way Queen Dowager's people will also think of you as most useful.

173
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,450
Keep an eye on the queen's movements more attentively from a close range.

174
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,660
Yes, please count on me, My Lord.

175
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,670
What would be better, flowers or buds?

176
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,430
What do you think, Oh Wol--

177
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:26,020
Now, I really only have His Majesty.

178
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,980
<i>My Lady, Her Royal Highness the Queen Dowager is here.</i>

179
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,920
Did you come to see me, Your Royal Highness?

180
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,900
You were drawing orchids.

181
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,510
Is it finished?

182
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,500
It's not done yet, I was debating with myself whether I should add flowers or buds.

183
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:01,470
Let me see. In my opinion, buds would be better.

184
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,790
Because that can allow us some curiosity about and expectations of

185
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,200
what kind of flowers they would become.

186
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,180
Oh my dear, this is so beautiful.

187
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,800
I wish those buds won't have the sorrow of losing the chance to bloom and just wither.

188
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,660
Oh, yes. I came to see you today since I have a small gift for you.

189
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,920
I'm so grateful, Your Highness.

190
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,670
Since I didn't know what you would like, I had to take my time thinking about it, so this gift is a little tardy.

191
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,150
I've heard you have a talent for archery.

192
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,530
I was also thinking of learning it, so while ordering one set for me, I bought another set for you, too.

193
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,500
These arrows are beautiful and strong.

194
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

195
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,530
My real gift is not these.

196
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:37,880
The real one will be presented to the king at today's official meeting.

197
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,430
If it's not the lake, then what is it? The only thing we have in common is the lake.

198
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,180
There is one more thing! Being at death's door.

199
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,930
Oh, but what if I really die while trying that? Dying is so painful!

200
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,320
There must be some other safe and peaceful way.

201
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,870
First, let's try to understand this woman.

202
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,610
I am Kim So-yong.

203
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,160
I committed suicide.

204
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,610
<i>Give up being who you are not...</i>

205
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,150
<i>Give up what she's not?</i>

206
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,820
Why would she commit suicide? Because she didn't want to live here.

207
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,600
So, that's obviously why she didn't come back!

208
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,590
This woman... Did she run away?

209
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,470
Now, I know why you're acting like this.

210
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:54,190
You're obsessed with that lake and you keep talking to yourself. Your Majesty is now...

211
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,420
You're trying your best to bring back your lost memories, aren't you?

212
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,370
Ah, yes! You're right.

213
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:11,240
Speaking of which... When I fell into the lake, you said I didn't wake up right away although I was rescued immediately.

214
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,780
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Damn it!

215
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,250
It was indeed running away.

216
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,010
How can she do this? I want to go back!

217
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,850
Isn't this kidnapping!

218
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,990
<i>If grilled gizzard shad can bring back a runaway daughter-in-law,
<i>(T/N: Old Korean saying to emphasize the delectable smell.)</i></i>

219
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,500
<i>and there are ancestral rites for souls outside of their bodies. So this means...</i>

220
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,760
That's right! I should have some extravagant shaman ritual and paste expensive talismans all over the walls!

221
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,920
Court Lady Choi, are you out there?

222
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:50,120
In this palace, are there any places famous for shamanic rituals or talismans?

223
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,430
What? You should never get close to such... things.

224
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,130
But I guess you will still do it in the end.

225
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,440
There is one person who is into those things, but...

226
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,280
But what?

227
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,300
<i>This wench... She's come all this way, what is she trying to find out?</i>

228
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,440
What brings you here?

229
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,730
I heard you were a pro.

230
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,300
A what? I am?

231
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,870
I need a part of a spiritual belief.

232
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,400
Whether it's an exorcism... or a talisman.

233
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,110
<i>Did she find out I got a new talisman so I can put a curse on her?</i>

234
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,460
How horrible! Why do you need to use such a things?

235
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,250
Well, it's nothing much.

236
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,770
I would just like to recall a soul that's left a body.

237
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,570
These things happen sometimes, don't you agree?

238
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,130
<i>Pretending to make a casual connection.</i>

239
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:05,820
<i>She's trying to find fault with my talisman. Devious wench.</i>

240
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,760
I don't really believe in such things.

241
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,290
Like ghosts and wayward souls.

242
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,870
Then... what is this room used for?

243
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,560
I see that you misunderstood. This isn't that kind of place.

244
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,260
It's a place to train the mind.

245
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,650
Ah, I see.

246
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,250
But exactly whose soul are you trying to recall?

247
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,820
You could say it has a close relationship or a strong bond with me.

248
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,370
Oh, it's a woman so please don't misunderstand.

249
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,550
Ah... I see.

250
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:00,380
It must be your mother whom you have never met.

251
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,700
Oh, my poor dear.

252
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,480
It's lonely in this palace and you miss your mother.

253
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,850
Is that why... you tried to take your own life?

254
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,980
Oh, is that how it works?

255
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,130
You can tell me everything.

256
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,510
His Majesty is not my son by blood,

257
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,170
but I'm like in the position of his mother.

258
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:34,070
From now on, I'll consider you my daughter and take good--

259
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,450
I already have two mothers.

260
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,850
But to be honest, I was really not trying to take my own life!

261
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,490
Then why... did you admit to it?

262
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,470
I know! Why did I do that?

263
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,620
<i>You want me to guess, is that it?</i>

264
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,040
<i>It means there is another hidden reason...</i>

265
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,220
<i>Is she threatening me and telling me to watch out?</i>

266
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,770
She was no help at all.

267
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,840
A council in my royal presence has yet to happen,

268
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,010
but she's already showing up unannounced to intimidate me?

269
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:24,050
Court Lady Han, she must have a little bird informing her of rumors, too.

270
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,700
Pardon? Exactly who could that be?

271
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:33,620
Seeing that she's letting on that she knows something, on purpose, with such confidence,

272
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,020
it must be someone unexpected.

273
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,420
Summon the fortune-teller, Court Lady Han.

274
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,290
I must get a personal reading done.

275
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,350
She was tormented by something and that is why she tried to take her own lif,

276
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,020
but she couldn't even die.

277
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,330
So her soul is like... "Whatever, I'm out here!"

278
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,160
And... she is not returning.

279
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,950
What was she tormented by?

280
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,220
According to Grand Queen Dowager, she didn't want to be the queen.

281
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,440
Why not?

282
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,150
Because Cheoljong didn't love her

283
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,730
and couldn't live without the other woman?

284
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,220
Eh, no way! She tried to take her own life because of that jerk?

285
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,420
Her Majesty is talking to herself more than usual.

286
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,050
There are a lot more people who are listening as well.

287
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,950
That is the least of my concerns.

288
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,210
All the nagging was also my obsession after all.

289
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,080
She just might start forming small body crystals.
<i> (Same as some Buddhist monks do)</i>

290
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,700
But then again, now I know,

291
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,790
being a queen is the same thing as being in prison.

292
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,350
Born in a noble family, in the Joseon era, and chosen to be queen, I guess she's never been able to date.

293
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,490
After living a life completely separated from boys, she finally meets Cheoljong.

294
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:51,600
And given the fact that he is the king, I can understand she fell in love at first sight.

295
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,210
Then, by then... this woman must have been totally fascinated by him.

296
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,700
And now after such an austere life... she's experiencing a whole new world!

297
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,130
<i>Wait a minute, what if she's... </i>

298
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,860
<i>doing weird things with my body?</i>

299
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,450
<i>(What the...)</i>

300
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,890
<i>Stop!</i>

301
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,950
Come back here right now! I won't forgive you!

302
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,520
You won't come back?

303
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,490
What is so interesting that has you all staring at it?

304
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,390
Then I'm going to... stab your body. Really!

305
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,020
Until it bleeds!

306
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,310
I bet it will hurt a lot!

307
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,520
Don't think I can do it? For real, I'll do it!

308
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,430
I am doing it! Jeez!

309
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,170
That hurts!

310
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,050
This time, I mean it, I'll stab me until I bleed!

311
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,880
Your Majesty!

312
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,590
That really hurts!

313
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,560
It hurts!

314
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,480
It hurts so bad!

315
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,650
I think I have reached my limit.

316
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:41,460
Coming back... Not coming back.

317
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,340
Coming back.

318
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,690
Not coming back.

319
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,470
Again?

320
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,980
Your Majesty, please don't worry!

321
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,550
It will return when the time is right.

322
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,670
But by then, I will already be...

323
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,650
Calling the spirit. Calling the spirit.

324
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,220
Are you here?

325
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,040
Calling the spirit. Calling the spirit.

326
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,420
Are you here?

327
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,380
Since we are sharing each other's body,

328
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,770
let's have a frank conversation.

329
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,780
You are talking to yourself again?

330
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,660
Shall I chant a homemade shamanic rite or converse with myself?

331
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,600
What will you do when weird rumors start spreading?

332
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,460
Rumors spread really fast in this palace.

333
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,890
What is that? It looks nice.

334
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,630
The king sent this gift to you.

335
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,560
I went and got it for you.

336
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,650
<i>[Book of Changes]</i>

337
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,820
There is something inside.

338
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,660
- Oh my gosh! How pretty!
<i>[Let's do "No Touch"]</i>

339
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,310
Geez, that damn "no touch" talk.

340
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,150
When I wanted to do it, he turned me down. So why now?

341
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,210
Did you catch a cold after all?

342
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,820
I knew this would happen!

343
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,550
You got soaked in the rain and even swam in water.

344
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,680
Goodness. What do I do with you, Your Majesty?

345
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,180
Yeon.

346
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,230
This is not a cold.

347
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,560
Then, what is it?

348
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,640
This is...

349
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,450
a disease called despair.

350
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,310
I thought everything would be fine once the lake filled up.

351
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:53,140
You see, hope is such a cruel thing.

352
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,960
To regain your memory, you even wanted to do a ritual.

353
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,210
I wish you'd stop trying so hard, Your Majesty.

354
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,790
If you had a lot of good memories, then why would you have tried to take your own life?

355
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,020
Maybe for the sake of your happiness, it is better that you don't remember.

356
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,300
No! I must return.

357
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,390
I can't live like this.

358
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,020
I'll tell the royal kitchen to make food that can help with your cold.

359
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,760
You should eat and get some rest.

360
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,440
No!

361
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,860
I will make this woman surrender and come back on her own at all costs.

362
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,570
Here, blow your nose.

363
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,000
What's this? I'm a grown-up and not an idiot either.

364
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,000
Please blow one more time. Yes.

365
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,000
- Here, Cheon-yeok.
- Yes.

366
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,730
Your Majesty, it seems to be a cold. Please hurry inside.

367
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,220
This isn't a cold. This is merely...

368
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,500
It is a cold. Head Eunuch, you are right.

369
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,810
- Has there not been an answer from the queen's quarters yet?
- No, there hasn't been.

370
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,080
And the book was safely delivered as well?

371
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,620
Yes, it was.

372
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,250
Of course, it is not easy to open up a closed heart.

373
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:27,850
And I have a favor to ask of you. I need you to find a valuable item.

374
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,530
By a valuable item...

375
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,890
What are you thinking in your head now?

376
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,500
<i>Kim Byeong-in is appointed to junior rank 1, Director of Uigeumbu (Royal Investigation Bureau).</i>

377
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,430
I have high expectations.

378
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,620
Your grace is immeasurable.

379
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:05,490
I've heard rumors of you being the youngest person to pass the civil exam and talented in martial arts as well.

380
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,900
As you excel in both literature and martial arts,

381
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,000
everyone must be curious about the reason why you declined a government position until now.

382
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,830
Was there a special reason this time?

383
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,640
Policy of Bu-we-jeong-gyeong, the country is facing a crisis,
<i> ("Straighten the country by correcting the wrongs as it faces a crisis")</i>

384
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,970
and I wanted to be of help. That's why I stepped forward.

385
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,750
A crisis?

386
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,190
Ah, the officials must be hiding it from me, lest I worry.

387
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,210
Is it the Qing Chinese or the Japanese this time?

388
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,380
What is more dangerous than a crisis from outside is

389
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,750
a crisis from within, wouldn't you say?

390
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:51,850
There is an internal crisis that was not there before? That means

391
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,490
I caught a bad cold.

392
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,420
Taking care of one's health is also the virtue of a ruler.

393
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,340
You must eat all this and go inside to rest.

394
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:30,200
I don't want to. I am going to stay out here and make my cold get worse. I am going to mistreat my body.

395
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,100
It's not my body anyway. I am not going to let it stay warm or keep its stomach full.

396
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,410
Give me more.

397
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,750
Your Majesty, will your memory come back by you mistreating your body?

398
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,450
You will just get more miserable. You keep saying that it's not your body.

399
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:54,250
But even if you have no memory, This Majesty's body is yours.

400
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,460
Who is sick? It's you, Your Majesty.

401
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,850
Even if your memory does not return, you can surely be happy.

402
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,150
Look! The sky is clear today, too. Isn't it nice?

403
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,680
That's right. A sky without fine dust.

404
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,650
The smell of fresh manure carried in by the wind.

405
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,080
Royal Korean cuisine three times a day.

406
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,870
I am happy enough with this. That's right. I sure am happy.

407
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,490
That's what I said.

408
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,410
Your Majesty, are you crying now?

409
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,910
No, I am not crying. I am totally happy.

410
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:45,490
As you said, I will try to like this place and live on.

411
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,100
Are you that sad about your memory not returning?

412
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,270
Many tens of loyal officials, including myself,

413
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:03,380
are worried about the queen's state of mind, thus we are making an appeal.

414
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:08,270
What is this? Are you talking about deposing the queen!

415
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:13,820
As she habitually attempts to commit suicide,

416
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,650
the Inner Court has been put in jeopardy. In order to straighten the Inner Court,

417
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,920
we ask that the queen be formally deposed.

418
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,370
The queen, trying to protect Eui Bin,

419
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,920
said things that were not true.

420
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,390
Rumor has it, that after almost drowning in the lake, she suffered a mental illness, confuses herself with someone else,

421
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,760
and now every time she sees a body of water she attempts suicide by jumping in it!

422
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,990
If you are to believe rumors,

423
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,940
then the rumor that Eui Bin pushed the queen in would also be true, wouldn't it?

424
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,310
- Wh-What!
- Oh ho!

425
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,800
Quiet, please!

426
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,930
This appeal memorial was not properly delivered so I am going to ignore it.

427
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,540
Follow the proper procedure and resubmit it through Seungjeongwon. <i> (The Royal Secretariat)</i> But...

428
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,660
as her husband and the closest one to observe the queen, I guarantee

429
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,110
that the queen does not have a mental illness.

430
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,840
- However—
- Since it has gotten too heated in here,

431
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,320
how about calling an end to today's session?

432
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,080
Yes, let's do that.

433
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,940
Your Majesty.

434
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,300
What brings you here, Cousin?

435
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,980
I heard you were here.

436
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,440
You heard... the news?

437
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,320
- What?
<i>- His Majesty the King is entering!</i>

438
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,160
My Queen!

439
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,320
You are here already.

440
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,460
Your Majesty is the one who is late.

441
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,560
I thought I was being sensitive,

442
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,970
but it seems that the Director of the Uigeumbu holds many grudges against me.

443
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,270
- Director of the Uigeumbu?
- Your Majesty,

444
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:00,440
in front of everyone, threw Her Majesty aside and humiliated her, the one who saved your woman.

445
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,460
I can imagine how you normally treat Her Majesty.

446
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,650
I wonder if that might be the reason for the suicide attempt.

447
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,710
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

448
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,420
In the end, Her Majesty is in this dangerous situation for having saved Her Ladyship, Eui Bin.

449
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,850
- What will you do?
- Danger?

450
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,350
I will never let that happen to the queen.

451
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,780
How? How will Your Majesty prevent it?

452
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,520
Is your way of speaking, which crosses the line, as the queen's cousin

453
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,190
or as the adopted son of Lord Kim Jwa-geun?

454
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:41,370
Since Your Majesty does not have the power to protect the queen, I am saying it dispassionately.

455
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,660
I don't have the power?

456
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,180
I'll acknowledge that.

457
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,200
However, there's no rule that says you must win over the strong with more strength.

458
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,450
There is also a way of winning by softly lowering oneself.

459
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:01,330
If I have to be softer, I will do it, if it means protecting the queen.

460
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,870
I can look as weak as need be.

461
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:09,140
You do not need to do that, because I will protect Her Majesty the Queen.

462
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,400
It's faster to win with something stronger.

463
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,770
Hey, what is all this about? It sounds like it's my problem, but why are you two leaving me out?

464
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,760
What about me? What now!

465
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,670
There was an appeal to depose you, My Queen.

466
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,470
Geez, damn it! I was trying to like this place and live on.

467
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,880
Everyone was out to kill me and now everyone is out to depose me!

468
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,300
Who else is talking about deposing?

469
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,900
Oh, Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager was angry.

470
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,800
I will talk to her to smooth it all out.

471
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,990
I have an idea as well—

472
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,220
Oh, you caught a cold, too!

473
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,050
You, too?

474
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,390
No matter how pressing the work is, it would be best for you to go inside and rest.

475
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:17,970
If you don't have anything more to say, please take your leave. We have some things to discuss as a married couple.

476
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,920
I have some things to tell Your Majesty, so I will wait.

477
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,640
- I will visit again.
- Okay.

478
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,850
I was going to wait for your answer but it looks like there is no time.

479
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,520
From now on, I am going to "no touch."

480
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,650
What are you talking about "no touch" at a time like this?

481
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,650
If you don't want to then I will do it by myself, "no touch."

482
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,940
- I am telling you there's a misunderstanding about the meaning of "no touch."
- Let me have your hand, please.

483
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,900
What for? Say, what are you—

484
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:17,560
My life was always in the hands of your family.

485
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,480
Perhaps, I was blinded by that reality.

486
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,290
I didn't realize that you were also an innocent person

487
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,270
who was struggling with that same reality.

488
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,560
I am sorry that I realized this too late.

489
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,260
Please give me just one chance.

490
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,120
The chance where I can, without any prejudice,

491
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,180
understand you simply as a person.

492
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,980
Why go that far?

493
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:53,690
I know you don't like this kind of thing, but I need to apologize to you properly at least once.

494
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:59,510
Oh, whatever! Okay, let's do it, "no touch." I am not in any position to push anyone away.

495
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,780
Then, today is Day 1.

496
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,130
- What?
- We agreed to "no touch" Day 1.

497
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,970
Don't say that kind of thing!

498
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,270
- Why not?
- Just don't say it! Don't ever say it again!

499
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,760
What's wrong with those words? Today is day 1.
<i> (T/N: Day 1 is used by dating couples to denote the start of a relationship.)</i>

500
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,750
Geez! Just don't say that!

501
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:27,880
- But today is Day 1—
- Don't say that!

502
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,230
You are doing this, knowing what it means, aren't you?!

503
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,400
No, but today is Day 1—
- Aish, quit saying that! It's grossing me out!

504
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,940
<i>- It is Day 1—
- Geez, don't say it! </i>

505
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,450
<i>- But it is Day 1—
- Don't say that! </i>

506
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,920
All right, since we decided to "no touch," I will do what I can for you.

507
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,060
Okay, that's all right. I have things to do, too. I am leaving first.

508
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,180
Please don't run. Don't ru—

509
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,180
You will get hurt!

510
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,560
Please go ahead. Say it.

511
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,150
If you make the queen unhappy, you will become unhappy too, Your Majesty.

512
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,540
- Is this a threat?
- It is a concern.

513
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,960
The queen's older cousin is caring for her far too much.

514
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,490
It's more like Your Majesty is far too neglectful.

515
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,460
Although I'm a powerless monarch,

516
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,600
manners should still be used between a king and his subject.

517
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,290
If you cross the line one more time,

518
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,670
I will take grave issue with your attitude.

519
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,030
Please try to take issue with me.

520
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,160
I will make you

521
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,980
write a very long, long letter of apology.

522
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:56,000
A very long one, you know it now.

523
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,700
You will have to stay up all night.

524
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,970
Your hand will hurt this much, I assume?

525
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,750
Are they thinking she will be really deposed

526
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,240
because of that mere appeal?

527
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,460
They are probably planning to gather support and power with that excuse.

528
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,900
They will try to gather more people who are dissatisfied with our Kim family

529
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,740
and increase the number of appeals. That's obvious.

530
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,570
How dare they come... at us so recklessly.

531
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,870
This was meant to happen one day anyway.

532
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,080
<i>Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager, </i>

533
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,030
<i>the queen is here. </i>

534
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,400
Let Her Majesty enter.

535
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,900
I'm so sorry to cause you concern.

536
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:14,020
I deserve to be deposed.

537
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,090
However, even if I'm to be deposed,

538
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,770
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager should depose me.

539
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:22,100
If the Pungan Jo family deposes me,

540
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,630
that's not appropriate.

541
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:31,100
<i>Even if one is lacking this much, if that person is your underling getting attacked by others, you can't just watch it happen. </i>

542
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,890
<i>This is a matter of pride. </i>

543
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,660
If I get deposed by the Pungan Jo family,

544
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,000
that will not only be my defeat,

545
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,860
but also the Ansong Kim family's defeat.

546
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,500
If you knew that, how could you give them any excuse to find fault with you?

547
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,220
What they are relying on now is a rumor. I will take care of it.

548
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,750
- How?
- Since a crisis can also be an opportunity,

549
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,550
if you give me a little bit more time,

550
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,740
I'll use this opportunity to completely change my reputation.

551
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,020
Today, after receiving the appeal,

552
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,900
His Majesty the King, took your side, Your Majesty.

553
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,960
<i>Cheoljong, that rascal did?</i>

554
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,100
The queen's action to come forward wasn't a fault only.

555
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,010
I'd better give a firm lesson to Queen Dowager Jo,

556
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,400
as to who the owner of this palace is.

557
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,330
Are these all the palanquin bearers you got?

558
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,740
- Well, it's—
- Hire more people good at storytelling.

559
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,750
Ah, yes, Your Majesty. Storytelling...

560
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,180
Pardon?

561
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,340
They should be handsome and tall. Being young is a given, too.

562
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,850
You are really hiring palanquin bearers, right?

563
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:05,360
Whom I'm hiring are not just simple palanquin bearers of food.

564
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,440
If you hear my plan, you would be surprised.

565
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,660
Those I'm hiring are...

566
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,920
- Say, have you heard the rumor?
- What rumor?

567
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,570
You know what? The queen didn't try to take her own life,

568
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,590
but just to save His Majesty the King and Lady Eui Bin...

569
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,570
To save His Majesty the King and Lady Eui Bin,

570
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,550
Her Majesty made a false statement about her suicide attempt. I heard...

571
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,160
- Either to be with her family...
- Or to be with her husband!

572
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,770
- That is...
- The question!

573
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:43,340
I heard, because of that, Her Majesty the Queen lost Her Highness the Grand Queen Dowager's favor!

574
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,500
Her Majesty the Queen put her silver dagger to her neck...

575
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,200
And said, "From my unlucky fate that doesn't allow me to choose neither one of them,

576
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,610
I'm going to get away!

577
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:54,750
That's what she said from what I heard.

578
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,740
She used to be, "The Witch of Royal Villa."

579
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,820
According to a rumor, she saw the heavens before coming back to life.

580
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,010
After falling into the lake?

581
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,870
Apparently, after she met the Jade Emperor,
<i> (The very first god in Chinese myth)</i>

582
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,260
she changed into a fairy, you know.

583
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,280
Good, good.

584
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,930
<i>Those I'm hiring are not just simple palanquin bearers of food.</i>

585
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,320
Storytellers. (She is using English not used in that time)

586
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,920
Or shall I say human tabloids spreading rumors like the plague?

587
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,200
Pardon?

588
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,680
<i>For rumors, the more levels of people they go through, the more it becomes like a plague.</i>

589
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,720
<i>They spread so fast that the person who starts it can't control it </i>

590
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,770
<i>and it will evolve in unexpected directions. </i>

591
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,570
By the way, if her suicide attempt was false,

592
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,860
then the person, after all, who pushed Her Majesty, the queen into the lake was...

593
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,330
Wait! Then, Her Majesty the Queen risked her life

594
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,000
to save the king's concubine who had tried to kill her?

595
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,030
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

596
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,660
Oh my, I'm suddenly getting chills.

597
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,360
Please get some rest now, please!

598
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,550
- This won't do! I'll carry you to your room, forcefully if need be.
- No!

599
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,080
All right, all right, I got it.

600
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,130
Since Court Lady Choi doesn't nag me anymore, you're nagging me now.

601
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,030
Is there some law on the conservation of nagging?

602
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:16,840
By the way, I haven't seen Court Lady Choi since earlier.

603
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,540
Oh, I'm cold.

604
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,430
Will you hug me a little tighter? I'm so cold.

605
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,930
Your Majesty!

606
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,450
How could you harm your own precious body?

607
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:08,960
Are you going nuts seeing me go crazy?

608
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,410
Swimming with His Majesty? Swimming, eh!

609
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,490
Are you determined to put this country in crisis?

610
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,370
A talisman? A shamanic rite?

611
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,980
You shouldn't keep such superstitious things anywhere near you!

612
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,070
You shouldn't talk the way you talk either!

613
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,910
From beginning to end, everything you're doing

614
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,500
is no, no, no, you shouldn't, you shouldn't do that!

615
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,890
Even after doing this, I don't feel like my burdens are lifted.

616
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:52,560
If I nag, Her Majesty will be distressed;

617
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,430
but if I don't nag, I will be distressed.

618
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:02,690
What should I do in this case?

619
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,200
Your Majesty!

620
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,120
- Have you heard the rumor?
- Pardon?

621
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,580
Right now, the entire palace is in an uproar.

622
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,230
They say that the queen risked her life

623
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,690
to save you, the one who tried to kill her.

624
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,250
Who on earth is spreading such a rumor?

625
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,450
Is it perhaps the queen...?

626
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:34,200
The previous rumor about her being "The Witch of the Royal Villa" has now changed to "Bodhisattva, Fairy, Virtuous Woman"!

627
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:37,760
How could she change like turning a hand upside down?

628
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,490
Now, the people will curse you as a wicked woman.

629
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,690
I'm sure she was going to do this from the very beginning.

630
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,290
She even came to see me at the shrine for King Heonjong and openly threatened me,

631
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,260
so this was it!

632
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,070
I'll go meet His Majesty the King and tell him,

633
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,920
so that he won't fall for the queen's false face any longer.

634
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,190
I'm not so sure...

635
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:07,560
if His Majesty will really believe your words.

636
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,550
If they're my words, His Majesty will believe them.

637
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:15,000
I heard that the king rejected the petition to depose the queen.

638
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:24,860
<i>- Her Ladyship the Eui Bin is here.</i>
- Oh.

639
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,290
Hwa-jin.

640
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:35,020
I was going to come and see you since I have something to discuss with you.

641
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,490
What did you want to tell me?

642
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:44,200
During today's council meeting, there was an appeal requesting to depose the queen.

643
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,590
Is that so?

644
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:51,740
The queen is in danger now for trying to save us, so I thought it's not right to do nothing.

645
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:56,420
I'd like to ask the Vice Royal Secretary to withdraw the appeal.

646
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,600
Would that be all right with you?

647
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,290
You mean, to ask my father...

648
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:05,620
As he's popular, with his great personality, many people inside and outside of your family respect and follow him.

649
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,880
As expected, though, will it be difficult for you?

650
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:19,430
No, I will write a letter to my father myself.

651
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:20,670
Many thanks.

652
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,320
Your Majesty,

653
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,390
there was one thing I hoped when I came into this palace.

654
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:32,050
Just like when we first met, I hope you will be able to forget any scary things, at least when I'm with you.

655
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,260
I hope to be such a person for Your Majesty.

656
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:40,040
You're already a great comfort to me.

657
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:46,860
I'm sorry to say this, but we haven't consummated our union yet.

658
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:54,130
Ah... I've left you lonely.

659
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,230
I'm well aware that you've been very busy so far.

660
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,870
I was inconsiderate.

661
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:01,730
Tonight, I'll come to your quarters.

662
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:06,960
However, there is still one day left for your night with the queen.

663
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,730
You don't have to worry about that.

664
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:14,280
Then, I'll meet Her Majesty the Queen to lessen her worries and write the letter.

665
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,410
That's a good idea.

666
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,810
Her Ladyship the Eui Bin has come to pay her respects.

667
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:33,860
Regretfully, Her Majesty the Queen has taken medicine for a cold and just fell asleep.

668
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,520
If that's the case, I'll come back tomorrow.

669
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,040
I see you came.

670
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,190
You were definitely sleeping like a dog on a hot summer day...

671
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,320
I heard you're not well.

672
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,990
Although my body is unwell,

673
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,830
that was for protecting justice, so I have no regrets.

674
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,860
Justice, you say?

675
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,750
Please don't just stand outside, please come in.

676
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:33,240
Just the two of us will have a hot... no, a friendly conversation.

677
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,220
So out, out!

678
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,700
Please take a seat comfortably.

679
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:08,090
Why so far away from me? It makes me feel a sense of distance. Please, come closer.

680
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:10,020
I'm fine right here.

681
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,030
Then, I'll get a bit closer to you.

682
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:20,900
<i>As I appeared like a prince and saved her life, her cold eyes must now be changed to hearts—</i>

683
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,050
What? How come...

684
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:31,070
Your eyes did change, but are they colder...

685
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:34,550
I'll make the appeal be withdrawn.

686
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:38,320
Then, now we're even.

687
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,290
Thank... you?

688
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:46,320
You must think that everything is being done as you intended.

689
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,870
No way! There is nothing being done as I wanted.

690
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,060
Since you lost His Majesty with lies, are you trying to take him back with lies again?

691
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:59,570
What are you talking about? I might not be frank sometimes, but I never tell lies.

692
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,760
I anticipated that you would feign ignorance.

693
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,700
But it's not feigning ignorance, though.

694
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,960
And how many times should I tell you,

695
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,770
I'm really not interested in His Majesty, not even a tiny bit.

696
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:18,970
All right. I will trust you on that.

697
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,360
Why don't we do something tonight to build a stronger friendship? How about a pajama party?

698
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,350
I mean, how about an undergarment party?

699
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:32,600
Tonight, I'll have a night with His Majesty for our consummation.

700
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:39,630
Why? And on top of that... Did you really have to tell me that in person?

701
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:43,910
To hurt my heart? By specifically pointing this out?

702
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,060
You seem quite upset for someone who has no interest whatsoever.

703
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,530
I said I had no interest in the king, I never said I wasn't interested in you.

704
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,630
Please prove that your kindness is genuine, Your Majesty.

705
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,660
If your words and actions don't match once again,

706
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,960
I, too, will fight with all my might.

707
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,730
Since you are so determined, I should give up.

708
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:15,710
Okay fine. I'll give up and give my blessings to the two of you.

709
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:20,090
It's your loss, as you missed the chance to know my charms.

710
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,380
All right, then I'll take my leave.

711
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:37,800
What an iron wall she is.

712
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,700
You're so cruel, woman.

713
00:58:55,470 --> 00:59:00,500
15, 20...

714
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,430
How can I help you?

715
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,730
I'm in so much agony from frustration.

716
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:15,180
I am here to heal my frustrated heart.

717
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,230
You came to the wrong place.

718
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:21,330
This is a general store offering all sorts of things,

719
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:23,560
but we don't have any medicines.

720
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:28,180
It's time for me to close the shop, so come this way, please.

721
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:31,020
- T-The thing is...
- Here, please.

722
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,900
That precious item...

723
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:42,090
I mean, that precious item from Qing.

724
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:28,220
I've invited both of you so that we can sort out the matter presented during today's council meeting.

725
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,620
How dare you bring up the appeal to depose the queen?!

726
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,590
This was a challenge to the entire Kim family!

727
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:38,250
The court with the queen who might jump into the lake at any time.

728
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,750
- It's like a candle lit before the wind.
- Heavens!

729
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,150
How could you make such a false accusation?

730
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,570
How dare you use that tongue of yours recklessly?

731
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:49,170
Use my tongue?

732
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,370
I didn't come to this table

733
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:53,740
so that I can suffer this kind of insult.

734
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:09,370
What are you doing? Are you threatening me now?

735
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:20,750
I'm simply asking you to hear me out.

736
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,840
As I told you, there will be no losers in this room tonight.

737
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,670
So, would you please listen to me a little more?

738
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,770
Please take a seat.

739
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,250
I'm not sure if you will remember, Right State Minister.

740
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:08,670
The letter that Queen Dowager sent to Lady Eui Bin.

741
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:12,120
<i>The location, date, and time that's written in this letter</i>

742
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,150
<i>aligns with the accident that the queen endured.</i>

743
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,260
That's a fake letter.

744
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,410
Will you be able to prove that this is a fake one?

745
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,580
This letter and the appeal to depose the queen,

746
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,900
I'd like to exchange those two.

747
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:37,990
With today's deal, both families will no longer suffer over this matter.

748
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:41,440
That's my suggestion to you.

749
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,300
What do you think?

750
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,730
Did you ask for me, My Lady?

751
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,960
I wrote the letter His Majesty asked me to write.

752
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,350
Could you deliver this to my father?

753
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:19,380
I will... persuade His Majesty.

754
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:24,360
His Majesty is sincerely trying to return a favor.

755
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,630
Although the queen is probably feeling differently about it.

756
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:32,000
However, what matters to me is how His Majesty feels.

757
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:36,440
So, it is all right.

758
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:41,170
<i>Your Highness, we are ready for your bath.</i>

759
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:09,250
So far, it is all right.

760
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:21,390
Your Royal Highness the Queen Dowager, has everything been well with you?

761
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:26,120
No. I have not been well. That is why I called for you.

762
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:32,580
I feel awfully anxious and worried again.

763
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:39,490
Please calm down. I will help you find answers for everything.

764
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:06,940
His Majesty is getting ready for the night.

765
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,460
I have something to tell His Majesty.

766
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,970
Give us some privacy, please.

767
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

768
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,330
Deposing the queen is an opportunity for us.

769
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:27,140
Your Majesty, why are you trying to stop it?

770
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:31,440
Even if we go that route, she will simply be replaced by someone else.

771
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,360
The Queen has been making decisions that are in favor of us.

772
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,990
Out of everyone who can occupy that position, she is the best option for us.

773
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,100
Is she making you waver?

774
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:49,370
Please answer me! Is she making you waver?

775
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,500
Yes.

776
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,860
She is.

777
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:59,450
She risked her life saving her husband who had even tried to kill her, as well as the woman her husband is deeply in love with.

778
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,100
Not because she was boundlessly merciful or because she forgave me,

779
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,000
but she did it just because she could not turn away from the truth.

780
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,030
She never even expected me to apologize or thank her.

781
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,830
She quietly did what she thought was right for justice's sake;

782
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,750
and because of this, she is in a crisis now.

783
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:17,120
So how could I not waver?

784
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,930
Will you betray Lady Eui Bin

785
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,510
and us as well?

786
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:29,230
I do not have any romantic feelings for the queen.

787
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,540
She is simply not our enemy anymore.

788
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,720
Thus, I am not betraying anyone.

789
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,500
You are growing fond of her, which is dangerous.

790
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:41,900
If you are fond of her, it will be used against us.

791
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,480
I will make sure that never happens.

792
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,800
All right then.

793
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,330
Please promise me this one thing.

794
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:53,250
If the queen's stance and attitude change, or

795
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,970
if she turns out to be one of our enemies,

796
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:59,250
then please without hesitation

797
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,600
will you...

798
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,140
behead the queen?

799
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,630
Can you not answer this question?

800
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,950
If by chance the queen...

801
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,290
indeed turns out to be one of our enemies,

802
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:48,390
I will behead the queen with my own hands.

803
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,970
Wow! I think I am already getting better at this.

804
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:09,430
Wow, you really did this all by hand?

805
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,560
When it comes to embroidery, every woman in Joseon is as skilled as I am.

806
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,350
Well, I guess not all.

807
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,950
Not everyone has to be skilled in embroidery.

808
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,560
You are good at everything on top of being so strong.

809
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,540
I was considered a weakling among the servants.

810
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:32,320
Everyone tells me that I look like a violet flower.

811
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,050
Wow, everybody during the Joseon period is a master at living.

812
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:38,750
Let's see.

813
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,430
Pull it.

814
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,310
<i>[Inauguration Ceremony for Descendants of Delivery]
<i> (It's a parody of a delivery service company's name)</i></i>

815
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,720
<i>[Inauguration Ceremony for Descendants of Delivery] </i>

816
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:51,520
We should put this in front of the royal stables.

817
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,980
We'll begin operating the business right away.

818
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:58,310
Shall we charge for delivery, too? I need some cash to go to Oktajeong.

819
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,250
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

820
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:04,090
I brought you a rare orchid.

821
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:05,810
Orchid?

822
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:11,730
Did word get out about my inauguration ceremony already? Who sent it?

823
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:15,710
<i>[Congratulations on "No Touch"]</i>

824
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:19,070
It is from His Majesty.

825
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:25,300
No!

826
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:29,630
Darn it! That jerk! I'm trying to focus on work to forget about everything.

827
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,960
Is he showing off or what?

828
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,270
I am a thousand times better. I mean, look at this.

829
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:39,240
It is such a brilliant idea. I am creating jobs, which the king can't even do.

830
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,460
In the Joseon period where the concept of convenience doesn't even exist,

831
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,160
I have invented this amazing service.

832
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,930
Does she feel intimidated because I am so amazing?

833
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,520
Well... that's understandable.

834
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,080
Whatever.

835
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,240
Is it because I've been listening to so many ridiculous things that it's

836
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:03,380
ruined my taste? Why can I not get the taste right?

837
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,500
Hold on!

838
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:12,380
Since the concept of convenience doesn't even exist in Joseon, whatever I do will be considered a Joseon first.

839
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,160
No... the world's first!

840
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:53,920
I feel so motivated all of a sudden.

841
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,720
So here I can be Thomas Edison and Steve Jobs.

842
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,510
No. Is there anyone who achieved even greater things?

843
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:04,300
A hero who saved mankind.

844
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,870
Inside the queen's body,

845
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:24,130
I see something that should not be there.

846
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:26,450
A wicked soul.

847
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:32,440
She is possessed by a wicked soul!

848
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:38,320
You must do something about this!

849
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,000
if not, this world...

850
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:47,110
this world will be thrown upside down!

851
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:54,590
Yes, Wills Carrier. The man who invented the first air conditioner.
