3
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,210
<i>[Episode 5]</i>

4
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,560
<i>Everyone has a fatal weakness.</i>

5
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,700
<i>Even the great Superman, when exposed to kyrptonite, </i>

6
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,900
<i>becomes a mere shabby pervert who wears his underwear over his pants.</i>

7
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,860
<i>Yet, when even Superman becomes like that,</i>

8
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,210
<i>ordinary people can’t fair much better.</i>

9
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,840
I will admit to the truth.

10
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,390
I will accept your punishment, Grand Queen Dowager!

11
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,740
The one who should be beheaded is not Consort Eui Bin!

12
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,040
Your Majesty...

13
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,780
Please...

14
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,940
Are you going to disobey my royal order?

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,310
<i>For ordinary people, this world is a minefield of weaknesses. </i>

16
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,720
<i>We become each other’s weakness</i>

17
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,660
<i>and drag everyone down to hell.</i>

18
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,840
<i>Even I, Jang Bong-hwan, a nearly perfect human being, has a weakness.</i>

19
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,990
<i>And that is...</i>

20
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,770
<i>I can't handle some other guy being cooler than me.</i>

21
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,100
- The one who tried to harm the queen is—
- Wait!

22
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,450
<i>Especially, in front of a woman I like.</i>

23
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,640
<i>I have to look the best or else!</i>

24
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,580
<i>You could say that it’s the only weakness of someone who has never lost</i>

25
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,370
<i>due to his remarkability.</i>

26
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,550
Since I'm the one who's at the heart of this matter,,

27
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,360
I will reveal the truth.

28
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,900
I...

29
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,230
tried to take my own life.

30
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,720
<i>Did you think I'd let you act all cool by yourself?</i>

31
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,920
<i>Stand back, pathetic Cheoljong!</i>

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,660
<i>I'm the hero here.</i>

33
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,540
So no innocent person's blood...

34
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,170
should be shed.

35
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,480
<i>Now... that was awesome!</i>

36
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,830
What absurdity is this?!

37
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,810
I beg your pardon, Your Royal Highness,

38
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,910
but I tried to take my own life.

39
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,480
This is the will that I always carry with me everywhere.

40
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,110
<i> I am going home tonight anyway,</i>

41
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,840
<i>so who cares if it ends up in ruins?</i>

42
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,070
Why in the world would you?

43
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,780
Are you saying you tried to take your own life the night before your wedding?

44
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,540
- That's...
- What is the reason!

45
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,480
The reason I was depressed enough to want to die...

46
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,450
I’m sure there was one...

47
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,590
Eui Bin!

48
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,850
<i>Oh, whatever!</i>

49
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,710
Your Royal Highness!

50
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,610
<i>No way... Are you going to hold me?</i>

51
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,480
<i>Don't do it! Stop!</i>

52
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,500
<i>Don't come near me! Get away!</i>

53
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,700
Your Royal Highness, Her Majesty is making such an effort and even telling lies

54
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,670
in order to save her junior sister right now.

55
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:32,690
Look kindly upon her noble heart, which has even accepted this great sin committed toward her, so please be merciful.

56
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,610
<i> Wow, now that's interpretation!</i>

57
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,380
Is there something entertaining to watch going on?

58
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,670
Why is there such a crowd?

59
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,230
Y- Your...

60
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,910
Your Royal Majesty!

61
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,970
What has happened to her!?

62
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,350
Fine!

63
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,130
Since the queen is making such an effort,

64
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,670
I will take her efforts into consideration and show mercy.

65
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,430
<i>[Susceptible Heel]</i>

66
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,140
I haven’t seen anything so amusing in the palace in quite a while.

67
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,890
What do you think made the queen act in such a way?

68
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,240
Maybe it was a woman's heart?

69
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,120
Anyhow, it confirms that it wasn't the Kim family's plan.

70
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,420
Yes.

71
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,310
Are you going to Seonwonjeon Hall?
<i>(Royal Ancestral Shrine)</i>

72
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,180
Today, I will need something other than a prayer.

73
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,910
Eui Bin, she may be terribly weak,

74
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,500
but she is our only arrow.

75
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,160
We will need to put poison on the tip of that arrow.

76
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,670
Cheorin! Cheorin!

77
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,710
<i>I have to pick just the right moment to wake up.</i>

78
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,700
This lacking father had no idea...

79
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
I am a sinner.

80
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,660
I am a sinner...

81
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,790
It's my fault.

82
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,320
I should have assisted her better...

83
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,020
It's all because I am lacking.

84
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,340
What is the reason, exactly?

85
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,790
You must know why since you were always by her side.

86
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,080
She tried to jump in several times whenever she saw water,

87
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,680
so I thought she was doing it from the shock of nearly drowning.

88
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,660
Several times?

89
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,060
How hard must it have been for her to do such a thing!

90
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,240
Your Royal Majesty!

91
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,320
<i>Oh, stop it!</i>

92
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,460
<i>If you keep sobbing like that, I won't be able to get up!</i>

93
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,690
We...

94
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,300
We shouldn't cry like this right now.

95
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,270
If she sees us crying,

96
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,330
she will be... so upset.

97
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,090
<i>That’s right!</i>

98
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,990
You are right! We should be comforting her right now.

99
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,040
<i> Okay then, should I slowly get ready to wake up?</i>

100
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,320
<i>Eh... really!</i>

101
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,710
When your mother had you,

102
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,910
she lost her life!

103
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,030
<i>Is he starting up again?</i>

104
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,560
Your Majesty!

105
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,910
You n-never even got to see... your mother's face.

106
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,930
Our poor Royal Majesty...

107
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,750
I had no idea you were going through such a hard time

108
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,490
and I said "no" to this and that...

109
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,730
following you around and...

110
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,100
kept nagging at you!

111
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,400
It’s j-just like...

112
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,670
- me having pushed you into the lake, Your Majesty!
- My Goodness.

113
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,070
Your Royal Majesty.

114
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
Your Royal Majesty!

115
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,570
<i>All right, I give up! This is not the kind of melodrama I can handle.</i>

116
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,180
<i>[Gwanghwamun Gate]</i>

117
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,660
Your Royal Majesty!

118
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,790
What will you do? Please stay safe.

119
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,230
This pathetic father...

120
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,440
I apologize.

121
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,000
<i>Orabeoni!</i>

122
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,430
<i>I am going to the palace today!</i>

123
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,710
<i> I’m finally meeting His Majesty for the first time!</i>

124
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,330
<i>Are you that happy?</i>

125
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,320
<i>It’s because I am curious.</i>

126
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,730
<i>Some days, he’s plain and ordinary,</i>

127
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,870
<i>but other days, he seems like a jade sculpture...</i>

128
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,370
<i>In my dreams, I am talking about.</i>

129
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,140
<i>And last night, he looked exactly like you!</i>

130
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,840
<i>I had believed that giving you up would result in your happiness.</i>

131
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,490
<i>You were so happy before you came into the palace.</i>

132
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,220
<i>Yet when you came to the palace, you tried to take your own life...</i>

133
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,140
<i>By chance, was it because of that?</i>

134
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,160
I am going crazy!

135
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,820
She's surely not in her right mind!
<i>[Give up being what you are not]</i>

136
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,890
While sleeping together for several nights, if she wasn't trying to win His Majesty over,

137
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,560
why wasn't she being won over instead!

138
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,590
Please be calm, Your Highness.

139
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,710
Being upset won't get us anything.

140
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,750
How can I not be upset right now!?

141
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,690
She wasted such a great opportunity!

142
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,210
How can she ruin herself this way!

143
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,270
Also, you saw His Majesty's attitude earlier.

144
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,170
That arrogant stare...

145
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,710
When I made him the king, it was so he would live out his life tending to mere military affairs.

146
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,030
How dare he act so rebellious toward me!

147
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,040
If he's being rebellious, we must control him.

148
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,530
I will tighten the reins so that he knows his place.

149
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,290
What use is putting all this effort into self-care

150
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,210
when it crumbles away over just one worry?

151
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,140
Summon Female Physician Park.

152
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,910
Yes, My Lord.

153
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,950
Actually, the queen came to me

154
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,170
the night she fell into the lake.

155
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,550
<i>Your Royal Highness! I...</i>

156
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,260
<i>I will leave the palace.</i>

157
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,070
<i>What are you saying?</i>

158
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,810
<i>I am not fit to become the queen.</i>

159
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,700
<i>I don't want to live anxiously.</i>

160
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,690
<i>There's a rumor in the palace that your behavior has been atrocious.</i>

161
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,790
<i>I see now that you did it on purpose,</i>

162
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,960
<i>so that you wouldn't become the queen.</i>

163
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,050
<i>That's adorable, thinking it would give you a choice in the matter.</i>

164
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,700
<i>But I don't know what came over you suddenly after being so diligent in your royal education.</i>

165
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,640
<i>And I don't even want to know!</i>

166
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,680
<i>Your fate was decided when you were born.</i>

167
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,640
<i>Doing your duty in serving your family is by becoming the queen,</i>

168
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,390
<i>that is your fate and the sole reason for your existence.</i>

169
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,050
<i>Princess Bi, did you come here on your own?</i>

170
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,190
<i>No! So you can't leave on your own.</i>

171
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,920
<i>Even if you die, die inside the palace!</i>

172
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,800
Girls these days get raised so preciously that

173
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,980
they have such weak thoughts when royal education becomes a little too difficult to bear,

174
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,140
and I didn't think much of it.

175
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,360
Falling in a lake or even taking her own life, I didn't even think that she could do something like this.

176
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,400
If she hated becoming the queen so much that she would throw herself into a lake...

177
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,700
Also, what was with her insane behavior today?

178
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,520
In order to step down as the queen...

179
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,690
If that's the reason,

180
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,510
I will never let her be.

181
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,360
Wait for me! Your Majesty, what are you trying to do?

182
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,960
I told you to come slowly!

183
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,970
Who would dare stop the queen?

184
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,790
Grand Queen Dowager!

185
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,810
<i>Queen, you won't be able to go home!</i>

186
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:44,150
<i>Queen Jang Bong-hwan, until you rot and die in this place,</i>

187
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,740
<i>you will live your entire life here while suffering forever as a eunuch!</i>

188
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,240
No, it can't be.

189
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,480
I don't want to! I don't want to be a eunuch!

190
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,280
Your Royal Majesty!

191
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,900
What's the matter with my dreams?

192
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,340
In the lake, trying to commit suicide...

193
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,060
- You fainted and I...
- Oh, okay, calm down.

194
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,640
Calm down! Calm down! I know how you feel.

195
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,010
I will die with you!

196
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,710
Please stop crying!

197
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,520
There have been enough tears today for me to be able to handle.

198
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,110
It's like a contagious disease, that crying. It's gone around three times already!

199
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,440
I got so tired of waiting that I fell asleep.

200
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,810
That's true. You probably didn't want to look at me crying like this, right?

201
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,760
You are prettier when you smile.

202
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,530
Where is Court Lady Choi?

203
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,110
She insisted on bringing your medicine herself.

204
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, your father also stayed by your side

205
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,010
and only left at sunset.

206
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,230
If you woke up just a little earlier, you would have seen him.

207
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,850
It's fortunate that I didn't see him.

208
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,910
Pardon?

209
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,890
<i>If he finds out that some man's dark soul is inside his precious daughter's body,</i>

210
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,460
<i>his heart would ache terribly. Right?</i>

211
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,690
Let's hurry before Court Lady Choi comes back. The lake should be filled up with water by now, right?

212
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,490
You are going to the lake this late at night?

213
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,880
Finally, today is the day!

214
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,290
- You are in a good mood, right?
- Of course!

215
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,780
The only thing left to do now is to leave a "cool man" will and go back home.

216
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,940
- Ah, that's right! Hong Yeon.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

217
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,330
I was able to endure thanks to you.

218
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,730
I don't know about others but I will miss you.

219
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,630
Ah, that's right! Court Lady Choi, too.

220
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,200
Hong Yeon, you, when you are dying,

221
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,330
leave these words for your descendants as a will.

222
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,320
A will?

223
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,010
"Gangnam! Buy land there."
<i>(Most expensive real estate in South Korea)</i>

224
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,580
You have to make sure to say those words.

225
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,410
If you sit on it for about 200 years,

226
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,390
your descendants will prosper for generations.

227
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,440
That's the only thing I have to give to you.

228
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,420
Okay, let's go. Let's go! Let's go!

229
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,000
Your Majesty, please be careful.

230
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,100
Cheer up. Cheer up.

231
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,650
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,440
What is this?

233
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,270
Why aren't you using the perfect system I made over there?

234
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,730
That is because... the well dried up.

235
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,880
That is why we are bringing water from way over there.

236
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,520
We are bringing the water but...

237
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,030
Say that again, please?

238
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,090
I think I misheard.

239
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,370
It sounds like you're saying you can't fill the lake by tonight!

240
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,580
Please accept our apology, Your Majesty!

241
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,010
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

242
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,780
As a high ranking civil servant, you wouldn't say something and then not follow through, right?

243
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,710
You said that the lake would be filled up with water by tonight for sure, didn't you?

244
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,360
Even the closest well

245
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,590
is 2 to 3 li away.
<i>(1li = 429.5 yards or .3927km)</i>

246
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,890
At least, fifteen days...

247
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,510
- Please kill me!
<i>- Please kill me!</i>

248
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,350
<i>- Please kill me!
- Please kill me!</i>

249
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,270
Why does everyone here ask to be killed all the time!

250
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,120
You are thinking "she wouldn't really kill me," aren't you?

251
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,740
Do you want me to show you what consistency in speech and action means?

252
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,810
Do you want to know what the ramifications are for bouncing a check?

253
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,990
Okay! That's fine. I am sure it should be enough.

254
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,920
No! Your Majesty!

255
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,940
Why are you doing this, too?

256
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,570
I won't leave you to try committing suicide again!

257
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,780
It is not like that!

258
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,690
I am not going there to die!

259
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,200
Then, what are you trying to do?

260
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,980
I am going there to live. This is the only way I can live!

261
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,020
- Ah!
- Whoa!

262
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,440
You will have to kill me to go there!

263
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,070
Damn! Why is she so strong?

264
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,200
Let go of me!

265
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,680
If that granny changes her mind and orders the lake to be drained again, I'll really be done for!

266
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,090
Everyone! Stop the queen!

267
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,810
- How can we dare to touch...
- Your Majesty!

268
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,210
No, Your Majesty!

269
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,920
I will never nag you again!

270
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,150
I will never say "no" either!

271
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,230
So, no, Your Majesty, please!

272
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,960
You said you wouldn't say that. You said you wouldn't say "no."

273
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,650
Damn it!

274
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,900
You are doing that again?!

275
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,410
Even if you keep doing that...

276
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,340
I stopped laughing long ago.

277
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,660
Eh? Damn!

278
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,040
I won't do it. I won't do it! I won't do it!

279
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,300
As long as I don't jump in, it's okay. Right?

280
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,110
Okay.

281
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,370
Lift your head. Straighten your back!

282
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,200
Do you know how to swim?

283
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,730
That's it?

284
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,890
If I go in over there,

285
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,720
it's deeper...

286
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,670
Okay, then just go in.

287
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,360
That's right!

288
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,530
It is slippery!

289
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,350
Your Majesty!

290
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,140
The Grand Queen Dowager is calling for you right away.

291
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,620
Oh, damn!

292
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,690
Lee Saeng-mang... that name was so unlucky!

293
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,550
Oh, you are drinking well.

294
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,780
What's wrong?

295
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,970
You know, sometimes, you have that feeling...

296
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,040
that the world is turning but you're not a part of it.

297
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,870
You, Young Master, are the center of my world though.

298
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,910
The ones who have sharp senses misjudge once in a while like this.

299
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,990
I didn't order naengmyeon though.
<i>(cold buckwheat noodles)</i>

300
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,470
This is our way of thanking our regulars who come here every day.

301
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:23,100
I am telling you that although it may seem as if I am coming here just to have fun, that's not it.

302
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:31,560
This is just to find a man named Lee Saeng-mang who disappeared.

303
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,170
But why are you... trying so hard to find him?

304
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:43,060
Somehow, it feels like there is an important secret to his whereabouts.

305
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:52,020
My sharp senses tell me that Lee Saeng-mang is the center of the incident.

306
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,490
- What incident?
- I wouldn't know.

307
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,030
Eh?

308
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,030
<i>I am being tested now.</i>

309
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,010
- Today's event...
- Today's event is my fault.

310
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,250
It was my fault for forcing you in a seat when you clearly did not want it.

311
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,960
Do you hate the seat of queen that much?

312
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,700
Enough to throw your life away? Enough to be fine if you're deposed?

313
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,370
<i>Is she saying that the suicide was to avoid becoming the queen?</i>

314
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,990
All right. Since you want it so badly, I will allow you to leave the palace.

315
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,610
I am deposing you.

316
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,450
You will be locked up in your family home, unable to take one step out, and live like that for the rest of your life.

317
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,800
<i>No! I can only go home when that lake is filled!</i>

318
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,860
I cannot remember!

319
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,160
My memory has not come back since almost drowning in the lake.

320
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,870
You don't remember that, but you remember trying to take your own life.

321
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:05,110
Only painful feelings have remained. The will as well, I know for sure that I embroidered it, but...

322
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,630
I also don't know why I tried to take my own life.

323
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,370
With such an unsure memory, why on earth did you get involved?

324
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,700
If you have no reason, you simply wanted to go against me. Isn't that right?

325
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,300
No, I have absolutely no desire to go against Your Royal Highness.

326
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,430
Today, you challenged me directly.

327
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,760
<i>I have to get out of this, but how? There is no solution!</i>

328
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,980
I cannot easily forgive that!

329
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,740
Kill me! Your Royal Highness!

330
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,060
I deserve to die! With this unsure memory, I was confused.

331
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,910
I can't go against my family, nor can I go against my husband.

332
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:57,640
So that I may end this pain, please order me to drink poison.

333
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,660
<i>What they really want is not to depose the queen...</i>

334
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,280
Is dying that easy!

335
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,320
You threw yourself into the lake and now you ask for a poisonous drink! Why are you so weak!

336
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,220
<i>What they want is a firm reaffirmation of the royal pecking order.</i>

337
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,000
This all happened because my foolish choice to commit suicide caused a misunderstanding.

338
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,550
I have committed a sin deserving of death so please kill me, Your Royal Highness!

339
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,340
Is it going to be all over just because you die!

340
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,840
Because of this incident, we have given a hand up to Queen Dowager Jo! This is not just your weakness!

341
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,600
She will try to use this as a weakness against our entire Kim family!

342
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,670
- That I will....
- Both of you calm down.

343
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:52,430
I will ask you one thing for the last time, Your Majesty.

344
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,700
Do you really want to leave the palace?

345
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,660
I want to... live in the palace.

346
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,970
What do you think Your Royal Highness, Grand Queen Dowager?

347
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,360
Having no memory is the same thing as becoming a new person!

348
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,560
I will be reborn as a perfect queen

349
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,450
I don't trust a promise of words.

350
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,970
I will show you through my actions.

351
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,790
Why don't you keep an eye on her and see, Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager?

352
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,980
All right.

353
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,500
Your grace is immeasurable!

354
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,490
I won't make you worry again.

355
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,670
I am not worried.

356
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,450
<i>[Give up being who you are not]</i>

357
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:02,460
We don't have any such thing as a weakness. If anything becomes a problem,

358
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,880
we just need to cut it out.

359
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,400
<i>That is the real thing! A real warning.</i>

360
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,160
<i>[Grand Queen Dowager's Residence]</i>

361
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,790
The outlook is dark.

362
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,970
Shall I raise the lantern, Your Majesty?

363
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,740
No, I am talking about my future.

364
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,990
Prince Yeongpyeong came barging in with warriors.

365
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,280
Warriors? Weren't they royal guards?

366
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,370
They were specifically trained men.

367
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,270
How many?

368
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,480
There weren't that many. Seven.

369
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,800
Hidden preparation amounts only to seven warriors?

370
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:21,060
You are in need of medicine, I see. If it weren't for that illness, you would have become the best warrior.

371
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:27,980
I am thankful even to be alive thanks to you, My Lord.

372
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,080
If you fail again for whatever reason, there will no longer be a need for this medicine.

373
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,420
I will keep that in mind.

374
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,330
Until now, we...

375
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,130
assumed the queen jumped into the lake in order to frame Bin.

376
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,550
We thought that even her memory loss was a lie to hide her true intent.

377
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,040
But to think that she tried to end her own life...

378
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,460
All this may be just to get you on her side.

379
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,590
She did it because she predicted that I would step forward for Bin?

380
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,140
If you hadn't stepped forward,

381
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,790
she would have been able to frame Noble Consort Bin. If you did not step forward,

382
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,780
she would be able to change your heart.

383
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,640
Prince Yeongpyeong, you seem to believe that all of queen's words and actions have evil intent.

384
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,350
The queen is... the center of the Kim family.

385
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:44,820
What kind of wolf pack is the Kim family? They drove all our family members to their deaths.

386
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:50,840
I cannot, even for one moment, forget that fact.

387
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:57,130
I cannot forget it either but look at the choices the queen made today.

388
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,890
Me, the one who tried to kill her, and Bin, the one she was usually against,

389
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,030
she revealed the truth for both.

390
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,440
Given that, the animosity towards the queen that we firmly believe in...

391
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,790
is it really right?

392
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,010
- Your Majesty!
- If the queen's suicide attempt is true...

393
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,370
I have tried to kill the queen twice.

394
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,100
<i>Why are you here, My Queen?</i>

395
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,660
<i>I made this happen as I had something to tell you.</i>

396
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,260
<i>It was unnecessary for you to go through all this trouble,</i>

397
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,930
<i>as I'm already in the grasp of your family.</i>

398
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,790
<i>Next time, please just tell me to give up the letter.</i>

399
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,720
<i>Your Majesty, do you hate me because I'm from the Ansong Kim family?</i>

400
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,050
<i>I have never said I hated you.</i>

401
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,560
<i>Then, do you like me?</i>

402
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:24,390
<i>If I weren't from the Ansong Kim family, would you have looked at me in a different way?</i>

403
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:30,000
<i>That would never happen since you're getting the seat of queen because of your family background.</i>

404
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,730
<i>I put in a lot of effort myself, too.</i>

405
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,690
<i>I'm not becoming the queen just because of my name.</i>

406
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,950
<i>This is something I've worked hard to get all my life, but why does everyone say--</i>

407
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,940
<i>Tomorrow, you will be able to take the seat you've coveted so much.</i>

408
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,130
<i>An important event awaits you tomorrow. As it's so late, why don't you go to bed now?</i>

409
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,270
<i>You must love me!</i>

410
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,440
<i>Is that an order?</i>

411
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,640
My coldness pushed the queen into that lake.

412
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,080
If she tried to commit suicide because of your coldness,

413
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,110
she would've jumped into the lake by herself.

414
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:29,990
She purposefully fabricated the letter and jumped into the lake in front of Eui Bin. To me, this shows some intent.

415
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,110
Some intent, you say...

416
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,540
I have to go see the queen.

417
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Evil people usually approach with a smile.

418
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,910
If her actions were all for changing my mind,

419
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,910
I will be able to find that out when I see her attitude.

420
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,750
Hyungnim, please stay here and take care of Eui Bin.

421
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,880
Cosplay the perfect queen for 15 days...

422
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,940
Will I be able to endure it?

423
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,750
If anything goes wrong, I'll end up in this suffocating female body in this suffocating Joseon era,

424
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,150
and might become a prisoner in this suffocating deposed queen.

425
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,720
Since I dug my own grave, who else can I possibly blame?

426
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,870
<i>His Majesty the King is here.</i>

427
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,350
Who else to blame? Of course, I should blame Cheoljong, that bastard.

428
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,700
If he hadn't come forward, to begin with, I wouldn't have come forward either.

429
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,130
Open it.

430
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:49,340
No, even before that, if he weren't so incompetent, I wouldn't have done it.

431
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,210
No, even twice before, if he had done well, this woman wouldn't have tried committing suicide.

432
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,820
Even three times before that—

433
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,440
Queen, how are you feeling now?

434
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,220
You're so worried about my health, yet you put a sword to my neck?

435
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,590
Ever since I came here, I haven't had a single day to be at ease.

436
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,800
As soon as I opened my eyes, I was told I would marry the next day.

437
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Some guy called my husband, who sleeps in the same bed as me, is trying to kill me.

438
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,920
Now, even my only supporters, my family, are threatening me with deposal.

439
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,840
- Deposal?
- Why? Does that sound good?

440
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,700
This is your perfect chance to place Jo Hwa-jin on the seat of queen, isn't it?

441
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,190
Why are you so worked up like a gamecock?

442
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,640
I'm not here to fight with you, My Queen.

443
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,350
Just seeing your face makes me angry.

444
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:41,270
Why wouldn't I? You who are trying to kill me, and your lover whom you're madly in love with.

445
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,500
To save you two, I might end up dead.

446
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,900
At this rate, before I get to commit suicide, I might be forced to commit suicide.

447
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,020
If I didn't get angry in this situation, it means I'm not human,

448
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,990
but Buddha!

449
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,600
You must have a lot of complaints about me. I do understand, but—

450
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,390
Whoa! Don't understand me!

451
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,900
Don't put a word of understanding in your mouth now, not even on the tip of your tongue.

452
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:09,530
That understanding part, you know, should've been done before you put a sword to my neck.

453
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,650
No! The one who tried to kill herself the day before getting married to you,

454
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,890
this body should've been understood back then!

455
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,750
Too late for you to be understanding now.

456
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,070
Hey, go get lost. I have no energy left to get angrier.

457
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,750
I'll come back when your emotions are calmed down a bit more.

458
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't come unless you'll get on your knees, in front of me, and beg for my forgiveness.

459
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,900
I'll come back again.

460
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,520
That bastard... I told you not to come!

461
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,430
Are they filling the lake with water again?

462
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,370
I heard the queen asked a favor of the Grand Queen Dowager.

463
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,200
For what reason?

464
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,920
I don't know that reason, but the reason why Her Majesty the Queen was at the lakeside today

465
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,830
was because she wanted to oversee the process herself, I'm told.

466
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,180
Your Majesty! I'm sorry for causing you concer—

467
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,950
I was afraid I might lose you.

468
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,490
Are you hurt anywhere?

469
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,910
Rather than hurting myself,

470
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,790
Your Majesty's wound hurts me more.

471
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:23,760
Today, this entire day was too brutal for you.

472
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,670
I'm sorry for dragging you into this hardship.

473
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,800
How lonely and difficult you must have felt by yourself in this palace so far...

474
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,760
I didn't bring you here to share the tragedy.

475
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,700
So, don't you ever do that again!

476
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:45,240
If you're sacrificed to save me, how will I remain sane?

477
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,170
I will never do anything to make Your Majesty feel afraid.

478
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,900
Until the situation becomes stable, Prince Yeongpyeong will guard you himself.

479
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,060
- By the way, how is Oh Wol?
- Oh.

480
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,600
<i>This is Officer Hong, Your Majesty.</i>

481
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,390
Come in.

482
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,530
- How is Eui Bin's maid?
- She's been moved to the Royal Clinic for treatment.

483
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,550
My brother worked hard to save her.

484
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,780
I thank you!

485
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:28,390
Did you meet with the queen?

486
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,870
- How was she?
- She was very angry.

487
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,530
- Pardon?
- She blamed my coldness for pushing her into suicide.

488
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,780
Even with her hatred toward me for trying to harm her, she poured out all her emotions.

489
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,510
It doesn't seem right to consider that her action earlier was meant to win my favor.

490
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:50,000
Moreover, she said she was even threatened with being deposed by the Kim family.

491
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,630
On top of that,

492
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,310
Kim Byeong-in still doesn't know that the owner of that fabric cut from the jacket is Your Majesty yet.

493
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,490
Indeed, the queen must be keeping it secret.

494
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:05,290
Although I don't know her real intention, it's true that the queen is acting on her own.

495
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,270
I thought I would be able to figure out what kind of person the queen is by seeing her actions and choices,

496
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,320
but now it's even harder to figure her out.

497
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,990
<i>Father, it's me, Byeong-in.</i>

498
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,250
All right. Come in.

499
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,060
I thought you had quit smoking.

500
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,180
I did.

501
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,620
I am sorry for today.

502
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:54,360
- What are you sorry for?
- What are you planning to do?

503
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:59,620
I will try to speak in a way that's clear-cut, and if that still doesn't work, disposal will follow.

504
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,290
Dispose of whom, if I may ask?

505
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,270
Whoever it might be, I mean since there is no permanent ally anyway.

506
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,550
Although this isn't the right time to say this,

507
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,910
I have something to tell you.

508
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,050
All right, what is it?

509
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,350
I have finally decided on the size of my dream.

510
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,550
That's good to hear. What post have you decided on?

511
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,860
I'll become a captain in the Uigeumbu.
<i>(Royal Investigation Bureau) </i>

512
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,220
A captain in the Uigeumbu?

513
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,430
Just the mere post of a swordsman is your dream's size?

514
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:42,210
I'd like to start in a position where I can use my body and move up accordingly.

515
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,020
All right.

516
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,100
You will climb up with your own strength, you say?

517
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,640
<i>Her Ladyship, Eui Bin is here.</i>

518
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,730
You shouldn't move!

519
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,650
My Lady...

520
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,650
I am sorry!

521
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,260
I should've resisted until the end.

522
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,940
Your crushed knees are telling me. I know everything.

523
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,390
This is nothing serious.

524
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:38,020
If I put herbs on them for several days, I will be able to run around soon.

525
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,180
All right. That will happen.

526
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,080
Who would do such cruel things?

527
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,480
His face was hidden, so I couldn't see anything, but...

528
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,760
I only remember his voice.

529
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,090
My Lady, I'm sorry to say this...

530
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:03,000
But if an injured person is not from the royal family, that person can't stay in the palace.

531
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,820
But how can she leave the palace in this state of injury?

532
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,890
That is the rule of the palace.

533
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,340
How can everything be so cold here?

534
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,340
If anyone takes it as a problem on your way out, use this as a bribe.

535
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,980
If you get out of the palace safely without any trouble, then use it to make your traveling more comfortable.

536
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,810
No, you can't give me such a valuable thing.

537
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:34,480
I'll send a letter to my family, so don't worry.

538
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,660
You've worked hard all this time.

539
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:46,780
How can I see His Lordship's face? I can't go there.

540
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,740
Oh Wol, I have lived with you my entire life.

541
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,000
You're like a blood relative to me.

542
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,950
You have to stay strong so that I can do the same.

543
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:04,140
For me, live more bravely. You must live through this.

544
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,750
I plead with you.

545
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,720
- What's going on?
- Yesterday it was total chaos. Her Majesty the Queen was...

546
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,400
Did you hear?

547
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,190
His Majesty the King was glaring at Grand Queen Dowager, with his big eyes as if he would prey on her.

548
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,120
Look... Look here!

549
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,940
His Majesty the King carried Eui Bin in front of the queen and...

550
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,960
Head Chef! Have you heard the news?

551
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,790
His Majesty the King grabbed the sword, and to Grand Queen Dowager—

552
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,590
Have you heard the news about Grand Queen Dowager's quarters? Done so easily like having a meal...

553
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,850
Today, we are going to appoint the captain of the Uigeumbu, Your Majesty.
<i>(Royal Investigation Bureau)</i>

554
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,690
We are?

555
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,200
I mean, this is the suggestion to appoint.

556
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,350
Who is this to be recommended for the new captain?

557
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:47,210
It's Kim Byeong-in from the Ansong Kim family.

558
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,970
This is an unexpected personnel change.

559
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,440
I'm sure there are already many candidates within the Uigeumbu.

560
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,660
If we appoint an outsider who only passed the literary state exam,

561
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,410
won't there be some complaints from them?

562
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,600
All the ministers recommended him unanimously, Your Majesty.

563
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,740
Unanimously, huh?

564
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:15,150
I've never dreamed of seeing all these ministers working together so harmoniously.

565
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:20,330
I guess he is indeed an amazing talent as the rumor has it.

566
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:23,690
<i>[Decree of Appointment]</i>

567
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,200
And the decree of appointment is also already prepared, I see.

568
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,560
For this slow-footed king to keep up with the high speed of you ministers, I guess I shouldn't sleep at night.

569
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,390
That wouldn't be right, Your Majesty.

570
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:40,900
You should stay healthy to get your heir.

571
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,380
How can he be called a king now? He's just a stud horse.

572
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:05,150
Please don't ever lose that humble attitude of yours, My King.

573
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,630
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

574
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:21,380
Today, our Pungan Jo Clan cut its own throat.

575
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,800
All because of Eui Bin's false confession,

576
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,830
what a humiliation this is.

577
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,570
"The defeat is not the result but the cause."

578
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,200
Pardon?

579
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,380
That's what Her Royal Highness the Queen Dowager said.

580
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:51,160
The reason why we had to agree to the appointment of Kim Byeong-in and support the legitimacy is because we were defeated.

581
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,690
The more we're defeated, the more we will keep losing.

582
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:00,240
So, she said we should make our move before them.

583
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,380
Do you think Oh Wol is recovered even a bit by now?

584
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,370
I'll find out how she's doing.

585
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:35,540
As she's so energetic, she was always running around.

586
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,060
I guess she will never be able to run around from now on.

587
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,530
If she didn't come to the palace with me...

588
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,090
Please don't dwell on it too much.

589
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:52,660
Thinking is sometimes like a quagmire. The more you struggle, the deeper you're dragged under in pain.

590
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:58,730
Prince Yeongpyeong, when you have too many thoughts and concerns, how do you manage to forget them?

591
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:03,760
In my case... I go to see Officer Hong.

592
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,980
He must give you some comfort.

593
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:11,740
How immaturely he always talks... listening to him makes me angry all the time.

594
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:18,430
After getting angry, I find myself getting out of that quagmire of thoughts.

595
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,810
Then... would you please make me angry?

596
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,180
Well, that's...

597
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,390
Or...

598
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,630
Please, don't move.

599
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,390
It's finished.

600
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:48,740
What is wrong?

601
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,520
Nothing is wrong.

602
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,970
Are you hurt?

603
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,600
You can't touch me.

604
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,550
I have a cramp.

605
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,370
Has it been... that long?

606
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:17,960
I'm relieved since you concentrated so much to even forget the time.

607
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,580
But if you are going to sew, why aren't you doing it at Daejojeon Hall?

608
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,200
Why must you do it in the kitchen?

609
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,690
But are you sure you are sewing?

610
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:52,500
I said I would be reborn as a perfect queen.

611
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,730
Did you say "perfect"?

612
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,920
You must not be busy. Should I make some work for you?

613
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,780
Ah, my back! When will I finish all this?

614
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,630
How did it go?

615
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,000
Come in.

616
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:24,220
It's the meal table returned from Tongmyeongjeon, isn't it?

617
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,340
Ah, yes, Your Majesty.

618
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:36,600
Since she tasted my new cuisine, she's become bored with the old.

619
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,120
Here, take this to the seamstress.

620
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:54,530
Tell her that if you make it according to the size of the table, it will keep the food from getting cold.

621
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,450
Tell them to try to make it look pretty.

622
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,320
Yes.

623
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,690
After sending me away, are you going to go to the lake again?

624
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,720
Ah, have you ever seen someone who is going to commit suicide live so diligently like this?

625
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,760
- And you must have forgotten since it's so natural, but the CCTV is always watching.
- Huh?

626
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,290
What are you worried about?

627
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,030
Okay, should I work my magic now?

628
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,510
Your Majesty!

629
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,230
Yes!

630
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,960
You! Is the meat done?

631
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,680
- Yes!
- Hurry.

632
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,500
Hurry up and bring it over here.

633
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,690
Go bring me the salt.

634
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,700
Her Majesty the Queen told me to do this first.

635
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:20,030
All right, let her have it all.

636
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,520
Let's see how well it turns out.

637
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:35,280
If you ask the queen to prepare the food--

638
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:40,230
<i>Your Royal Highness the Grand Royal Queen Dowager, it is the Head Dosulli.</i>

639
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,830
<i>The queen sent me here to bring your meal.</i>

640
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,700
Shall I tell them not to send it in?

641
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,570
Quickly.

642
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,000
She is so insensitive.

643
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:08,800
Your Royal Highness, they have brought your meal, but...

644
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:16,500
<i>[Tongmyeongjeon]</i>

645
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,550
Be careful.

646
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,270
Wait, that is...

647
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:04,110
The queen states that the theme of today's meal is OCIM.

648
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,710
OCIM?

649
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,050
It’s the first time I’ve heard this four-character idiom.

650
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,500
Mencius? No...

651
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,810
Is it, "The Analects of Confucius"?

652
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:19,140
She said that it's food that's crispy on the outside,

653
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:24,040
but moist on the inside.

654
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,790
Oh, right!

655
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,240
The food palanquin is back!

656
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,200
Let's see.

657
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,660
Be careful.

658
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:06,470
Your Majesty, she was pleased and praised you.

659
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:13,010
She especially wondered how you could come up with such an idea as the food palanquin!

660
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,940
Yeah, this result is logical.

661
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,810
Since it's an item that was successful in the competitive Hell Joseon.

662
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,440
Joseon's deliveryman. Wow!

663
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,790
Hey, kid! I applaud you!

664
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,640
As a woman of the royal family, humility must be--

665
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,000
No way! Are you nagging me now?

666
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,860
Must it be shown or not? It was only a question.

667
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,840
No! Life is hard enough living as a show-off.

668
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:50,830
I don't even know what she is talking about, but that bothers me.

669
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:57,940
At least Oh Wol is alive, so it's a relief.

670
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:04,800
You must have realized this time around, too, what type of people the Kim family are.

671
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,020
I didn't realize they would go this far.

672
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,250
You must have been scared and surprised.

673
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,850
But this is just the beginning.

674
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:20,390
They never give up on the game they missed.

675
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:26,170
They said the previous king didn't die of illness.

676
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,410
Then?

677
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,210
The late king thought the Kim family was ruining Joseon.

678
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,900
<i>Do you know what your sins are?</i>

679
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:41,160
<i>He banished the influential Kim Won-gun after stripping him of his post</i>

680
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,350
<i>and reformed the law aimed at organization.</i>

681
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:50,190
<i>He faced the Kim family head-on,</i>

682
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:54,020
<i>but they wouldn't just stand by and watch.</i>

683
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,860
<i> Fortunately,</i>

684
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,670
<i>while avoiding misfortune,</i>

685
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:07,120
<i>he was looking for evidence to reveal the people behind it,</i>

686
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:20,050
<i> when the last king passed away and Kim Sang-gung disappeared.</i>

687
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,250
Surely, he was poisoned.

688
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:28,220
If we had taken immediate action, the last king would still be alive.

689
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,740
I already told you, it's not too late for you.

690
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,550
But if you miss this chance, it will be too late.

691
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:43,710
This time, it was your servant, Oh Wol, but next time it’ll be you.

692
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,680
I’ll file an appeal

693
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:52,400
requesting to dethrone the queen. You won’t have to do anything.

694
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,330
It will look better that way in His Majesty's eyes as well.

695
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:59,640
All I need you to do is to agree with this.

696
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:08,520
Your Royal Highness, I apologize as your grace overflows,

697
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:14,650
but please... help me.

698
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:22,040
The only thing you must care about is the king's heart.

699
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,360
After this incident, the king will see the queen differently,

700
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,900
without realizing her dark intentions.

701
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:37,600
The weather is awful. Maybe it will rain.

702
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,490
Court Lady Han, the room is dark, so light the candles.

703
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,110
Yes, Your Highness.

704
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:14,050
<i>You can't meet with the king tonight.</i>

705
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:16,150
<i>Why would Your Highness...</i>

706
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:19,490
<i>Will you not be satisfied until you take everything I have?</i>

707
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:22,470
<i>Did you change the letter's contents?</i>

708
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:26,400
<i>You changed something that’s more important.</i>

709
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,090
<i>Why can't I change something like that?</i>

710
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,220
<i>I don't know what you are talking about.</i>

711
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:39,470
<i>I know... your lies.</i>

712
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:47,010
<i>If His Majesty knew the truth that I know,</i>

713
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:50,400
<i>then you’d know how my heart feels.</i>

714
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,340
<i>You’d feel what it feels like when your loved one looks at you with hate. Forever...</i>

715
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:59,360
<i>living your life looking into those eyes,</i>

716
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,860
<i>how harsh it is.</i>

717
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,150
<i>If you want to keep up the lie, leave the palace.</i>

718
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:21,610
<i>You figured out my weakness. All right, then reveal the truth to His Majesty.</i>

719
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:25,540
<i>But you will reveal another truth, too.</i>

720
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:31,740
<i>That Your Highness tried to kill His Majesty.</i>

721
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,580
<i>You knew everything and... </i>

722
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:48,720
<i>Your Highness, you can’t do anything to me.</i>

723
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,450
<i> You, too,</i>

724
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:59,650
<i>will end up losing someone precious to you!</i>

725
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,540
What is wrong?

726
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:51,540
You know, too, that His Majesty doesn't handle guilt well.

727
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:57,290
Guilt is the price you pay for staying alive.

728
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:08,910
<i>In order to gain His Majesty's heart, you're going to go this far?</i>

729
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:27,710
<i>Hurry up and take them in! They're getting wet! Hurry!</i>

730
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:38,100
It's finally raining after days of dark clouds.

731
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:41,590
My rank is higher in this lifetime than the last,

732
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:44,500
so why is living so pathetic?

733
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:50,630
Your Majesty, do I also have a now life and a past life?

734
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:54,600
According to the theory of a parallel universe, it's possible.

735
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:03,310
Here. This is our current life.

736
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:06,180
This is our original life.

737
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,540
It's very difficult

738
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:15,370
After sticking to Her Majesty, her speech has become ridiculous.

739
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:20,910
Then, do you think Daeng-Daeng is a person in his original life?

740
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,650
That could be possible.

741
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:25,040
That Mr. Fool, too?

742
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:32,170
Of course! He's probably running around under my orders.

743
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,440
- Then, how about me?
- Oh...

744
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:40,540
You'll always be... Court Lady Choi.

745
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,610
Oh, Hong Yeon would be—

746
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:48,550
Then, my mother and father probably live well in their original life. Right?

747
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:52,150
My mother only has four fingernails.

748
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,670
It ended up that way while picking out rocks in freezing winter.

749
01:05:55,670 --> 01:06:01,420
In her original life, she probably has all ten fingernails. Right?

750
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,040
Right.

751
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,410
And my father's eye is fine, too?

752
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:07,990
What happened to your father?

753
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,980
He got hit with a pitchfork.

754
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:10,740
What!

755
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:14,770
He must have borrowed rice to fulfill his military service and ended up being hit for not paying interest.

756
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,540
That's the only way to put fear into people so they won't go astray.

757
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,150
There are many who get hurt that way.

758
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,940
Don't worry. In the original life, your mother's ten fingernails don't even need fancy manicures,

759
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:34,550
and your father's two eyes are clear and bright as if wearing color lenses!

760
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:40,990
I wish I could see how pretty her nails have grown!

761
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:48,760
Me, too. I want to see my mom.

762
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:53,080
Our queen doesn't even know her mother’s face.

763
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:58,460
My goodness. Why did you have to mention her mother?

764
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:04,520
No, no, not that mother but another one! Madam Lee Soon-shin who's very much alive!

765
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:09,420
Why would you freely kill someone who's now even taken up Zumba dancing?!

766
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:18,780
Gathering in a kitchen where women are barred and now they're even crying!

767
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,320
Seriously, women...

768
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,180
Mother.

769
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:34,250
Mom...

770
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:47,920
Seriously, the rain makes us sentimental.

771
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,080
Hey, bring me some pajeon and makgeolli.
<i>(Scallion pancake and rice wine. Customary on a rainy day.)</i>

772
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:56,890
You should return quickly to Daejojeon Hall. This rain will not stop falling.

773
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:00,500
How do you know that? Are you a super weather forecast computer or something like that?

774
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

775
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:08,700
But when my wrist keeps hurting like this, it means that it’s going to be pouring all night.

776
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,130
Pouring? How much?

777
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,150
I don't know.

778
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:23,900
At this rate, as if someone is pouring down bucketfuls for several hours.

779
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,400
Pouring down bucketfuls?

780
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,580
Then the lake and the well will be filled with water?

781
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:34,210
Oh! Oh!

Yes, Your Majesty.

784
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:56,720
I'd like to read some more before going to bed for the sake of a united palace.

785
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,450
It's late, so you should return to your room.

786

<i>I told you not to come!</i>

791
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,170
When kneeling has becomes a daily habit...

792
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:06,680
I'll be unable to do so in front of the person to whom I should do it for.

797

01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,490
What are you saying, Your Majesty?

801
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:22,200
That woman is really...

802
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,510
hard to figure out.

803
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:27,060
Ooo-ha! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

804
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,820
- Why are you doing this, Your Majesty?
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

805
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,210
Oh, it's unlike you to be walking around alone!

806
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,100
Did you come out to get rained on, too?

807
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,960
I came to apologize to you.

808
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,870
Never mind. It doesn't matter now.

809
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:56,360
No, I can't just let it pass like this.

810
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,490
I said it's okay, so why are you being clingy like this?

811
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,420
Clingy?

812
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,520
I am a simple person.

813
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,400
I am the type of person who curses first when happy and picks a fight for no reason if I feel indebted.

814
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,480
I hate being cheesy... so get lost.

815
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:24,230
Get lost? I gathered up my courage to come and apologize to you, and that's all you can say?

816
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:29,700
If an apology is being made for the sake of the one making it and not the one who has to accept it, how is that an apology?

817
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:35,580
But there are rules for the royal family.

818
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:39,040
How long are you going to keep using that strange way of speaking?

819
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,350
Only till tonight!

820
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:47,970
Tomorrow, everything will go back to its original place. Oh... yeah!

821
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,690
Yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

Oh, yeah!

826
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:08,540
Today, my feelings are hurt so I won't be able to spend the night with you!

827
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,810
Sleep by yourself.

828
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:18,480
Oh, yeah! That's the best thing I've heard.

829
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:22,400
That was natural.

830
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,510
Did you come out without an umbrella?

831
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:32,350
Once in a while, it is nice to get rained on like this.

832

All those numerous thoughts seem to get washed away.

834
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,050

Be upset! Be upset at my pelvic gyrations and pour down some more!

840

The Queen's mental state is worsening every day since she attempted to commit suicide.

845
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,870
The core of the Inner Court is being shaken.

846
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:22,470
Therefore, isn't it right to petition to depose the queen?

847
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:25,250
- That's right, My Lord!
<i>- That's right, My Lord!</i>

Now, it's time for us, the Pungan Jo family, to unite our power.

849
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:51,550
Since the delicate neck has been exposed, we should bite it off!

850

852
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:18,290
<i>However, his only weakness was his heel, and he died after an arrow struck his heel.</i>

853
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:22,980
<i>That's how the phrase came about, Achilles' heel.</i>

854
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:27,210
<i>However, the reason why he died was actually because he didn't have a craftsman who could make armored boots for him.</i>

855
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:32,500
<i>If we didn't have any weaknesses, we may not have needed each other.</i>

856
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:39,010
<i>We became each other's weakness and got dragged down to hell...</i>

857
