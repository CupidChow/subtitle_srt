00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,370
Even the most vicious beast does not bite the human that feeds it. It wags its tail.

6
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,320
<i>Since I first started cooking at the age of 13, my dream was to enter the Blue House, no matter what.
(Blue House - South Korean President's residence)</i>

7
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,140
I shall become the person who feeds the strongest.

8
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,550
Well, that's how I became a chef.

9
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,330
As you mentioned, you have become the Blue House's youngest chef.

10
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,820
- The first.
- Excuse me?

11
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,390
- Here.
- The cod.

12
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,160
Okay.

13
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,190
Please Chef... The Chinese Ambassador is allergic to fish bones.
<i>[Aide to Chinese Ambassador]</i>

14
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,700
Be cautious and pay extra attention.

15
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,090
The ambassador is particularly sensitive to fish bones. Please pay extra attention.

16
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,500
Ah, if you say that one more time, only the fish head will be served.

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,830
Since the chef himself is especially handling it,

18
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,320
- he says please do not worry.
- Is he Qin Shi Huang or something?
<i>(The first emperor of Qin Dynasty in China)</i>

19
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,260
Qin Shi Huang?

20
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,530
Fishcakes were first developed because of Qin Shi Huang.

21
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:29,660
Qin Shi Huang, this jerk enjoyed showing his power so much, that even though he liked fish and ate it every day, if he found even one fishbone,

22
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,140
he mercilessly, to the chef's head...

23
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,160
Since the chefs were unable to last long and were being put to death, a new chef thought,

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,580
"Ah, I am also doomed to die," and gave up on himself and lost his spirit.

25
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,760
<i>As he was hitting the fish absentmindedly...</i>

26
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,060
"Eureka!" Yes, he was very lucky.

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,480
<i>You might think, "Would he really kill someone just over food?" but it's not "just food" you see.</i>

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,150
<i>A properly prepared cuisine can penetrate even a heart that's an iron wall.</i>

29
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,520
<i>Should I say it's the most attractive bullet in the world?</i>

30
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,890
That's why when I cook at the Blue House,

31
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,150
I think, "Cooking is politics."

32
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,990
Speaking of which, let's hear about what many are most interested in.

33
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,860
For example, the Blue House backstory.

34
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,320
Ah! Before that, we need to clear something up.

35
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,920
My name is off the record, payment is in cash. Okay?

36
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,580
Ah, that? It's been broken for a week due to a short circuit caused by a leak.

37
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,550
Did it break or did it get broken?

38
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,530
Sometimes it is necessary to look the other way like this.

39
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,060
That way I can benefit from it as well.

40
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,490
But... is it okay for us to be like this?

41
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:08,000
The game's over once the main dish is served. Right about now, the Chinese Ambassador should be tasting a slice of heaven.

42
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,800
Chef Jang! Find Chef Jang!

43
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,330
<i>- Chef Jang, where are you?</i>
- Ah, really!

44
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,400
Ah, being too good is tiresome.

45
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,500
Ah, the ambassador who fell in love with my cooking wants to compliment me himself?

46
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,430
- I will be right back, Seon-young.
- It's Hye-jung.

47
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,930
"Seon-young" suits you better.

48

<i>[Beware of dog]

50
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,600
Oh! Hey, you-you go try.

51
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,910
Mr. Jang Bong-hwan! We are from the Seoul Jongno Police Station, Criminal Division!

52
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:47,350
Of all surnames, that jerk Chef Jang's surname is Jang, so I feel like I am losing the battle of names too when he is called Chef Jjang. <i>(T/N: Jjang - slang for the best)</i>

53
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,340
In the future, when Korean cuisine becomes globalized, the name the world will know is

54
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,320
Boo Seung-min, not Jang Bong-hwan.

55
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,040
- Do well. Keep it quiet as well.
- That's right!

56
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,860
We shouldn't be misunderstood.

57
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,360
We are clean.

58
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,390
<i>[Beware of dog]
[If disturbed, it will bite.]</i>

59
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,100
My goodness, I was scared!

60
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,060
You will need to come to the police station for a bit.

61
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,370
The matter of the fish hook was resolved as having been caused by a hand caught fish,

62
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,030
and I took the responsibility for that and was fired. So, what more is there?

63
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,330
Circumstances of corruption in the foodservice suppliers have come to light.

64
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,520
- So how much?
- It's been happening for two years, so it's quite a bit.

65
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,500
And the circumstances point toward me?

66
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,520
Who says that? It's just for an investigation as a reference...

67
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,070
Ah, you really suck at acting.

68
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,770
- Why don't you open the door now?
- Detectives, as you may well know,

69
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,290
can a mere chef do something of this scale at the Blue House?

70
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,060
Boo Seung-min, that jerk's been a sous-chef all his life and has worked in the Blue House kitchen the longest. He is a deep-rooted evil.

71
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,600
I am telling you that jerk colluded with someone higher up and is framing me now!

72
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,160
Sure, sure. That's why we are telling you to come to the police station and explain your side of the story.

73
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,270
I was wondering why go that far just to get me fired but there was this, too?

74
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,440
To go this far, it's only possible at the level of the Chief of Staff...

75
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,860
- It's not possibly Chief Han, is it?
- Why are you suddenly talking to yourself

76
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,710
- when we are in hurry?
- Why do you think? I am buying time.

77
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,730
We don't have time so...

78
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,240
Uh, what is this!

79
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,310
Mr. Jang Bong-hwan! Stop right there!

80
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:38,060
Ah, you are so impatient! I will hire an attorney and Boo Seung-min, that bas—

81
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,500
I will look into him, and I will come visit you on my own.

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,920
You should defeat corruption and get promoted, shouldn't you?

83
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,210
Let's stop, okay? Did you hear? Okay. Okay.

84
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,180
Go. Go home.

85
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,470
Ah, really!

86
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,970
Hey! You crazy dog!

87
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,810
I told you to beware of dog. Don't come any closer.

88
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,370
Mr. Jang Bong-hwan! Something terrible will happen if you keep this up!

89
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,460
Aish, damn!

90
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,270
- Ah, that's right. I had an important question. May I ask?
- What is it?

91
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,190
Why do you serve blood sausage soup with rice in the holding cell?

92
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,470
- What kind of nutty talk is this!
- Because I really hate blood sausage soup with rice.

93
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:39,800
Is this a transport diner? A highway rest area?!

94
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,490
- Why are you obsessing about the menu!
- Because I'm a chef!

95
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,770
A man who only thinks about food even in this kind of dangerous situation, Chef Jjang!

96
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,010
Bullshitting...

97
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,710
- Uh! Don't let go! Don't let go!
- Ah, damn!

98
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,130
Ah, I almost died!

99
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,410
It's pretty, isn't it?

100
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,290
<i>No! There are so many women I still haven't met yet...</i>

101
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,060
<i>Help me! I want to live.</i>

102
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,750
<i>I desperately want to live!</i>

103
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,360
<i>This is... Heaven?</i>

104
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,350
<i>No, I am going to live!</i>

105
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,030
<i>But this cloth? I can't possibly be in a morgue while still alive, right?</i>

106
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,420
<i>That's not it.</i>

107
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,860
<i>That's right, how would I go to Heaven?</i>

108
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,590
<i>I haven't done anything bad but I haven't done anything good, either.</i>

109
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,230
<i>But this really outdated place is...</i>

110

<i>Hanok Village?
(T/N: Seoul neighborhood with many traditional Korean houses)</i>

111

<i>But why am I not injured when I fell from such a height?</i>

112
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,080
<i>The lower body exercises sure are what makes a man.</i>

113
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,530
<i>I am fine, right? My precious...</i>

114
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,540
<i>Huh? How did I lose all my muscles?</i>

115
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,810
<i>I've worked so hard for those babies. Where did they...</i>

116
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,460
<i>Damn, I heard that muscle becomes fat when loosened up... </i>

117
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,710
<i>but how long was I bedridden for?</i>

118
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,200
<i>Ah, why?</i>

119
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,990
<i>Ah, a dream, right?</i>

120
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,360
<i>Even after near-death, still dreaming about a woman... I must be fine.</i>

121
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,050
<i>But I should dream about being with a woman. What good is it dreaming about being a woman myself?</i>

122
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,080
<i>It's a thin line between a nightmare and a good dream.</i>

123
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,300
<i>But I saw this woman somewhere. Did I see her on Instagram?</i>

124
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,800
<i>No. We've had physical contact and were very close.</i>

125
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,100
<i>Soo-yeon? Chae-young?</i>

126
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,090
The water ghost!

127
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,520
<i>Uh-oh! Even my voice changed!</i>

128
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,810
Your Royal Highness!

129
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,150
You are finally awake!

130
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,070
I knew you would wake up!

131
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,670
Thank you. It really is fortunate.

132
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,460
- Please do not move.
- Why not? What?

133
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,780
You are still unwell so I will...

134
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,840
<i>That's right. Have this kind of dream. How ni—</i>

135
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,610
What is this? This awful tasting stuff.

136
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,110
Is it that uncomfortable to drink?

137
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,620
<i>What kind of dream has such a vivid sense of taste?</i>

138
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,000
I will have them brew it with more licorice and bring it again.

139
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,220
Is it possible that... this is not a dream?

140
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,950
What is... going on here?

141
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,110
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have left Your Royal Highness alone even for a moment.

142
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,270
I regret it so much.

143
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,740
From now on, I will not take my eyes off of Your Royal Highness even for a minute.

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,180
Your Royal Highness!

151
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,660
Why are they like that, scaring me?

152
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,900
Your Royal Highness! You shouldn't run like that, Your Royal Highness!

153
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,710
Where are you going? Your Royal Highness!

154
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,710
Your Royal Highness, where are you going?

155
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,100
It's dangerous running like that. It's dangerous.

156
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,870
My goodness! My goodness, Your Royal Highness!

157
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,790
<i>Your Royal Highness!</i>

158
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,500
<i>Your Royal Highness!</i>

159
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,300
Your Royal Highness!

160
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,490
- Your Royal Highness!
When did she... It's not like she's Hong Gil-dong.
<i>(T/N: a Joseon era fictional character like Robin Hood)</i>

161
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,360
Your Royal Highness! Please do not run!

162
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,230
<i>Your Royal Highness!</i>

163
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,520
<i>A palace? </i>

164
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,370
<i>- It's strange. Everything is strange.
- Your Royal Highness!</i>

165
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,070
<i>- Your Royal Highness.
- If this is not a dream, then what is it?</i>

166
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,100
<i>Really! What is this!</i>

167
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,980
Your Royal Highness! Your Royal Highness!

168
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,920
- Ah! Ah!
- Aigoo!

169
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,750
<i>The really strange thing is that, with me running around like this, it's not in the way?</i>

170
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
<i>I don't have it?</i>

171
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,400
Where did it go? My...

172
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,490
Mine! Where did mine go!

173
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,630
What are you looking for? I will search thoroughly for you.

174
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,150
Don't any of you come near me!

175
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:23,400
I am... a eunuch?

176
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,550
Your Royal Highness.

177
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,310
Something terrible will happen if you suddenly run around like this.

178
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,490
Wh-What did you do to me!

179
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,720
For your well-being, we'll have the royal physician diagnose...

180
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,180
Royal physician or whomever I see, I will make him into a eunuch as well!

181
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,070
This is utter nonsense. What kind of elaborate human trafficking scheme is this?

182
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,340
Why kidnap a man and even perform surgery?

183
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,520
You... Who hired you?

184
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,730
Boo Seung-min, that punk, is his grudge this deep-rooted?

185
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,320
Sorry?

186
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,860
Is it possibly Chief Han? Is that why the surgery turned out this well?

187
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,800
With the influence of the Chief of Staff, is it possible to even change a person's gender?!

188
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,220
But... why are you all dressed like that?

189
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,890
As if I time traveled.

190
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,380
Wha-at?

191
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,980
The year of your birth is...

192
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,480
May 31, 1988, a Gemini.

193
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,830
You reside at...

194
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,430
Seojung Parkville 302-ho, Sambong-ro 31, Jongno-gu, Seoul.

195
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,360
Your parents' names...

196
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,490
Father: Jang Gi-ryoung. Mother: Lee Soo-jin.

197
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,090
Each a teacher: Chinese and History.

198
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,370
I'm the only son born to a hardworking family of educators, a mutation, a crazy bastard.

199
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,620
What? Shall I tell you even the size of my underwear?

200
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,650
Can you tickle me?

201
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,480
Like this?

202
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,240
<i>As expected, it's not a dream. The sensations are too vivid.</i>

203
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,560
<i>Then the only answer is that my soul time traveled and entered this woman's body...</i>

204
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,490
I just need to wake up if it's a dream.

205
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,060
<i>If I entered, I just need to exit.</i>

206
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,530
You, there. Tell me everything about what happened to this woman.

207
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,890
"This woman"?

208
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,630
So okay, me. What happened to me?

209
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,580
It's all my fault. I didn't even know you went out alone.

210
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,500
Please kill me, Your Royal Highness!

211
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,390
If my problem could get solved by you dying, I would do that.

212
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,530
But that's not it, right?

213
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,680
Calm down. Calm down, calm down.

214
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,230
Stop crying, stop crying! That's right.

215
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,250
When and where did I go alone?

216
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,920
That is...

217
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,110
The night before last, Your Highness told me to get your bed ready early because you were tired.

218
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,420
I made sure that you were asleep before I went to do my work...

219
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,130
<i>With our rations, </i>

220
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,010
<i>must we even do the night patrol ourselves?</i>

221
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,530
<i>Is getting palace rations for two years that big of a deal?</i>

222
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,210
<i>You're the older brother of the king,</i>

223
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,510
<i>and I'm the king's best friend. We have our reputations to think about.</i>

224
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,130
<i> You have become a full-fledged palace person.</i>

225
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,800
<i> Ah, did you hear that story?</i>

226
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,760
<i>Is it about a woman or a ghost?</i>

227
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,830
<i>When you lower your voice and get excited,</i>

228
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,300
<i>it's got to be one of those two.</i>

229
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,460
<i>It's a story about a virgin ghost.</i>

230
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,000
<i>So it's both.</i>

231
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,510
<i>It's about a water ghost that appears in the lake right over there.</i>

232
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,400
The two of them immediately jumped in and saved Your Royal Highness.

233
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,900
Even when the royal physician checked your pulse and said it was normal,

234
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,220
but for an entire day and night,

235
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,360
you were inexplicably unconscious.

236
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,700
And I woke up just a little while ago?

237
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,840
<i>That's right. It's water.</i>

238
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,820
<i>I and this woman both fell into the water.</i>

239
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,490
<i>Our bodies got switched through water.</i>

240
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,020
Lead me, to that lake!

241
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,400
I said there is no need to follow!

242
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,070
I am just going there to see because I can't remember how I fell.

243
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,320
<i>Those damn tails.</i>

244
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,560
<i>They'll probably put up a fuss to stop me from falling into the lake.</i>

245
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,270
Are we going the right way?

246
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,070
It's in the same palace so why is it so far?

247
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,580
We've arrived, Your Royal Highness.

248
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,330
Behind that rock is...

249
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,640
the lake.

250
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,520
<i>Surprise attack!</i>

251
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,700
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

252
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,060
<i>Your Royal Highness!</i>

253
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,670
<i>Your Royal Highness!</i>

254
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,180
<i>Your Royal Highness, you shouldn't run like that!</i>

255
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,590
Your Royal Highness, it is dangerous!

256
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,850
Your Royal Highness, it is dangerous!

257
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,890
<i>Let's get back...</i>

258
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,470
<i>To my life. To my precious body.</i>

259
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,370
<i>Now, I will do good deeds once in a while as well.</i>

260
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,960
<i>God, Buddha, Mother Mary...</i>

261
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,050
Your Royal Highness!

262
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,050
Are you really not hurting anywhere?

263
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,930
Why is there no blasted water in the lake?

264
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,150
Was there a severe drought in just one day?

265
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:56,020
To prevent another accident, the water has been drained, Your Royal Highness.

266
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,460
You sure told me quickly.

267
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,280
Deepest regrets, Your Royal Highness.

268
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,560
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
<i>- Yes, Your Royal Highness.</i>

269
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,360
That damn "Your Royal Highness"! I am already so sick of it, I feel like vomiting!

270
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,140
Why am I, "Her Royal Highness"?

271
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,870
Right now, Her Royal Highness Bi is not in a good mood,
(T/N: "Bi" is a senior 1-rank name given to Queen Consorts.)

272
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,070
everyone may address her as "princess."

273
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,980
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

274
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,820
Her Highness? Bi? What is that?

275
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,070
Although you have been selected, it is still before the wedding ceremony;

276
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,020
thus, you are still Her Highness Bi.

277
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,600
Selected to be the spouse of a royal family member?

278
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,860
- Then I...
- You will become the queen.

279
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,510
So what you are saying is...

280
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,710
I am going to be Wangbi, the king's consort?

281
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,570
Yes.

282
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,740
Wow, now I am going crazy! Really!

283
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,900
<i>Deepest regrets, Your Ro—</i>

284
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,960
Princess.

285
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,360
How is it that he looks like a sculpture?

286
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,670
<i>He is so handsome.</i>

287
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,860
<i>Even his hands are so delicate.</i>

288
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,400
<i>What do I do?</i>

289
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,960
<i>[19]</i>
<i>(Mature Adult Rating 19)</i>

290
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,970
Your Majesty, it's already been two hours!

291
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,680
I worry for your health.

292
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,410
It would be best to end it here for today.

293
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,930
Head Eunuch, as a king who is responsible for a country,

294
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,950
is there anything more important than doing my utmost for its future affairs?

295
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,990
Although it is hard and tiring,

296
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,170
I cannot stop being diligent.

297
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,190
Fine, let's say that I give in 100 times and admit I time traveled,

298
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,660
but as a woman?

299
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,150
On top of that, not just any woman but the queen?

300
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,970
I don't even believe in marriage! Why do I have to be the king's wife—

301
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:50,290
<i>Wait... If it's the queen... the royal family?</i>

302
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,880
Would you like to go straight to the bathing room, Princess?

303
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,640
Call me "Your Royal Highness."

304
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,940
Call it all you want.

305
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,330
<i>- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.</i>

306
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,760
I am the Royal Highness, right?

307
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,740
<i>- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.</i>

308
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,640
That means I am the boss.

309
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,680
I hated hearing it, but suddenly it sounds good to my ears.

310
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,940
Look here! Fill up this lake with water this instant!

311
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,860
It is an order!

312
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,130
<i>There was such an easier way.</i>

313
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,020
We cannot, Your Royal Highness.

314
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,520
What!

315
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,990
You will come to your senses when I really boss you around—

316
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,840
<i>Ah! Please spare my life, Your Royal Highness.</i>

317
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,100
I've committed a sin deserving of death.

318
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,450
No, but still, just spare my life, please.

319
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,470
What is this? Why is she overreacting?

320
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,270
Her Highness Bi has finally woken up.

321
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,060
Seeing that as soon as she awoke she is scolding the servants,

322
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,170
she must have fully recovered.

323
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,040
Have her come here.

324
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,900
Your Royal Highness, His Majesty summons you to the pavilion.

326
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,150
<i>Your Majesty, the King!</i>

327
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,590
The king?

328
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,510
<i>The head of this place.</i>

329
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:10,220
As expected, she is full of energy.

330
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,990
Look here, Your Majesty.

331
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,340
Why are you looking like this?

332
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,310
- That's not important right now.
- Not important?

333
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,370
You must always keep your clothes neat and have an upright heart.

334
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,340
- I understand, but I'm in a hurry right now.
- They say scholars,

335
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:38,130
wake up at dawn with the rooster's cry and get dressed in a neat fashion. And discipl—

336
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,420
Disciplined...

337
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,850
And keep a disciplined mind--

338
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,500
Look you can lecture me later, but I'm in a rush right now.

339
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,320
- I really need some water right now.
- Look here.

340
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,850
- Get her some cold water.
- No, no!

341
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,830
What I mean is, I need water in the lake.

342
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,790
There's no water in there right now.

343
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:08,670
Oh, you're asking me to fill the lake with water?

344
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,180
- Yes, yes!
- I cannot.

345
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,100
- Why?
- Grand Queen Dowager ordered it herself.
<i>(T/N: The king's grandmother)</i>

346
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,690
If I fill the lake with water, I would be disobeying her order.

347
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:26,860
Aren't you the king? Why can't the king fill up the lake with water on his own?

348
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:36,290
Not only should I calm Grand Queen Dowager's heart after such an accident,

349
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,220
but I also agree that leaving the lake empty is correct.

350
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,330
Why is that correct? Explain it logically.

351
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,190
Just because.
<i> Is he playing around with me right now? </i>

352
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,170
How dare you put your hand on my person?

353
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,820
It looks like you care much about scholars,

354
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,330
but isn't covering your nose right in front of someone's face a bit rude?

355
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,390
It's a relief seeing you healthy. I was very worried.

356
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,150
Oh, sure. I feel your desperate sincerity.

357
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,740
But have you always spoken in that tone of voice?

358
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,560
After I almost died and came back, I realized I have a lot of grudges against the world.

359
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,870
- How did you end up in the lake?
- That part!

360
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,570
That part is the only part she doesn't remember.

361
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,650
Just that part. That is strange.

362
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,960
Oh? You're reading the Four Books and Five Classics?

363
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,690
If it's the Book of Changes, it's the best on--

364
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,990
I don't like it when someone else touches my books.

365
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,150
Oh well now, I've already touched them.

366
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,660
I already dirtied it, so let me see.

367
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,590
A wife must follow her husband's lead and she must follow him to the grave!

368
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,820
- You mean "she must respect him."
- That's what I said.

369
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,020
You said, "she must follow him to the grave."

370
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:17,000
The light must not disturb the darkness and a wife must obey her husband!

371
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,920
Are we in the Joseon era right now?

372
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,990
- It is the Joseon era.
- Oh, wow, and who made you king?

373
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,430
I am the king.

374
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,030
How absurd!

375
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,850
Let go.

376
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,570
Look here! Why are you doing this?

377
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,660
<i> Something is very amiss...</i>

378
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,890
Your Majesty!

379
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,780
It is time for your morning meeting.

380
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,680
Ah, it's already time.

381
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:08,090
- A king who cares for a country is like a bird who doesn't stop—
- Ah, right.

382
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,260
Since you're busy, I'll get going.

383
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,330
<i>[Four Books and Five Classics]</i>

384
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,630
Wait!

385
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,070
Eunuch!

386
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,660
Yes!

387
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:10,120
Eunuch, you know how much I care for my books.

388
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:16,250
My actions have gotten slower with age. My hand slipped, Your Majesty.

389
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,190
That one book is probably three times your wage.

390
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,790
Please kill me.

391
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:31,160
That shouldn't happen. No matter how precious my book is,

392
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,060
it's not more precious than your life.

393
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,190
You are so gracious, Your Majesty.

394
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,910
I didn't know you were as passionate as I am about books.

395
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:47,970
I will prepare new books for you.

396
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,860
I have to get going to my morning meeting.

397
00:34:54,830 --> 00:35:00,600
Look here! Prepare the palanquin.

398
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,370
Let's ride together. This palace is bigger than I thought.

399
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,710
I don't want to. There's not enough space to ride together.

400
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:14,100
And you should go get washed.

401
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,470
Let's go.

402
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,010
What's with his attitude?

403
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,220
Your Highness, you can't sit on the ground.

404
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,340
My legs hurt.

405
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,940
Memory loss...

406
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,980
It's not a simple memory loss.

407
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:16,570
Due to her worries deepening over a big event, she is escaping reality by hallucinating as a different person—

408
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:45,910
The only people in this room are Queen Dowager and me.

409
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,530
If the words you just said roam around and come into my ears again...

410
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,370
That will never happen.

411
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:03,560
- You must find a way to heal Her Highness Bi.
- Yes.

412
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,450
How are you going to make a girl who doesn't even know her own name, the queen of the country?

413
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,240
We can tell her her name and find her memory.

414
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,940
Please do not be concerned.

415
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,210
Would you like to see her for yourself?

416
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:48,490
There are many eyes watching. There is no need to confirm the fact that she can't even recognize her elders.

417
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,970
I will minimize her contact with people and find a solution.

418
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,570
But why did Bi go out that late at night?

419
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:05,310
I believe someone pretending to be the king woke her up.

420
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,960
If it's a royal order, it's hard to be suspicious.

421
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,170
Who would do that?

422
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,850
She woke up?

423
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,760
Really?

424
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,160
My talisman must've worked.

425
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,790
That female Buddhist is skilled indeed...

426
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,290
Keep bringing me such entertaining news.

427
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,120
It's a story the officials will love to gossip about.

428
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,360
The soon-to-be-installed royal concubine pushed Bi into the lake...

429
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,050
The installation of the royal concubine will not take place.

430
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,460
- Did you say Jo Hwa-jin?
- Yes.

431
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,530
They don't have a function, so I'm glad. Even if the Pungyang Jo family is now powerless.

432
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:11,060
We must always be vigilant of even dying embers.

433
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:16,310
With regard to the abolition of military service, the So-byun Tonglon and Dae-byun Tonglon strongly oppose each other. <i>(T/N: sounds like urine and feces)<i></i></i>

434
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,530
We will convey those thoughts to Your Majesty.

435
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,630
My thought is...

436
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,580
Dae... Dae-byun?

437
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,760
So... So...

438
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,350
How can I...

439
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,580
Dae-byun Tonglon asserts the abolition of military service.

440
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,210
However, since it's impossible to avoid a tremendous financial loss,

441
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,360
how about proceeding with So-byun Tonglon's step-by-step reduction?

442
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,210
My will is exactly that!

443
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:00,280
Next, is the most urgent issue of the royal marriage.

444
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,230
Right, you have not heard yet, but Bi has finally woken up.

445
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,240
Your Majesty, there are rumors in the palace

446
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,370
that her condition is very serious and unusual.

447
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,890
Is that so?

448
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,220
This is the first I'm hearing of this rumor.

449
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,230
I only found out about her waking up when I happened upon her by chance.

450
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,520
It seems that I was the last to hear the news.

451
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,050
The slow one...

452
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,960
It's merely gossip.

453
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,160
Out of concern that Your Majesty would be worried,

454
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,600
the ministers kept it from Your Majesty.

455
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,860
Such a deep thoughtfulness--

456
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,320
I believe it is not just gossip.

457
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,150
When I met Bi, she did seem different than before.

458
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,630
Ah, I heard that she has no memory of the day of the accident.

459
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,680
She must have been in great danger to lose her memory from the shock.

460
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,450
Danger?

461
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:05,020
Her Highness Bi falling into the water was not a simple accident.

462
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,050
What do you mean?

463
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,230
At that time, the Head Sulli
<i>(T/N: Head Eunuch in charge of managing food)</i>

464
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,990
saw a suspicious woman while he was passing the lake.

465
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,950
Who on earth could that have been?

466
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:33,220
It could only be one woman according to the entry records.

467
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,220
Jo Hwa-jin, of the Jo family.

468
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,030
<i>How dare you make up stories to place blame!</i>

469
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,380
She had no reason to dare to harm Her Highness Bi.

470
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,910
She has already been selected to be the royal concubine.

471
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:57,100
Perhaps she harmed Her Highness Bi because she wants to be queen.

472
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,090
This is an unfair frame-up, Your Majesty.

473
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:03,970
The Jo family is famously loyal,

474
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,790
and his daughter also, as to her character,

475
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:12,000
- she is well-known to--
- This is treason!

476
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,430
How dare you say such—

477
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,980
Why did Jo Hwa-jin secretly enter the palace?

478
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,090
She met Her Highness, the Queen Dowager, isn't that right?!

479
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:22,480
What are you saying? Heaven will punish you!

480
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,470
Your Majesty, please reveal the truth

481
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:30,200
and punish severely.

482
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,490
Deepest regrets.

483
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,850
This is rather embarrassing.

484
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,320
Jo Hwa-jin... was with me that night.

485
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,650
All night long.

486
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,870
Pardon?

487
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:15,400
Ah, of course, we haven't gone through the customary selection formalities yet,

488
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,180
but my youthful vigor has...

489
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:25,990
But you all knew that already, didn't you? Since rumors get to all of you faster than me.

490
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,830
Since things turned out this way, let's hurry and finish with the royal wedding and appoint the concubine.

491
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,460
How about it?

492
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,470
- That is—
- The circumstance of the accident

493
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:40,140
will all be resolved as soon as Bi regains her memory. Let's not jump to conclusions.

494
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,420
How can any work be done when you are divided and fighting like this?

495
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,480
Isn't that right?

496
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,950
If the ceremony happens, it'll become the Kim family's world!

497
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:05,800
Since the king so cherishes Jo Hwa-jin, there should be an opportunity to counterattack.

498
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,860
From now, our Pungyang Jo family's fate is in Jo Hwa-jin's hands.

499
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:20,060
First, we need to get her installed safely and then worry about the future.

500
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,700
It looks like the royal wedding should finish without any problem.

501
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,580
Why the shadows on your face?

502
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,000
It will be a little bothersome fight.

503
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:52,130
I regret that my inadequacies cause you trouble every time.

504
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,630
It's no trouble.

505
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,800
You are getting more skilled at ruling as well.

506
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,440
I am not worthy of the praise.

507
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,650
I am merely getting by with you to depend on.

508
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,080
Anyway,

509
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,570
I hadn't considered your vigor.

510
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:13,970
Deepest regrets.

511
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:18,210
I am the one to regret not understanding your needs.

512
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:23,050
However, balance is important even when it comes to manners concerning women.

513
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:26,440
Since the Inner Court is also part of the government,

514
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,320
please do not forget that the queen is more important than the royal concubine.

515
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,100
I will take it to heart.

516
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:40,190
And I will for sure find out who the woman was that the Head Sulli saw.

517
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,850
We should make sure that no danger comes to Bi again.

518
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,990
Yes, you are right.

519
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,720
<i>[Practising poetry and caligraphy]</i>

520
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,850
I am sorry, My Lady!

521
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:24,880
Oh no! You wrote so much...

522
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:45,070
This poem... Now, I've written it with your help.

523
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,260
Thanks to you, it became more beautiful.

524
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,330
My Lady...

525
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,430
<i>My Lady, a message came from the palace.</i>

526
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,840
Receive the king's royal command.

527
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,830
After the royal wedding, Jo Hwa-jin, the daughter of Vice Secretary Jo Dae-su,

528
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:16,820
will be installed as the royal concubine, so enter the palace immediately.

529
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:25,150
Ah, so refreshing!

530
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:30,230
More cold water.

531
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,830
Water is going in.

532
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,990
Pour it in without hesitation.

533
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,330
That's right, water. That's the problem.

534
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,550
<i>Wouldn't I be able to get back even if I fell into other water?</i>

535
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,750
<i>I fell into the pool anyway.</i>

536
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,330
Isn't there any other lake around here?

537
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:55,050
There are two more inside the palace alone.

538
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,370
- Really?
- Yes.

539
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:00,560
Although the other lakes are the same now.

540
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,530
What do you mean?

541
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,170
Her Royal Highness, the Grand Royal Queen Dowager ordered

542
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,620
to drain all the lakes in the palace.

543
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,910
All the lakes?

544
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,880
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

545
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,340
Until when?

546
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,110
Forever, Your Royal Highness.

547
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:20,790
Then, what you are saying is...

548
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:24,770
<i>I... have to live like this?</i>

549
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,490
<i>Forever?</i>

550
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,250
Your Royal Highness!

551
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,780
<i>Water. I am going to try all kinds of water.</i>

552
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,340
<i>I want to go back!</i>

553
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,740
Your Royal Highness!

554
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,070
Your Royal Highness!

555
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,950
Your Royal Highness!

556
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,390
That's dirty water!

557
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,760
Your Royal Highness! Your Royal Highness!

558
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,390
No!

559
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,510
Your Royal Highness!

560
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,050
I can't move.

561
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,990
Lower your bottoms!

562
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,280
Your Royal Highness! Please pull your head out!

563
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,390
You shouldn't do this!

564
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,130
<i>As expected, it's not going to work unless it's that lake.</i>

565
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:37,430
How great the shock must have been that you keep suddenly changing whenever you see water.

566
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,680
You, cutie, what is your name?

567
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,370
It's Hong-yeon. Hong-yeon.

568
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:59,970
If you even forgot me who has served you since birth,

569
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:03,800
how sick you must be.

570
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,420
Why do you cry, making my heart ache?

571
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,190
<i>I will serve the herbal medicine.</i>

572
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,340
Why do you dare show tears? Her Royal Highness is the one who is having the hardest time now.

573
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,660
Deepest regrets.

574
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,590
That's right. I am the one who's having the hardest time.

575
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:36,630
You two wouldn't know this feeling of loss.

576
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,820
Straighten yourself out then come back.

577
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,440
<i>It's not possible to go back soon anyway.</i>

578
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,090
<i>In order to last here, I need information.</i>

579
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,460
But that human trash that I met earlier, what is his name?

580
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,700
I am asking, what is the king's name?

581
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,190
How could I dare say the name of the sacred king?

582
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,750
That's right. You are not allowed to say or write the king's name.

583
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,720
When exactly is right now in the Joseon era?

584
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,440
Joseon Year, Sin-hae <i>(1791)</i>.

585
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,610
It's the second year of Deokwang-gun's reign.

586
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,930
Deokwang-gun. Deokwang-gun...

587
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,410
I am sure I've heard that name.

588
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,710
Give me some more hints.
<i>(T/N: Hint is an English word used in modern Korea.)</i>

589
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:31,590
Hin... tu?

590
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:37,100
Then I will sing, so give me a sign when the name of the king comes up.

591
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,630
Listen carefully.

<i>he became a king overnight. A Cinderella man.</i>

<i>As the least educated and powerless puppet king, causing extreme hardship for the people,</i>

<i>he died of illness, 14 years after becoming king.</i>

<i>They say overnight wealth is scary, but he sure acts the part for being an overnight king amazingly well!</i>

I ordered them to move quickly with the preparations for the wedding ceremony which were postponed due to your accident.

616
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,360
It is tomorrow, our wedding ceremony.

617
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,930
<i>Oh my god! I forgot the most important thing.</i>

618
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:38,660
<i>Cheoljong was famous for neglecting state affairs over women and was known as the Joseon era's sex maniac! </i>

619
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,990
Wait!

620
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,020
There is something you need to know first.

621
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,370
As you wish, I told everyone to not come near.

622
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,580
Is it all right now?

623
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,990
So this is something difficult to believe but...

624
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:11,650
I am not sure how I should explain this...

625
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,280
Here, something...

626
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,920
Why?

627
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,350
It's a flower petal.

628
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,400
It will be shocking but try not to get too shocked.

629
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,020
- I am, to be honest...
- To be honest?

630
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,560
I am a man.

631
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,170
I'm a healthy male who lives in the Republic of Korea about 200 years from now.

632
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,070
I don't know what happened.

633
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,440
I thought I was going to die after falling into the water but when I opened my eyes, I was already like this.

634
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,710
Anyway, I am not the person you think I am.

635
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,390
What you see is not everything.

636
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,330
You are probably thinking about what kind of bullcrap this is.

637
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:06,030
But you really have to judge wisely.

638
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:11,090
A wedding ceremony is one thing but a first night... that's really not right.

639
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:15,260
I am not really into men.

640
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,490
This is more problematic for you.

641
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,250
For me, this is an identity issue, isn't it? For you though, it's a fraudulent marriage.

642
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,360
It's a crime!

643
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,340
I understand what you are saying.

644
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,960
Really?

645
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,380
You... Unlike what I read in the history books, you are great!

646
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,920
Here!

647
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,220
<i>- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!</i>

648
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:46,610
Have the royal physician examine and precisely diagnose Bi's condition and report to me!

649
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,160
Huh?

650
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:57,190
Please do not worry. I will do all I can to help you get better.

651
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,750
Please do not forget. You are not alone.

652
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:05,000
No matter how out of your mind you become or how badly madness destroys you,

653
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:09,130
I will forever be your husband.

654
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,790
Ah! You are still unwell.

655
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:20,030
Here, hurry and guide Bi to her residence.

656
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

657
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,020
Please do not worry.

658
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,690
If you go in and rest, you will be fine.

659
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,830
Everything will be fine.

660
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:33,030
It is all right.

661
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,720
It is all right.

662
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,520
Books sure don't lie. Maybe, he is even more dim-witted than what was recorded in the history books.

663
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,790
Please rest well.

664
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:47,090
Okay. I got it. I got it.

665
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:51,090
Your Royal Highness, you should not lift up your skirt when walking.

666
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:54,070
Your Royal Highness, you should not show your undergarments when walking.

667
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,880
Your Majesty, you need to walk slowly.

668
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,400
<i>You should not do that.</i>

669
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,630
Just what are you up to?

670
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:09,830
No, I don't want it. Western medicine suits me better than oriental medicine.

671
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,790
There. Say, "Ah..."

672
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,630
That's why I...

673
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:49,900
<i>Since your head is filled with water energy, we need to fill it with yang energy using sandalwood.</i>

674
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,060
Your Royal Highness, you need to regain your memory.

675
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,970
Hey, you quack! You don't have a valid license, do you?

676
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,380
Why the hell are you smoking a person with a brazier?!

677
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:11,120
I will puncture the Gi-heyol 13 that treats mental illness.

678
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,590
<i>Okay. Do whatever you want.</i>

679
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,320
<i>It's not my body anyway.</i>

680
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,630
I remember!

681
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,680
Suddenly, I remember everything.

682
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,820
Hong-yeon, my precious servant who grew up with me at my home.

683
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,470
Here, what is her last name?

684
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,380
You are...

685
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,730
<i>Choi</i>

686
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,430
Cho...

687
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,190
<i>Choi</i>

688
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:58,190
Choi! Court Lady Choi.

689
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:04,550
Then, what is my last name?

690
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,030
How would I know the last name of lowly royal physician?

691
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,030
What are you all doing? Hold down Her Royal Highness.

692
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:17,430
Something terrible will happen if you move wrong.

693
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:21,110
You are using something that is only used for grilled skewers on a person! Are you out of your mind?!

694
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,460
My expertise is acupuncture.

695
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,190
There is nothing better than this to open up clogged blood vessels.

696
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:27,630
This, in the back of the neck—

697
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,700
Stop! Stop! Stop, please.

698
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:36,390
If I regain my memory, I am the queen starting tomorrow.

699
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:42,860
What would be an appropriate punishment for a serious crime such as unnecessary medical care?

700
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,660
Overdoing anything is less effective than doing less.

701
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:52,630
My colorful medical technique will stop here.

702
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,460
You're very skilled.

703
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,590
I am all better now. All better. All better.

704
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,730
<i>Okay, since you all want it so badly, I will become the queen.</i>

705
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:11,030
<i>I am the queen of a country. It shouldn't be too difficult to fill up a lake with water as I wish.</i>

706
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:36,580
<i>Your Royal Highness, have you awakened?</i>

707
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,630
<i>Enter!</i>

708
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,630
I have to wear all of this?

709
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,500
<i>[Palace Ceremonial Robe Set]</i>

710
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,170
<i>Undergarments, old man panties, (pants-shaped underwear worn under the skirt)</i>

711
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:36,010
<i>wide pants, large skirt,</i>

712
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,060
<i>chest wraps, underwaist,</i>

713
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,020
<i>skirt with one line of gold thread pattern, skirt with two lines of the pattern,</i>

714
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,130
<i>pleated outer skirt with three lines of the pattern,</i>

715
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:45,510
<i>short jacket, and outer jacket.</i>

716
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,930
<i>Upper garments are narrow and tight</i>

717
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:50,060
<i>and lower garments are blown up wide,</i>

718
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,990
<i>to create a "generousness to the bottom and stinginess on top" elegance.</i>

719
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:01,040
So suffocating.

720
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,040
<i>The ten strings of beads covering your eyes and the jade beads covering your ears mean that</i>

721
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:40,500
<i>the king should shield his eyes and ears and hear his subjects.</i>

722
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,930
Straighten your neck, please.

723
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,830
It's really heavy, though.

724
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,370
You should endure that oppressing weight.

725
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:45,250
I am Joseon's first "no bra."

726
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:50,960
<i>Bride and groom bow twice!</i>

727
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:56,350
Your Royal Highness.

728
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:58,590
What do you want me to do?

729
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,930
This is not a memorial ceremony.

730
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:40,310
A wedding is a funeral.

731
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:45,730
How many times am I supposed to bow?

732
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:48,410
Two more times.

733
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:00,990
They are a very beautiful couple.

734
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:04,430
This is all Grand Queen Dowager's work, isn't it?

735
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:08,150
Thank you for the recognition, Royal Queen Dowager.

736
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,240
<i>Bride and groom share the gourd cups of wine!</i>

737
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:51,990
Uncle, are you crying now?

738
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:58,420
Although it's a joyous thing to become the mother of this country,

739
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:04,100
I feel like I am losing my only daughter...

740
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,930
But you are now a buwongun though.
<i>(T/N: Queen's father)</i>

741
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:12,620
Buwongun Young-eun

742
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,390
Is that so?

743
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:29,250
It is proclaimed that Andong Kim Family's Kim So-yong is now the Queen of Joseon!

744
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,410
<i>Now that I think about it, I finally know this woman's name.</i>

745
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:34,370
<i>You must love me!</i>

746
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,420
<i>I can't breathe. I can't breathe.</i>

747
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,580
<i>Is it a heart attack?</i>

748
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,370
<i>Ministers!</i>

749
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:27,340
<i> We respectfully congratulate you, Your Majesty!</i>

750
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:36,410
Inside the palace, no one is an enemy forever and no one is an ally forever.

751
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:40,730
So that you don't get entangled, center yourself, and empty your heart.

752
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,470
Please do not worry.

753
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:47,270
I am just going there to give strength, however meager, to the king.

754
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,330
Nanny, it's not like I am going there to die.

755
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,890
Don't cry so much.

756
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:01,280
Such a kind lady...

757
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,440
How will you survive in that scary palace?

758
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,750
I will be with her and serve her well so please do not worry!

759
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:21,100
I surrender, surrender, surrender!

760
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,450
I was thinking that we would recite a poem at a pavilion.

761
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:30,720
If it was going to be like this, you should have told me that we are going to train, not sightsee.

762
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,980
Isn't it nice?

763
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,920
To sweat like this under superb scenery.

764
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,570
Nice? Thanks to my father being the Head of Military Affairs,

765
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:42,120
I train in martial arts every day even though it does not suit me. Do I have to do it here as well?!

766
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,390
If I had known, I would never have followed you.

767
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,880
If anyone sees this, they will think we are enemies or something.

768
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:54,360
Why are you so upset over the joyous event of your cousin becoming the queen?

769
01:09:56,530 --> 01:10:00,400
I am so happy that I am overflowing with energy.

770
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,580
If you don't like martial arts, let's have a fight.

771
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,760
I changed my mind. I am going to return immediately.

772
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,420
Defeat me then return.

773
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,390
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

774
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,430
It feels like it's digging into my neck.

775
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:27,350
I thought I was going to die. SDM doesn't even come close in comparison. <i>(T/N: SDM - Studio, Dress, Makeup / modern wedding) </i>

776
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,170
The room got quite an upgrade?

777
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:45,800
This is Daejojeon. <i>(T/N: Official residence of the queen)</i>

778
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,260
Like the name, it is big.
(T/N: "dae" means "big")

779
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,830
It means "make a big contribution."

780
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,560
What? Save the country or something?

781
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,490
It means to conceive a descendant for the king.

782
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,600
<i>That's right. I need to spend the night with him.</i>

783
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:12,420
<i>In 33 years of Jang Bong-hwan's life, this is his greatest crisis.</i>

784
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:30,280
<i>There is always a way out.</i>

785
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:35,190
<i>There definitely is a way...</i>

786
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,830
<i>We are bringing the wine and food.</i>

787
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,390
<i>That's right. It's alcohol.</i>

788
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,820
<i>Ancestors, you were wise.</i>

789
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,360
I will pour you a cup.

790
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,260
Which wine would our king like?

791
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,970
I enjoy the snacks more than wine.

792
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,720
<i>Damn.</i>

793
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:37,190
<i>Sine it is a special day, instead of snacks, let's go for it. Huh?</i>

794
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:40,150
Drinking too much is not good for your health.

795
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:44,890
<i>This jer—! Let's not get excited and calmly...</i>

796
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:48,650
<i>There is no one in Korea who is not proud of their ability to drink alcohol.</i>

797
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:54,490
You can't hold your liquor, can you? By the looks of it, you are not able to drink as much as me.

798
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:55,630
That's good then.

799
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:58,870
All this wine is yours.

800
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:04,920
<i>Is he a bulletproof vest or something? None of my attacks are getting through.</i>

801
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,790
Ah, then do you want to play a drinking game?

802
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:10,230
I know a few drinking games.

803
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,820
Is that so?

804
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:16,580
3, 6, 9! 3, 6, 9! 3, 6, 9!

805
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:20,650
<i>When did the multiplication table begin?</i>

806
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,950
You don't know? Then...

807
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:26,230
Attendance sheet, attendance sheet, attendance sheet.

808
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:28,830
Attendance sheet, attendance sheet, attendance sheet.

809
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:32,140
<i>The word self-doubt was created to be used at a time like this.</i>

810
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:33,220
Hey, why aren't you doing it?!

811
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:34,900
Do what? How?

812
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:41,260
You said it's a game so I was expectant, but all you do is shout "attendance sheet." It's not that good.

813
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,090
<i>What a difficult punk!</i>

814
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:47,580
Drinking and dancing go together, right?

815
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,330
How long are you going to have me dance to the music of the Jongmyo Royal Ancestral Ritual?

816
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,990
Look at my shoulders. They're moving.

817
01:13:56,990 --> 01:14:01,040
Ah, the wine is going in. Drink, drink, drink...

818
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,030
It keeps going in. Drink, drink, drink...

819
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:05,450
Are you having that much fun?

820
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:12,860
<i>Wait! Did the music of Jongmyo Royal Ancestral Ritual work?</i>

821
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,820
Then, in earnest?

822
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:30,390
No, I didn't mean "in earnest" that way.

823
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:44,790
<i>Then, is there only the last resort?</i>
