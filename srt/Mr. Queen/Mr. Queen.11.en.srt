Teacher,

46
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,980
I had a nightmare.

47
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,020
But what's scarier than the nightmare is me.

48
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,510
I felt dirty from that dream but I also liked it at the same time.

49
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,310
I don't know if it's my soul's mind or my body's mind.

50
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,560
It... It feels like I have been assembled with pieces taken from here and there.

51
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,770
That's right.

52
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,500
It almost feels as if... I became a Lego block.

53
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,610
Who on earth... am I now?

54
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,300
But... why are you calling me "Seonsaengni"?
<i>(T/N: Seonsaengnim - teacher, respectful term)</i>

55
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,470
Ah, you are breaking the flow! Just listen since it's a sort of custom.

56
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,680
So, what is your opinion as an expert?

57
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,340
It's common to have weird side effects after being in a vegetative state.

58
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,090
It's common?

59
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,200
Oh, I see it's common.

60
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,880
Wow, that gives me great comfort.

61
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,470
Just hearing those words made all my worries go away.

62
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,490
Able to cure the illness without using even one needle...

63
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,100
That is truly a good physician.

64
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,950
Now that I look at you, I see my physician is actually a psychologist.

65
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,810
Then, when will this mixed-up and contradicting condition of mine be resolved?

66
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,430
That's the problem from your mind.

67
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,680
If you start accepting, then it will no longer bring pain.

68
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,760
And when it no longer brings pain, only then will it disappear.

69
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,400
Accept myself as I am?

70
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,280
True. Being inconsistent is the only consistent thing about me anyway.

71
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,840
Right.

72
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,340
The ingredients you used last time for the beauty mask were good, too.

73
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,500
Using that experience, try making toner for the face this time.

74
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,570
Elasticity, gloss, whitening... makes one fall for it just hearing about it.

75
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,760
Make several since it will be replaced every 28 days.

76
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,180
Why 28 days...

Skin regeneration cycle.

78
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,770
Then, at least, whenever the dead skin cells slough off, she will need me.

79
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,100
<i>Your Majesty, your father is here.</i>

80
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,900
Is it really Eui Bin's maid?

81
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,030
Her Ladyship, Eui Bin, believes so.

82
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,210
I am... hoping that the maid who sold the accessory is Oh Wol.

83
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,440
Eui Bin must be greatly upset.

84
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,850
I need to go see Eui Bin.

85
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,290
<i>Your Majesty, Her Ladyship, Eui Bin, is here.</i>

86
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,100
Let her in.

87
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,200
Bin.

88
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,090
I—

89
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,440
I drew Oh Wol's features,

90
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,020
since I remember her the best.

91
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,130
For sure, the one who sold the accessory was Oh Wol.

92
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,650
There is no reason why she would have ended up like that inside the palace.

93
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,180
I guess this will confirm that.

94
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,130
Please continue your conversation.

95
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,630
Yes.

96
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,030
I just heard.

97
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,260
How hard it must have been for you all alone last night.

98
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,130
As it took all night, I've regained myself, so please don't be concerned about me too much.

99
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,660
There's something I must tell you, Your Majesty.

100
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,290
It's about your heart toward the queen.

101
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:41,980
Instead of winning against others, it seems harder to win against myself.

102
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,410
So, please, don't try so hard to stop it.

103
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,320
What I want isn't to make you feel apologetic.

104
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,550
Is everything all right?

105
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,830
I've only been back for one day so not much has happened, but

106
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,190
I plan on being busy with the appointment of royal concubines.

107
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,440
Ah, appointment of royal concubines.

108
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,530
During the time you stayed at home,

109
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,930
was there anything out of the ordinary?

110
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,510
Out of the ordinary?

111

112

There wasn't. Is something wrong?

113

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,150
it seems so empty there now. That's the only problem.

116
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,370
You should stop by to see the king.

That's a whole different person.

160
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,620
Her eyes are slanted a little this way.

161
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,070
Or was it the left side? Ah... I'm now hungry...

162
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,300
All right.

163
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,900
Her face was narrow but her cheeks were full.

164
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,460
Her forehead was wide while her eyes glistened.

165
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,480
Like this and this part was widened.

166
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,900
Ahem!

167
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,960
Your Majesty, the Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen is here.

168
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,770
I think iris liquor would be good but what do you think?

169
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,150
I'm sorry?

170
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,810
Right. I was thinking out loud and got ahead of myself.

171
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,660
I was thinking about the alcohol to be served at the banquet.

172
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,900
Your Majesty, there are some things that I've been preparing.

173
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,500
I deserve to die!

174
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,460
Sit comfortably. That way you'll be able to work well.

175
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,010
If I may...

176
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,490
Is that comfortable? Come over here.

177
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,250
Wha—

178
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:13,320
This is the traditional banquet layout. The banquet I am thinking about is a little different.

179
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,590
Reduce the number of dishes

180
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,000
and the things for display only, like the big fruit bowls put in the center,

181
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,040
I would like to leave them out.

182
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,340
I apologize, Your Majesty.

183
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,860
A palace banquet should be splendid and plentiful.

184
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,460
And the fruit bowls are...

185
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,310
When my people are starving, food only consumed by the eyes...

186
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,740
That kind of food, let's instead...

187
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,470
invite the starving people both inside and outside the fortress and feed them.

188
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:57,060
A frugal but not shabby... and splendid but not extravagant banquet.

189
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,560
That's what I would like.

190
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,850
For the next 15 days, I will put my all into it.

191
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,790
Do well then.

192
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,530
Why does a grown man have so many tears?

193
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,120
This detailed... recording the source of the offerings.

194
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,440
The queen's father is more meticulous than I thought.

195
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Eui Bin's enemy isn't the Kim family, but the queen.

196
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,480
Which makes her have a narrow view.

197
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,410
We have to make this into something bigger.

198
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,270
So while we're breaking up the entire Kim family,

199
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,040
the queen will also be dragged down.

200
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,160
The ledger?

201
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,990
What was the queen's father thinking, putting something that dangerous there? Why I ought to—

202
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,530
For now, keep it a secret. If the family finds out, there will be a lot of agitation.

203
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,320
Ah, the queen's father, seriously!

204
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,010
More importantly, whose hands do you think it's in?

205
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,820
The king stayed at the queen's father's house for two days, even ignoring the message asking him to return to the palace.

206
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,280
The ki—

207
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,330
The king?

208
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,070
Then he's probably thinking to expose it during the banquet on Surinal.

209
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,960
Even if they have a weapon,

210
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,600
we need to make it so they don't have the strength to wield that weapon.

211
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,650
From the queen's father's standpoint... I guess I would be the last one left to suspect.

212
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,720
It's not like he can confront the king and ask if you stole the ledger. He must be so distressed.

213
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,470
Were you not able to find the whereabouts of the masked man from the Royal Investigation Bureau?

214
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,620
There's no one with a scar on their face in the Royal Investigation Bureau.

215
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,480
Even if we can't find the ledger,

216
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,290
we need to stack the deck to bring our plan to fruition.

217
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,000
How is it going with your analysis of the (candidate) families?

218
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,710
<i>The five-second rule. It only takes five seconds to fall in love.</i>

219
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,690
Your Majesty, they're all here.

220
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,150
Oh, this is all?

221
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,270
Nice to meet you.

222
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,880
Nice to meet you.

223
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,050
Let's see, let's see. Was there a lady that had the same feel as me?

224
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,830
Oh!

225
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,970
Nice.

226
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:29,550
Our dear Lady Yoon, where and how have you been raised so that your energy is so extraordinary?

227
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,180
In my hometown, there is a very beautiful and famous mountain.

228
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,270
Its name is Mountain Gamak.

229
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,200
- Mountain Gamak?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

230
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,320
How admirable!

231
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,120
Admirable...

232
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,790
Your Majesty, in my hometown, there is a huge castle.

233
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,750
It was built by King Jeongjo—

234
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,870
In the town of Namyang (modern-day Hwaseong), is the Hwaseong Temporary Palace the only thing you can brag about?

235
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,630
Whenever you open your mouth, you're bragging about that temporary palace.

236
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,110
Now your town will have one more thing to brag about,

237
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,220
when our dear Lady Hong becomes Suk-ui.
<i> (Noble Consort, Suk-ui, Level 2)</i>

238
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,060
Your Majesty, I'm so grateful!

239
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,200
There are many peach trees near the Donggang River of my hometown,

240
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,750
so when all those trees are full of blooming flowers, how beautiful its scenery is!

241
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,110
I'm told that the conception dream when I was born was also a dream full of peaches.

242
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,170
No wonder.

243
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:32,290
If a peach were born as a person, I wonder if it would be you, Lady Min.

244
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,260
Peach.

245
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,790
If you gain these three families' hearts, Your Majesty,

246
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:46,230
it would be like two wings of a dragon and a phoenix,

247
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,330
while you're riding a white tiger.

248
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,690
Hwaseong Temporary Palace is guarding the gate

249
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,620
and the beautiful scenery of Moutain Gamak is right in front of my eyes,

250
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,340
so the whole room is full of the fruity fragrance of peaches.

251
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,100
<i>Papyeong Yoon Family, </i>

252
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,190
<i>Namyang Hong Family, and the Yeoheung Min Family. </i>

253
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,130
<i>The balance of families here is good. </i>

254
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,850
<i>Innocence, sexy, cute; what harmony.</i>

255
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,470
Yoon Gyeong-ok from Papyeong Yoon Family,

256
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,960
Min Ja-hyeon from Yeoheung Min Family,

257
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,720
and Hong Sim-hyang from Namyang Hong Family

258
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,260
will be installed as Suk-ui, Level 2 of the Inner Court.

259
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,720
With this, these three Suk-uis and their families have now become my family.

260
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,350
Therefore, invite the lords of these families to the Surit-nal banquet.
<i>(5th day of 5th lunar month)</i>

261
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,090
<i>Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!</i>

262
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,100
My goodness...

263
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,350
The king has started to create his own faction.

264
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,520
Even so, because of his truly incompetent self, they will leave his side soon.

265
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,970
The king insisted on holding a banquet so much,

266
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,500
so this was why in the end?

267
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,290
Are the preparations going well?

268
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,230
Don't worry.

269
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,100
That's it!

270
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,890
How curious all of them must be about the outside world,

271
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,610
to be so good at neolttwigi like that.
<i>(Traditional Korean see-saw like jumping game)</i>

272
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,080
Queen Dowager is coming.

273
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,850
Have you been well, Your Royal Highness the Queen Dowager?

274
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,940
Long time no see, Eui Bin.

275
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,450
<i>- Greetings, Your Royal Highness, Queen Dowager.
- Greetings, Your Royal Highness, Queen Dowager.</i>

276
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,120
I'll go to the Archery training field and start my practice.

277
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,210
It's been a while since you've been awake from your vegetative state,

278
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,250
but you've never visited me to give me a greeting.

279
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,850
As soon as I came back, it has been so hectic to prepare the royal concubine installation.

280
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,100
I'm so sorry, Your Highness.

281
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,280
Seeing as how you almost died, aren't you too perfectly fine now?

282
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,290
It's because I was born with exceptional health.

283
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,090
I guess you gave up on the upcoming hunting event on Surit-nal.

284
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,340
You're not practicing archery at the training field, but enjoying neolttwigi so leisurely.

285
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,320
Since Eui Bin will be the winner anyway,

286
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,300
I've decided to just enjoy the process only.

287
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,330
I'm not as confident about hunting animals, as I am "hunting."
<i> (T/N: English word 'hunting' - used for 'hitting on', seducing)</i>

288
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,630
Hunting...

289
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:22,670
Do you know why the Inner Court's young women play at hunting on Surit-nal, My Queen?

290
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,110
Well, I'm not so sure.

291
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,080
Surit-nal is the day when we chase away evil spirits.

292
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,160
With the blood from the slaughter, people chased away evil spirits in the past,

293
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,100
but now we've replaced it with playing at hunting.

294
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,720
- Boo!
- God...

295
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,760
In fact, a corpse was found in a well in the palace,

296
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,520
but there was a rumor that it was Lady Eui Bin's maid.

297
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,260
A palace well?

298
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,740
Gosh! Why, of all...

299
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,710
- Your Majesty!
<i>- Please come here.</i>

300
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,900
Oh, all right.

301
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,590
So cool!

302
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,080
- You're so good at this.
- Your Majesty!

303
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,370
<i>Triple Axel!</i>

304
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,110
I can't fall asleep and my mind is so restless.

305
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,790
Shall I send my Suk-uis a Messenger chat?

306
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,920
Ah... What would be good?

307
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,520
A simple beginning that is not too burdensome but can leave a nice aftertaste...

308
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,120
Ah!

309
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,490
Tell them to deliver one to each Suk-ui's quarters.

310
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

311
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,320
Oh, and tell them to keep a watch if the king visits any of them.

312
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,960
Yes.

- Huh?

320
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,140
- It feels like something changed.
<i> - One! Per! Each! His! Majesty!</i>

<i>Keep! A! Watch! On! Suk-ui's! Quarters!</i>

322
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,080
"Are you asleep?" Are you asleep?

323
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,850
Huh...

324
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,680

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,950
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

326
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,010
Geez, why was she so curious about that?

327
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,680
Three "Are you asleep?"

328
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,510
Here is the response.

329
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,390
What? Three were sent, but why is there only one coming back?

330
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,440
Are they putting in too much effort?

331
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,250
Let's see...

332
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:02,160
Wow, how graceful this handwriting is. As expected from a woman of a prestigious noble family.

My Queen!

Ah, My Queen!

- You! I told you that you're forbidden!
- But...

368
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,720
At the concubine installation ceremony, as it was an official occasion,

369
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,600
we had no other choice but to act like a happily married couple.

370
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,970
Right now, it is a very important time when I'm regaining my identity,

371
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,900
so I'd like to ask for your cooperation.

372
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,150
Dammit...

373
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,330
How severely different the temperature of her attitude is...

374
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,500
She must feel easily shy unlike how she looks.

375
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,540
Now, the bal-gi of dishes is complete.
<i>(Bal-gi - record)</i>

I'll count on your hard work.

377
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,790
Have you confirmed the bal-gi of offerings to be used for the Ritual for the Heavens?

378
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,360
<i>Here is the bal-gi of offerings.</i>

379
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,490
Why do they keep talking about bal-gi-s back there?
<i>(T/N: "bal-gi" also means 'erection' in Korean.)</i>

380
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,100
The bal-gi of dishes is the record of the food.

381
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,720
And the bal-gi of offerings means the record of items to be used during the rite.

382
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,130
Why do you ask, Your Majesty?

383
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,400
Really? Am I the only trashy one here?

384
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,190
Y-Your Majesty!

385
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,100
You've been overworking for several days,

386
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,570
so you should now go to your bedroom and take a rest, Your Majesty.

387
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,360
No, I'm fine.

388
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,190
Since we don't have much time, let's finish the rest.

389
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,630
Gosh, I almost felt pity for him again.

390
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,320
This won't do. I should send more passionate messages for tonight's messenger chat.

391
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,950
Bal-gis are indeed dangerous.

392
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,980
He's got nose-bleeds due to some unnecessary thing, unlike anything described in history.

<i>As I can't forget it, it will come to my mind.</i>

395
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,720
How different she is between the day and the night...

396
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,810
Is her mind to forgive me and not being able to forgive me colliding with each other?

397
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,730
<i>There is no way to forgive a crossed mind. </i>

398
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,370
<i>Is there any road where we can walk together?</i>

399
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,480
<i>So I wish, the next time, even if it's in our dreams, </i>

400
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,050
<i>we can walk together from the beginning. </i>

401
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,160
Sword fighting in the middle of the night? Isn't one crazy rascal enough?

402
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,960
I need to prepare for the fight that is to take place on Surit-nal.
<i>(5th day of 5th lunar month)</i>

403

404
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,620
How do you evaluate your own skills as a swordsman?

405
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:12,040
I wouldn't know! Since I am not interested, I have never put all my power into it.

406
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,860
That's why I need you... not knowing your potential.

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,760
Oh, really? That's good. I really hate when it rains on Sports Day.

413
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,230
Since my father is coming, I have to look especially splendid.

414
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,310
It's my first public appearance so take special care.

415

All right, all right. I look beautiful.

416
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,460
Everyone will look only at me, right?

417
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,370
You are... going to use a real arrow?

418

Today, I...

419
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,770
have a big hunt.

420

They need to be delivered in a rush, so hurry up. Hurry.

Ah, you are working hard.

This is the fresh produce for the palace. It's being used for today's Surit-nal Banquet.

423
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,510
We need to get to the palace fast so we are in a bit of a hurry.

424

427
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,730
You need to get dressed, Your Highness.

428
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,540
Just a moment.

429
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,820
On such an important day...

430
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,490
Although it's not the best way, I need to see my fortune like this at least.

431
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,230
Let's see... our Pungan Jo family card...

<i>[Tojang, one]
<i>(One of the lowest cards in gambling)</i></i>

One rabbit. <i>(T/N: rabbit is on the face of the "one" card.)</i>

434
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:45,400
Well... fortune is relative anyway.

435
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,670
Let's see... our king's card...

436
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,560
Injang, nine...
<i>(The highest card in gambling)</i>

437
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,630
Will it get turned over?
<i>(T/N: She's guessing the movement of power.)</i>

438
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,780
Then... the queen...

439
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,480
Dragon?

440
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,420
<i>[Uhjang, eight]
<i>(Second highest card in gambling)</i></i>

Uhjang, eight. Ah, darn!

442
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,550
Today's fortune reading is not very good.

443
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,740
Queen, this wench... again?

444
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,060
Is she planning something?

445
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,980
<i>[Daejojeon]</i>

446
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,290
<i>Her Highness the Queen Dowager is here.</i>

447
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,390
You should have sent a message before coming—

448
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,650
You make it so obvious that you are displeased.

449
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,540
In my days, I couldn't dare even think of behaving like that.

450
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,650
Regardless of age and country, a mother-in-law's sudden visit is difficult to rejoice in.

451
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,060
And on top of that, talking back...

452
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,790
I heard that you made a lot of food for Grand Royal Queen Dowager, is that right?

453
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:19,230
But you have yet to serve me even a snack.

454
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:24,150
Are you more afraid of the grandmother-in-law's scolding than the mother-in-law's?

455
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,210
No, no way.

456
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,220
Grand Dowager Queen looks young because she takes such care in maintaining herself.

457
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,780
However, she cannot defy time.

458
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:41,030
Think about it carefully. I will live much longer than Grand Queen Dowager.

459
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,010
- I will soon be servin—
- I need to taste it right now.

460
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,910
I am curious about your skills that I have only heard of in rumors,

461
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,280
that I cannot wait.

462
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,780
Right... now?

463
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,620
Is this how married life with in-laws start?

464
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,210
Oh, what a headache...

465
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,490
What could it be? That wench's hidden card.

466
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,220
Head Chef, syrup!

467
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,730
What am I supposed to do if the fresh produce doesn't get here today!

468
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:39,300
Even the soldiers who were guarding the food are all dead, so what can be done?

469
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,040
Ah, seriously!

470
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,250
- Dried fish!
- Huh?

471
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,630
Dried fish! Dried fish!

472
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,240
Dried—

473
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,460
Head Chef is too busy these days.

474
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,220
I can't order him around.

475
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,680
Where is the syrup?

476
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,360
<i>[On a sleepless night...]</i>

477
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,530
Head Chef! Head Chef!

478
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,890
Your Maj-Majesty!

479
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,880
What is wrong?

480
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,700
Your Majesty!

481
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,680
Ah, the... these valuable things! They are all rotten!

482
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,140
They must not have been stored properly.

483
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,230
K-K- Kill me, Your Majesty.

484
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:02,820
Would I? This happened because there's surely someone who has guaranteed your life.

485
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,660
Head Chef!

486
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,190
Your Majesty.

487
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,990
There is big trouble. Someone poured rocks into the rice pot.

488
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,370
At this rate, we can't even serve a bowl of rice properly.

489
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,950
Don't worry and just prepare what you can.

490
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,600
I will somehow have the ingredients brought in to you.

491
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,710
Yes.

492
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,490
Please save me! Please save me!

493
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,460
She has to see me going through the trouble of bringing it all over by myself like this,

494
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,440
in order for my mother-in-law to stop being so upset with me.

495
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,830
The combination of the sweetness of the syrup and the salt... the standard of the sweet-salty taste!

496
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:22,050
♪ Oh, Byeokgyesu flowing in Mountain Cheongsan... ♪

497
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,850
Director Han?

498
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,580
This punk!

499
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,480
Where?!

500
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,100
My popcorn!

501
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,090
This damned family!

502
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,100
Where is the snack?

503
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,690
Th-That is...

504
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,810
Here...

505
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,710
Look forward to your palace life from now on!

506
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,550
Since our situation is like this,

507
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,930
as soon as your martial arts demonstration is done, you should go get the ingredients.

508
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,680
Yes.

509
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,820
Your grace is immeasurable for allowing us to attend such an important event as this, Your Majesty.

510
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:20,380
Of course, I should invite you. All the Suk-uis are well.

511
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:24,000
- Have you all been well, My Lords?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

512
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,100
I hope you have a great time today.

513
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,830
Hasn't Queen Dowager arrived yet?

514
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,350
I'll go check, Your Royal Highness.

515
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,820
I wondered if you had run away.

516
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:04,350
Why would I? Whoever committed a sin should gladly pay for that sin.

517
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,000
What a relief that you at least know that.

518
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,480
The queen served a snack to me this morning so I had to taste it. That's why I was late getting dressed.

519
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,750
The queen did?

520
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,670
<i>Gosh, this is killing me, sandwiched between these two...</i>

521
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,680
<i>Is she perhaps getting some weird misunderstanding again?</i>

522
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,660
No way...

523
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,780
The Royal Guard will demonstrate their martial arts.

524
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,250
Everyone!

525
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,150
Draw swords!

526
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,510
<i>With that same sword, he dared trying to harm Her Majesty the Queen?</i>

527
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,620
Spar!

528
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:26,090
Oh my! The king has properly prepared this event.

529
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,860
Your Royal Highness. Grand Queen Dowager. Now, it's time to start the hunt.

530
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,210
Your Majesty, please come change into your hunting outfit.

531
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,410
I'll be back shortly, Your Royal Highnesses.

532
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,430
I'll be back shortly.

533
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,240
First row, present arms!

534
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,830
Fire!

535
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,960
Fire!

536
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,080
Fire!

537
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,600
I thought they were nothing...

538
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,970
Oh, rich items are the best, indeed.
<i>(T/N: Referring to online game weapons)</i>

539
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:07,400
Oh, I think I look so sharp. Great! I look awesome and cool, huh?

540
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,150
Why is that woman looking so determined?

541
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:20,000
There are always some people who put their lives on the line on Sports Day.

542
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,340
How dare she glare at me!

543
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:26,420
One point for a bird, two points for a rabbit,

544
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,850
three points for a badger, four points for a wild boar,

545
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,920
five points for a deer, seven points for a wolf,

546
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,670
nine points for a bear, and lastly, the tiger will give you ten points.

547
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:40,070
All of you will get 10 arrows.

548
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:45,230
And for a fair competition, the court ladies and palace maids serving you won't participate.

549
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:50,530
Gosh, how cruel is that! If this was modern times, there would be an uproar of petitions to the Blue House.

550
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:54,180
Then, we'll start the competition.

551
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:07,150
Well, now, you may all depart.

552
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,570
I'll just go kill some time somewhere.

553
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,810
Today's hunting competition won't have any big surprises, I think.

554
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,630
Although this is a war of pride in upholding each family's honor,

555
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:42,630
the Queen doesn't seem enthusiastic at all.

556
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,700
So, you can afford the leisure to enjoy the game, Queen Dowager.

557
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:51,040
when you might have ended up seeing your son's face sometime today!

558
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,170
I guess now is the time to give you my present.

559
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:04,490
On the night when the queen went into a vegetative state, the King and Eui Bin were supposed to consummate.

560
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:10,430
The queen was able to get up from her sickbed just one day after her vegetative state.

561
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:17,770
Are you suggesting that she went into a vegetative state on purpose, just to stop their consummation?

562
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:22,770
The queen has risked everything to gain the king's heart.

563
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:27,670
She jumped into a lake and even stepped in front of a sword that was about to behead Eui Bin.

564
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:31,810
Now, she has even put one last thing on the line in the end.

565
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:37,790
The queen has abandoned her family.

566
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:50,050
I was getting bored, but now I'm listening to a really interesting story.

567
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:54,470
The king suddenly insisted on holding a banquet,

568
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:59,450
and the queen expedited the concubine selection, choosing prestigious families with power.

569
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:03,220
It's as if she's gathering the king's supporters.

570
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:09,240
Today, in front of these three families, the king will definitely show the true self that he has been hiding.

571
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,940
I mean, a strong kingly figure.

572
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,640
Do you get it now? The queen is making moves for the king.

573
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,450
Aren't you afraid of the aftermath, after making such an accusation?

574
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:28,900
I'm sure you believe the queen is totally your ally.

575
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,560
To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed in you.

576
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:36,090
Distracted by the queen's petty tricks, you've been deceived just like that.

577
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,970
And you're now getting old too, Your Highness.

578
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,070
I'm going to rip apart that mouth of yours!

579
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:47,430
Since the queen's vegetative state was fake, I'm not guilty of that charge anymore. Therefore...

580
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:51,390
I'm no longer afraid of you!

581
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,410
Why did you stop playing music?

582
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:01,780
Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager will get angry.

583
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:20,810
Next, His Majesty the King will bestow the Dano Day fans.

584
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,330
You've worked hard for this event. I'm looking forward to the banquet.

585
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:50,250
I see you've also worked hard, Councilor.

586
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,970
<i>Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager is here.</i>

587
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,920
Welcome, Your Royal Highness.

588
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:12,390
How boring that event in the inner court was, I couldn't bear it any longer.

589
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,860
I came here, wondering if it's better over here in the outer court.

590
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:20,240
I'm sorry for not giving you good enjoyment.

591
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:24,800
I expected to see some martial arts demonstrations, but I guess I came too late.

592
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:31,080
But come to think of it, such scripted demonstrations are as boring as those other ones anyway.

593
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:37,300
What do you think about having a real sparring match, then?

594
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,240
I'll let the Royal Guard spar.

595
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,120
Why don't you do it yourself, My King?

596
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:51,940
I'm told that you made a living by cutting firewood and carrying water on Ganghwa Island.

597
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,550
With such strength, I guess you would be able to do it.

598
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,950
But such manual labor is different from doing martial arts.

599
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:05,540
On top of that, as I've been sitting on the throne for the past few years, my body is now rusty.

600
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,790
Then, instead of weapons, let's use the Dano Day fans.

601
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:16,510
Ah! What do you think of sparring with the Director of the Royal Investigation Bureau? You two are similar in age, too.

602
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:23,590
The Director of the Royal Investigation Bureau is a warrior, who has been trained properly.

603
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:27,030
I'm worried that His Majesty might get hurt. So if you insist on a real sparring match, I'll—

604
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,350
I must see the king do the sparring.

605
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:37,740
What do you think?

606
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,760
<i>My father is wrong. </i>

607
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,390
<i>Please show the king's bare face on Surit-nal.</i>

608
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,120
All right!

609
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,680
Darn it!

610
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,550
Oh, no...

611
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,740
Go. You're not the game I'm looking for.

612
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,390
Huh? Isn't it this way?

613
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:05,260
Oh, this tree. I think I saw it earlier.

614
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,360
Geez, which way should I go?

615
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:18,070
Holding the fan in one hand, the one who captures the opponent's fan will be the winner.

616
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:23,240
Go easy on me.

617
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,850
What on earth is going on now?

618
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,840
Geez, I told you to go easy on me.

619
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:01,160
How will you take responsibility if you harm your king's body this way?

620
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:07,390
Since this is Grand Queen Dowager's order, I have no other choice but to do my best.

621
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,620
So, you're saying, Grand Queen Dowager is behind you?

622
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,630
Then this time, I'll again give you a lesson on who is the owner of this palace.

623
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,980
You did say he was different from the late king. He is different, indeed.

624
01:02:55,470 --> 01:03:00,430
Gosh, I don't know. After I take a nap, it will end and they'll come looking for me anyway.

625
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,440
Gosh, that scared me! What are you doing here?

626
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:12,440
What do you think I'm doing? I'm hiding to survive.

627
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,000
It's not like you'll really get killed. Why are you trembling in fear?

628
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,520
Even if I don't get killed, it's quite painful getting shot with that fake arrow.

629
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,720
I still have the bruises I got from the last year.

630
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,380
What a crybaby.

631
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,140
Don't worry, I'm not interested in hunting.

632
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:31,440
But I'll get shot by another lady's arrow in the end.

633
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:47,090
Gosh, this man. Why have you already come back?

634
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,870
<i>[Tiger]</i>

635
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,650
<i>[Tiger] +10 points</i>

636
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,550
<i>Like this?</i>

637
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:58,410
<i>Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!</i>

638
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,970
<i>Here's your souvenir. Go. </i>

639
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,430
Huh? Already?

640
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,940
Her Majesty the Queen's archery skill is great to catch a tiger this early!

641
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:14,270
She's like a god-given archer!

642
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:20,200
I didn't see her but only heard the sound of the wind. And then suddenly it hit me, you know?

643
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,500
Oh, really?

644
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:04,010
<i>It was you. You're that bastard. </i>

645
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,240
I won't forgive you.

646
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:32,170
I'll end your life.

647
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:57,160
<i>[Mr. Queen]</i>

648
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:06,300
<i> Translation and Timing Carefully Crafted

649
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:14,210
<i>I have to relay regrettable news. </i>

650
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:17,560
<i>As my hand slipped, I shot the arrow toward the queen by accident. </i>

651
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,810
<i>The banquet is about to start, but the ingredients are not here yet.</i>

652
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:20,960
<i>Not possible, is this all?</i>

653
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,730
<i>Was it you, who put the drug in it?</i>

654
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,610
<i>My name is Lee Saeng Mang.</i>

655
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:26,360
<i>According to the new ingredients, I'm going to make a new menu list. </i>

656
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,530
<i>How dare you kill my precious big needle!</i>

657
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:32,580
<i>What we make today isn't just food, it's the face of the president. </i>

658
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,490
<i>How dare you insult me!</i>

659
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:37,030
<i>- Catch them!
- This isn't just disloyalty, it's treason!</i>

660
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:40,990
<i>You will have to pay for your action of not suppressing your temper.</i>

661
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:45,490
