W-Why...

8
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,440
Did the king come to visit me while I was asleep?

9
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

10
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,410
So it wasn't a dream, then.

11
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,290
Then, why is he acting like this suddenly, as if he's being chased?

12
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,380
It's because the situation of rebellion is very urgent.

13
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,020
Even so, this is a bit...

14
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,350
Please don't worry too much, Your Majesty.

15
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,130
Yes, His Majesty will return soon.

16
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,520
That's right. There must be some reason why he had to hurry like that.

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,840
As soon as he finishes his inspection, he will come back right away.

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,530
Save the time for saying goodbye to me, he can better hurry up and come back sooner.

19
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,190
That must be... why he's acting like that.

20

You could've done it at once like this.

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,780
It was only possible since the queen made up her mind.

23
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,340
The queen did?

24
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,670
For the royal baby she's carrying, she abandoned the king and chose our clan.

25
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,890
If so, I should also take the queen back in

26
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,540
for the sake of the royal bloodline.

27
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,940
I'll make sure that she will never challenge you for power again.

A human is really an animal of adaptation.

33
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,570
It used to taste so bland and tasteless, but now I can feel the true taste of the ingredients.

34
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,970
I don't get tired of these no matter how much I eat. Rather, the more I eat, the hungrier I get.

35

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:54,630
Since I'm pregnant, my worries have grown, I overthink, and my tears have increased.

159
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,530
This is all not me,

160
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,090
but all of my hormones.

161
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,340
Oh, my... my heart hurts so much.

162
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,270
♫ <i> Where are you </i> ♫

163
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,940
It seems like the needles are wandering around in my heart.

164
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,430
Your Majesty...

165
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,220
♫ <i> Where is my dear one right now</i> ♫

166
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,800
Oh, what do I do...

167
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,180
Why am I like this?

168
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,740
♫ <i>Always standing in the same place</i> ♫

169
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,850
We are still searching for the corpse. Please wait a little longer.

170
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,310
I cannot wait.

171
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,630
If there is a chance that the king is still alive, we must hasten the process even more.

172
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,690
I will announce the king's death, so get ready.

173
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,240
Yes.

174
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,230
I'm completely armed. No more reason to cry.

175
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,060
Oh, what a surprise.

176
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,430
- Your Majesty.
- My goodness, I thought the baby was falling out.

177
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,490
How could you say such a thing so recklessly?

178
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,250
Your Majesty...

179
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,390
What's wrong? You're making me feel uneasy.

180
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,960
Is the king hurt?

181
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,330
The king is...

182
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,960
The king has...

183
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,110
passed away!

184
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,160
<i>If I hadn't just fallen asleep...</i>

185
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,500
The king...

186
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,240
has passed away.

187
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,350
<i>If only... If only I hadn't let you go.</i>

188
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,490
<i>Sangwibok!
(T/N: "Please come back, sire" - Calls the deceased king 3 times asking the king's soul to return.)</i>

189
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,030
Sangwibok!

190
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,640
Sangwibok!
<i> (Getting no answer and letting go of King's robe means the soul has truly passed on)</i>

191
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,120
<i>If only I hadn't come to this place...</i>

192
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,360
<i> If we hadn't met...</i>

193
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,360
<i> Then you would've still been alive..</i>

194
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,500
<i>[5 days before the coronation]</i>

195
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,540
What Sangwibok? Beseeching a dead king to come back.

196
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,500
What spine-chilling words they are.

197
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,190
Moreover, at this moment when the corpse hasn't been found yet, Sangwibok is especially spine-chilling.

198
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,470
In my heart, I would like to enthrone a new king right away.

199
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,210
But breaking the custom of waiting five days for the king to resurrect,

200
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,500
it is clear that it would be used for political strife in the future.

201
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,840
Even if the king survived,

202
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,630
he would not be able to return to the palace.

203
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,330
Until the coronation is over, I will seal the gates of the palace.

204
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,690
True. If we just endure the next five days and finish the coronation,

205
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,730
he will no longer be king. So even if we kill him, it would not count as treason.

206
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,940
How much longer will I have to wait for the queen?

207
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,750
Does she even have any plans to reconcile with the family clan?

208
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,960
In the upcoming days, I will tell the queen to hurry and pull herself together so that she may come and meet with you.

Was this your plan from the beginning? <i>(without any honorifics)</i>

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,000
His Majesty already knew the risk.

235
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,280
Even so, to save you, he left the palace despite the danger.

236
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,850
What do you mean?

237
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,940
Arrest Prince Yeongpyeong immediately.

238
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,280
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

239
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,890
What are you doing!

240
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,630
Why are you taking your anger out on Her Majesty?

241
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,040
The people who took His Majesty's life are the Thieves of Donghak!

242
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,030
Those rebels who didn't even behead the magistrates

243
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,360
but attacked a king while he wore the robe with the dragon embroidery?

244
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,430
Do you think I will believe that?

245
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:20,400
The ones who killed the king were your soldiers, Kim Byeong-in!

246
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,440
The life of a queen who worked with you to drive His Majesty to his death

247
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,210
is now being taken by me!

248
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,270
No, please!

249
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,680
For the sake of the baby, Her Majesty is carrying,

250
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,860
please stop, please!

251
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,930
Our queen doesn't know anything, so, please...

252
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,970
Put him in prison.

253
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,100
Are you all right?

254
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,270
What was he talking about? Your soldiers harmed the king?

255
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,380
All of you, leave us alone.

256
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,530
- Your Majesty...
- It's all right.

257
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

258
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,540
When misfortune happens, one wants to find a target to place the blame on.

259
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,460
It was Prince Yeongpyeong's delusion only,

260
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,520
so you don't have to pay any attention to it.

261
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,090
What is the reason you're putting Prince Yeongpyeong in prison?

262
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:12,070
Prince Yeongpyeong fired those Donghak reformers who infiltrated the Royal Guard

263
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,080
to hide their identities which was recently confirmed.

264
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,200
Those people were also involved in the accident the king suffered, so I was about to investigate Prince Yeongpyeong,

265
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,890
but I see I was a step later than he was.

266
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,420
What are you talking about right now?

267
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,700
You make it sound like Prince Yeongpyeong killed the king.

268
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,730
It's obvious that someone in the palace secretly communicated with the Donghak reformers outside

269
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,670
and gave them the information about the king leaving the palace.

270
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,830
To do so, that person had to be in a position able to learn of the route for the king's trip.

271
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,410
So, Prince Yeongpyeong became the prime suspect.

272
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,450
Are you really sure that the king was killed by the Thieves of Donghak?

273
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,590
You should worry about something more important than that, Your Majesty.

274
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:55,410
Now, our family is the only one that can protect you and your baby.

275
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,850
Please do not concern yourself with any other unnecessary issues.

276
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,090
You must pacify Grand Queen Dowager right now.

277
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,250
If you miss a smooth timing,

278
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,800
you won't be able to restore a relationship with our family ever again.

279
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,770
In my next life, I'll have to be born as you, Prince Yeongpyeong.

280
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:39,050
"Secure the evidence." Do you know how blasted hard it is to carry out that simple command—

281
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,690
Now all of you arrived.

282
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,990
Despite all, gathering here in a gisaeng house during the national mourning period is—

283
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,250
Since I put a lot of effort into preparing this comfortable setting,

284
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,570
why don't we all be honest at this meeting at least?

285
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,320
The king's death is...

286
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,910
something for us to celebrate, is it not?

287
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,250
Please, help yourselves.

288
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,170
How worrisome it is with the rebels going crazy like this.

289
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:27,180
I'm very worried about the future of Joseon.

290
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,360
At this rate, there are no guarantees that the Thieves of Donghak won't attack Hanyang. <i>(The Capital, what is now Seoul)</i>

291
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,910
If that happens, it will be hard for all of you here to stay safe.

292
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,110
Therefore, during the time of the funeral, not only the palace,

293
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:46,020
but all of Hanyang will be better off, locked down, I think.

294
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,890
Under the emergency order, we must strictly tighten entry into Hanyang

295
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,330
and arrest all suspicious persons,

296
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,020
to wipe out all the Thieves of Donghak, given this chance.

297
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,200
That is really a great idea.

298
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,940
<i>The queen must not be in her right mind now.</i>

299
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,020
When was she ever in her right mind?

300
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,160
With her pregnancy, she thought she grasped the power in her hand and acted up.

301
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,070
But now since the king died like that, she must be in shock, I bet.

302
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,270
Now, if she gives birth to a legitimate son,

303
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,770
to the contrary, that will take her life.

304
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,820
You're right about that one!

305
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,630
It's about time to replace the candles and incense sticks.

306
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,430
Your Majesty, I might get killed if we do this.

307
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,370
To so strictly guard a dead man like that?

308
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,100
Head Eunuch, is that normal to you?

309
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,310
Please hurry up.

310
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,080
Thanks.

311
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,220
<i>His royal body was damaged a lot, Your Majesty.</i>

312
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,390
<i>Especially, his royal face...</i>

313
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,070
<i>It was in horrible shape, which made it unrecognizable.</i>

314
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,960
Eureka!

315
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,440
You bastards! I'm innocent!

316
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,020
The ones with the biggest crimes always raise their voices the loudest.

317
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,720
Your crime is losing dozens of rifles.

318
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,930
A false charge is one thing, but placing such a dishonorable charge against me?

319
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,610
Where in the world is there such an idiotic soldier who loses his rifle?!

320
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:00,770
Here he is! With such an idiotic soldier like you, the armory was robbed of its rifles.

321
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,500
As for Prince Yeongpyeong's charge,

322
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,580
he doesn't even seem curious about it. Don't worry, you won't stay here too long.

323
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,010
What do you mean, I won't stay here too long... An execution?

324
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:26,010
It's all right for me to stay here longer. Sleeping on the floor is natural for me so... Hey!

325
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,600
That's right!

326
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,030
We can solve this issue through conversation, you know?

327
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:50,370
<i>Kim Byeong-in used me as bait to send Cheoljong off into the riot and tried to kill him. </i>

328
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,640
<i>But seeing that imposter's corpse, shows their plan went awry. </i>

329
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,850
<i>That's why they locked up Cheoljong's associates who might help him return...</i>

330
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,620
Ah, because of the sound of your cries, I can't focus.

331
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,680
Come closer to me.

332
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,470
Now, I'm going to share one secret with you two,

333
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,610
so you two must take this secret to your graves.

334
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,140
Yes, I will.

335
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,350
His Majesty the King is...

336
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,800
alive.

337
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,320
Of course, of course.

338
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,570
His Majesty the King will stay alive in your mind forever.

339
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,150
I touched every part of that corpse,

340
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,510
but it wasn't him.

341
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,980
E-Every part...

342
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,860
I'm going to omit any more explanations about it.

343
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,490
But if the king is alive, why isn't His Majesty coming back?

344
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,300
He's either hurt or confined somewhere.

345
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,750
- Court Lady Choi.
- Yes?

346
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,840
Is there a law forbidding an enthronement of a new king as soon as the former king dies?

347
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,850
Yes...

348
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,570
It's called sangwibok. <i>(Meaning "Please come back, Sire").</i>

349
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,290
For five days, we have to wait for the deceased king's soul to come back.

350
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,010
Only after that, can we have a coronation of a new king.

351
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,410
Then including the day of the coronation, it's six days in total.

352
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:41,470
They will probably use all sorts of measures to prevent the king from returning in those six days.

353
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,090
How many court maids and ladies are there in the palace?

354
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,600
For court ladies only, there are about 230;

355
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,400
and including all the lower maids, there are about 600 in total.

356
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,540
So, 600 human CCTVs, eh...

357
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,920
Only one word from each will make 600 ready-made rumors...

358
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,280
- I'll use the Palace Maid Network...
- Pardon?

359
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,350
That should stir up trouble at the coronation.

360
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,680
Are we on the same team? Fighting!

361
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,020
- T-T-Ting!
- Ting!

362
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,740
Ting...

363
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,300
His Majesty the King is alive...

364
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,720
Since there are a lot of difficulties in this country's fate,

365
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,980
the enthroning of a new king cannot be delayed any further.

366
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,520
Therefore, as the new king who will protect the throne,

367
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,320
I'm now announcing the enthronement of Yi Gyeong-won, the 12th generation descendant of Grand Prince Minheung.

368
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,470
Moreover, due to the rebellion of traitors,

369
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,460
the former king has died.

370
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,750
"So there will be no mercy toward the wicked Thieves of Donghak, who took the late king's life.

371
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:52,480
"We hereby declare to execute and annihilate all the Thieves of Donghak, not a single one missing."

372
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,740
So, those Thieves of Donghak finally caused big trouble. What rotten bastards they are!

373
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,210
<i>Cousin!</i>

374
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,440
What's the reason for locking up Prince Yeongpyeong and Officer Hong?

375
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,120
Depending on the owner of the royal throne, the landscape of power changes, too. That's not so new, is it?

376
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,850
Even so, how could you put them in prison as soon as the king passes away when they're innocent?

377
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,300
They are innocent?

378
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,530
Standing on the side of the weak is also a crime.

379
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:36,190
Hyungnim... How far are you planning to go?

380
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,210
I am thinking of growing even bigger.

381
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,430
In order to protect the things I hold dear,

382
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,000
I need much more power.

383
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,930
Now, tone down my lips, too.

384
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,050
Even now you look like a living corpse.

385
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,810
Then, as much as I will look like a dead body, kill the color a lot.

386
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,190
Do you really have to go that far?

387
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:11,090
Now, I'm the only one left among those on the king's side.

388
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:17,760
No matter how things are, they won't be able to lock this pregnant widow down in depression.

389
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,660
How do I look?

390
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,870
- You look like a dead corpse.
- Yeah?

391
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,470
<i>Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager is here.</i>

392
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,710
<i>These two ladies are putting all their souls into this act. </i>

393
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,930
<i>However, the grand prize for Best Acting tonight will go to me.</i>

394
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,790
YOUR... MAJESTY!

395
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:42,860
How could you leave without me?

396
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,170
Then, what about our royal baby!

397
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:52,520
Y-Your Majesty!

398
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,500
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

399
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,950
Your Majesty!

400
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,030
Your Majesty!

401
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,910
Call the royal physician at once! Right now!

402
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,390
Your Majesty!

403
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,250
<i>If I stay here one more second, I don't think I can hold back my mouth from cussing them out! Move! Move!</i>

404
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,130
Your Majesty!

405
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,130
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

406
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,840
Did you send for me, Your Majesty?

407
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,580
I know you must have been shocked by the news.

408
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,960
What on earth happened to His Majesty in the last few days?

409
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,540
How could this happen so suddenly?

410
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,770
The king is...

411
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,840
alive.

412
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,240
I called you to give you this news.

413
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,690
Thank you. I thank you so much.

414
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:28,420
So, this is... just the beginning.

415
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,900
Now after four days, the country will become stable again.

416
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,030
Thanks to the king, we were also able to dispose of the rebels

417
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,490
and the rest of those lowly others have cowered now, too.

418
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:50,000
With this, hasn't the king sacrificed his life and saved the country?

419
00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,500
But before that, I have a small concern...

420
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,590
so I asked to meet with all of you.

421
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,220
The Ansong Kim Clan and Pungan Jo Clan have been on bad terms for a long time.

422
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:15,010
In order to go against the king, who was a dual-threat, we temporarily joined forces.

423
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,000
But now that the king is gone.

424
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,440
I'm afraid we will bite

425
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,290
and compete against each other again in the future.

426
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:27,100
That having been said, before any new missions are carried out,

427
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,600
I have prepared something that will strengthen our ties.

428
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,380
<i>[Jo-jeong-il, Gyeon-hon-ran... (meaning, "As the court is facing a chaos now...")]</i>

429
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,060
"As the court is facing chaos now..."

430
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,560
<i>['Yigwakjisa'...]
<i>(T/N: "Either dethrone the king or place a new king on the throne.")</i></i>

431
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,180
Yigwakjisa?

432
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,490
- That means...
- That you too are planning a rebellion?

433
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,990
It is a word that is in the hearts of everyone here.

434
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,090
The king is already dead,

435
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,400
so what is the use of making this compact without any signatures?

436
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,460
It is in order for us to have collective responsibility.

437
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,470
So that no one clan will have to bear it all.

438
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,350
To make it evident, I'm stating we are in the same boat.

439
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:20,230
So if you all just agree, I guarantee that the two family clans

440
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,580
will live a balanced life together.

441
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:28,760
It means that you will hold our lives on a leash!

442
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,380
We... cannot agree to this!

443
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,040
What do you think you are doing?

444
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,950
You dare to mobilize troops?

445
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,230
You must agree...

446
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,240
in order to leave this room.

447
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,060
<i>[Kim Byeong-in]</i>

448
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,620
- <i>Your Majesty.</i>
- Yes, yes!

449
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,820
Come in!

450
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,670
- Your Majesty.
- Did you find anything?

451
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:42,060
Like Your Majesty said, not only are the gates of the palace closed,

452
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,240
but also the city gates of Hanyang are closed.

453
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,130
As I expected.

454
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,370
What about the movements of the guards?

455
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:53,060
Some guards have been stationed and keep patrolling a particular area.

456
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,630
It's in the vicinity of the Hanjeol Wall.

457
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:59,760
<i> I found you, Cheoljong! I'm coming.</i>

458
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,900
I'm sleepy.

459
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,140
You two may leave.

460
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,060
Oh, so sleepy.

461
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,970
- Sleepy...
- Have a restful night, Your Majesty.

462
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,220
Please have good dreams, Your Majesty.

463
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,370
- You two also have a good night.
- Yes.

464
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,550
Be healthy.

465
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,890
Yes?

466
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:37,340
One's health is something you cannot let your guard down on.

467
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,130
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

468
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,390
<i>[CJ]</i>

469
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,990
The queen?

470
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,760
She fainted in the mourning hall due to shock, but recovered quickly—

471
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,790
Fainting?

472
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,350
<i>Where are you going?</i>

473
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,370
Don't tell me it is what I am thinking.

474
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,560
Eventually, it has come to this?

475
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,870
- Let me be.
- I cannot.

476
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,270
If you leave the palace, you will be in danger.

477
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,230
You think I don't know that?

478
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,660
I know everything, that you used me as bait to corner the king in the deadly spot

479
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,210
and that you used your own sword on the king.

480
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,620
I know everything.

481
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,970
As long as Your Majesty can be safe,

482
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,220
it is fine if you dislike me.

483
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,320
So resent me all you like.

484
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,560
And give up, as well.

485
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,360
In any case, the king is dead.

486
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,830
No... He's not dead.

487
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:21,980
You know it too, that the king wouldn't die so easily.

488
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,100
Isn't that why you closed the gates of the palace and rushed the coronation?

489
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,470
Your Majesty... please.

490
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,360
You must throw away the king in order to survive.

491
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,660
You asked why it had to be the king, didn't you?

492
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,200
I'll answer you right now.

493
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,670
If someone had to be a king,

494
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,380
then I think this king is best suited for the throne.

495
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,140
Out of all the kings I've seen, he's the most kingly.

496
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,830
So, don't get in the way of me placing my precious vote for the king.

497
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,010
If you continue blocking me,

498
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,060
I will have no choice.

499
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:08,790
So-yong, how could you aim an arrow at me? Knowing how I feel.

500
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,990
If you so desperately liked her,

501
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,910
then at the very least shouldn't you have noticed

502
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,600
the changes in Kim So-yong?

503
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,670
Look at me. See if I'm the same woman that you've always looked at for a long time.

504
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,740
Completely different on the inside, but you didn't even realize it.

505
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,750
The thing you liked, was merely the shell.

506
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,640
So-yong.

507
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,460
The real Kim So-yong you liked is gone.

508
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,390
What exactly does that mean?

509
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,870
If this was the real Kim So-yong, then she wouldn't have been able to shoot an arrow at you.

510
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,180
Because she still liked you as a brother in the very least.

511
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,370
But I'm different.

512
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,930
I can shoot you as much as I want.

513
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,670
I warned you!

514
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,430
I didn't know it would really hit you.

515
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,360
What are you two doing here?

516
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,410
You were acting so obvious, so I thought you wanted us to follow you.

517
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,810
In my case, I came here to save myself.

518
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,920
If I can't see Your Majesty, I feel like dying of anxiety.

519
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,710
Forget it. Go back to the palace.

520
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:11,560
No, you can't, Your Majesty! If you really have to go by yourself, please step on me.

521
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,580
Now there are only four days left.

522
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,980
In four days, the coronation will be held, so are you saying you will search such a big mountain by yourself

523
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,960
to find His Majesty?

524
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,200
- Did you just laugh at me?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

525
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,860
There are so many wild animals on the mountain, so you wouldn't be able to endure it by yourself, not even for a day.

526
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,270
Whether you become the prey of wild dogs

527
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,740
or you might be frozen dead to be found by the guards later.

528
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,420
Oh my god, I'm so scared!

529
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,180
Whatever you say, it doesn't scare me.

530
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,420
Let's go back!

531
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,820
Since Her Majesty doesn't want our company, for the crime of not stopping the queen from running away,

532
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,270
let's drink a bowl of refreshing poison

533
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:05,800
and fall into a long sleep!

534
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,510
All right, all right. You can come with me.

535
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,900
It's not for a nice occasion, so why are you following me?

536
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,170
By the way, how will you pass the gate of Hanyang City?

537
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,320
My original plan was to climb over the city wall with my outstanding skill.

538
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,120
But now, with the tails of you two, no way.

539
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,080
I don't get how you will climb over the city wall when the wall is so high.

540
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,370
Why do you keep laughing at me?

541
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,570
We've prepared everything, so please don't worry, Your Majesty.

542
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,690
- Your Majesty the Queen!
- Your Majesty the Queen!

543
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,520
I thought this drink was for celebration, but looking at your face, this seems like a drink for a loser.

544
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,970
At this rate, your wound won't get healed properly.

545
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,410
Where on earth did you get hurt—

546
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,800
If you ever take my drink away from me again,

547
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,050
I'll cut your wrist.

548
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,700
<i>If you so desperately liked her, at the very least shouldn't you have noticed </i>

549
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,210
<i>the changes in Kim So-yong?</i>

550
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:44,110
<i>In last night's dream, he looked exactly like you. </i>

551
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,000
<i>What? M-My love for him?</i>

552
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,890
<i>Why would you say something so disgusting?</i>

553
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,920
<i>I'm already having an identity crisis, so how can you say something like "my love for him"?</i>

554
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,770
You're late.

555
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:24,320
Go to your room and take a rest. The room has been heated, so it must still be warm.

556
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,850
Why aren't you asking me anything?

557
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,480
A father is like that.

558
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,650
What did you say he made?

559
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:45,000
He said he made a signed list of those plotting to commit treason.

560
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,860
Without saying a word to me, how could he make such a dangerous thing?

561
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,540
If that list is in our hands, it can be our weapon, so please do not worry.

562
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,690
I'll bring it to you, Your Royal Highness.

563
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:58,870
As soon as the king disappears, you coming back after the treason controversy...

564
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,650
won't look good.

565
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,120
I don't need any official position.

566
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:10,360
I'm satisfied with supporting Your Royal Highness quietly in the background.

567
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,890
By the way, I've heard that the queen left the palace last night.

568
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:20,570
As the Mother of the Nation, how could she run away into the night?

569
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:24,390
Since it's the shame of our family, I've kept it secret but you know it already.

570
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,700
Thinking of the queen's personality,

571
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,620
this isn't just a simple escape.

572
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,850
If so?

573
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:37,290
She must be trying to bring the king back to the palace and bring everything back to its previous status.

574
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:42,660
The queen must be sure that the king is alive.

575
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,220
Then, there must be something to assure her of that. Right?

576
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:54,190
Since she left the position of the queen by herself, now the queen is just one of many ordinary women.

577
00:53:54,190 --> 00:54:00,430
Although I knew it was a lie, since Byeong-in was trying so hard, I thought to accept her again.

578
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:03,810
Since the king and queen are so ardently in love,

579
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:08,390
we should bury them namelessly, side by side, in a secluded place.

580
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,490
Will you do it yourself, Brother?

581
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,830
My Lord.

582
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:29,290
I've come back to this office to help Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

583
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,780
Are these men the ones

584
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,640
who took the former king's life?

585
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,750
Yes, My Lord.

586
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,740
We're just mere herb pickers.

587
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,090
I've never even seen the face of the king.

588
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:43,650
If that's so, your lot, who are less than bugs,

589
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:47,100
caught the Dragon of the Sky without realizing it.

590
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:17,030
Looking at your spirit to get up so quickly, you're perfectly fine. I was worried I'd have to get rid of a corpse.

591
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,870
Who are you?

592
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,720
Who am I? I am a guy who travels around picking herbs.

593
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,600
If not, why would I be so deep in this mountain?

594
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,840
Did you save me?

595
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,470
Rather than saving you, I picked you up.

596
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:32,220
Your outfit was expensive,

597
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,930
so if I saved you. I thought you might give me something to pay me back.

598
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,660
Nothing is free in this world, is it?

599
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,660
But you didn't have anything worth any money on you.

600
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:47,070
Your outfit looked expensive, but with all of it ripped and torn, I can't even sell it.

601
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:49,700
So I burned them all.

602
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,590
You burned them?

603
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:55,520
Recently, guards have been searching around the mountain.

604
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:00,380
Did I pick up something that's going to be trouble?

605
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,150
<i>Anyone there?</i>

606
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:08,690
If you run without paying, with this cutter your wrist will...

607
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,720
You know now, right?

608
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,520
<i>[Pharmacy]</i>

609
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,510
I only put quality goods in it.

610
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,560
So, so, so what will happen, Your Majesty?

611
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,420
So, in a hurry, they hold the funeral with the fake corpse,

612
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,400
they endure for six days, and then place a new king on the throne; it's over.

613
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,160
But how did you know that?

614
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,230
The things bad guys do are obvious.

615
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:58,890
Those darn evil bastards. Hope they get Heaven's punishment!

616
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:10,750
<i>[A Letter of Confession]</i>

617
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,110
It's the confession of the rebels.

618
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:16,080
Since we've made out who will be the culprit,

619
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,990
as soon as the coronation is over, find an appropriate time and announce it.

620
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,130
Father.

621
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:28,540
May I request that you keep the palace in check for a moment?

622
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,020
What is wrong?

623
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,290
I must personally...

624
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:37,900
bring the necks of the king and queen.

625
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:49,210
<i>[3 Days before Coronation]</i>

626
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,800
Hyungnim!

627
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:56,020
You're going to find the queen, right?

628
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,860
Why did the queen escape? You must know why

629
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,850
since you two were so close.

630
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:06,460
The queen is no longer the cousin that I once knew.

631
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,320
What?

632
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,570
We should be hurrying to find the king.

633
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:33,050
This poorly made lock, I should just be able to break it with my bare hands.

634
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,410
Oh... what?

635
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,800
It must be locked more firmly than that. What are the odds you actually did it?

636
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,850
<i>Sir.</i>

637
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,280
Are you all right, Prince Yeongpyeong?

638
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:58,260
- What are you doing here?
- I am friends with everyone in the palace.

639
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,590
How could it be a crime that you are the king's best friend and that he is the king's brother?

640
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:06,870
Do not worry. I will start a protest movement and get you out.

641
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:09,150
Kim Hwan, you fella...

642
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:13,520
Even though situations have changed this much, how could you stay the same?

643
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,140
Of course.

644
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,450
Just like you didn't keep me close because I was a member of the Ansong Family clan,

645
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:23,130
I as well did not keep you close because you were the king's best friend.

646
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,800
However, the inside of the palace has been completely flipped upside down.

647
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,590
It is said that they are going to kill all of the rebels that hurt the king,

648
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:34,390
but I'm afraid that innocent people might also get hurt.

649
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:40,310
Also, the queen also disappeared last night.

650
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,690
What did you say? The queen disappeared?

651
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,200
She even took her Court Lady and Court Maid along,

652
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,890
then she disappeared without anyone seeing.

653
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:56,790
Just now, Hyungnim Byeong-in left to find the Queen,

654
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,930
but the atmosphere seemed unusual.

655
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,200
How was the atmosphere?

656
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,220
I might be overthinking, but

657
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:08,320
it seemed as if he was going out to hurt the queen.

658
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,530
Why? Why?

659
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,050
Why?

660
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,910
It's all right now.

661
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:31,820
Let us go.

662
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:35,280
What was that, Court Lady Choi? You surprised me.

663
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:39,870
You must be cautious regarding everything.

664
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,570
You're right.

665
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:46,110
Anyway, our Court Lady Choi is the best at being cautious.

666
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,420
You, go.

667
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,650
Come here.

668
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,790
Be careful.

669
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:56,850
You brought all of these?

670
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,450
What is this?

671
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,290
It's braised balloon flower roots.

672
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,480
Braised balloon flower roots?

673
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:05,530
A precious person gave it to me, so I was reserving it.

674
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,350
Your Majesty, please eat it.

675
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,830
- I'll try one.
- Yes.

676
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,850
Mm, delicious! Hong Yeon, try one.

677
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,280
Hong Yeon as well... Oh, all right.

678
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,380
Court Lady Choi, you too.

679
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,120
Yes.

680
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,100
It's so good!

681
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:27,040
Court Lady Choi!

682
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,500
- I am fine.
- Stand up, stand up.

683
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,140
I am fine.

684
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,390
I have no problems, Your Majesty!

685
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:39,060
- Heave-ho!
- Careful.

686
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:44,620
Where in the world is His Majesty the King?

687
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:50,200
How will Your Majesty, who has lived a luxurious life, sleep in such a place as this?

688
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,100
It's okay. I've done it a lot.

689
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,000
Your Majesty has?

690
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,840
I, myself, have not even done this.

691
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:01,800
Hey, this is nothing. Have you carried 50 kilograms of military armor and walked 1,000 Li? <i>(1,000 Li = about 400 km)</i>

692
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,820
1,000 Li?

693
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:10,310
Your lie has gone too far, 1,000 Li?

694
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,270
Okay, you're right, 1,000 is a lie...

695
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,700
but for sure it was 500 Li.

696
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,480
- For cold-weather training, we melt ice to get water—
- Wow.

697
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:22,350
Yes, yes. Of course, you melted it.

698
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,870
It's for real.

699
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:29,720
All right, Your Majesty. You'll catch a cold.

700
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,640
We can't even make a fire since we'll get caught.

701
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,760
I'm worried as to how we'll get through this cold night.

702
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,530
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

703
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:43,470
Ah, who's cold with this? Compared to cold-weather training, this is a piece of cake.

704
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,890
Your Majesty...

705
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,230
Ah...

706
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:16,130
Turn off the air conditioning...

707
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:19,390
We'll get sick...

708
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,470
<i>[A coded note]</i>

709
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:19,300
We haven't found him yet.

710
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,780
Split up and search thoroughly again.

711
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,510
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

712
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,660
I have a good feeling today.

713
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:53,530
It is such weather that makes us feel like we will meet His Majesty the King today.

714
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,130
Oh, this isn't the time for this. Let's hurry and go.

715
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:06,860
Yes.

716
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,240
We need to hurry.

717
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,030
- That way?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

718
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,200
We're nearly there.

719
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,050
If we go a little bit more, it will be that cliff.

720
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:23,290
As expected, kids that have just entered their 20s are different.

721
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:26,040
Their endurance is the best.

722
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,470
- Let's rest a bit.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

723
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:41,600
But since we have left the palace,

724
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,490
everything looks better, Your Majesty.

725
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:50,070
You hated going outside of the palace before.

726
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,790
Hong Yeon, what about you? Do you like being inside the palace or outside?

727
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,080
I like the place where Your Majesty is.

728
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,000
- Look at you.
- What was that?

729
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:08,460
Your Majesty! T-They are here!

730
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,840
Over there, catch them!

731
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,410
You must hurry and escape!

732
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,490
Your Majesty!

733
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,980
Hurry and escort Her Majesty! Hurry and go!

734
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,460
What are you doing, Court Lady Choi?

735
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:20,920
Court Lady Choi!

736
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,540
You can't, you bastards!

737
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:23,810
You can't!

738
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,430
You must hurry and leave, Your Majesty!

739
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,990
- Court Lady Choi!
- You can't!

740
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:29,330
Let me go!

741
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:32,440
Your Majesty...

742
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,650
You can't!

743
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:39,130
Get back!

744
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,900
Court Lady Choi!

745
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,610
You can't, Your Majesty!

746
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,100
Chase them!

747
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,320
Please, stop.

748
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,690
You must not, Your Majesty!

749
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:06,520
- Court Lady Choi!
- Your Majesty!

750
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,930
Please!

751
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,380
Court Lady Choi!

752
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,910
Stop...

753
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,700
Court Lady Choi!

754
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,540
Let me go! No, why are you like this?

755
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,890
Court Lady Choi!

756
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,030
Your Majesty, please run away!

757
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,350
Your Majesty!

758
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,700
Your Majesty, you must find His Majesty!

759
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,190
Hong Yeon!

760
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:48,050
Over there!

761
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:12,080
Who are you?

762
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,960
Just what did you do to So-yong?
