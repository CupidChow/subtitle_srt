00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,770
Come to think of it, when I came here you were the first person I saw.

Oh, has our Hong Yeon been working out lately? All bulked up...

It must be a dream. Even last time, Hong Yeon's face changed.

49

- Why did the face sparkle and then change into you?
- Pardon me?

50
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,810
Tell me properly. What happened between us last night?

51
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,690
How much of properly do you want me to say?

52
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,050
Tell me without leaving out a single detail.

53

Since what happened to that fortune teller, I haven't been able to get my fortune read properly.

Why didn't I think of the possibility that she wouldn't like me?

109
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,970
For what reason was I choosing between my lineage and love?

Why did I contemplate that for so many days?

111
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,720
Usually, the most difficult thing about love is

112
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,930
not the other obstacles, but

113
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,360
the process of gaining another's heart.

114
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,510
And what was her reason?

115
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,600
She said...

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,850
<i> I do not like you.</i>

126
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,370

There's also good news, right? The king has gotten well so soon.

130
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,430
My prayers must have worked.

131
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,990
You should've heard some other news as well.

132
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,390
I heard that Elder Kim Jwa-geun will be removed from his office due to this.

133
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,250
I like the king and respect Elder Kim Jwa-geun, too.

134
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,690
My heart is split into two.

135
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,440
You haven't even personally met the king, what do you like about him?

136
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,710
That is because he is your best friend.

137
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,670
You are such a good person,

138
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,590
that it is only right, your friend is also a good person.

139
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,580
Oh, you!

140
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,970
Oh!

141
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,830
You were drawing an octopus?

142
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,400
An octopus? This is a person.

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,660
This is?

144
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,820
If you look at it one by one, I drew it quite well.

145
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,240
These are the eyes.

146
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,510
That is the mouth.

147
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,600
That is the mouth, right?

148
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,030
There are even lips.

149
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,050
As fortunes go, the morning fortunes are the best.

150
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,920
Your Highness, it is Lady Eui Bin.

151
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,860
Oh, my...

152
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,800
Ah, your face has gotten so haggard overnight.

153
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,390
If someone sees, they might think the king hasn't been able to wake up.

154
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,160
The issue regarding the queen, how did it go?

155
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,570
We gave up on the big picture and did what you wanted.

156
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,210
They probably went to the queen's quarters

157
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,680
and found that item by now.

158
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,870
Last night... the king stayed in the queen's quarters.

159
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,110
As soon as he recovered?

160
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,430
I have realized once more due to this incident...

161
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,280
If I lose the king, I will die.

162
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,250
<i> The woman who is to die today... Can it be her?</i>

163
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,600
I want to die. Should I just die?

164
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,490
If I die, I might feel better.

165
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,140
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I'm sorry!

166
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:29,290
I clearly denied it, but the king was too certain.

167
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,460
Huh, what are you talking about?

168
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,460
What?

169
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,110
Where is this burning smell coming from? Who did this?

170
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,560
What kind of man did this?

171
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,600
Where are you going?

172
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,020
Geez, please!

173
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,100
Court Lady Choi—

174
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,420
I happened to reveal everything.

175
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,780
You did? So you're saying,

176
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,270
last night the king came to find me after hearing your words and that's why this whole mess happened?

177
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,530
I did not say it like that.

178
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,920
Ultimately, all of this confusion I am feeling right now is all

179
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,810
because of you.

180
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,430
W-What sort of confusion are you feeling?

181
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,280
It was good for sure. Better than before.

182
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,220
That is why I am going crazy! Why did I like it?

183
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,320
I shouldn't be like this.

184
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,180
Isn't the soul the owner of the body?

185
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,390
Or is both the soul and body not the owner? Are humans just slaves to hormones?

186
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,740
Your Majesty!

187
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,760
Why is she like this?

188
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,400
What are you talking about?

189
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,060
Her Majesty the Queen is acting just like herself.

190
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,870
Why doesn't it make me feel dirty? Why!

191
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,180
Feel dirty! Dirty! Feel dirty!

192
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,470
<i>His Majesty the King is here!</i>

193
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,540
Where is the queen?

194
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,270
Yes, she—

195
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,690
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. She was here just a moment ago.

196
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,980
Why in the world is she avoiding me like this!

197
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,730
Last night, she was like a tiger... Grr!

198
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,690
Will you help me with finding the queen?

199
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

200
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,030
As you can see, I have a lot of things to say to her.

201
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,970
Yes.

202
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,220
What sort of words?

203
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,240
No, if I meet Cheoljong right now, it will be really dangerous.

204
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,430
What if my body betrays me again?

205
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,400
That's right. Last night, this woman's soul controlled me for sure.

206
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,220
The thing I liked? Only because I thought it was Hong Yeon.

207
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,850
If I knew that was Cheoljong...

208
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,000
I'd still like it? Am I really crazy?

209
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,030
So, will Jang Bong-hwan disappear forever like this?

210
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,250
Is that what happened?
<i>[I came for no reason...] </i>

211
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,570
<i>- Queen!
- Your Majesty!</i>

00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,070
My Queen! My Queen!

217
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,940
Your Majesty, My Queen!

218
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,770
Your Majesty!

- Your Majesty, My Queen!
- Your Majesty!

222
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,000
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

223
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,660
<i>For trying to openly assassinate the king,</i>

224
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,400
it seems Lord Kim Jwa-geun is going to be impeached.

225
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,030
This I say...

226
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,130
No matter how much I think about it, this does not seem like a method Lord Kim Jwa-geun would use.

227
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,210
Perhaps he was put on the defensive.

228
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,740
With this explosion accident, Lord Kim Jwa-geun has lost everything

229
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,130
and the king has gained too much.

230
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,870
Even so, you don't think the king risked his own life and planned the explosion?

231
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,030
You're right...

232
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,690
- Y-Your Majesty!
- Are you on your way to the council meeting?

233
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:54,560
Yes. What is Your Majesty doing here alone?

234
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,880
The queen is...

235
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,930
Your Majesty, are you playing hide and seek?

236
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,230
I am so freaking good at it, Your Majesty!

237
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,400
- Finally!
- Damn it!

238
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,200
Stop following me! Are you a CCTV camera or some "sasaeng" fan? <i>(T/N: An obsessive idol fan, like a stalker)</i>

239
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,310
- What...
- Your Majesty!

240
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,500
- I will see you at the council meeting.
- Y-Yes.

241
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,770
Let's talk about what's right and wrong, My Queen!
<i>(T/N: Right and wrong - sounds like CCTV in Korean.)</i>

242
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,560
- They seem to have a good relationship.
<i>- Queen!</i>

243
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,130
Hide and seek, really? They're acting like children.

244
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,090
What in the...

245
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,080
Playing hide and seek as soon as he recovered from an almost fatal accident?

246
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,580
That's right, I have my Suk-uis.

247
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,930
The guardian of my (sexual) identity, the one I expressed my love to via Kakao Chat all night long!
<i> (Kakao - A message chat forum)</i>

248
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,290
- Your Majesty, hello.
- Your Majesty, hello.

249
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,640
Hello to all of you.

250
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,660
Now, goodbye.

251
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,870
Queen! Is there a running competition in the palace?

252
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,830
There's no gap between those two for us.

253
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,860
Sure seems like it.

254
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,300
But they look so good together!

255
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,310
<i> Okay, I will recover my identity with Kakao texts.</i>

256
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,980
<i>- Queen!
- Your Majesty!</i>

257
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,760
Queen?

258
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,520
She is not here as well.

259
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,930
I had something I really wanted to ask the queen, which is why I keep chasing after her.

260
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,200
<i> Something he wanted to ask?</i>

261
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,030
It seems the queen feels uncomfortable seeing me,

262
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,950
so I should stop.

263
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,540
When she feels like facing me,

264
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,420
then I guess the queen will let me know.

265
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,920
Let us go to the council meeting.

266
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,470
Yes.

267
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,990
You were here.

268
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,840
You were spinning all around the palace. I had a hard time finding you.

269
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,120
What is the matter?

270
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,730
You were here. Last night...

271
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,870
We will tell you on the way.

272
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,560
Let's go.

273
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,590
Where to, again? Again, where to?

274
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,690
How wide the palace is...

275
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,200
Did he leave?

276
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,470
What does he want to ask so badly that he's like this?

277
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,760
Usually, in situations like this, a man typically asks..."Was it good?"

278
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,800
To the usual place.

279
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,210
Something's missing.

281
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,510
Court Lady Choi!

282
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,900
Yes, Your Majesty?

283
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,230
Why haven't you been nagging me, lately?

284
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,130
"You shouldn't be going around like that, Your Majesty." You should be nagging me like that.

285
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,620
I have quit nagging, Your Majesty.

286
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,500
What a surprise.

287
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,800
- Okay, hurry and go.
- Yes.

288
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,670
What a surprise...

289
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,870
From today on,

290
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,510
I will withdraw my regency.

291
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,330
With this, I declare that I will rule for myself going forward.

292
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,570
<i>- Long Live The King, Your Majesty!
- Long Live The King, Your Majesty!</i>

293
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,880
I will die if I live like this.

294
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,930
I am so angry I cannot live this life span given to me.

295
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,740
Should I tell them you will not be eating?

296
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,330
You are actually wishing me to die and planning my funeral, aren't you?

297
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,520
I'm sorry.

298
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,700
But, does this mean you want me to bring in food or not?

299
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,640
If I do, you will definitely say it is food for your funeral.

300
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,860
Do I... have to tell you... every little thing one by one?

301
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,820
Your Highness!

302
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,660
Please calm down.

303
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,010
Do I look like I can calm down?

304
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,420
With this, my life in politics is as good as over!

305
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,490
I will find it for you once more.

306
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,920
You will definitely be able to regain your regency again.

307
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,380
You're so confident.

308
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,820
Your father was like that when he was young.

309
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,060
I gave a final chance to my brother.

310
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,270
What chance did you give him?

311
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,280
He said it's the way to break the king's heart.

312
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,880
If my brother succeeds, you should keep your position for now.

313
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,800
Yes. However, you will find out that an old tool has its limit.

314
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,240
The king is not as easy an opponent as you think.

315
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,050
Do you really think the explosion was the king's own plan?

316
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,760
The person who gained the most is the culprit.

317
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,600
To have such a tiger cub on that seat.

318
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,550
Your Majesty, congratulations on your sole rule.

319
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,650
Thank you.

320
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,910
While you were away, there was a letter from Daejojeon.

321
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,580
- From the Queen?
- Yes.

322
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:09,160
<i> Should I say, I miss you? So, I miss you.</i>

323
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,800
This will not do.

324
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,570
As expected my last resort. How hot it is!

325
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,720
<i> Let us meet.</i>

326
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:35,020
You came... to save me from this confus—

327
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,080
Cheoljong? How did you know I was here?

328
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,100
I told you to meet here, so, of course, I know.

329
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,850
- The person who called me here was Suk-ui!
- Which Suk-ui?

330
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,680
I like the thrill their anonymity gives me,

331
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,600
so I purposely didn't find out who she was among the three.

332
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,530
Anyway, it's not you!

333
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,360
"I sometimes think about something else."

334
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,490
"It doesn't matter even if I'm drowning in your thoughts to death,

335
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,480
so please row and come to me."

336
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,510
"Ah! I didn't let you go, my love."

337
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,960
- Stop.
- Do you know now?

338
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,150
No, I do not know that corny poem.

339
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,450
"I will die calling out your name."

340
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,810
"I cannot forg—"

341
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,730
Stop it! People are listening.

342
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,350
It's not like you wrote them, so what is the matter?

343
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,670
We have things to talk about privately, so all of you stay far away. Got it?

344
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,590
Yes, Your Majesty, Our Queen.

345
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,520
Are you surveilling me? Did you inspect my Kakao texts?

346
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,210
What are you talking about?

347
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,310
Through letters, you always express such enthusiastic affection, but when we actually meet, you completely ignore me.

348
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,510
How cruel!

349
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,590
- Accidental delivery?
- Accidental delivery?

350
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,400
D-Did you think I was someone else?

351
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,290
My new source of hormones is you?

352
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,910
How can my last line of defense for my identity be you?

353
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,830
The person my heart fluttered and pounded for every night...

354
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,800
was you.

355
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,480
That is why you had two faces.

356
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,980
Why did you come out? Why always?

357
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,860
Every time I opened my eyes it was you. Even in my dream—

358
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,870
Did you dream of me?

359
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,670
<i> Don't get awkward! If you do, it's over.</i>

360
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:32,660
There are many kinds of dreams. There are also spine-chilling nightmares.

361
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,310
Why did you help out with the banquet?

362
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,290
Did you chase me around to ask about that?

363
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,820
I thought you would thank me. I helped for nothing.

364
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,750
You told me that if I'm glad to see someone, I should curse at them;

365
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,950
and if I feel thankful, I should pick a fight with them for no reason.

366
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,430
Since when have you listened to my words so well?

367
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,770
You make a fuss even if I listen to you.

368
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,280
Which side am I supposed to adhere to?

369
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,600
You said you would do "no touch" toward me and then you help me.

370
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
And then you declare you are going to betray me.

371
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,930
For that, I...

372
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,820
Wait a minute.

373
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,860
You heard my words saying I would betray you?

374
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,510
- Oh...
- They said you lost your hearing, but was that a lie?

375
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,380
Don't tell me... Was the accident with the explosion perhaps your own scheme?

376
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,990
It is true that I lost my hearing.

377
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,670
When you were talking to me, it just happened to be the moment that the ringing in my ears disappeared.

378
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,540
Are you crazy? You almost died!

379
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,510
- Queen.
- Did you have to use such a dangerous method?

380
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,700
Y-You... I said this was forbidden.

381
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,310
Hugging like this, laughing, laying next to me.

382
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,260
All of this is forbidden!

383
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,420
I forbid you to forbid me.

384
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,530
I like you, Queen.

385
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,950
Are you someone who falls in love easily? How tacky to confess right after we slept together just once!

386
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,410
It is not like that.

387
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,940
Then, why do you like me?

388
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,520
You are arrogant and your actions are rough,

389
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,440
you only know about yourself and are inconsistent

390
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,470
and have many flaws.

391
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,400
That's right. So you shouldn't like me.

392
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,390
Still, I like you.

393
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,270
Even if you are the person with the most flaws in the world,

394
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,600
I still like you.

395
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
That night...

396
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,880
The day I ran into the lake,

397
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,090
do you remember the words I said to you?

398
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,980
<i> You must love me.</i>

399
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,250
I believed I was the only one who could protect you.

400
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,730
That's why I said that.

401
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,020
You needed to love me so I could support you.

402
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,680
That way you and I could both survive.

403
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,220
Is that what that meant?

404
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:30,750
But... that Kim So-yong does not exist in this world anymore.

405
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,910
The Kim So-yong from that night is dead.

406
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,810
I will no longer hurt you, Queen.

407
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,050
There is nothing more for us,

408
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,340
because I cannot forgive you.

409
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,050
<i> I'm not the real Kim So-Yong.</i>

410
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,510
<i> So... it can't be.</i>

411
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,190
Why? Does Her Majesty the Queen want anything from me?

412
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,270
I gave you trouble last time.

413
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,830
- Last time?
- At the pharmacy...

414
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:29,280
Oh, th-that was my fault for giving you poisoned water.

415
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,950
Well, even if you gave me the illness and then the medicine,

416
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,110
it still is not right to just pretend it didn't happen.

417
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,560
I picked this up on the way.

418
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,950
Where did she go to have picked up such a precious thing?

419
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,730
An assassination of the king... Why did he proceed with such a big event by himself that only led to his demise?

420
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,310
Lord Kim Jwa-geun lost his touch, I guess.

421
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,050
<i>Even if you are crazy about money, how dare you siphon off weapons!</i>

422
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,890
<i>Do you want to ruin this country? You clearly said there was no problem!</i>

423
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,920
<i>Moving people around as you want, My Lord,</i>

424
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,120
<i>can not be done by your power only.</i>

425
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,610
<i>Are you saying you did this for me?</i>

426
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:39,530
<i>I only did my best for you to see the outcome, but not to know the process behind it.</i>

427
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:45,670
<i>For you, My Lord, and for our clan, I did this.</i>

428
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,800
<i>In the worst possible scenario, you must be prepared to face the consequences.</i>

429
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,780
<i>I will give you a chance to redeem yourself.</i>

430
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,210
- Are you all here?
- My Lord!

431
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,390
The queen's father is not here yet.

432
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:22,200
I did not call him. We are here because of the mistakes he made.

433
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,450
The queen's father has

434
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,060
secretly kept a record of our clan's wealth and possessions.

435
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,460
Thankfully, that ledger is in my hands.

436
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:43,490
As long as I have power, this item has no use, so do not worry.

437
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:49,940
However, if I am impeached and lose my power,

438
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,040
I will not be able to protect this.

439
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,120
If you all protect me,

440
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,790
I will also protect you all.

441
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,480
If we protect you,

442
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,920
then what will you do with the king?

443
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,930
If we do not proceed with the impeachment,

444
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,740
then the king will get rid of us all.

445
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,390
There was something made for a country in crisis.

446
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,010
Border Defense Council?

447
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:29,340
If not for when an incompetent king assumes the royal authority, is there any other crisis?

448
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,850
From now on, everything related to politics

449
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:36,230
will be through the Border Defense Council.

450
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,540
The item is ready.

451
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,710
Like you said, we put arsenic in the center and froze it.

452
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,160
Once that ice melts, the arsenic will be released.

453
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,180
How long does it take before the arsenic is released?

454
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,180
It will differ depending on the weather,

455
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,630
but it will probably take a short time to finish one cup of tea.

456
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,330
All right.

457
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:59,820
But... who are you planning to use this on?

458
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,790
If just one woman disappears from the palace,

459
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,700
two men that threaten my position will be broken.

460
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,390
Thank you for not giving up.

461
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:30,670
I will not forget what kind of mindset you had in order to endure such torture.

462
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,690
Since all of your identities were revealed, it is dangerous to stay in the palace.

463
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,480
Now you must leave the palace

464
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,430
and all of you will each become a seed.

465
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,290
What all of you want...

466
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,520
I will be sure to make it happen.

467
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,890
It feels a bit lonely.

468
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,350
Which foolish man couldn't throw away his regret—

469
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,380
You came.

470
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,560
Put honeycomb-shaped ice blocks into the queen's beverage?

471
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,180
That's right.

472
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,980
All you have to do is put in the ice.

473
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,920
Your Highness the Queen Dowager, I have some important information.

474
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,180
So please, save me.

475
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,670
What is this information?

476
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:18,080
If you promise to save me first.

477
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,980
- What do you think you are doing?
- Court Lady Han.

478
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:29,540
For such a bold girl like you to be so scared,

479
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,160
I do not know what exactly it is

480
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,430
but I will do whatever I can as much as my power allows.

481
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,480
T-To me, Lord Kim Jwa-geun said...

482
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,270
If you were going to like me, you should've liked me sooner.

483
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:50,500
Then Kim So-yong wouldn't have tried to kill herself and I wouldn't be in this situation either.

484
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,090
But the most important part...

485
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,780
I was confident that I had undergone everything the world had to offer.

486
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,320
But there's more to life than I thought I knew.

487
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,360
Last night's feeling was how should I say...

488
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,980
If the life I knew was a fluffy piece of bread, this is...

489
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,290
It's new. I'm only tempted because it's different!

490
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:29,170
Come to your senses, Jang So-yong! Geez, now I'm even getting my name confused! Dammit!

491
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,410
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

492
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,980
Yes, come in.

493
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,190
Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager has asked to do brunch.

494
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,330
Brunch at this time?

495
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:52,040
I'm not in the right mindset to cook.

496
00:43:54,330 --> 00:44:00,240
The Grand Royal Dowager has already prepared everything.

497
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,840
Do I just have to go to Tongmyeongjeon after running around all day, I'm hungry? <i>(Grand Queen Dowager's quarters)</i>?

498
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,570
They are trying to get rid of the queen.

499
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,320
Ultimately, the ledger has come into Lord Kim Jwa-geun's hands.

500
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:15,470
Who knew that it would come out of the queen's quarters? How come...

501
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,980
I must return to the palace at once.

502
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,990
- What are you doing? Hurry!
- Yes!

503
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,230
You're running off by yourself again!

504
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:02,100
I am very pissed off because of you, Sir Daeng-daeng!

505
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:21,880
I am so grateful, Your Royal Highness. How great, a brunch with this wonderful view.

506
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,370
With no more duties, I have a lot of time now.

507
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:28,220
Let's spend more time like this in the future.

508
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,570
Yes, Your Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

509
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,380
It wouldn't be brunch without drinks.

510
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,960
The woman who is going to die in the palace is the queen!

511
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:58,760
Your mother is finally getting revenge!

512
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:26,930
<i> Translation and Timing Carefully Crafted

513
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:09,430
Today, I specially prepared ice that is more precious than gold.

514
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,390
<i> It's my first time seeing ice here.</i>

515
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:22,210
As the sun is beaming down, it is the perfect weather to drink something cool.

516
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,670
Queen... please! Please, Queen.

517
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,260
How dare you!

518
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:04,240
For Her Majesty the Queen! I have something to tell the queen!

519
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,490
- This is not a place for you. Go away.
- It is important!

520
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,450
Dam-hyang?

521
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,770
Why are you being like this? My neck might also be taken off.

522
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,970
What exactly is this important information?

523
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,360
Do you know that child?

524
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:31,010
Yes, I see her often in the royal kitchen.

525
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:34,410
Dam-hyang, what is it?

526
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,820
That is...

527
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,840
That is...

528
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,480
I'm sorry.

529
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,490
I came to help serve Grand Queen Dowager.

530
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,240
I told you this was a place for women.

531
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,620
This is the first time I've met you in this setting, please forgive me.

532
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,140
It is my honor.

533
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,240
Like I told you, how is the monitoring of your husband going?

534
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,320
Ah...

535
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,490
It hasn't been long since the king woke up, so I will now do my best from now on.

536
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:43,640
Let us hurry and drink before the ice melts.

537
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,120
How is the taste?

538
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,700
How refreshing!

539
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,290
It was so refreshing that I couldn't help myself.

540
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,850
Queen!

541
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:59,300
Your Majesty!

542
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:08,240
How dare you! What do you think you're doing!

543
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,920
- Are you all right?
- Huh? Yes.

544
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,550
You dared to throw a rock at the queen?

545
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,870
I am all right, Your Highness.

546
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:30,670
Throw that child in prison right now. She will be punished for showing such disrespect.

547
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,910
Your Highness!

548
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,600
She is a child I cherish. I am fine, so please do not be angry.

549
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,000
This does not concern you.

550
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,640
This has shaken up the order of the inner court and broken Joseon's way of discipline.

551
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,860
She is but a young child. There must have been a reason. She wouldn't have done this for no reason.

552
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,510
If you keep acting like this,

553
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:13,550
then I will punish that child even more with the crime of showing no remorse.

554
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,030
Why were you running over here in such a hurry?

555
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:25,100
Did you know that the child would try and hurt the queen?

556
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,940
Are you trying to implicate even me in this?

557
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,630
The timing of your presence was so fitting.

558
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,750
The fact that the one who planned treason would be attending the queen's dining table

559
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,970
had me running here with uneasiness.

560
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:42,760
This good setting has been ruined. I will head back now.

561
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,290
I will be sure to punish the one who ruined my plans.

562
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,890
Brother, you should also be held responsible.

563
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:02,570
So that you are not a nuisance to our family clan.

564
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:13,350
What happened? They won't possibly hit that little girl, right?

565
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:18,800
Queen, are you really all right? Does your tongue tingle or your heart beat fast?

566
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,000
- What are you saying? The way you're talking sounds like—
- First, let us move elsewhere.

567
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,450
The queen and I will go to Daejojeon.

568
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

569
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,820
From now on, any food or drink

570
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,230
or whatever you have to ingest, you must be careful.

571
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:51,150
Is... someone coming for me?

572
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:58,080
Kim Jwa-geun and Grand Queen Dowager tried to poison your drink.

573
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,330
You're lying! But I didn't do anything!

574
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,090
Don't tell me... they're trying to kill me because I helped you with the banquet?

575
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:13,830
A ledger was found in Daejojeon.

576
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,640
Ledger?

577
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:24,020
Then that was what Kim Jwa-geun and my father kept asking about. What sort of ledger is it, exactly?

578
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,820
Did you not bring it from your parent's house?

579
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:31,910
I didn't even know it existed. I haven't seen it at my parent's house, let alone at Daejojeon.

580
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,590
I see.

581
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,490
Not even a dethronement, but poisoning...

582
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,940
Then Dam-hyang saved me?

583
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,760
- It seems so...
- So that's it.

584
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,260
But I drank for a long time.

585
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,490
I will ask that child, Dam-hyang myself.

586
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:55,080
I will ask her myself. Dam-hyang will be okay, right? She must be okay.

587
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,920
The people who wanted you dead will not stay put.

588
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,540
You need to save her.

589
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,800
I will do my best.

590
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,800
I... did nothing wrong.

591
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,050
It is not stolen money.

592
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:15,360
It is money I have saved up for years to save my younger sibling from slavery.

593
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,490
Please save me.

594
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:25,180
If I die, my younger sibling...

595
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:32,930
Everything about this accessory,

596
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,280
tell me in detail.

597
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,890
Dam-hyang.

598
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,910
Your Majesty!

599
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,120
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

600
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,200
It’s me who should ask you that.

601
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,550
I'm glad, Your Majesty.

602
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:04,170
That the ice didn't melt.

603
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:07,330
Ice?

604
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,620
Take the criminal!

605
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,580
Yes!

606
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,080
Take her? To where?

607
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,940
Your Majesty, you shouldn't be here.

608
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,270
You know that this child is innocent, right?

609
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,680
What are you talking about?

610
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,240
The only crime she committed was daring to save my life.

611
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,090
I don’t know where you heard that.

612
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,410
But for now, you should head back.

613
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,130
What if I don't want to?

614
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:44,030
That child will go through the appropriate measures and be dealt with.

615
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:47,480
If you stay here, even you will be harmed.

616
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,490
Escort Her Majesty, the Queen, to Daejojeon.

617
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,350
- Yes.
- Yes.

618
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,600
Let go of me!

619
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,000
I will escort her.

620
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,610
Please go back, Your Majesty.

621
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:13,440
Making a fuss like this will not help that child.

622
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,500
Your Majesty.

623
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:36,850
Dam-hyang, I'll get you out of here soon.

624
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,440
Don't be too scared.

625
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

626
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,640
Your Majesty, let's go.

627
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:49,940
I'll definitely save you.

628
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:18,380
How dare a child palace maid throw a rock at the queen?

629
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,930
This is blasphemy!

630
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:24,140
This is not blasphemy, but treason!

631
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,110
Even that child's father is a criminal charged for defaulting on the levy for military service and treason,

632
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:31,230
it seems like it runs in their blood.

633
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,640
Your reactions are excessive.

634
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,070
It hasn't been revealed yet as to why the child did that.

635
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,920
Even now, those thieves believing in Donghak have grown in their influence <i>(Eastern Learning /Neo Confucian reform )</i>

636
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,320
that they have been threatening the court.

637
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,020
We must justly show discipline and make an example out of them!

638
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,170
Are you trying to connect this to those that believe in Donghak?

639
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:51,430
Daring to throw a rock at the queen

640
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:54,590
was no doubt brought on by this rebellious ideology.

641
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:58,340
She is only a five-year-old child, but to say she was affected by a rebellious ideology...

642
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:03,080
I'm sorry, but during the time Your Majesty lived on Ganghwa Island,

643
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,120
some say that you too learned this Donghak ideology.

644
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,770
Is this your new weapon?

645
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:13,920
If you continue to protect that child and refuse to punish her,

646
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,180
it is no different than you as the king condoning this rebellious ideology.

647
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,310
That is how we will think of it.

648
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:25,970
If you punish this palace maid with certainty,

649
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,780
then this matter will be over.

650
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:33,950
<i>(T/N: 'Donghak' = 'Eastern Learning' was a reform movement of Neo-Confucianism. It introduced the ideas of democracy and human rights, which threatened the class system.) </i>

651
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,190
That should be enough.

652
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:39,980
Grand Queen Dowager told us to be strict with the king.

653
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:44,550
Is she throwing a tantrum because she lost her power?

654
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:46,730
How could that lowly child maid

655
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,290
have ruined a golden opportunity

656
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,270
to remove the queen?

657
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,650
Why isn't he coming?

658
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:18,040
He should be doing well, right?

659
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,510
The fact that the council meeting is going on for so long isn't a good sign though.

660
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,960
- Your Majesty!
- Yes?

661
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,640
Your Majesty, it's this way!

662
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,140
All of you, remember this for a very long time.

663
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:06,000
In the palace, you palace maids must not see nor hear

664
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,480
nor even think such blasphemous thoughts.

665
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,190
If you come across anything seditious like Donghak or its motto, "All humans are the same under the Heavens,"

666
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,410
know that you will receive the same punishment.

667
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:22,040
- She is but a child. How could she—
- Shush!

668
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,980
Quiet!

669
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,800
I thought we would catch a big fish,

670
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,950
but it is a mere child maid.

671
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,810
Am I too late?

672
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:54,530
Now you know how I feel.

673
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:04,940
She was only trying to save you.

674
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:08,040
That is why they killed her.

675
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,970
Because she stopped them from trying to kill me.

676
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,840
What crime has this child committed?

677
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,380
You told me

678
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:03,770
that this young child was taking the blame for the crimes of people like them.

679
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,980
Why didn't you save her?

680
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,120
I had to for the greater good. I had no other choice.

681
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,780
The greater good?

682
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:20,260
Your safety is for the greater good?

683
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:25,800
You are the one that said that nothing in life is fair!

684
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,990
With this small sacrifice,

685
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:31,070
I stopped a bigger sacrifice.

686
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,350
Small sacrifice?

687
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:40,540
Because she was just a weak, small little girl?

688
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,920
Being incompetent is a crime.

689
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:53,190
Not having the power to be able to protect even this one little child... is a crime.

690
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,320
<i> Why don't we make a hand signal that we only know? Like this.</i>

691
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,970
<i> "What I'm saying right now is a lie."</i>

692
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,960
<i> That's what it means.</i>

693
