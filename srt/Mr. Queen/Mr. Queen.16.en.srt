Do you know what this is that's considered so precious?

8
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,200
Why is this children's book precious to you?

9
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,780
- Oh that—
- Was it you, My Queen?

10
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,670
Were you the one who saved me?

11
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,860
Did you save me from the well?

12
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,090
That's right. It was me.

13
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,600
Did you forget already? After I went through all that carrying you around?

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,470
These handsome arms still have muscle aches that I got at that time.

15
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,330
Wow, I can't believe you already forgot all about it.

16
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,020
I'm talking about what happened eight years ago.

17
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,720
That wasn't your first time falling in a disused well?

18

What's wrong with you?

19
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,680
Then, why is this book important to you?

20
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,950
At a glance, it looks like it would be presented on the TV show, "Genuine Articles and Masterpieces."

21
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,890
You're saying weird things again.

22
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,780
After I dreamed of being trapped in the well, I thought of you.

23
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,620
Maybe it's because you saved me from the well,

24
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,880
but I keep confusing you with the child who saved me from the well eight years ago.

25
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,300
I keep thinking that perhaps you might have been that child—

26
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,560
Oh, this doesn't taste good when it's soggy.

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,340

28

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,280
What are you reading?

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,550
It's a book on strategy, written in the Ming era.

34
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,800
If you say, a book on strategy...

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,990
The military?

36
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,780
Are you going to war?

37
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,670
To strengthen my royal authority, a strong military power must back it up.

38
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,360
Do you still have nightmares of dying as an incompetent king?

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,560
From time to time.

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,160
Even if that really happens,

41
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,080
it's not because you're lacking.

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,530
It's just how the massive flow of history is.

43
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,370
You just happened to be standing in the flow already running in the direction of ruin, that's all.

44
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,910
So it's not your fault.

45
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,260
That could be the case.

46
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,410
So don't try so hard or be miserable.

47
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:11,320
If it's fate, then you can't stop it anyway.

48
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,030
After I wake up from my nightmares, I sometimes get this weird feeling

49
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,160
that my dream is actually the present and the present is the past.

50
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,560
In that last moment of my life as an incompetent king is ending,

51
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,900
I'm dreaming...

52
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,460
of the moment when I still have a chance,

53
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,900
when I can still... prevent things. Dreaming of the present...

54
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,060
Maybe right now I'm

55
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,650
just doing this to fight my fate.

56

Since I'm on your side now, you're destined to win.

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,430
That confidence of yours is very reliable.

62
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,320
I have a secret weapon.

63
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,500
I know the future.

64
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,200
Do you remember when I told you I was a man who came from the future, 200 years from now?

65
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,100
I remember that ridiculous statement, yes.

66
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,600
What if what I told you was true?

67
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,140
So what if I can teach you using knowledge from the future?

68
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,610
Are you telling me to really believe that?

69
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,160
If it's so hard to believe, just think I simply had a dream.

70
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,750
A very vivid dream about the future.

71
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,700
If that's the case, I won't exactly believe those ridiculous words,

72
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,320
but I'll listen to them.

73
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,300
How is Joseon 200 years from now?

74
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Okay, then.

75
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,060
Let's just say I'm making this up, but

76
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,280
we no longer call it Joseon.

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,960
The Republic of Korea. That's Joseon's future.

78
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,020
- The Republic of Korea?
- In the Republic of Korea, the citizens pick the king themselves.

79
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,100
What kind of nonsense—

80
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,270
Shouldn't you tell me something more believable so that I can be fooled or not?

81
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,730
You can't be shocked already.

82
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,650
The nonsense starts now.

83
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,340
Two hundred years from now, there will be neither nobles nor commoners.

84
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,350
Are you saying the class system will disappear?

85
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,020
Of course, something else exists instead.

86
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,540
Dirt spoons and gold spoons.

87
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,500
To think they use spoons instead of hopae to confirm their identity... <i>(ID system using badges with status / household info )</i>

88
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,680
Then when the citizens choose their king, do they take spoons with them?

89
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,820
There's this thing called voting.

90
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,800
Once you turn 18, you legally receive the right to choose a king.

91
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,050
- Choosing a king?
- That's right.

92
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,550
<i>At the age of 18?</i>

93
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,690
Like that, the queen has stirred up the entire palace all day long.

94
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,110
Good work.

95
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,670
From now on, your job is to watch the queen's actions and movements every day.

96
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,100
Brother, as you became the youngest Minister of Military ever,

97
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,310
you've become masterly.

98
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,900
- Is that all?
- Of course not.

99
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,030
Figured as much.

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,380
Congratulations.

101
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,750
By the way,

102
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,450
can our family and the king really not live on good terms?

103
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,980
The king cares for the queen very much, too.

104
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,930
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

105
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,440
The king does not sincerely cherish the queen.

106
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,710
For his own gain, he always puts the queen in a deadly situation.

107
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,550
But he doesn't seem like that.

108
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,630
That's what I hate the most.

109
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,160
He hides behind a mask and his woman.

110
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,210
Like so, he hides his true self and fools people with his two faces.

111
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,280
The queen is being fooled by that face

112
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,930
and supports the king, even by turning her back on our own family.

113
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,150
The king is only using the queen's feelings.

114
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,080
From what I heard, it's actually the king that's fallen head over heels for the queen.

115
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,300
Regarding the king's love life,

116
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,250
the rumors among the palace maids are always the most accurate ones, you know.

117
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,030
Even last night, they were talking for so long,

118
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,910
the lights in Huijeongjeon burned all night long, from what I heard. <i>(King's bed-chamber and office)</i>

119
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,420
<i>If Cheoljong succeeds, I guess the world of 200 years later would change, too. Right?</i>

120
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,420
<i>If history changes, then the Japanese colonial period will not happen either. </i>

121
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,660
<i>And deep-rooted corrupt people like Director Han won't exist either.</i>

122
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,130
<i>I'm not helping because of Cheoljong.</i>

123
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,650
<i>This is solely for myself.</i>

124
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,060
Saving you...

125
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,820
is also saving myself.

126
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,420
Your Majesty!

127
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,970
Your Majesty, your father has collapsed.

128
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,640
Don't get up, don't get up.

129
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,040
- What happened?
- It's dangerous.

130
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,640
Why did you come all the way here?

131
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,640
No. The palace is more dangerous.

132
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,370
Your Majesty, stay here from now on.

133
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,830
I will do my best to keep you safe.

134
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,110
I see... You collapsed because of what happened to me.

135
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,330
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

136
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,200
It's as if I served the poison to Your Majesty with my own hands.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,530
I uselessly made something that I wasn't able to protect.

138
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,300
They were the ones who did wrong.

139
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,960
It's not your fault, Father, so don't blame yourself and get some rest.

140
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,250
Think only about your health.

141
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,160
I am all right.

142
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,460
As long as you're happy, I'm all right.

143
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,330
So, Your Majesty,

144
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,140
please step down from your position.

145
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,650
- Father.
- So-yong,

146
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,820
when your mother was pregnant with you, there's something she always said.

147
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,560
She said, "This child will live the nice life I can't."

148
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,790
That her child would do everything she was unable to do,

149
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,570
hoping that you would live a better life than her.

150
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,700
That was your mother's last dream.

151
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,100
Now I don't know how I will look into your mother's face on the other side.

152
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:31,760
Father, from now on, I'm going to live as Mother wanted.

153
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,840
I plan on returning the favor to those that did this to me.

154
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,310
- Your Majesty.
- So, Father, you can't become weak like this.

155
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,100
There's something I need you to do.

156
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,190
Yes. I'll do anything you need me to.

157
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,440
I will do anything.

158
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,930
<i>[Storage Clearance!] [His Lordship Must Have Gone Crazy!]
(T/N: Modern Korean catchphrases.)</i>

159
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,390
<i>Whoa, this is awesome!</i>

160
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,240
He's an infamous miser, what's going on?

161
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,840
What if he forces us to pay back double-fold later?

162
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,410
I thank you!

163
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,540
Your Lordship, as well as Her Majesty the Queen, will live a long and healthy life!

164
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,330
A whole sack of rice!

165
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,070
Are they crazy?

166
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,000
How... beautifully crazy they are!

167
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,650
<i>I need you to do something for me.</i>

168
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,910
<i>Please take your hands off of any corruption. </i>

169
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,860
<i>And now you will have to build a good reputation. </i>

170
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,050
Are you really not going to sell all this but give it away?

171
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,940
Of course. It's not like I can take these things with me to the afterlife.

172
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,300
You need to let go so that I can take it.

173
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,690
Well, since earthly desires are like habits...

174
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,680
Your father has made a big decision.

175
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,850
That's not all.

176
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,010
This is the ledger you've been looking for.

177
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,350
My father remembers everything in the book.

178
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,540
<i>(List of names and their corrupt account in detail)</i>

179
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,610
They're much trashier than I thought.

180
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,840
The Left State Minister played a lot of tricks with the government loan for the poor.

181
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,610
<i>He has siphoned it in very varied ways, but the scale is tremendous. </i>

182
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,030
The Prime Minister's specialty is playing with land.

183
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,130
<i>For example, he forced the farmers to cultivate a rocky mountain and harvest from it, </i>

184
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,550
<i>then he charged them a huge tax. </i>

185
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,850
<i>There is no one who didn't pocket and nothing they didn't pocket. </i>

186
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,520
Not to mention, military corruption and the selling of official posts,

187
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,370
there is even a case where they sank a boat full of stone, instead of salt,

188
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,090
and just pocketed that huge amount of salt!

189
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,230
In such ways, they've committed all sorts of fraud with taxes and products submitted to the king.

190
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,010
Among them, what made me most pissed off was the evil loan sharking.

191
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,850
After charging farmers a huge tax, they'd give them a loan with 50% interest.

192
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,930
So every time the people breathed in, they're being crushed under by debt.

193
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,700
This is almost like gangsters' work.

194
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,570
Your father's memory concerning wealth is really amazing.

195
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,830
Well, then,

196
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,320
how will you treat a whistle-blower?

197
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,560
Your father was at the core of all this corruption.

198
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,480
His sin won't disappear even with this information.

199
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,560
But—

200
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,530
What do you mean "but" when he's just the queen's father who is also one of those corrupt people!

201
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:54,040
However, he is your only blood family left.

202
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,720
How about this?

203
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,650
They say, after calculating the merits and faults, if merits are bigger than faults, one's faults will be forgiven.

204
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,960
So, he should accomplish more merits? Give me some examples.

205
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,170
For example, he could cooperate to collect more evidence.

206
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,990
Because it'll be hard to punish those people with only that list.

207
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,330
In return, you will guarantee the whistle-blower's safety for sure.

208
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,750
Of course.

209
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,220
Your Majesty, it's time for you to go to the council meeting.

210
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,160
All right.

211
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,300
The council meeting...

212
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,770
<i>To incinerate garbage, I should go to the dumping ground. </i>

213
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:56,080
<i>But unless it's as regent, they don't let women attend the royal council meetings, though.</i>

214
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,990
For Director of Office of Correction for the Three Taxes, I'm appointing my brother, Prince Yeongpyeong.

215
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,920
<i>- That can't be done, Your Majesty!
- That can't be done, Your Majesty!</i>

216
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,230
Why not?

217
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,020
To let an inexperienced Prince Yeongpyeong take that post,

218
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,110
its responsibility and workload would be too severe.

219
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,400
Ideally, he isn't partial to any families either.

220
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,150
That's precisely the biggest qualification for taking that office.

221
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,830
Moreover,

222
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,360
now, do I look like I'm asking your permission?

223
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,350
<i>[Letter of Appointment]</i>

224
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,660
<i>Oh, Cheoljong!</i>

225
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,350
I've dispatched a secret Royal Inspector to the Yeongnam area, where the situation is the most serious. <i>(Gyeongsang Province)</i>

226
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,670
All crimes of exploitation will be punished according to the law,

227
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,410
and any wealth made from that exploitation will be

228
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,140
used as a relief fund for people.

229
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,870
In that way, we will use it as an example to all local government officials in the eight provinces

230
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,070
and make them turn themselves in.

231
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,510
<i>- That can't be done, Your Majesty!
- That can't be done, Your Majesty!</i>

232
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:07,530
The Ministry of the Military has already dispatched their officers and soldiers.

233
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,050
They dispatched troops without reporting to me?

234
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,960
Recently, the vicious commotion made by the Thieves of Donghak <i>(Eastern Learning / Neo-Confucian Reform)</i>

235
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,420
is similar to the Northwest Rebellion which threatened Joseon in the past.

236
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,850
Therefore, as this is a crisis that we must urgently deal with—

237
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,950
I bet the Border Defense Council has decided to do as they please!

238
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,330
The Thieves of Donghak have created a disturbance, threatened government officials,

239
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,740
and harmed government clerks.

240
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,230
Therefore, we'll immediately arrest the leaders of the Thieves of Donghak and behead them.

241
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,730
We'll make sure such incidents will never happen again. We have to eradicate them.

242
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,360
Eradicate them?

243
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,690
Not only the people who teach Eastern learning but also the people who learn it.

244
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,950
We'll arrest all of them, charge them, and mete out severe punishments.

245
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,480
Right now, the root of the problems that Joseon is facing are those people who frequently exploit others!

246
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,120
To eradicate the real root of the problem, the Office of Correction for the Three Taxes is trying to investigate the details and relieve the people!

247
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,800
As you're just sitting on the throne, Your Majesty, you don't know the nature of the crowds.

248
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,380
If you start to listen to their demands, there will be no end to it.

249
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,510
We should suppress them with a strong force,

250
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,350
so that they won't be able to uprise ever again.

251
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,960
<i>- That's right, Your Majesty!
- That's right, Your Majesty!</i>

252
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,770
As to whether there are any innocent people among the incarcerated, I'll review them again.

253
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,330
Also, those people who exploit others will be severely punished as an example,

254
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,910
and I'll order that both provincial and military governors in charge of those problematic districts to be beheaded as well.

255
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,150
Calming the unrest of those Thieves of Donghak with the relief fund...

256
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,170
How ignorant of the matter he is.

257
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,940
Before the force of the rebellion gets bigger,

258
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,960
I'll dispatch more troops and suppress those Thieves of Donghak.

259
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,730
What are you doing?

260
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,700
Before the face gets dried, you should apply the toner.

261
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,570
Your Highness, the thing is... We just ran out of it.

262
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,330
Shall I ask Her Majesty the Queen to bring a new toner—

263
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,500
I shouldn't, no, of course not.

264
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,290
- You may leave!
- Yes, Your Highness.

265
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,430
Can you really not forgive the queen?

266
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,540
If you read those letters she exchanged with the king, you wouldn't be able to say that.

267
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,010
This isn't a matter of forgiveness.

268
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,530
What a childish love game it was...

269
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,040
It seemed that she might even give up her own life for him!

270
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,180
Is this the cost for being loyal to your family?

271
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,480
Placing all the blame on us, banishing and branding our family as treasonous so that our future is now blocked!

272
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,670
How could you dump us like worn-out shoes?

273
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,760
You better think what a relief it is that your family didn't get annihilated.

274
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,120
At least, you saved your own life.

275
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,880
Follow me to work at the palace.

276
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,810
I'll prove to you that I'm different from my father.

277
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,320
Indeed, drinking in daylight is the best way to drink alcohol!

278
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,010
Of course, drinking in daylight is the best.

279
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,400
Oh, this is shrimp. What a rare food it is.

280
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,260
- What are you?
- What are you then?

281
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,470
- Sitting like this in this current situation.
- What?

282
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,590
Where do you think you are, daring to behave like this! What on earth are you, scoundrel?

283
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,310
Oh... here. I'm a Secret Royal Inspector.

284
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,750
Oh... the right way.

285
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,960
They said there were too many fake secret royal inspectors lately. Don't you dare to deceive me!

286
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,050
Well, these days the effectiveness of the "mapae" <i>(badge)</i> isn't the same as before anymore.
<i>(T/N: 3-5 horses, on badge is the rank of royal inspector)</i>

287
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,000
So here comes the Secret Royal Inspector.

288
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,460
S-Spare me, please.

289
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,800
Here we're entering the era when a rifle works better than a mapae.

290
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,220
Gosh, we're not even women, what's with this tea time?

291
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,390
Why do you think she summoned us?

292
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:51,660
The king with a hard-line policy, and the queen with a conciliatory policy, maybe it's something like that.

293
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,960
She's probably trying to show that she's from our family, but that's absurd.

294
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,580
Well, let's go and play along with her tune for a bit.

295
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,660
- Let's do that.
- Let's go.

296
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,760
It has been quite a while since I became queen,

297
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,760
but I haven't properly treated you, the elders of our family yet.

298
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,980
It's all because there were so many incidents these days. Please accept my apology.

299
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,640
Although this isn't much, please enjoy what I've prepared.

300
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,750
- This is not tea... but alcohol?
- Shush!

301
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,580
Please pretend you're drinking tea. His Majesty the King has decreed a reduction in the number of dishes and forbid alcohol,

302
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,590
but how could these ministers drink alcohol in daylight hours like this? What if you get caught?

303
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,600
But you deceived us, Your Majesty!

304
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,160
Did you just set a trap here?

305
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,330
- How could she...
- This is ridiculous...

306
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,900
Stop being so annoying. It's annoying.

307
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,120
But you were annoying firs—

308
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,940
What do you take us for that you're doing this?

309
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,450
I know exactly the kind of people you are.

310
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,080
That you are cancerous beings in this period of time.

311
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,210
C-Can... Cancerous...
<i>(T/N: Cancer is a modern term. Ancient era - they used 'ongjer')</i>

312
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,020
- In your terms, you guys are the plague of this era.
- W-What...

313
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,380
Why are we here listening to this? Let's leave!

314
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,350
Why on earth are you doing this to us?

315
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,140
Good question. That was a good question.

316
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,750
As expected from the prime minister, you speak some useful words, unlike the others.

317
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,740
Why am I being like this?

318
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,690
I'm doing this to tell you to not block the king's path.

319
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,820
Going forward, every time when you shout in unison, "That can't be done," in front of His Majesty,

320
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,080
starting from the tail, one by one,

321
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,620
one after another,

322
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,800
please be aware that you will disappear.

323
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,090
From now on, if you don't want to see that no one remains from the Ansong Family during council meetings,

324
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,150
I'm telling you, you'd better spare yourselves a bit.

325
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,750
You are also a part of the Ansong Kim clan!

326
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,540
That's why I'm changing my surname! From now on, I'm not Kim So-yong, but Jang So-yong.

327
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,130
W-What?

328
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,430
I guess your brains are that dumb because you got to that position due to your clan's influence.

329
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,580
All of you, please write these down.

330
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,490
From now on, forbidden to say, "That can't be done."

331
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,950
Forbidden to submit appeals, forbidden to conspire schemes,

332
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,260
forbidden to go to Oktajeong.
<i>(The gisaeng house)</i>

333
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,600
W-Why is O-Oktajeong forbidden?

334
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,790
Because I can't go.

335
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,130
I saw that the Grand Pardons were processed successfully.

336
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:14,710
Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager has great discerning eyes to see good talent.

337
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,750
Today, I came here to ask you a favor.

338
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,690
Since you've joined hands with our clan, I would appreciate it if you

339
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,230
would stop doing things to harm the queen, who is from our clan.

340
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,270
Our enemy is the king.

341
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:38,790
We shouldn't aim swords at each other's throats to help our common enemy, don't you think?

342
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:45,530
Of course not. It has already been a long time since I quit all shamanistic rites and posted talismans.

343
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,800
Your Royal Highness.

344
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,980
There's something to report.

345
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,760
That's right. To know the language of an era, I should read the books from that era.

346
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,920
Ah, it's so awkward explaining my words nicely.

347
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,360
What should I read to know newly-made words in this Joseon era?

348
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,870
Such things are not in this library here at the palace.

349
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,090
Then?

350
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,800
It's better to buy an eonmun novel, which is sold at general stores outside of the palace. <i>(Korean stories written in dialect)</i>

351
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,900
Oh, I see. What kind of content is it?

352
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,100
I've only heard of them.

353
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,740
I wasn't allowed to read them.

354
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,560
I know a few.

355
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,000
There is a story about a good wife who died after being abandoned by her husband,

356
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,200
but her soul came back with a mole next to her lips and took revenge.

357
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,090
Th-That story sounds familiar. What's the title?

358
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,820
Temptation of Woman.
<i> (T/N: Parody of TV drama, "Temptation of Wife")</i>

359
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,060
I thought you didn't read it.

360
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,670
Only the title. I only know the title.

361
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,830
And? Is there anything else?

362
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,650
This is a recent one. It's a story about one lady from a noble family.

363
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,600
Her husband, the lord, had an affair with a so much younger miss from the house next to them—

364
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,300
The World of The Marital Classification!
<i>(T/N: Parody of TV drama, "The World of The Married")</i>

365
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,020
Court Lady Choi, you said you didn't read it. Why are you so angry?

366
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,410
I apologize.

367
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,390
I see everyone thinks alike.

368
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,470
Why did you do it?

369
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,550
Leave us.

370
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,780
Yes.

371
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,050
Your Majesty, for your safety, you need the power from our clan.

372
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,370
Why did you make them your enemy?

373
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,300
It seems like you've forgotten but those oldies tried to kill me.

374
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,320
I've been making a way for you to return to your original place.

375
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,820
I don't want to return.

376
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,340
While I was here, I did all sorts of things to get on the Grand Queen Dowager's good side.

377
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,860
I didn't even work this hard when I was at the Blue House.

378
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,500
But you know what I received in return? Poison in ice.

379
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,430
That was because of the Jo family, which tried to get between you and the family.

380
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,260
I said I would protect you.

381
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,930
Let me make things clear.

382
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,990
Since dragging this out won't be good.

383
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,690
I can't have the same mind as you and I don't intend on using your feelings.

384
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,470
Already...

385
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,870
My path is different than yours.

386
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,640
It's best for both of us to go our own ways.

387
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,620
Your Majesty, I am your person!

388
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,320
Why is it the king out of all people?

389
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,920
If it weren't for the king, I could do anything you want me to, but why him?

390
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,890
Even if it weren't for the king,

391
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,820
you still wouldn't be it.

392
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,090
Don't let go of my hand, So-yong.

393
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,590
You're my everything.

394
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:52,300
<i> Translation and Timing Carefully Crafted

395
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:03,270
The Royal Portrait must portray His Majesty exactly, even a single hair of his.

396
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,560
Not only His Majesty's appearance but his inner nature must be included, too.

397
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,710
And you must not use your own painting style either.

398
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,140
My Queen.

399
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,170
Do you have any worries now?

400
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,260
Well, nothing much.

401
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,970
It just doesn't feel so great.

402
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,590
My Queen...

403
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,240
What are you doing?

404
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:46,750
If I use my face widely, my voice sounds like a king, but if I use my face narrowly, my voice sounds like a eunuch.

405
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,920
Is it not funny?

406
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,450
It's really not easy to make you laugh. If that's the case...

407
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:04,820
If I use my body in a small way, a servant's voice, but if I use my body in a big way, a strong man's voice comes out!

408
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,100
Is it not funny?

409
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,160
You finally laughed!

410
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,060
Your Majesty, please be in the position again.

411
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,870
I'll do it again later.

412
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,990
By the way, why, all of sudden, a portrait?

413
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,120
According to the rule of "Jo for merit and Jong for virtue,"

414
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,490
I've decided to promote the name of King Sunjong to King Sunjo.

415
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,080
So accordingly, my status is also elevated, so this is to commemorate it. <i>(T/N: Cheoljong was an adopted son.)</i>

416
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,920
"Jo for merit and Jong for virtue..." Ah, I've heard of it once, for sure.

417
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,290
When a king's posthumous name is decided upon,

418
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,240
for a king who accomplished merits, "Jo" is used,

419
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,410
and for a king who is with virtue, "Jong" is used.
<i>(T/N: The "jong" in Sujong was not bestowed )</i>

420
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,480
Ah, now I remember.

421
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,630
Your Majesty, this is the thing you've mentioned.

422
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,900
Let me see.

423
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,620
Whoa...

424
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,050
Wow, this product came out nicely.

425
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,190
Are you trying to learn swordsmanship?

426
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,270
With swords, I'm pretty good.

427
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,590
I don't have to learn swordsmanship separately,

428
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,070
because I'm already great at using knives.

429
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,710
This is a gift to be presented to a valuable person.

430
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,490
A valuable person...

431
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,930
Is it now my turn?

432
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:59,440
You must have been waiting! Oh, I'm sorry.

433
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,880
I wasn't so sure if I have to really deal with someone who is now pushed backstage.

434
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,280
How interesting.

435
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,620
You suggested forming an alliance with me, then you suddenly resigned without saying goodbye.

436
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,840
You failed to control your husband.

437
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,640
That's why you didn't guarantee my safety?

438
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,520
I had a plan, you know, before you messed with me.

439
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,300
What kind of plan was it?

440
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,610
A plan to live a safe and boring life.

441
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,450
Please unsheathe the sword.

442
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,190
I'm not fighting with a woman.

443
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,140
This is just a gift I've prepared, as I was sad to let you go without a proper retirement ceremony.

444
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,210
On the blade, all the accomplishments that Lord Kim Jwa-geun has achieved so far are engraved.

445
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,210
So please unsheathe it and take a look.

446
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,230
That is exactly your life so far, My Lord.

447
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:10,750
You asked about what I could possibly do as a woman, even if I were the queen. Right?

448
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,690
Please wait and watch what I can do.

449
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,660
From now on, I'll go with "no filter," "no brake," and "no back."

450
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,380
Your Majesty, Lady Eui Bin is here.

451
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,420
Let her come in.

452
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,240
How are you feeling?

453
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,060
Since I sorted out my troubled thoughts while shooting arrows, my mind is now at ease.

454
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,100
That's a relief.

455
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,140
You have done a lot of work until this late hour.

456
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,210
Not as many as you need to worry about, My Lady.

457
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,330
<i>[Dong-mong-seon-seub]</i>

00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,120
<i>[Dong-mong-seon-seub]</i>

459
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,770
If I had known this would come to mean so much to Your Majesty,

460
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,470
I would've used it a bit more gently.

461
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,870
I put a lot of scribbles in here.

462
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:54,530
I must have taken too much of your time when you were busy. I'll take my leave now.

463
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,920
My Lady.

464
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,900
There is something I haven't been able to say so far.

465
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:15,500
I didn't embrace you in my mind, just because you were the child I met in the well eight years ago.

466
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,950
You, whom I met again when I came back to Hanyang,

467
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,350
I liked you even then.

468
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,920
<i>Your Majesty, Prince Yeongpyeong is here.</i>

469
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,930
I see you are here, My Lady.

470
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,670
I was about to leave.

471
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,280
Please enjoy the conversation, you two.

472
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,430
What were you talking about so that she...

473
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,140
The truth that no one wants

474
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,660
is only right to be disregarded, I guess.

475
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,380
Look at those passionate eyes.

476
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:41,920
What a pervert for social science.

477
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,350
Gosh, you must have been thinking of getting my lesson all day long.

478
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:53,660
Well, I probably won't believe it, but let's hear your future story again today.

479
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,700
Today's topic is...

480
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,140
<i>[Constitutional monarchy]</i>

481
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,380
Constitutional monarchy.

482
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,570
Constitutional monarchy?

483
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,070
The king reigns but does not govern.

484
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:25,030
This is the way that there is a king, but the power is given back to the people.

485
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,910
There is a country called Bhutan.

486
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,930
That's a very unfamiliar name.

487
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,040
There is a king called Jigme Khesar, which is an even more unfamiliar name to you.

488
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,620
This king changed his country himself to a constitutional monarchy from an absolute monarchy like Joseon.

489
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,210
Why did he do that?

490
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,910
He did it since he was worried that some despot would become king in the future and ruin his country.

491
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,180
So, they make a constitution first and they rule according to the constitution.

492
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,710
The king is just a symbolic figure.

493
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,240
Jigme Khesar is a wise man.

494
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,000
Which "Ji" is he using for his name?

495
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,750
Hey, go home now.

496
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,860
Home? Where is that?

497
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,750
Gosh, this guy. You're really drunk.

498
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,690
You can't even remember where you live.

499
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:36,160
I must be off and head to my own home.

500
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,990
I don't have a home.

501
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,230
I don't have anything.

502
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,040
I have no place to go and I own nothing.

503
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,210
There's nothing for me now.

504
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:20,610
<i>I didn't embrace you in my mind, just because you were the child </i>

505
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,430
<i>that I had met in the well eight years ago. </i>

506
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,690
No. There's no way the king knows.

507
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,580
- Now is not a good time.
- I need to see the king now.

508
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:49,560
But—

509
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,970
Your Majesty, it's Hwa-jin.

510
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,430
So, with Her Majesty the Queen, who is half man and half woman here,

511
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:42,310
I shall complete the military strategy book? Well, all right, sounds good.

512
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,430
Don't have a prejudice. The queen is designing new and groundbreaking weapons we've never heard of.

513
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,620
Well, let me hear it first, please?

514
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,120
Before that, I have some killing training routines for soldiers.

515
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,000
- Why don't I teach him that first?
- Oh!

516
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,730
Killing...

517
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,740
One, two, three, seven!

518
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,080
Your voice is too quiet. Is that all you can do?

519
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,540
I understand it now, so let's discuss the weapons.

520
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,850
This is just number eight. There are 14 routines in total.

521
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,330
For the last one, you're not counting out loud.

522
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,270
If you are, the routine will be restarted from the beginning.

523
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:33,790
One, two, three, six.

524
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,070
<i>- Your eyes must look up.
- One, two...</i>

525
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,890
It's dangerous to involve the queen in the work of the military strategy book as well.

526
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,720
The queen declared war against her own clan.

527
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,310
Is it necessary for her to prove that she's on our side anymore?

528
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,190
My Queen.

529
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,770
Lift your legs. One, two, three, eight,

530
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:58,050
Oh, eight is the last one. From the beginning, again.

531
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,550
What? You said it's a killing method, so will it end when I'm killed?

532
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,340
Start again from the beginning.

533
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,300
- Yes!
- Your Majesty, please...

534
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,130
<i>Because you don't even realize you're becoming a monster,</i>

535
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,610
<i>although you're becoming a monster little by little, every day.</i>

536
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,870
With this many forged records, it's enough to bring down the Left State Minister.

537
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:45,080
- Please go and arrest him.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

538
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,830
<i>Your Majesty, Lady Eui Bin is here.</i>

539
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,070
Let her in.

540
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,270
There's something I need to tell you.

541
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,620
Can you please excuse us, Prince Yeongpyeong?

542
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,690
- My Lady...
- Please.

543
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,110
It seems that you've been talking with the queen every night.

544
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,430
What do you talk about?

545
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,590
We talk about the Joseon that I dream of.

546
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:39,460
I thought I would be the one to share your dreams with you.

547
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,830
While the queen is doing that, I've been busy being thrown off by lies.

548
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,030
I will no longer be thrown off.

549
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,450
The owner of the children's book is not me.

550
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,570
You knew all along? Then, why didn't you say anything?

551
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,630
Because it doesn't change anything.

552
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,140
Why does it not change anything?

553
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,720
Your trust in me will no longer be in your heart.

554
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,410
Your eyes won't be the same as before when looking at me.

555
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:24,360
Just because of one lie,

556
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:28,530
doesn't mean the time I spent with you disappears.

557
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,610
The fact that we've shared our feelings for the past two years doesn't change.

558
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,660
You probably acted like you didn't know, for my sake.

559
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,390
Because that's the kind of person you are.

560
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:46,810
Did you think I would be happy if you acted like you didn't know, for my sake?

561
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:51,310
- Hwa-jin.
- I plotted to entrap the queen.

562
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:58,440
I found the ledger in the queen's parental home and gave it to Queen Dowager Jo.

563
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,230
What... How—

564
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:07,070
I hate the queen.

565
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:12,280
Didn't you know what that ledger was when you saw it? That it was something I needed.

566
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,420
I knew that and still did it.

567
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,080
How could you do that to me?

568
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,550
You knew better than anyone what my dream was. To think that you stepped on my dream...

569
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:30,330
My dream... was you, Your Majesty!

570
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:34,050
But your heart started going toward the queen.

571
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,060
Seeing you try your best toward me,

572
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,620
while also being helplessly drawn to her,

573
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,890
made me feel more and more pathetic.

574
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,070
And I soon lost myself.

575
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,410
It's all my fault.

576
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,920
I made you like this.

577
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:14,280
It's my fault.

578
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,690
I shouldn't have had a love that was not for me.

579
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:26,740
I will find myself now, even if it's too late.

580
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,440
<i>[The World of The Marital Classification - Volume 1]</i>

581
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,530
This rotten lord! Next one.

582
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,280
<i>[The World of The Marital Classification - Volume 2]</i>

583
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,340
Your Majesty, aren't you going to go to Huijeongjeon tonight?
<i>(King's bed-chamber and office.)</i>

584
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,880
Should I just skip today?

585
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:03,910
Ah, our Cheoljong must be waiting with a craned neck for me.

586
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:10,720
Who knew I also have such a "soul of a scholar" family.

587
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,000
Just one more page.

588
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,930
<i>[Dong-mong-seon-seub... Kim So-yong]</i>

589
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:35,010
Jong, I'm sorry, sorry. I was going to read just one more page, but couldn't stop reading page after page.

590
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:39,380
Why didn't you change yet—

591
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,960
What? Why are you giving that to me?

592
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:56,970
Didn't you say to return it when I felt like living again?

593
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,150
Now I know that not knowing the truth itself

594
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,270
can hurt someone.

595
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,890
I took too long

596
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,660
returning this to its owner.

597
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,590
<i>[Dong-mong-seon-seub... Kim So Yong]</i>

598
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,660
I'm sorry.

599
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,420
For not recognizing you.

600
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,730
Same to you. I wasn't honest with you for a long time.

601
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,000
<i>[Kim So-yong]</i>

602
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,890
It finally came back to its owner.

603
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:42,230
I may not be able to turn back the time we missed;

604
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:50,430
however, I will never again misunderstand or lose you again.

605
00:51:53,980 --> 00:52:01,550
But what happened to you during those eight years?

606
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:06,110
Although you were a bit odd at that time, you weren't this bad.

607
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:09,030
Did I miss something?

608
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,240
That's what I'm saying.

609
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,390
Seems like you're enjoying that, though I'm not sure what it is.

610
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,040
It's medicine. Medicine.

611
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,380
Whatever you eat in hiding must be good.

612
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,120
Yogurt?

613
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,990
But this smells like alcohol!

614
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:45,500
It's called Yihwaju.
<i>(Yogurt-like alcohol liked by noble ladies to hide their drinking)</i>

615
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,900
It's a liquor that we make in the season of pear blossoms,

616
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,320
and drink when the fragrance of the pear blossom floats subtly in the jar.

617
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,700
Give me some, too.

618
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,750
That was the last bite. This alcohol requires a lot of work

619
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,410
so I was saving it, but because of you—

620
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,160
How do you make this?

621
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,040
All right! First, you add water to rice powder to make a dough.

622
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,580
You flatten the dough, make a hole in the middle, and let it rest.

623
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:16,980
It's shaped like a donut.

624
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,220
Continue.

625
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:26,410
<i>Anyway, after cooking them in boiling water, you break them into pieces and cool them down.</i>

626
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:31,300
<i>There is a yeast called Yihwagok. Prepare this yeast in advance, so that you can put it in the dough and knead it again.</i>

627
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,130
Then you put it in an alcohol jar, close the lid,

628
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,560
and after three days?

629
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Then we drink?

630
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,870
Of course not.

631
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,200
Then we give it a good stir,

632
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,130
and after 20 days...

633
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:51,660
We eat it then.

634
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:57,880
Time needs to fly quickly. Ferment well.

635
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:07,090
Kim Seok-geun, Left State Minister, colluded with local government officials to exploit farmers

636
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,900
and used the reserved grains for your personal use.

637
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,000
For all these charges, you will be dismissed from your official position and your properties will be forfeited.

638
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,300
You will be exiled to an isolated island, surrounded by a thorn hedge.

639
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,630
How dare you!

640
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,600
Let go!

641
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,450
Let go of me!

642
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:25,620
I said let go!

643
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,020
What? Let go!

644
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,820
Who knew that the queen's declaration of war was really true...

645
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,020
For the post of Left State Minister, which is now vacant, I'm appointing

646
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,680
Lord Min Wu-jin of the Yeoheung Min family, Suk-eui Min's father.

647
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,540

When do you think I can resume my regency?

Don't you think it needs to be done before the king ruins Joseon?

653
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,050
There will be no more incidents causing our clan to lose its posts.

654
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,560
And since I've started to reform the military, the end of the king's world will come soon.

655
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,450
Hurry up, as I'm not the patient type.

656
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,100
Yes.

657
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:30,190
By the way, I heard something odd.

658
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,940
That the queen is teaching the king blasphemous ideas.

These are encrypted words used by Thieves of Donghak.

672

Because one grenade can be more effective than ten soldiers.

It feels like she's just making this up.

Well, I just remembered, there was a number 15 in the commando PT routines.

677
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:27,410
Well, the name sounds very trustworthy... grenade.

678
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,160
If you put the explosive powder in this kind of bag and threw it... BAM!

679
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,720
It explodes.

680

You can't keep pissing me off!

770
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,210
You will fall into a manure pail if you keep doing it!

771
01:04:55,830 --> 01:05:00,450
Oh, dear! Not many people can curse better than I do, but you can.

772
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:04,190
If I were to make a suggestion you should breathe more from here—

773
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,590
Oh my...

774
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,030
I should warm up my voice.

775
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:16,590
You freaking bastard! You...

776
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,930
I ought to—

777
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,950
Shall we do it together this time?

778
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,960
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

779
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,630
I love you, Yihwaju!

780
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:00,990
Milk colored, Yihwaju!

781
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:06,020
You two should try some, too.

782
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,730
Just a little. Here.

783
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,500
There you go.

784
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,810
Its color is so beautiful, Your Majesty.

785
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:19,050
The scent is also nice.

786
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:22,320
It fermented well. Yes, it fermented very well.

787
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,760
What did you two do that both your voices are gone?

788
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,070
Let me see.

789
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,050
Your Majesty.

790
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:40,490
Is it because I haven't eaten anything yet?

791
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:45,600
Then... I can just eat it for dessert.

792
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,890
See you again, Yihwaju!

793
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,630
Tarak <i>(milk</i>) colored, Yihwaju!

794
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,670
Yihwaju!

795
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:01,170
I came as fast as I could because I wanted to give it to you personally.

796
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,520
Our military strategy book is now completed.

797

♫ <i>Just keep going forward, not back</i> ♫

798
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:12,720
"The Book of Military and Defense." Its title is nice.

799
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,900
It's all thanks to you.

800
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:18,420
Well, all I did was just tell you what I've seen.

801
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,330
- On the next page, with Officer Hong back then...
- Ah!

802
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,790
Whenever Officer Hong sees these drawings, he almost wets his pants.

803
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,670
Wow, you drew this really well.

804
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:41,390
My Queen. Aren't you lonely?

805
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:47,870
Even for me, who came to the palace after living in a different status momentarily,

806
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:52,630
adjusting to the palace, in the beginning, was so hard and lonely.

807
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:59,020
So, I'm worried about how lonely you feel as you're so different from others.

808
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,190
I don't have time to be lonely.

809
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:04,660
Every day is dangerous, and I'm busy running around.

810
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:18,380
I have someone who even makes a dictionary to understand me,

811
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:21,010
so I'm not lonely, thanks to you.

812
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:36,460
<i>Is it finally the ramen?</i>

813
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:43,030
<i>Do I not do it? Whatever.</i>

814
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,780
I didn't do it on purpose. My stomach has been like this since before-

815
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:56,750
Over there! Call the royal physician right away.

816
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,600
Is it serious?

817
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,380
It's conception.

818
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,020
Wh-What? Conception?

819
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,970
Pregnancy?

820
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,490
