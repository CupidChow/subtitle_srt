barely alive, hanging on a mere line.

6

Life is quite futile, isn't it?

Mr. Jang Bong-hwan, it could've been really bad.

46

<i>That's what I'm saying. I thought my life would be over, locked in a woman's body.</i>

47
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,250
How many days has it been?

48
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,720
<i>I know, right? I guess I've stayed in bed so long that my body feels heavy, like a thousand tons. </i>

49
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,240
It has been a week.

<i>So, time passes the same as in Joseon. First, please help me sit up. </i>

51

Since he hasn't been conscious for a week, we can say he's in a vegetative state.

<i>What do you mean, "a vegetative state"? Hey, Doctor Lee!</i>

Please keep monitoring him.

Yes, Doctor.

63
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,570
My Queen, wake up!

64
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,330
What has happened?

65
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,390
S-S-She just stood straight up suddenly,

66
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,270
but with that pale face, then she fainted.

67
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,130
This can't happen without a reason!

68
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,000
It's poison.

69
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,530
She must have ingested poison!

70
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,130
What?

71
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,840
Th-There is no way!

72
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,230
Not only did we control and inspect all the ingredients completely and thoroughly,

73
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,950
but also Her Majesty didn't eat anything here.

74
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,220
What did the queen do here? Did she cook?

75
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,750
Y-Yes, Your Majesty.

76
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,970
Then, in the process of seasoning or checking the ingredients, she might have taken in some poison, Your Majesty!

77
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,430
T-That's not certain...

78
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,560
There's no way.

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I always felt uneasy that something like this might happen someday.

80
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
In the end... it happened!

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,500
Poison? How could it be poison?

82
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,490
I will take... I will take a look.

83
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,440
Please, hurry up!

84
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,560
This is... It's not the pulse of a living person.

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,970
What are you saying?

86
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,050
It is Sigwol.
<i> (A sort of respiratory arrest)</i>

87
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,480
Sigwol?

88
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,920
The main symptom is to be corpse-like,

89
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,480
so it's called Sigwol.
<i>('Si' for corpse, 'gwol' for state/symptom)</i>

90
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,780
All her blood and qi energy is concentrated in her upper body,

91
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,410
so now her emptied heart has stopped her breathing.

92
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,000
If her qi comes back, she will survive, but if not...

93
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,850
she will die.

94
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,510
She will die?

95
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,020
Then, what must be done to save her?

96
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,010
A tonic of "Hwanhon" and juice from an iris

97
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,140
need to be poured into her mouth.

98
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,090
Head Eunuch! Immediately instruct the pharmacy accordingly!

99
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,420
Yes, Your Majesty!

100
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,860
Will the queen be able to survive until it's ready?

101
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,750
That's my concern.

102
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,830
Don't just wait! Find a way to save her!

103
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,490
Please save Our Queen!

104
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,030
Then first, we need to move her.

105
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,030
Let's go to Daejojeon!

106
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,290
Queen Dowager, we must kick out the wicked soul in the queen's body.

107
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,670
We must do it right now!

108
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,300
What is the method?

109
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,460
We must block the energy first, by burying the ominous objects near Daejojeon,

110
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,560
and then chase it away with an exorcism rite.

111
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,910
That's dangerous. An exorcism rite inside the palace?

112
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,050
If by chance we get caught—

113
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,450
If it's not done inside the palace, it won't work.

114
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,480
It must be done as close to the queen as possible

115
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,050
to make it effective.

116
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,030
Hurry up!

117
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,400
- Yes!
- Are you done?

118
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Yes, I am done.

119
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,520
Huh? What's going on?

120
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,180
The patient just had a cardiac crisis.

121
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,560
<i>Look here! Can't you hear my voice?</i>

122
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,520
<i>Is he saying something?</i>

123
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,310
<i>Yes! You heard me, right? I knew it!</i>

124
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,060
<i>I can hear and see everything like this, so does it make sense that I'd be in a vegetative state?</i>

125
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,140
Really?

126
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,680
- Did he really say something?
- He says he feels freaking wronged.

127
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,960
<i>You fr-freaking son of a bitch! Is your fat in your ears?</i>

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,100
I'm sure he feels wronged.

129
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,770
The whale fight. He got stuck in between Director Han and the prime minister. Now he'll get the blame.

130
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,700
<i>What the... So, all of this was done by Director Han, that bastard? </i>

131
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,360
Hurry up and treat her.

132
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,780
The more I check him out, the more he seems like a nutjob; but still, he's not someone who should get blamed like this.

133
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,500
What else can be done, though? This is a situation where he can't avoid getting attacked by either side.

134
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,760
Maybe lying down here like this might be the best thing for him.

135
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,510
<i>How can you say that? If it were you, </i>

136
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,660
<i>would you be lying down like a corpse and just let them have their way?</i>

137
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,940
<i>How can detectives say something like that!</i>

138
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:25,530
Then, with my neck on the line, I'll start the acupuncture.

139
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,840
<i>I won't leave them alone. That freaking Director Han...</i>

140
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,220
<i>That bastard...</i>

141
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,760
I will chew you up!

142
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,320
Cheoljong, why are you here?

143
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
- My Queen!
- Your Majesty!

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,420
Your Majesty, while eating all sorts of things carelessly, you even ingested poison.

145
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,790
What are you trying to chew up again?

146
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,060
The crisis is over now.

147
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,420
But why is she still unconscious, then?

148
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,310
Her breathing came back,

149
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,360
but she's not in sound condition yet.

150
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,830
She might get into a serious state again,

151
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,230
so we must keep watching her.

152
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,500
Are you saying she's still in danger?

153
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,890
This night... will be crucial.

154
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,140
His Majesty is at the queen's residence.

155
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,360
How is that?

156
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,480
The queen fainted and His Majesty has been staying with her the entire night.

157
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
Understood.

158
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,550
You should change your clothes.

159
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,020
I said I understood.

160
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,340
Keep your silence.

161
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,240
If this gets known, you won't be safe either.

162
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,660
Of course, ma'am. I know full well.

163
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,140
Perfect timing that girl works under the queen's lady-in-waiting.

164
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,610
How could everything work out so perfectly!

165
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,480
Indeed, the deity is helping us.

166
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,010
<i>Your Royal Highness the Queen Dowager, are you there?</i>

167
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,860
I'm planning a big prayer event, so I'm preparing for it.

168
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,700
It's nothing serious, so please just take a seat.

169
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,360
I have something to tell you.

170
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,230
I heard the news.

171
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,100
You moved your father into withdrawing the appeal, I heard.

172
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,070
You told me before that I didn't have to make a move myself, Your Royal Highness.

173
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,290
I did.

174
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,430
What if... if I make the move myself,

175
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,550
then... will we be able to crush the queen for sure?

176
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,790
I'll stay by her side, so you all may leave.

177
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,760
It's so late, I'm worried that this might hurt Your Majesty's health as well.

178
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,660
I am all right.

179
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,370
Head Eunuch, you may get some rest, too.

180
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,980
<i>Ever since I have been here, I haven't had one comfortable day.</i>

182
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,740
<i>Some guy called my husband, who sleeps in the same bed as me, is trying to kill me.</i>

183
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,000
<i>If it feels like your tongue is starting to become numb, move this hand without hesitation. </i>

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,430
<i>Get lost? </i>

185
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,870
<i>I gather up my courage to come and apologize to you, and that's all you can say?</i>

186
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,480
<i>If an apology is being made for the sake of the one making it and not the one who has to accept it, how is that an apology?</i>

187
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,390
<i> It is too late for you to be understanding now. </i>

188
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:38,440
I hoped that it wasn't too late to understand you, My Queen.

189
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,890
This is Songyuk silk. It's premium quality.

190
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,860
If the clothes were made with this, there is no way that I wouldn't remember it.

191
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,030
Are you sure?

192
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,650
I heard you received silk fabric to make the silk flowers for decorating the palanquins.

193
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,920
Yes, Sir.

194
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,750
But wasn't the amount too much for just making artificial flowers?

195
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:16,100
That was... Lord Kim Moon-geun, the chief advisor in Saongwon, took the rest.

196
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,460
Was this silk also sent to Lord Kim Moon-geun?

197
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,170
This is...

198
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,360
<i>Since he was burning a very valuable item, which I found suspicious, so I kept watching closely.</i>

199
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,590
I'm sure of it.

200
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,270
Prince Yeongpyeong...

201
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,020
<i>Was it perhaps on the king's order?</i>

202
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,620
What did you say?

203
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,940
Queen Dowager Jo and Eui Bin joined hands and are going to carry out an exorcism rite?

204
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,260
Yes.

205
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,960
I thought an extraordinary girl came into the palace as a Bin, but she's just the same level as Queen Dowager Jo.

206
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,470
This is great. We can give those two stupid women a lesson at the same time.

207
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,200
Exorcism rites or talismans are useful for creating controversy,

208
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,120
but they are not decisive enough.

209
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,000
I know.

210
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,160
How nice it would be if we could give them something better than just a lesson.

211
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,870
<i>This is the Head Eunuch. I have urgent news.</i>

212
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,920
Come in.

213
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,850
What is it about?

214
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,370
Her Majesty the Queen is in a Sigwol state. She stopped breathing.

215
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,140
Stopped breathing!

216
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,440
Just now, after the royal doctor's treatment, she started breathing again,

217
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,780
but she needs to be nursed all night long.

218
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,020
How on earth did that happen?

219
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,530
Maybe, while she was cooking in the royal kitchen,

220
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,400
she might have taken some poison.

221
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,630
<i>[Kim So-yong - Birth Date ]</i>

222

<i>If you really mean that you will fight </i>

223
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,230
<i>and if you really want to win against her, </i>

224
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,190
<i>you must not hide a single secret from me. </i>

225
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,440
<i>Will you promise?</i>

226
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,520
<i>Yes, I promise, Your Royal Highness.</i>

227
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,900
<i>So, regarding the king,</i>

228
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,820
<i>is what we see from him all that he is?</i>

229
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,110
The current king also

230
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,800
has the same dream as you.

231
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,160
<i>[Daejojeon - Queen's quarters]</i>

232
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,830
Is she still breathing...?

233
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,900
She is. If she was just asleep, there is no way that she would be so quiet like this.

234
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,950
- What's wrong, are you in pain somewhere?
- Mother...

235
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,860
You wished for a daughter so much,

236
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,890
so are you happy now...

237
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,120
Especially when one is sick and having a hard time,

238
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,200
a mother is usually missed all the more.

Be as you always are. Please shake it off gallantly and wake up soon.

You should keep the promise of "No touch: with me, no?

245
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,360
Your strange way of speaking and even your arrogant attitude too,

246
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,520
I'll forgive all of them.

You were inside the palace, fortunately.

What is wrong?

252
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,130
The queen is in a Sigwol state.

253
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,550
She has stopped breathing?

254
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,400
Fortunately, she is breathing now.

255
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,100
Lead your men from the Investigation Bureau and go to the Ancestral Shrine right now.

256
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,190
Did someone harm Her Majesty?

257
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,160
We... will point the finger at the Queen Dowager and Eui Bin.

258

<i>(chanting spells)</i>

<i>(chanting spells)</i>

00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,320
What in the world are you doing?

262
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,660
You dare!

263
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,750
Do you think you will get away with this!

264
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:59,350
Then, Queen Dowager, did you dare expect getting away with harming the queen?

265
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,330
- Oh, my!
- Move aside!
- Why are you doing this, Sir?

266
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,460
Search thoroughly!

267
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,690
Please!

268
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,220
I was merely offering a prayer for peace in the government.

269
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,650
This nasty thing was found near the queen's quarters.

270
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,620
It has nothing to do with me.

271
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,680
Then, she is the only one connected to this, is that right?

272
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,190
Your deity must not have revealed anything about your lifeline,

273
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,000
because you are going to die today.

274
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,470
Please save me, Your Highness the Queen Dowager.

275
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,600
I only... did as Her Highness asked.

276
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,930
Shut that mouth!

277
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,770
I... will perform an exorcism to lift the curse!

278
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,130
You will perform an exorcism to lift a curse that was placed by your rite calling the spirit?

279
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:12,040
Serving your deity instead of the king has you thinking that the palace is an easy place, is that right?

280
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,880
This is a misunderstanding, Your Highness.

281
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,220
It's too late. The queen's life is in danger already.

282
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,490
That can't be...

283
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,510
You performed the rite, yet

284
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,350
you don't believe in its effectiveness?

285
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,530
What are you doing getting involved with such a fraud!

286
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,180
The sin of lowering the prestige of the Inner Court to the ground!

287
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,110
The sin of the attempted murder of the queen!

288
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,720
Thus, throwing the country into chaos; a serious sin!

289
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,640
These many sins, how will you ever atone for them?!

290
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,530
How bad is the queen's condition?

291
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,700
Are you trying to get out of it by pretending ignorance?

292
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,490
If you must know, I will tell you how she is.

293
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,720
Poisoned!

294
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,380
Arsenic was found among the ingredients the queen used to cook with.

295
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,310
Arsenic.

296
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,450
Isn't that something you, Queen Dowager Jo, are familiar with?

297
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:25,360
Grand Queen Dowager, you would know more about it than me, wouldn't you?

298
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,140
You are still doing that.

299
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,750
In your delusion, putting the blame on me for the former king's death.

300
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,210
Human beings are foolish, thus they easily forget the past.

301
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,960
Not realizing how precious your life is when it was saved by selling the life of your own son.

302
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,020
At that time, you were the one who first begged me

303
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,970
to stop a fuss being made about arsenic or whatever in regards to the former king's death, and in return

304
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,290
to please just spare your own life.

305
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,270
But what is this!

306
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,880
You've even got the naive Eui Bin involved in a rite to place a curse and a poisoning!

307
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,420
Aren't you ashamed to face the former king!

308
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,570
But then again, if you felt any shame, then you would have died with the former king.

309
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,250
I know it's useless to say that it is unfair,

310
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,120
since you already know better than anyone

311
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,510
that it is unfair.

312
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,080
If you continue to insist, I have no choice.

313
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,020
Hear me!

314
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,530
Have this so-called Bodhisattva and Court Lady Han put to the slowest and most painful death!

315
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,440
<i>Yes, Your Highness!</i>

316
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:47,180
Please forgive me, Your Highness the Grand Queen Dowager! Please forgive me, Your Highness the Queen Dowager!

317
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,270
Your Highness!

318
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,930
And, the Queen Dowager—

319
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,730
Please spare...

320
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,310
my life.

321
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,320
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

322
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,890
This is not something you can get out of by begging me again!

323
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,850
Just how long must I take pity on you and be patient with you!

324
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,830
This time, I will never let you off so easily.

325
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,670
I made a mistake.

326
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:20,900
Give me a chance to make up for my mistake.

327
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,520
What on earth can you do to make up for your great sin?

328
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,780
Grand Queen Dowager,

329
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,130
you must be... proud of yourself,

330
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,450
thinking that you have the king in your grasp.

331
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,510
You were self-confident about the former king as well.

332
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:45,020
That's why you removed yourself as the regent.

333
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,860
Have you forgotten?

334
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,450
Does what the Queen Dowager Jo said bother you, Your Highness?

335
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,640
I will confirm it for you.

336
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,640
What kind of person the king is.

337
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,150
What on earth is going on!

338
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,080
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

339
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,970
What kind of fuss is this?

340
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,710
I came to take the queen.

341
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,830
Where are you going to take her?

342
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,320
I can't tell you.

343
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,680
You can’t tell me where you will take the queen.

344
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,510
What's going on?

345
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,180
<i>A facade.</i>

346
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,570
Just now, in the Ancestral Shrine, there was a rite to place a curse on Her Majesty the Queen.

347
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:18,290
Queen Dowager Jo... along with Eui Bin.

348
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,440
Eui Bin would never do that. Also,

349
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,600
are you going to insist that the queen is like this because of a ritual?

350
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,940
Arsenic was found in the royal kitchen.

351
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,640
From this moment, the Uigeumbu will begin its investigation.

352
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,660
In that regard, there is something to ask Your Majesty.

353
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,700
Your Majesty and Prince Yeongpyeong.

354
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,830
Where were you and what did you do the night after the royal wedding ceremony?

355
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,770
What are you doing now?

356
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,450
<i>Show your true face!</i>

357
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,640
It seems that you don't remember.

358
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,660
Then, there is no choice but to formally interrogate Prince Yeongpyeong.

359
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,330
Stop there, right now!

360
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,370
Your Majesty.

361
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,870
Please do not move anymore.

362
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,550
So that your soldiers do not commit the disrespectful act of harming His Majesty.

363
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,200
Stop.

364
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,100
This is a king's order.

365
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,420
She is my woman.

366
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,850
If you even lay a finger on the queen,

367
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,000
I will cut your throat with this sword!

368
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,110
I did not know that you cared this much for Her Majesty.

369
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,820
There’s a lot you don’t know.

370
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,500
I'll teach you myself.

371
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,960
Do you see me?

372
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,770
I am the king of this country!

373
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,120
Whose soldiers are you!

374
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,090
You belong to me!

375
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,840
Everybody stand down.

376
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,200
Your Majesty!

377
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,780
What disloyalty is this?

378
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:30,210
Withdraw immediately. If you don’t want to see blood spilled for daring to commit blasphemy in Daejojeon.

379
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,420
Prince Yeongpyeong, if His Majesty ordered it,

380
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,820
would willingly get blood on his hands.

381
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,590
I had something to ask anyway.

382
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,090
It's good that you came.

383
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,170
I did not order any investigation of this incident.

384
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,390
On whose order is Uigeumbu acting right now?

385
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,550
I will review the incident first.

386
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,660
So that an innocent person will not be accused as a culprit again.

387
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,780
Every time, it is Her Majesty the Queen who is the most innocent.

388
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,790
I told you...

389
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:18,150
that if you made Her Majesty unhappy, you would also become unhappy.

390
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,850
I said that not as a threat, but I will change that now.

391
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,670
Insolence!

392
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,760
You are no longer this woman’s cousin.

393
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,310
By the way,

394
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,090
the person responsible for her happiness and misfortune,

395
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,330
is not you, Director of the Uigeumbu,

396
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,430
it is me.

397
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,830
The queen will be moved to her family’s home.

398
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,120
Bring the palanquin now.

399
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,930
- Yes.
- Yes.

400
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,960
Let's go.

401
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,480
I was too late.

402
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,030
You worked so hard to hide yourself.

403
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,570
Take care of her.

404
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,290
I will, Your Majesty.

405
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,970
I'm sorry to send you off alone.

406
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,980
Don't let your guard down before you arrive at her home.

407
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,480
When you arrive there, stay alert throughout the night.

408
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,330
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

409
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,900
Ah! Everyone, except for me,

410
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,870
is probably having an easy life in the palace.

411
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:49,680
What am I so happy about?

412
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:55,130
Anyway, it should be time for Kim Hwan to get here.

413
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,130
As expected...

414
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,860
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you before I left for field train—

415
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,320
Who is this?

416
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,660
I met a great friend today.

417
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,940
This is Lee Saeng-bang.

418
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,150
I met him while looking for Lee Saeng-mang.

419
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,300
What a bond only made possible by the difference of one letter!

420
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,930
I thought perhaps we'd have drinks together

421
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,330
and gamble some.

422
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,920
Is training camp a tavern or something?!

423
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,250
Drinking and gambling. How disorderly!

424
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,210
Haven't we always been like this?

425
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,690
That was because it was you, no one else but my Kim Hwan!

426
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,830
You are you know.

427
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,120
Were you always such a bad guy?

428
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,450
Are good friends so common and bonds so abundant?

429
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,940
Was I just one of your common friends

430
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,510
and one of your abundant ties?

431
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,250
So, did you lose Lee Saeng-bang?

432
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,900
You are to enter the palace immediately, Sir.

433
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,730
Wh-What?

434
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:50,930
Why is there no one around? Did everyone leave me out

435
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,690
and go see something interesting?

436
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,760
Why do I feel so alienated lately?

437
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,260
Lee Saeng-mang! You are alive?

438
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,240
Finally, we're meeting again like this!

439
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,160
I mistook you for my good friend.

440
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,320
Please excuse me.

441
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:32,090
I don't know about a good friend, but I do have a good item.

442
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,570
These strange things... What are they?

443
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,750
They are...

444
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,670
- Why are you out and about while the curfew has not been lifted yet?
- Hide these, please.

445
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:00,280
You are... After getting flogged last time,

446
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,380
you're selling those obscene things again!

447
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,310
Obscene!

448
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,430
This guy... was trying to sell them to me!

449
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,560
Take these two in for an immoral crime committed in our local jurisdiction!

450
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,890
<i>- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!</i>

451
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,390
B-But...

452
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,320
- Gently, gently.
- This...

453
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,160
He asked specifically about the night after the royal wedding ceremony.

454
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,270
So in the end, the queen must have revealed it.

455
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,660
I was wondering why she was keeping quiet!

456
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,690
If he knew that I was trying to kill the queen,

457
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,900
he wouldn't have stopped at just questioning me.

458
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,390
On the first day of his appointment, he recites, "In a time of crisis, straighten the country by correcting the wrong," to me.

459
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,010
"Saving a country that faces a crisis,

460
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,030
that power makes the king fear."

461
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:50,200
That arrogant... He's threatening to replace the king.

462
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,970
If he's that kind of opponent,

463
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,870
Your Majesty should have held back a little more.

464
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:57,790
If His Majesty didn't act, he would have investigated that night.

465
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,170
Regardless, he laid a trap to expose you.

466
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,620
Ah, he's smart.

467
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,220
It means we somehow got caught.

468
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,700
I will look into how much he knows.

469
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,170
First, for today, let's hope that the queen wakes up safely.

470
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,670
For everyone's sake, that's the most important thing.

471
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,100
What should I do about field training since Kim Byeong-in is so sensitive about that?

472
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,760
That's more of a reason to push forward,

473
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,630
because it means that we don't have much time.

474
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,520
Raise the lantern a bit higher.

475
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,550
Where is Her Majesty?

476
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,580
She is on her way here.

477
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,600
Is she really out of danger?

478
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,480
Yes, fortunately.

479
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,990
What on earth!

480
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,930
Poison? Poison!

481
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,330
I... summoned all the best physicians in Joseon.

482
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:05,410
My goodness... I need to be more alert than ever.

483
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:11,350
Calmly and dispassionately.

484
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:18,370
Ah, Your Majesty! My goodness... Oh, my goodness!

485
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,850
How cruel!

486
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,650
To falsely accuse Queen Dowager of the poisoning when she lost the previous king that same way!

487
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,400
Since the situation is such, it would be best for you to distance yourself from Queen Dowager.

488
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,120
I happened to give them cause for trouble, by being at Seonwonjeon Hall.

489
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,150
Don't blame yourself.

490
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,740
They are the kind to make their own causes.

491
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:44,090
But... why did you move the queen to her parents' home of all places?

492
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:50,010
Her life in the palace must be lonely. She was calling out for her mother in her sleep.

493
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,430
Her Majesty... wished it, I see.

494
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,390
Why? Is there a problem?

495
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,440
No, there isn't.

496
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,590
Do not worry too much.

497
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,230
As soon as the situation clears up, I will send a message through my brother.

498
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,670
Your Majesty.

499
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,260
<i>Please...</i>

500
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,370
<i>Are you going to disobey a royal command?</i>

501
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,920
Please do not get hurt.

502
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,220
All right.

503
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,050
Now that you are here,

504
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,010
it feels as if we've turned back time.

505
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,170
<i>Orabeoni! </i>

506
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,410
<i>You are the only one who looks for me when I am in hiding.</i>

507
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,130
<i>I won't let you go.</i>

508
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,250
<i>I won't forget you.</i>

509
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,130
If I could turn time back to then.

510
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,320
<i>She is my woman.</i>

511
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,640
You should have been mine.

512
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,550
I, too, should have been yours.

513
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,990
Do you know who I am!

514
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:37,590
I am really... soon to become... the manager of Uigeumbu! Really!

515
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,070
Using the crops you got an advance on is not enough, so that now you are using a title in advance?

516
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:45,080
What are you talking about "using in advance" when I am such a pure nobleman!

517
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,490
With this kind of shining face and talent...

518
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,800
Still, I am a professor at Sungkyunkwan. Doesn't that tell you something?

519
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,170
I... do not negotiate injustices!

520
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,450
Eh... Be quiet!

521
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:59,560
We've got a noisy one today.

522
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,830
If you let me out right now, I will give you five nyang.

523
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,690
That five nyang...

524
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,830
give it to me.

525
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,420
I will teach you something very valuable.

526
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,350
If you listen to what I tell you,

527
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,010
you will no longer be your old self.

528
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,240
You will become a true grown-up.

529
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,910
Are you just entering the palace?

530
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,660
Yes, I see you're here.

531
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,930
I heard about what happened with the king.

532
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,320
I see. Yes.

533
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,400
No matter how insignificant a man is,

534
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,720
he will try to act the part of a man if pushed.

535
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,040
Why did you do something you weren't tasked to do?

536
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,010
That's because...

537
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,000
<i> That gaze...</i>

538
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,410
<i>The eyes of a man who's suppressing his true colors.</i>

539
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,800
I didn't want to cause Grand Queen Dowager any concern.

540
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,210
I guess I got a bit overzealous.

541
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,610
Mind yourself.

542
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,410
Father.

543
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,410
Aren't you curious about the queen's state?

544
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,760
I heard that she's past the worst stage.

545
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,740
She is still unconscious.

546
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,990
She'll shake it off soon and get up, I'm sure.

547
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,050
Is there anything more to be said?

548
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,760
I heard that Grand Queen Dowager

549
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,030
spoke of deposing Her Majesty.

550
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:56,810
She only said it out of anger. She didn't really mean it.

551
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,720
You worry about needless things.

552
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,520
I know very well how much you care for the queen.

553
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,340
Not as much as you,

554
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,860
but I also care about her, so do not worry.

555
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,250
Yes.

556
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,300
I'll see you at the palace.

557
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,610
The father-in-law of the king has sent all these presents again.

558
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,370
How is the queen?

559
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,260
She's over the crucial stage,

560
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,940
but she needs to recuperate, so she was moved to her family home.

561
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,530
She keeps having to deal with illnessses.

562
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,950
She hasn't been in good health ever since the accident.

563
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,590
What can I say?

564
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,930
She's broken.

565
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,440
We're fixing her as best we can,

566
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,210
but now she's suffering through Sigwol.

567
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,610
She's so frail.

568
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,510
If Eui Bin ends up giving birth to a prince first,

569
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,500
Queen Dowager Jo will act up again.

570
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,220
Do not worry.

571
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,180
I have an alternate plan in case of that.

572
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,430
An alternate plan?

573
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,070
There are two candidates who passed the final round of the queen selection.

574
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,450
I made sure they still aren't married.

575
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:20,130
You are very reliable as expected.

576
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:26,390
I am told that Byeong-in got very aggressive with His Majesty yesterday.

577
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,090
It seemed that everyone had concerns with His Majesty yesterday.

578
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,240
As though he had an alternative motive.

579
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,560
He's different than the late king.

580
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,040
Of course, he is; you're an impeccable judge of character.

581
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,630
There's only one reason I placed him on the throne.

582
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:51,600
In order to prevent the pain of making the choices which you experienced with the late king.

583
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,900
Right.

584
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,570
It was very painful.

585
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:01,160
I had the blood of my grandchild on my hands while fighting for this country.

586
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,410
So if anyone tries to ruin this, the harder it will be for me to forgive.

587
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,500
<i>[Uigeumbu - Royal Investigation Bureau]</i>

588
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,120
You first.
<i> (Gift of tofu, customary for one who is released from prison)</i>

589
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,770
No, you first.
<i>(Each batch of tofu tastes different - signifies person will reform)</i>

590
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,730
- No, you first.
- No, you!

591
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,380
<i>Where is this?</i>

592
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,820
<i>Joseon or Hell Joseon?
(Modern satirical term to protest socio-economical times)</i>

593
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,690
<i>It's Joseon.</i>

594
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,850
Not having it is sad to call it a relief

595
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:55,350
and being able to confirm it without moving is convenient yet troubling.

596
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,950
<i>Oh, but it's too dazzling in here.</i>

597
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,330
The golden empire...

598
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,440
The Incas!

599
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,240
Your Majesty!

600
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,370
Oh, I got scared thinking I traveled through time again, but it's only you!

601
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,510
You're finally awake!

602
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,200
Oh, there's nothing like great loving-kindness and compassion,

603
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,000
but let's not repeat making such a fuss.

604
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,900
But you were in serious danger.

605
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,630
You completely stopped breathing.

606
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,320
Stop crying... Stop, stop.

607
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,070
My breathing stopped?

608
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,370
According to the doctor, you suffered from Sigwol.

609
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:59,620
It's a symptom like that of a dead person.

610
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,170
So I was in a vegetative state here, too.

611
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,450
But where am I?

612
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,210
Your family home.

613
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:13,800
Then that means I can't avoid meeting the one I wanted to avoid so much!

614
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:19,530
- Pardon?
- I have nothing to be afraid of in this world except one person.

615
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:22,700
The person who's like a mortal enemy is

616
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,260
the father of this woman.

617
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,010
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

618
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,770
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

619
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,910
My goodness, Your Majesty! Are you alright?

620
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,410
Can you breathe now?

621
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,340
What do you need? Should I call the doctor?

622
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,960
I think you're about to stop breathing!

623
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,640
Here you go. Drink, drink this up.

624
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,110
Yes, yes.

625
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,180
That's a tonic that restores female energy...

626
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,020
That's good, that's good.

627
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:52,110
Oh, why are you sweating so much?

628
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:59,010
I was so worried,

629
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,730
I couldn't sleep all night.

630
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:05,240
I couldn't eat anything since the inside of my mouth felt rough.

631
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,070
And when I would get up from sitting, I-I felt at a loss.

632
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,470
You must have been in terrible shock.

633
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:15,680
Every illness comes from worry and concern, so get a good rest.

634
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,630
Yes, yes. I will do so.

635
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,240
I hope you feel better soon.

636
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,130
Then, I will be—

637
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:25,160
No... Where are you going?

638
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:30,560
Oh, I should be minding my manners first.

639
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,590
Oh, please! Don't make me more uncomfortable than I already am!

640
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,200
No, no, no.

641
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,050
Please accept my bow, Your Majesty.

642
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,340
Oh, no!

643
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:49,720
I will do it again.

644
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,110
Oh, Father, everyone in Joseon greets me with so much difficulty.

645
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,030
While I'm here,

646
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00,370
please treat me as your daughter, So-yong.

647
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:07,390
The more honorable a position, the lonelier it is.

648
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,310
All right, all right.

649
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,310
While you're here,

650
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:17,240
I will treat you like before so that you can stay here comfortably.

651
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,230
Go ahead and sit down.

652
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,280
Yes, thank you.

653
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:35,750
No matter how much I decorated the room, it still felt empty.

654
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:40,450
Now that you're back, it's shining so bright.

655
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,370
Yes...

656
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:48,530
It's so very bright as if I'll go blind.

657
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,730
I like it, too.

658
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,750
I put some care into it so as not to tarnish our reputation.

659
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,500
I have everything else ready as well.

660
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,870
As usual... only the best.

661
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:44,000
Good. Next physician, please enter.

662
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,990
Great doctors, who were so rare to see back there, are so plentiful here?

663
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,790
Will there be more people coming?

664
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:01,790
- Why the feast?
- This is breakfast.

665
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:10,260
To help you regain your energy, your father prepared turtle soup for you.

666
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,200
As soon as I wake up, I have to go to sleep?
<i>(Words for "turtle" and "go to sleep" are Korean homonyms.)</i>

667
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,720
Eh, why? What is it? What is it?

668
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,820
Ta-ta-da!

669
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,610
It's an honor to serve you, Your Majesty.

670
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,570
She is the best traveling stylist in Joseon.

671
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:51,610
I am a natural beauty so I don't need much processing.

672
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,090
Please come this way.

673
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,530
Petition to depose and poison!

674
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,410
They are out to get Her Majesty!

675
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:11,590
Please do not worry.

676
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:15,320
No matter how bad the deeds of those trying to harm Her Majesty get,

677
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,040
I will grow my power as well.

678
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,230
Her Majesty is in good hands with such a dependable cousin like you.

679
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,100
By chance, do you remember this item?

680
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,970
Silk is silk.

681
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,860
Is it special?

682
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:44,210
Did you, by chance, give a gift of a robe made of this, to someone?

683
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,850
After Her Majesty became queen,

684
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:51,470
I usually received gifts so I don't really have a reason to give.

685
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:55,780
The only gifts I give are to Her Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

686
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,000
I see.

687
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,340
But, maybe...

688
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,290
Recently, my warehouse was burglarized twice.

689
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,650
It's possible that this silk was among the things taken.

690
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,350
Are you saying your residence was violated?

691
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:13,500
No, no! That's not it.

692
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,490
Since it's not safe to have all this wealth in one place,

693
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,080
you need to divide it up and store it in various places.

694
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,030
I have many such warehouses.

695
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:28,420
<i>Of all the warehouses, the secret warehouse where I keep the most valuable items...</i>

696
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,820
When I think about it again, it pains me.

697
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,810
My precious babies.

698
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:44,530
Is there a way to confirm whether this silk was among the items that went missing?

699
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:50,750
There were so many and it's dangerous to keep an inventory of such items.

700
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,420
So, that's why I am saying...

701
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:57,760
Please don't talk too much about my warehouses.

702
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,020
If the Customs Office finds out, it would be a bit...

703
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,090
I understand.

704
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:09,820
But, by chance, did you hear anything strange from your father?

705
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,420
Is anything wrong?

706
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:18,210
Last time, when Her Majesty saved His Majesty and Eui Bin,

707
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:22,680
she annoyed Grand Queen Dowager. That's been weighing on my mind.

708
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,450
I keep having nightmares about Her Majesty being deposed as well.

709
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:31,000
What are you saying, "deposed"? Why do you think such a thought?

710
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,830
There is a rumor that in the final round of selection, the families of the candidates for Queen,

711
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,880
were given secret messages.

712
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,370
I wondered, by chance, if she (the Grand Queen Dowager) might be thinking about a new queen.

713
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:46,180
I have been so worried about it that I've been overeating lately.

714
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,830
They wouldn't give up on someone like Her Majesty the Queen.

715
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,640
Isn't that right?

716
00:59:53,500 --> 01:00:00,040
I... will have to be more diligent and offer more gifts to Grand Queen Dowager!

717
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,370
How is your injury?

718
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,390
This... in no time...

719
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,830
I guess not right away.

720
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,080
How did such an accident happen?

721
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:19,290
I-I... forgot my age and was careless.

722
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:27,240
This is no time for me to be laughing like this.

723
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,270
How do you feel?

724
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,090
I feel like I became a Barbie doll.

725
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,140
That's great!

726
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:48,220
That means you feel good, right?

727
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:18,210
Ah, this moldy old book smell!

728
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,740
It has the scent of a student getting ready for an exam.
<i>(Usually refers to either the Bar Exam or the Civil Service Exam)</i>

729
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:25,030
If you were a man, you would have passed the government exam for sure and entered the palace.

730
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:28,910
Since you enjoyed reading so many books.

731
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:34,170
Who enjoys studying? I did it to make my father happy.

732
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:37,030
Since I was born at the price of my mother's death,

733
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,150
I implicitly thought that I should at least be worth it.

734
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:46,310
That must have been why, every year on your birthday, you studied books until your nose bled.

735

<i>So-yong.</i>

<i>Happy birthday.</i>

737
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:15,150
Because my birthday is also my mother's memorial day,

738
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,130
I always felt bad.

739
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,000
Those kinds of thoughts are occurring.

740
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,200
Your Majesty... finally... your memories came back!

741
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:34,460
