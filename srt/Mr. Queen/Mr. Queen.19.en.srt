Where is the real So-yong?

12

I don't know. I really don't know whether she's alive or not!

Since the moment when I woke up from the accident at the lake.

You said you know everything that happened between me and So-yong.

I suddenly remembered everything.

19

- What are you scheming?
- If you remember,

It's the list of people who plotted treason and their signatures.

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,660
There was darkness everywhere.

164
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,440
- A "blackout" is—
- You don't need to explain. I know what it means.

165
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,450
I know how you felt.

166
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,150
Because I felt the same way.

167
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,880
I've missed you.

168
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,900
More than my injured body,

169
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,370
my heart was in much greater pain.

170
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,220
I will never leave you alone again.

171
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,030
I am sorry.

172
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:18,940
♫ <i>For coming to me who was nothing</i> ♫

173
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,210
♫ <i>I was full of mistakes</i> ♫

174
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,430
♫ <i>But you embraced me</i> ♫

175
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,570
♫ <i>who was stumbling as if crumbling</i> ♫

176
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:40,390
♫ <i>I love you, I love you and all of you</i> ♫

177
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,310
♫ <i>After I met you, everything is hovering like a dream</i> ♫

178
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:52,370
♫ <i>Wherever you are,</i> ♫

179
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,710
♫ <i>I can feel you</i> ♫

180
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,030
Did you get hurt badly?

181
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,040
I am all right, Sir.

182
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,960
With medicine, I will be all right.

183
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,040
Did you recognize the group that attacked you?

184
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,860
I saw a very familiar face.

185
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,140
<i>They are Donghak followers!</i>

186
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,490
<i>I saw the king.</i>

187
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,040
<i>[The king is not dead.]</i>

188
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,940
<i>[Greedy Kim Clan tried to kill the king and frame innocent people...]</i>

189
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,220
Halt! There is even an emergency order.

190
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,280
How dare a woman roam around alone?

191
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,190
I am the deposed Eui Bin, Lady Jo.

192
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,500
Since I am in no position to go around showing my face,

193
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,650
I just wanted to get some fresh air when there aren't as many people around.

194
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,530
You should hurry back in since the atmosphere these days is troubling.

195
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,890
I understand. Thank you for your hard work.

196
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:10,130
<i>Greedy Kim Clan tried to kill the king and frame innocent people.</i>

197
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,400
<i>Pulled by fate, the king is alive.</i>

198
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,580
<i>To fill a throne that's not empty,</i>

199
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,030
<i>how does that make sense?</i>

200
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,510
<i>My Lord! My Lord!</i>

201
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,100
My Lord, in the streets, this...

202
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,780
What's all this fuss?

203
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,480
This...

204
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,550
<i>[The king is not dead. Greedy Kim Clan tried to kill the king and frame innocent people.]</i>

205
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,120
<i>[Pulled by fate, the king is alive. To fill a throne that's not empty, how does that make sense?]</i>

206
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,250
Then, Her Majesty, also,

207
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,830
is not convalescing, but...

208
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,300
As expected... Lord Kim Jwa-geun had Kim Byeong-in in the palm of his hand all along.

209
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,190
He even predicted that Kim Byeong-in would betray...

210
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,690
- Lord Kim wants Kim Byeon-in's death kept quiet for now.
- Yes, Father.

211
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:22,130
Anyway, you ended up directly siding with Lord Kim Jwa-geun this time!

212
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,650
But losing the queen...

213
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,830
You will have to achieve something else

214
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,990
to make up for it.

215
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,720
It will get all mushy if it's boiled for that long!

216
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,540
Leave him be, please.

217
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,080
Ever since the queen left to convalesce, he's been out of it just like that.

218
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,970
They say that dislike is scarier than affection.

219
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,920
I guess he'd gotten really attached to the queen.

220
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,900
<i>How can the king leave so fruitlessly?</i>

221
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,000
<i>He was only sincere in caring for his people.</i>

222
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,680
<i>As expected, you stayed behind alone.</i>

223
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,380
<i>There was no one to greet me at home either so...</i>

224
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,780
<i>Her Majesty must be in heartache as well, right?</i>

225
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,190
<i>I don't know what to say to console you...</i>

226
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,060
<i>To me anyway,</i>

227
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,620
<i>you have already been a great comfort and consolation.</i>

228
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,930
<i>Enough even that briefly I forget to nag.</i>

229
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,120
<i>I was the one who, thanks to you too...</i>

230
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,310
<i>Would you like to have a cup with me?</i>

231
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,450
<i>I am a little busy...</i>

232
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,070
<i>Just a moment. Just a moment then. I should at least pack you something.</i>

233
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,450
<i>I like you.</i>

234
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,830
<i>I love you.</i>

235
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:30,360
<i>I am in a position where I can't even express that kind of feeling so...</i>

236
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,730
<i>so, Head Chef,</i>

237
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,030
<i>please find a good partner</i>

238
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,930
<i>who can share your loneliness.</i>

239
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,300
<i>C-Court Lady Choi.</i>

240
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,660
I knew it was strange.

241
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,170
<i>Is the food preparation going well?</i>

242
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,660
Ah, that, that! Head Chef!

243
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,620
I ruined it, I see.

244
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,180
It’s very unlike of you to ruin a dish! What’s happened to you?

245
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,710
Something happened, not to me, but to this country.

246
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,150
The lower provinces are in chaos.

247
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,980
The goods for the palace have not been delivered for days.

248
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,870
Head Chef!

249
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,350
I heard that there is a strange notice being put up in the streets.

250
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,690
The one who harmed the king are—

251
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,180
Who else but the Donghak followers would do such a thing?!

252
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,710
Those nasty!— Their seeds need to be dried up!—

253
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,670
Whose seeds are you going to dry up? Whose seeds?

254
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,530
Do you even know seeds? Do you, huh?

255
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,470
You just shut up. Tell me.

256
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,530
I've been wearing this too long. I am getting bored with it.

257
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,570
It's time to take it off, don't you think?

258
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,320
You can do it, right? You've worked under me for 10 years.

259
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,800
Pardon?

260
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,020
Where are you going? Who's going to prepare the food?

261
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,640
There are many in Joseon who can be Head Chef.

262
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,700
Ah, that...

263
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,330
Since two days ago, suspicious hand-written posters have been posted in the market places.

264
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,130
I'm told that it's about a rumor regarding the king.

265
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,810
That mere rumor is not a big issue here now.

266
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,820
As soon as the coronation ceremony is held, that will end it.

267
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,110
Right now, what we must worry about is

268
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,780
that signed pact list, which will determine our lifeline.

269
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,830
True, it's quite suspicious that Kim Byeong-in is nowhere to be seen lately.

270
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,180
The queen left to prepare for childbirth

271
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,040
and now Kim Byeong-in also disappeared?

272
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,420
Both the king's death and the queen's absence

273
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,360
somehow seem doubtful.

274
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,880
What if both of them are false?

275
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,570
Maybe the queen, who resisted because of the king's false death,

276
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,120
is hidden somewhere far from here,

277
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,880
and Kim Byeong-in took the side of the queen?

278
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,400
If so, Kim Byeong-in will use the signed pact

279
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,500
to crush the Kim family.

280
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,930
Gosh, it's so cold!

281
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,880
Is it cold?

282
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,130
This is embarrassing.

283
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,550
Oh, wait!

284
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,450
As soon as you left, the weather suddenly turned cold.

285
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,420
Maybe you felt cold because I wasn't with you.

286
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,820
I'm thankful for your overflowing love, My Queen.

287
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,800
<i>... Three, one!</i>

288
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,720
<i>One, two, three, two!</i>

289
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,030
<i>One, two, three, three!</i>

290
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,370
- Watch your movements!
- One, two, three, four!

291
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,480
Huh? That is...

292
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,200
It's the training method you taught us, My Queen.

293
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,460
That's why you made that military strategy book.

294
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,220
Who knew the king was really one of the Thieves of Donghak? <i>(T/N: Neo Confucian reformers) </i>

295
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,730
<i>...Three, four!</i>

296
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,020
<i>One, two, three...</i>

297
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,690
I made even these people unaware of that fact.

298
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,820
I just let them think that a big merchant was helping them since he had complaints against the country.

299
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,070
Why did you do such dangerous work?

300
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,910
If two parties share a common enemy, they can be allies for each other.

301
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:52,040
It's because those corrupted officials are our common enemies.

302
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,570
But isn't this too humble a number? Where are the other people?

303
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,780
If all of us stayed in one spot, we would be massacred.

304
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,060
Only when we carry out the attack, will we send the message and gather.

305
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,780
To be safe, we must live scattered at all other times.

306
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,690
- Are you the leader here?
- That's right.

307
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,690
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

308
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,680
<i>One, two, three, five!</i>

309
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,560
<i>One, two, three, six!</i>

310
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,190
<i>One, two, three, seven!</i>

311
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,940
Nice to meet you! The first impression you give off already suits you being the leader.

312
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,350
Especially the scar on your eye makes you look so brave. Nice to meet you.

313
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,200
In this place, just any man who has a long lifespan is the leader.

314
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,300
If the leader dies, the next person in line will become the leader.

315
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,160
So, the leader just means that person has survived the longest here.

316
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,880
If I die, over there,

317
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
that punk will become the next leader.

318
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,440
<i>One, two, three, ten!</i>

319
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,400
Such a young boy will be?

320
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,220
I heard of the connection between you and my Dam-hyang.

321
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,480
"My Dam-hyang"?

322
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,700
Wait, then perhaps you are...

323
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,820
He's Dam-hyang's father, whom we've been looking for.

324
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,000
That man who got hit in the eye with a pitchfork?

325
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,250
Wow, what a small world this is!

326
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,580
If it weren't for my Dam-hyang, this man would already have been dead by my hands.

327
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:08,070
I always said that I would slit the throat of the king who ruined this country to this state if I met him.

328
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,650
You should be thankful to your daughter,

329
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,030
since you almost died when you tried to kill me.

330
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,560
Well...

331
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,220
I shouldn't have saved your life. I should've cut your wrist with a straw cutter back then.

332
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,570
<i>One, two, three, ten!</i>

333
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,530
Until when should we do this one?

334
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,230
You should've moved on to the next step on your own!

335
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,880
Geez, I have to tell him everything from one to ten.

336
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,470
Dam-hyang had saved your life and now mine, too.

337
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,720
Since the king didn't give up on his people,

338
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,470
his people are now saving the king's life.

339
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:46,370
By the way, what about those soldiers who chased after me?

340
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,590
Most of these people were herb pickers, born and raised on this mountain,

341
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,490
so they know this area like the back of their hands.

342
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,550
In this area, those soldiers can't win against them.

343
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,080
What about that weird bastard with the goblin mask? Did you catch him?

344
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,950
A goblin mask...

345
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,170
Was that man after you, too?

346
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,760
That man tried to kill me.

347
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:13,380
To stop him... Kim Byeong-in also died.

348
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,020
That man with the mask

349
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,570
is Kim Jwa-geun's man.

350
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,410
So, Kim Jwa-geun must be back.

351
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,460
<i>One, two, three, seven! One, two, three, eight!</i>

352
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,330
<i>One, two three...</i>

353
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,230
<i>[One Day Before The Coronation]</i>

354
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,700
This is a "death note."

355
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,570
It means this is the list to be killed, allowing you to wipe out all the corrupted ministers.

356
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,000
Now, we just have to find a way to enter the palace.

357
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,900
If we gather all the rebel warriors who are now scattered all over the country, how many are there?

358
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,230
If from all over the country, maybe, about a thousand?

359
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,530
Only that?

360
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,420
What do you mean, only that? Do you think it's easy to risk your life?

361
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,390
But why did you spare the magistrate's life every time?

362
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,030
If you want to win the fight, you must strike the leader.

363
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,130
Do you think we're some blood-thirsty hyenas?

364
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:08,120
Even we, the lowly commoners, can make the higher-ups shake in fear, at least, if we unite!

365
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,370
That's what we needed to show, that's all.

366
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,270
Oh, so it was only for propaganda.

367
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,840
It was a good strategy, as you didn't give them any excuse to mobilize a huge scale of troops.

368
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,620
Even if we're ignorant,

369
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,530
we at least know that we will definitely lose when it comes to a proper battle.

370
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,400
The warriors newly recruited this time alone are already a thousand, though.

371
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,490
<i>You don't even recognize this righteous man, who came to risk his own life for the country's sake!</i>

372
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,020
Royal Head Chef?

373
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,400
<i>These people, seriously!</i>

374
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,850
Head Chef?

375
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,020
How can we trust the words from a man who worked in the palace?

376
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,580
Forget it! Forget it! I'll go back, then.

377
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,770
Here, untie me.

378
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,900
All right, I got it. I will untie it myself. What's wrong with your eyes there?

379
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,290
You look so much younger than me, yet you're talking to me without any honorifics.

380
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,690
Even if you beg me to stay, I won't!

381
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,460
Get out of my way!

382
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,630
Even if you came here as you pleased, you can't leave as you please.

383
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,990
Somehow this situation is very familiar.

384
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,020
Now you've seen all of our faces and know our basecamp is here,

385
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,450
do you think you can leave here alive?

386
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,760
Damn it...

387
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,960
<i>Head Chef!</i>

388
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,440
I must be dying, since now I'm hearing things!

389
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,960
<i>Hey, Man-bok!</i>

390
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,090
Your Majesty! How could you be here...

391
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,790
Your Majesty!

392
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,860
Head Chef!

393
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,620
Court Lady Choi!

394
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,590
Court Lady Choi! Court Lady Choi...

395
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,860
- Court Lady Choi!
- Head Chef!

396
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,060
What happened to you?

397
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,200
Who on earth did this to you?

398
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,330
- Ouch!
- Oh my gosh, what's this?

399
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,730
As expected... As expected from you, Court Lady Choi.

400
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,690
What brings you here, Head Chef?

401
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,260
I heard all the people who have complaints against the country are gathering,

403
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,010
so I asked around to find this place. But now I see

404
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,460
it's all of you who disappeared from the palace.

405
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,510
Did you have complaints against the country, too?

406
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,580
If you see what's going on in the palace, you will have complaints if you didn't have any before.

407
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,730
What's the situation in the palace right now?

408
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,100
Ah, yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:53,190
First, change your clothes. And cover your mouth when you sneeze, come on.

410
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,190
<i>[Tongmyeongjeon (Grand Queen Dowager's quarters)]</i>

411
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,190
Even 24 hours a day aren't enough to prepare tomorrow's coronation.

412
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,640
You're working so hard, Your Royal Highness.

413
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,400
By the way, why is that, the more you suppress those Thieves of Donghak, the more aggressive they become?

414
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,170
The rumors I'm hearing are serious.

415
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,030
When it comes to a fight, the more your opponent recoils,

416
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,260
the more they get angry, thinking they're justified.

417
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,100
Therefore, tramping on them even harder is the only way.

418
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,390
As soon as the coronation is over, I'll mobilize the troops and suppress them.

419
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,190
For a change, you're carrying a sword.

420
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,260
Does that mean even inside the palace there is danger?

421
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,660
This is the sword, gifted to me by Her Majesty the Queen.

422
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,030
The queen did?

423
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:49,790
In fact, I'm afraid that I have to give you regretful news this early in the morning.

424
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,660
Byeong-in gave up his life to protect the queen.

425
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,000
After all...

426
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,260
that foolishness, to risk everything for a momentary feeling

427
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,180
is the only demerit against youth.

428
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:10,030
And so? Is the queen alive?

429
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,630
Yes.

430
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,470
The one who saved the queen's life was the king.

431
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,590
So, in the end, both the king and the queen are alive?

432
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,500
Do I not have any talented people or are those two so greatly talented?

433
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,570
I'm sorry. So, tomorrow—

434
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:40,070
The other time, when we were planning to use the ice cubes with arsenic for the queen,

435
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,250
the king found out in advance and ran to her rescue.

436
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,560
I think...

437
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,830
there is a rat eavesdropping on our conversations.

438
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,950
Isn't she the nurse you gave me as a gift?

439
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,390
You made her blind and deaf yourself.

440
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,690
Because of this important task, I'm being overly sensitive about everything.

441
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,730
I understood what you meant.

442
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll move up the coronation as early as possible.

443
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:33,300
Please don't forget that you already lost to those two before.

444
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,120
In this fight,

445
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,820
I'm betting my life.

446
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,650
I have a good idea of how to get in.

447
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,410
You can surely get through the gates of the Hanyang fortress and can even get through the palace gates on the first try.

448
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,780
What is this novel idea you have?

449
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,840
Those higher-ups eat meals made with fresh ingredients every day.

450
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,850
How long do you think they'll last without them?

451
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,850
The Grand Queen Dowager already has a picky palate. She wouldn't last long.

452
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:18,890
Not that one! That one. That!

453
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:29,360
That's why, even if all the palace doors are sealed, there's one door that's not.

454
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,210
The door that lets the food in and out.

455
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,950
We will need information on the carts that deliver the royal tributes.

456
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,750
We have a system in the palace for receiving royal tributes.

457
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:48,360
More than 50 carts come to the royal kitchen daily.

458
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,520
Not only that, there are monthly deliveries

459
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,680
and once every four months, we--

460
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,950
Say it simply and to the point.

461
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,060
The total number of (kitchen) carts that will come in on the morning of the coronation is 62.

462
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,800
However, with the new emergency order,

463
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,590
all the tributes will be thoroughly searched.

464
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,980
But... there is one more cart that no one knows about...

465
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,710
Dosulli's secret cart.

466
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,650
Oh, right!

467
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,730
These are indeed our products. Let them in.

468
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,110
<i>According to the Head Chef, Dosulli's been "switching".</i>

469
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,890
- "Switching"?
- Yeah, since high-ranking people don't have my kind of perfect palate.

470
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,460
The highest quality products meant for the palace are "switched" with slightly lower quality products.

471
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,440
The cart that holds the replacement ingredients is...

472
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,340
Dosulli's secret cart.

473
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,040
There are only a few people who know about it.

474
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,480
Ah... as expected, it's not a palace, but a thieves' den.

475
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,200
My apologies, Your Majesty. I just took it as customary practice...

476
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,860
It's natural for there to be knotholes in a rotten tree.

477
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,440
Let's take advantage of this hole.

478
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,750
- Okay, everyone, let's gather our hands.
- Everyone?

479
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,700
Give me all your hands.

480
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,090
One, two, three, aja!

481
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,720
Aja! Aja.

482
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,830
Aja.

483
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,320
- Are you ready?
- Yes, let's go.

484
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,650
- Man-bok!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

485
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,580
Why did he change clothes again?

486
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,000
Thank you...

487
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,050
and I'm sorry.

488
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,760
You were very special to Kim So-yong, too.

489
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,070
I want to bury him myself.

490
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,880
Let's do that.

491
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,700
Rest in peace now.

492
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,520
Shall we go?

493
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,420
You may speak.

494
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,990
Her Majesty's childbirth preparation...

495
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:00,690
should be assisted by her mother. But since my situation is such,

496
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,580
I would like to help myself.

497
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,670
If you just tell me where she's lying-in, I will go there.

498
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:12,240
I am not telling you the queen's location for the safety of the royal child.

499
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,350
I am taking care of it without any problems, so do not worry.

500
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,730
This...

501
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,680
Is she really in a mid-wifery place?

502
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:48,780
Please, don't tell me you're still trying to harm the queen.

503
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,470
The queen ran away.

504
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,890
We are trying to protect her honor.

505
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:01,420
- Ran away?
- She probably believed that ridiculous rumor about the king being alive and left to look for him.

506
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:09,060
My apologies... but I would like to speak directly to Your Highness the Grand Dowager Queen.

507
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:13,430
Doing all this is not for our clan,

508
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,830
it's actually ruining our honor.

509
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,010
Don't you know how our clan will be talked about in future generations?

510
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,970
Do you think you have the right to say that?

511
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,970
I know at least what shame is now.

512
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:32,690
That shame is what makes it a sin.

513
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,930
If you did not feel ashamed, you would not have felt like you committed any wrongdoings.

514
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,570
If this isn't for the honor of our clan,

515
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,400
what exactly did you try to gain from harming the king?

516
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,500
What was it?

517
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,380
Until I myself let go,

518
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:52,030
my era shall never end.

519
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,800
So you can hear.

520
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,120
Tae Oh!

521
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,770
- Your Majesty.
- I see you're already here.

522
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,510
- Ah, my knees!
- Your Majesty.

523
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

524
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,330
You've done well staying alive all this time.

525
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:06,540
I'm glad that you're safe, Your Majesty.

526
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,270
Doesn't anyone have any tobacco?

527
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:11,560
Your Highness, the ground is cold.

528
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:20,540
At times like this, a cold beer would really do.

529
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,460
This place isn't even that great. Why'd we come all the way here?

530
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,470
This location is a safe place that hasn't been exposed to the outside.

531
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:33,250
You're right. There's no way for this place to even get exposed.

532
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,600
Oh, my legs.

533
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,010
- Not yet.
- This is enough!

534
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,990
This is our last chance. You should be prudent.

535
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,590
Now!

536
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,820
Wow!

537
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,240
Is it that tasty?

538
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,150
This...

539
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,510
Ah, yes...

540
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,920
Gosh!

541
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,050
It's so tasty.

542
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,680
Why are you suffering on purpose like this?

543
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,230
People like us have no choice since we are going to die anyway.

544
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,180
But you are in the top position in Joseon.

545
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,710
All you have to do is close your eyes

546
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,640
and your life will be easy, isn't that right?

547
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,480
To me, as well, living was at one time

548
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,680
just a hell to be endured.

549
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,200
I've endured it thinking about taking personal revenge

550
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,210
on those who killed my parents and siblings.

551
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,760
Then, I saw that Joseon was rotting away.

552
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,130
And inside, I saw the people who were groaning, too.

553
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,550
You are a king with great eyesight, I see.

554
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,540
I thought all those who lived inside the palace were blind.

555
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,790
If you succeed this time,

556
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:18,950
you are not going to end up becoming like them, are you?

557
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,080
Now...

558
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,250
I am dreaming of a new Joseon.

559
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,850
- You said it's called "voting," right?
- What?

560
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,640
You know, the people choosing the king themselves.

561
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,570
Yes, voting.

562
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:42,490
Although it doesn't make the world perfect.

563
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,820
No... it is perfect just with that!

564
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,700
Since it can be changed again if things don't go right.

565
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,580
Well, it looks like this king and queen have gone crazy as a pair.

566
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,900
All right! Everyone, get to bed early. There's a big job ahead.

567
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,780
Sleep well.

568
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,860
If you really came from the future,

569
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,880
you would also know the ending to this fight. Right?

570
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,200
What happens?

571
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,520
You will lose.

572
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,620
But I am going to put my everything on you.

573
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,120
Aren't you usually on the side that wins?

574
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,770
It's okay. This life is ruined anyway.

575
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,830
Even if I put in everything, there really isn't much.

576
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,440
You put all your eggs on me, is that right?

577
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,150
That's right. All-in. I went all-in on you.

578
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:02,330
Then, I will do my best even if I fail.

579
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,400
Until even fate will be tired of me.

580
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,690
I won't go down easy.

581
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,310
Tied down here,

582
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,290
I can't be of any help to His Majesty.

583
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,250
Do you think Her Majesty met His Majesty?

584
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:40,000
Even if she did, what could just the two of them accomplish?

585
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,030
Inside here,

586
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,890
is there any way we can stop the coronation...

587
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,210
How about if we use Kim Hwan?!

588
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,210
Sir!

589
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,490
You are here again?

590
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,920
I packed some things and brought them.

591
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,900
This is?

592
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:19,110
I am also collecting petitions to get you two out.

593
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:24,030
But is there anything else that I can do to really help?

594
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,450
- Help?
- Tell me. Whatever it is.

595
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,880
- Anything?
- Yes.

596
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,960
For you, there isn't anything I can't do.

597
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,570
How can a person...

598
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,530
be so naive!

599
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,870
Is it your business to go around feeding swindlers?

600
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:53,110
How could you be so naive?!

601
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,440
I was wrong.

602
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,260
- What did you do wrong?
- I don't know, but...

603
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,560
if you let me know, I will never do it again.

604
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,910
What you did wrong was...

605
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,620
trusting someone like me.

606
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,170
I falsely befriended you in order to get information.

607
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,250
You had no idea and...

608
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,870
what is all this?

609
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,050
It's all right.

610
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,390
So, are you saying that you have not been seeing me as a friend?

611
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,510
That's right.

612
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,190
I never, even for a moment,

613
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,620
thought of you as my friend.

614
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,310
So don't ever come and see me again.

615
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,060
Why do you look at me like that?

616
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,470
Are you trying to blame me for

617
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,990
not using him more?

618
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,470
It's not that I saw...

619
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:37,110
It's more like this unsightly happening occurred in front of my eyes.

620
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,800
You must've been very tired.

621
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:57,970
<i>It's not watered down</i>

622
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,980
<i>and it's been mixed with soju! (Korean alcoholic beverage).</i>

623
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,920
<i>The golden ratio of soju and beer!</i>

624
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,380
It looks like you are having a good dream.

625
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,750
It's a relief.

626
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,330
What kind of dream did you have that you are?

627
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:43,500
The king's portrait was burning up.

628
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:48,200
That fire was engulfing the entire Seonwonjeon.
<i>(Royal ancestral shrine with past kings' portraits)</i>

629
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,570
I was trapped alone in there...

630
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:53,310
In that fire...

631
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,460
Today is a very important day so even a single drop shouldn't be wasted.

632
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,690
Get me ready perfectly.

633
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:57,140
<i>[Coronation Day]</i>

634
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:13,660
We've enforced the emergency order once again today for your safety.

635
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,350
Other than soldiers, no one is allowed to move about inside the palace.

636
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:19,250
Yes.

637
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:24,780
Of course, musicians weren't summoned and even the royal relatives were not invited, so proceed with the ceremony quietly.

638
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,170
The clan members weren't either?

639
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,070
It's safer that way.

640
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,900
But—

641
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,480
My advice is correct.

642
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,100
I understand.

643
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:56,060
Your Majesty, aren't you scared?

644
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,790
Don't worry. When I sometimes ran into Taoists on the streets,

645
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:02,560
they would tell me that I was well-favored by my ancestors.

646
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,480
This time, I might as well benefit from that favor.

647
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:12,470
Your Majesty, today of all days, you seem the most like a queen.

648
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:20,550
Don't get all emotional. You're making it seem like this is the end when it's just the start.

649
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,010
You're right, Your Majesty.

650
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,850
I'll see you in the palace tonight.

651
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,880
Okay. I'll be off.

652
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,610
Don't die.

653
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:44,540
What's so good about living?

654
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:49,430
Even if it's miserable and pathetic, live a long life.

655
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:56,650
If you succeed, I'll cast that vote thing for you.

656
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,880
Thank you.

657
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:05,040
Shall we go?

658
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,460
It's time to go back home.

659
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:12,830
Sinner Lee Yeong-pyeong concealed the identity of the Donghak followers who plotted treason.

660
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:16,270
It is ordered that he is to be stripped of his title and exiled to Chuja Island.

661
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:19,720
Also, sinner Byeolgam Hong committed the sin of being careless with gun storage.

662
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:24,870
He is ordered to work as a government slave in the Personnel Clerk's Office of the Ganghwa local government for 600 days.

663
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,850
As soon as the coronation ceremony is over, the sentences will be carried out immediately.

664
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:43,410
Since there weren't any achievements to be written about the king, I had a hard time.

665
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:51,570
Is it right to laugh heartily showing your teeth when the royal funeral is not even over yet?

666
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,080
I apologize.

667
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:59,570
Finishing up the coronation quietly today

668
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,580
rests in your hands.

669
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:08,750
Yes, I will do it so that the empty position of the Minister of Defense is not felt.

670
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:16,610
However, when does Kim Byeong-in plan to return to the palace?

671
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:20,240
It seems you're very curious about his whereabouts.

672
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,210
Everyone is concerned about it.

673
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:26,100
Don't worry about it, I'm taking care of it.

674
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,170
I understand. Yes, yes.

675
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:33,030
This day forward, the king and the Pungan Jo Clan...

676
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,280
are all my puppets.

677
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,190
Mister, I will pay double, to the palace.

678
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,180
Double.

679
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:15,500
Mister, we're nice people.

680
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:23,950
But if the guards or whoever gets suspicious and catches on, then we can be very bad people.

681
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:29,580
Forget those theories of fundamental human nature being good or bad. It all depends on the person you are dealing with. Okay?

682
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:32,390
Be natural. Natural, okay?

683
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,850
Okay.

684
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,840
Let's go.

685
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,440
I'm uncomfortable, move over.

686
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,020
Like this?

687
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,940
Is this your elbow?

688
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,950
Stop stabbing me.

689
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:17,880
If you press against my stomach like that—

690
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,450
Gosh.

691
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,710
Move a little.

692
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:31,210
Goodness.

693
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,610
Now I can see a little.

694
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,630
Here?

695
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,070
This isn't the time for that.

696
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:52,090
You're right. We should come to our senses.

697
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:55,150
What would you have done if you had to hide with your bodyguard?

698
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,320
Why would you say something like that?

699
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,570
Move, let's find a different position.

700
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,180
Gosh.

701
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:18,290
Now I'm a bit more comfortable.

702
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:23,070
I also like this position the best.

703
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:37,070
We'll get caught by the sound of your heartbeat. Why are you so scared?

704
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:39,970
It's not just my heartbeat.

705
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:56,600
Also, it's not because I'm scared. It's because of you, My Queen.

706
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:05,630
Me too. It's not like that because I'm scared.

707
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,350
It's a gift from Great Britain.

708
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:35,290
It's way stronger and quicker.

709
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,370
If the king happens to show up at the palace,

710
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:45,480
aim for his heart.

711
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:09,260
Are they new workers?

712
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,530
Yes, that's right.

713
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:12,100
Yes.

714
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,650
All right, go on.

715
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,420
Halt right there!

716
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:48,020
Search it!

717
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,960
There's nothing wrong.

718
