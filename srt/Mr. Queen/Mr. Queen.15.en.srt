This little one hasn't done anything wrong!

<i>The smell of alcohol and a strange fragrance...</i>

12
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,980
<i>She didn't drink poison.</i>

13
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,850
With these tiny hands,

14
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,570
how could you make her drink poison?

15
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,040
<i>Her hands are warm. She's alive!</i>

16
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,380
It can't be!

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,590
Dam-hyang!

18
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,870
Goodness...

19
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,980
- Sir.
- You're here.

20
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,780
Here you go.

21
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,470
We can't just dump her on the mountain.

22
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,560
I will only be comfortable holding a funeral for her.

23
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,670
There.

24
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,910
- Then farewell..
- Farewell.

25
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,420
What happened to Dam-hyang? She's all right, isn't she?

26
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,530
She probably has made it safely out of the palace by now.

27
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,820
I've petitioned for her mother to be released as a government slave,

28
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,620
so that they can live together away from Hanyang.

29
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,840
She's going to meet up with her mother!

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,770
She was so worried that her mother only had four fingernails...

31
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,890
I'm so happy for her! It's great!

32
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,680
How did you do it? Did you use sleeping medicine?

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,770
I made her drink a paralytic concoction.

34
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,940
Oh, the thing that Great Physician, Hua Ta, used during surgery?

35
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,320
You know about it?

36
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,630
Of course, I do. I watched "Three Kingdoms for Children" many times.

37
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,040
Three Kingdoms for...?

38
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,320
But you should have told me your plan sooner.

39
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,900
It was an urgent situation and too dangerous for many to know.

40
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,340
Did you receive news from Byeolgam Hong?

41
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,950
Yes, Sire. The child escaped safely.

42
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,360
Great job.

43
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,410
Putting your life at risk to save one servant was reckless.

44
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,280
She's not just a servant.

45
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,960
If I were to give up on that child,

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,210
it would become too easy giving up 10 or 100,

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,550
or all my subjects in the future.

48
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,010
<i> Cheoljong... Here, I thought he was just an idiot.</i>

49
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,460
<i>He's a total idiot!</i>

50
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,630
Don't think such amazing thoughts. You won't live long.

51
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,240
It's not my goal to live a long, shameful life.

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,710
Those are some great values that will help shorten your lifespan!

53
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,850
- Who do you think would do this—
- She's saying "thank you."

54
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,640
Her words are vastly different from those of others.

55
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,450
The Queen's Dictionary is useless! How full it is with your liberal and incorrect translations!

56
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,730
- Did you see it?
- You put it there for me to see.

57
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,150
By the way, was the queen's position always this dangerous?

58
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,370
Why is everyone out to get me?

59
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,510
I will make sure something like this doesn't happen again.

60
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,710
No, I'm going to do it my way.

61
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,640
The best defense is to attack.

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,860
<i>From today on, the crazy bitch in this palace is me.</i>

63
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,020
<i>[Episode 15: Crazy in the Zone]</i>

64
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,320
Did you try to get rid of the queen?

65
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,400
The queen is the king's person.

66
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,850
She handed over her clan's embarrassment and weakness to the king.

67
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,960
She fell for the king and turned her back on her own clan.

68
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,240
There is no way that's possible.

69
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,560
I know you don't want to believe it.

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,140
The fact that the queen you worship so much

71
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,720
is just a foolish woman who struggles with the love for a man.

72
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,750
Ever since the moment I stepped into this house,

73
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,400
I have done everything possible to receive recognition from you, Father.

74
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,460
It wasn't only so I could remain in this household.

75
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,990
I wanted to be like you

76
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,610
and respect you.

77
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,910
However, the moment you tried to harm the queen,

78
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,030
you were no longer my father.

79
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,140
Whoever tries to lay a hand on the queen,

80
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,990
will lose their life.

81
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,810
Return home whenever you wish.

82
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,610
Even if you do not see me as a father,

83
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,730
to me, you will always be my son.

84
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,610
<i>Who could it be? The person who hid the ledger in Daejojeon.</i>

85
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,340
<i>The most likely candidates are these two people who hold a grudge against me, although I've done nothing against them.</i>

86
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,560
<i>Queen Dowager Jo and Jo Hwa-jin.</i>

87
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,890
<i>In terms of motive, Jo Hwa-jin is likely to be the culprit.</i>

88
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,590
Thinking of her vigor during Surit-nal, it's undoubtedly her.

89
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,200
But Jo Hwa-jin hasn't come to Daejojeon lately at all.

90
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,280
Thinking of movement, then the culprit should be Queen Dowager Jo.

91
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,540
<i>Here...</i>

92
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,370
It's suspicious that she has recently visited me more frequently than ever.

93
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,460
And for sure, Queen Dowager Jo also has a clear motive.

94
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,480
Then indeed, is it Queen Dowager Jo? What a racoon-like...

95
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,620
If so, how could that ledger possibly fall into Queen Dowager Jo's hands?

96
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,270
That is the mystery.

97
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,010
By the way, what is this ledger exactly?

98
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,800
I didn't hold any shamanistic ritual today, though.

99
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,130
I apologize for my ill manners the other day.

100
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,220
I don't think you lower your head for no reason.

101
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,730
What is the reason?

102
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,750
As expected, Your Highness the Queen Dowager

103
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,840
catches on quickly.

104
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,170
I thank you for agreeing to come to this difficult meeting.

105
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,600
You might have realized based on today's events,

106
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,130
now is the time to save the noble class first, rather than your own family clan.

107
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,660
If you don't have lips, your teeth will suffer.
<i>(T/N: meaning the inseparable relationship of two parties)</i>

108
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,210
If any one of these two families gets ruined,

109
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,100
it won't be easy for the other to be intact either.

110
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,820
Therefore, I'd like to suggest "Grand Pardons"

111
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,990
for the promise of concord between our two families.
- Grand Pardons?

112
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,170
Both clans have many family members with talent

113
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,860
who lost their governmental posts just because of some momentary mistakes.

114
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,680
So, with "Grand Pardons,"

115
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,460
we are going to pardon those talents' crimes.

116
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,440
So, it's a kind of token to signify the promise as well as a congratulatory gift.

117
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,400
What do you think?

118
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,010
Would you like to come together?

119
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,090
<i>Although it was the Minister of Military who committed the embezzlement single-handedly, </i>

120
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,780
<i>I can't say that my sin not to control him properly is small either. </i>

121
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,190
<i>Therefore, I, your humble subject, Kim Jwa-geun, </i>

122
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,400
<i>is requesting your approval to allow me to resign from being General of Military Training...</i>

123
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,850
This is not the end for me.

124
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,460
As long as I am alive.

125
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,990
Eat slowly.

126
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,070
Are these side dishes enough for you?

127
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,160
If I were shameful, the food shouldn't be going down this easily.

128
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,650
Why on earth did you run away?

129
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm sure that I provided for you plenty during your time here.

130
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,070
That's because—

131
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,110
Mother?

132
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,890
Mother.

133
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:19,410
You did well, my Dam-hyang. You did well.

134
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,030
Mother.

135
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,910
It's all right.

136
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
It's all right.

137
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,590
We should at least do our best and smile,

138
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,900
so Her Majesty won't be sad endlessly.

139
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,680
Yes.

140
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:12,170
<i>Your Majesty, it's time to wake up.</i>

141
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,400
Your Majesty.

142
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,170
Were you not able to sleep at all?

143
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,930
What will we do if your body falls ill?

144
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,750
I had too many thoughts so I wasn't able to sleep.

145
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,100
By the way, they probably slept well right?

146
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,580
Who are you referring to?

147
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,290
The people who threw such big shit my way.

148
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,150
Last night will be the last time they sleep in peace.

149
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,600
So I hope they slept well.

150
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,610
- Court Lady Choi.
- Yes.

151
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,120
Send someone to my father and tell him I want to see him here.

152
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

153
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:16,030
<i>Your Majesty, your father is here.</i>

154
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,900
Already?

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,250
I was just about to go find you.

156
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,030
I see you came to me instead.

157
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

158
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,920
I came to see you on my own.

159
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,620
- Last time—
- Last time—

160
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,420
Oh, you first.

161
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,990
- No, no you first, Your Majesty.
- No, Father, you speak first.

162
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,750
- I apologize for last time.
- I apologize for last time.

163
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,330
- No, no, I'm sorry.
- No, no, I'm sorry. It's all right.

164
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,200
They say you can't deceive your own blood.

165
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,000
You're right.

166
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,780
I—

167
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,090
The reason I wanted to see you... is because of the ledger.

168
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,870
You knew?

169
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,530
Everyone seems to be freaking out because of it. What kind of ledger is it?

170
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,420
The wrongful actions of our clan are recorded in there.

171
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,160
<i>The Ansong family's records. That's why Cheoljong was trying to retrieve it.</i>

172
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,310
I also came to talk to you about the ledger.

173
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,770
The ledger disappeared during your stay with the king.

174
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,310
I have been suspecting the king thus far.

175
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,560
However, recently one of my trusted servants ran away from home.

176
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,330
Thankfully he was caught and when I asked him why he ran away he said

177
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,950
the night before the ledger disappeared, he let Eui Bin into the house.

178
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,870
As our whole house was being flipped upside down,

179
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,260
he ran away thinking some kind of trouble happened so I only just recently found out.

180
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,600
I apologize, Your Majesty.

181
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,870
This isn't something you need to apologize for, Father.

182
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,320
Now I see,

183
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,410
the puzzle is complete.

184
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,400
I'm sorry?

185
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,070
<i>Sister Sunwon (Grand Queen Dowager), who personally f***ed me over. </i>

186
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,920
<i>Today, I prepared ice more valuable than gold. </i>

187
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,460
<i>Queen Dowager Jo, who got around to f***ing me over. </i>

188
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,810
<i>- I will serve you soon—
- I need to try it now.</i>

189
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,250
<i>And Jo Hwa-jin, who made this all very f***ed-up. </i>

190
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,260
<i>You tell the king yourself.</i>

191
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,140
<i>Is that a threat?</i>

192
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,490
<i>I completely understand</i>

193
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,980
<i>what you want. </i>

194
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:22,620
Father, there's somewhere I need to go.

195
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,670
Where?

196
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,890
To open up the gates of hell.

197
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,570
<i>I'll show you all</i>

198
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,790
<i>exactly who you messed with. </i>

199
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,700
My daughter, who used to be like a sika deer.

200
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,530
How could she change this much when she hasn't even been that long in the palace?

201
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,380
I know they say that parents don't know their child,

202
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,640
but a sika deer?

203
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,690
If you had to compare her to an animal it should be a wild horse.

204
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,200
My daughter is a wild horse?

205
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,980
<i> A Māori clan tattoo, a peacock feather,</i>

206
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,910
<i>and a Devil wearing Prada.</i>

207
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,440
<i>Things that are strong are beautiful.</i>

208
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,490
<i> Today, I am wearing the world's most beautiful battle armor.</i>

209
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,360
How is it?

210
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:43,050
I like it. Revenge is fun when it's glamorous.

211
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,180
<i>[Round 1]</i>

212
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,090
What do you think you're doing right now?

213
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,200
Not everything is as it seems.

214
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,390
If you want to know what's inside, you must cut the stomach in half.

215
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,400
I thought it was a potato as it seemed,

216
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,290
but you completely deceived me.

217
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,330
It's not right to cut it open blindly without trust, is it?

218
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,090
You should first check whether it's a potato or a sweet potato before cutting it open.

219
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,560
Now, you can never restore it, can you?

220
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,050
<i>Here is the beverage, Your Majesty.</i>

221
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,350
The reason why I prepared this brunch today is

222
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,650
because I'd like to return the precious thing

223
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,050
that Your Royal Highness bestowed on me.

224
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,170
How nice the taste of the beverage was, from last time!

225
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,070
It was so nice you wouldn't have noticed even if the person next to you died while drinking it together.

226
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,980
Please try it.

227
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,330
I'm not thirsty though.

228
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,850
Considering my effort to prepare it, why don't you at least taste it?

229
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,600
I said I don't want to!

230
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,000
I've gone through a lot to prepare it, though.

231
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,030
Well, if you say so...

232
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,280
Indeed, ice tastes the best when I crush it with my teeth.

233
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,530
I told you before,

234
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,950
that I would help you every day so that you can stay young and healthy for all your life.

235
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,220
I'm thinking to keep doing my best going forward.

236
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,000
When one begins to suspect everything, including food, drinks, and cosmetics,

237
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,090
her life will become like hell soon, you know.

238
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,440
Since your husband started his own rule, you're now acting up, trusting in his power.

239
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,710
Do you think your position as queen is still safe when you turn your back on your clan?

240
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,190
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager,

241
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,350
neither the clan nor my husband is what I'm trusting.

242
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,710
I'm acting up because I'm trusting myself.

243
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,280
- Ah, that's right, Head Eunuch.
- Yes, Your Majesty?

244
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,740
For a while, I've neglected my work to focus my study on producing my heir.

245
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,270
How neglectful I've been in my king's role.

246
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,610
So, hurry up and go report back.

247
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:23,110
R-Report back... Your Majesty, to whom are you referring to...

248
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,330
You know... the person you always go report back to.

249
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:35,210
Oh, you bastard! You know what your sin is!

250
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,400
Your Majesty! I've committed a grave sin, please kill me.

251
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,300
What's wrong with you? I wasn't talking to you.

252
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,310
Now, my life is yours, Your Majesty.

253
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,280
I don't need such a thing. Where could I possibly use your life?

254
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,200
Please... Please kill me, Your Majesty.

255
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,100
Oh, dear! I told you, I don't need it.

256
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,340
Head Eunuch, what else can you possibly do? You had to do whatever your superior ordered you to do.

257
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,870
Please, I'd rather you get angry at me, Your Majesty.

258
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,500
You're scarier this way...

259
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,240
With such a weak nerve, what kind of spy can you be?

260
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,060
I have to stop by somewhere before the council meeting.

261
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,140
Head Eunuch, go to Injeongjeon first.
<i> (The Great Throne Hall)</i>

262
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,360
Oh, dear! Read that kind of thing secretly. Our dear Head Eunuch was so shocked.

263
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,020
<i>[Round 2]</i>

264
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,450
Have you been well overnight?

265
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,810
Do you think that's the proper attitude to greet an elder with?

266
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:21,690
Since the accessories on my hairpiece are so heavy, I can't lower my head.

267
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,980
This is a sacred place where we hold rituals for previous kings.

268
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,540
What I'm saying is that it's a discourtesy to come here donning such extravagant style.

269
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,220
If you want to get a refund, you should dress up as much as possible. That's the common rule.

270
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:41,550
Oh my, look at me! I forgot to light incense for the former king.

271
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,750
Dear me, smearing my certificate from Cheonghak Manner School...

272
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,820
Please stop.

273
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,800
I usually follow Confucianism thoroughly,

274
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,580
so I can't help myself if I'm not following the protocol of manners.

275
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,470
I told you, don't touch it—

276
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,680
There is an item you left behind in my room.

277
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,900
You frequently visited me without notice and invaded my privacy,

278
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,350
but ultimately, that was the reason.

279
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,820
What are you doing now?

280
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,050
I told you, getting a refund.

281
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,630
I should return the big f*** I received.

282
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,050
Where did you learn this kind of ill manners?

283
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:30,330
You recklessly slander your elder and talk back at every word.

284
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,270
You were always arrogant, but today you are even worse!

285
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,280
Indeed, you can't hide the fact that you grew up without a mother, is that it?

286
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,240
What the... Mother-in-Law!

287
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,700
If I'm mannerless because I grew up without a mother,

288
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,310
then are you mannerless because you're living without any children, Old Woman?

289
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,840
Gosh, it's hot!

290
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,650
Ah, I was too pissed off to endure those hot things.

291
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,150
I almost burned up that royal portrait of your dear son.

292
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,010
My Queen! You've gone crazy!

293
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,530
Of course, I've gone crazy. Very much, at that.

294
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,310
Among all these crazy bitches, I think I'm the craziest one.

295
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,780
So, you'd better watch out.

296
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,060
If you touch even a single hair of mine...

297
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,590
you will never be able to see your son's face again.

298
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,140
It's not the queen I should worry about, but other people.

299
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,630
The best defense is to attack, she said.

300
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,470
<i>[Round 3]</i>
Aigoo, I didn't see our dear Eui Bin there.

301
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,900
How dim your presence is.

302
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,440
I'm going to skip stones. Will you join me?

303
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,700
You can enjoy it by yourself.

304
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:57,110
The ledger. I know you took it.

305
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,470
Thanks to that ledger, I almost died too.

306
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,220
Tell me.

307
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,730
Is that what you want?

308
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,510
Did you really not kill Oh-wol?

309
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,170
No matter what I say, you only believe whatever you want to believe.

310
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,180
You believe I'm trying to steal the king from you and I killed Oh-wol and put her body in the well.

311
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,310
Only then, I'll be the evil bitch who deserves to die.

312
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,160
Because you're the kind and pitiful victim, right?

313
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:38,980
This is why cosplaying a victim is scary, because you don't even realize... you're becoming a monster.

314
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,200
Look in the mirror and see how hideous you are.

315
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:25,340
Grab me yourself and pull yourself up, because I'm not in a generous mood right now.

316
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,600
When I fell into the lake in front of your eyes,

317
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:54,170
maybe you could've grabbed me too, don't you think?

318
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,590
With this, I've proved that I'm a better person than you are.

319
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:15,050
<i> Translation and Timing Carefully Crafted

320
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,060
Kim Jwa-geun, the former General of Military Training,
<i>[Appeal for Resignation - Kim Jwa-geun]</i>

321
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,020
resigned himself?

322
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

323
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,980
The process of his impeachment was getting delayed, so I was just about to hold all you ministers responsible for it.

324
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,150
What a shame... (I didn't get to do that).

325
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,400
Oh dear, that was a slip of my tongue. I was going to say, "What a relief."

326
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,700
- The next agenda item is—
- Today, there is something I must proclaim in front of you.

327
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,890
I'm making a government office to set the disorder of the three major tax systems right. <i>(Land/Military duty/Government loans)</i>

328
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,300
Its name will be Office of Correction for the Three Taxes.

329
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,160
Office of Correction for the Three Taxes?

330
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,520
It will make the law relevant to this issue and prepare the solution to correct the fundamental problems.

331
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,770
Its role will be to straighten out the three major tax systems.

332
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,820
Joseon is a country where people live off agriculture. Farmers must survive first for the country to survive.

333
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,360
Therefore, a local government official's exploitation of them is an act that ruins this country.

334
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,940
So going forward, that will be punished as severely as treason.

335
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,030
We must be cautious when we install a new kind of government office.

336
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,450
So, first, after listening to our thoughts, the ministers—

337
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,360
When we carry out a rightful deed, there shouldn't be any compromise.

338
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,680
What I'm saying is that I will no longer try to please you ministers.

339
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,840
In addition, my ancestor, King Sunjong's name will be

340
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,620
promoted to King Sunjo, following the rule of <i>"Jo for contribution and Jong for virtue."</i>

341
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,500
Today of all days, the king is very aggressive.

342
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,850
Your Majesty, today there is a new appointment to be announced.

343
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:24,620
Royal Secretary, your tongue also slipped. It should be "the suggestion of appointment."

344
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,070
The seat of Minister of Military is vacant now,

345
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,560
but the crisis in military power can be led to the crisis in the country.

346
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,940
Therefore, we've confirmed this appointment urgently through the emergency committee.

347
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,950
Minister of Military, enter the room.

348
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:09,800
I, Kim Byeong-in, Minister of the Military, greet Your Majesty.

349
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,580
What's scary about Kim Byeong-in is that he can even embrace the Jo family.

350
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,010
Numerous appeals to demanding the Grand Pardons are pouring in from both families.

351
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,710
That must also be Kim Byeong-in's action.

352
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,950
It won't be easy to ignore so many appeals like those, eh?

353
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,630
If it goes wrong, this might give an excuse to the entire noble community to protest.

354
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,480
Since your own rule began, we can do what we wanted to do,

355
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,280
but it's still hard to stop what we don't like.

356
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,680
It's true that the best defense is to attack.

357
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,930
Now, the key is who will make a faster and more fatal attack, rather than keeping in check.

358
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,870
We don't have time to find the right people.

359
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,480
For the Director of Office of Correction for the Three Taxes, Brother, please take that position.

360
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,720
Officer Hong, you should take the role of the royal inspector, specially appointed by me

361
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,570
and travel around investigating the three provinces where the public unrest is.

362
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,550
So, it's a business trip to the countryside again.

363
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,250
Please do your best.

364
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,180
Why is it that you two are more often staying in the palace ordering me around with your words

365
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,980
while I'm running around by myself. Is it just me feeling that?

366
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,460
What do you mean, by yourself? Always, my thoughts are with—

367
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,560
Once your mission as the royal inspector is completed, a vacation might—

368
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,360
I'll work on the preparations for the business trip.

369
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,360
M-Might be... I said a vacation might be given to you.

370
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,990
I'm sure that he didn't hear the rest of the sentence.

371
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,540
How foolish he is...

372
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,930
Your... Majesty... The queen... letter...

373
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,320
I'm not going to bite you, come over here.

374
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:10,830
H-Her Majesty the Q-Queen sent a letter.

375
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,830
Are you not feeling well?

376
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,000
You're too weak...

377
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,370
The thing called revenge is... I thought it would feel as if a burden would be lifted off.

378
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,290
But it really feels like that. So thrilling!

379
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,870
His Majesty the King arri—

380
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,670
You're here?

381
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,050
You look especially glamorous today. This style also suits you well.

382
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,520
At first, fashion isn't complete until the face is done. Now, whatever it is I'm wearing, it suits me well.

383
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,380
Who knew that even the body of a queen would look good on me.

384
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,250
I really can't get used to this.

385
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,990
The reason I wanted to see you was...

386
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,660
to form an alliance.

387
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,930
My clan must have abandoned me, thinking we're already allies anyway.

388
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,550
So, I have nothing to lose here, do I?

389
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,830
Becoming my ally means that you will become the Kim family's enemy.

390
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,060
Since my clan abandoned me first,

391
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,490
now it's my turn to abandon them.

392
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,960
If we share the same enemy, aren't we allies?

393

394
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,950
♫ <i>Don't think anything else, but just listen to this</i> ♫

395

♫ <i>I'm Patrasche who can eat only by running crazy in this life</i> ♫

396
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,900
So be it.

397
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,790
From now on, you and are no longer in a "no touch" situation.

398
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,150
Okay, from now on, "no touch" is forbidden.

399
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,330
♫ <i>For the goal, ye, run like a rabbit, so hurry, to me</i> ♫

400
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,190
According to martial arts movies, they usually put drops of their blood in alcohol and drink together.

401
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,600
But in this era, such an unhygienic method is a bit of a no-no,

402
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,630
so let's just drink tea and share the camaraderie of allies, simple and pure.

403

♫ <i>If I change, the world will change too</i> ♫

405
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,120
- This is... the camaraderie of allies?
- Yup.

406
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,630
This is how it's usually done. Bottoms up!

407
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,270
Oh, well...

408
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,390
♫ <i>Even if you fall, don't settle, stand up again</i> ♫

409
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,310
Now we've formed an alliance, so let's get rid of some bothersome questions before moving on.

410
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,600
Why did you try to kill me?

411
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,830
You're right.

412
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,080
As this is a matter we must discuss one day.

413
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,400
I thought you eavesdropped on our discussion about assassinating your father.

414
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,970
Even so, how could you... He's your father-in-law.

415
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,070
To me, he was just one of the corrupted people.

416
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:11,400
What a heartless bastard. But then again, it's not surprising since you were trying to kill your wife, too.

417
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,870
You're a serious killer of your wife's family.

418
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm sorry.

419
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,000
Although these excuses seem meaningless now,

420
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,220
there were many misunderstandings and circumstances.

421
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,020
Okay.

422
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,380
Then, you now owe me one. Until you pay me back that debt, you're not forgiven.

423
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,550
So what are you trying to do? Strengthen royal authority?

424
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,820
Royal authority is just a tool to fix this broken country of Joseon.

425
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,980
I believe that the world never changes fundamentally.

426
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,830
So, to be honest, I like your tool more than your goal.

427
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,340
If your royal authority is strengthened, I'll become more powerful, too,

428
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,810
and then they won't be able to touch me as they please.

429
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,300
I'm well aware of the fear that the threat of death causes.

430
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,830
Although you pretend to be strong, in fact, I'm sure you're afraid.

431
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,080
I don't know... Maybe it's because I already died once,

432
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,930
but I hate getting stepped on more than dying.

433
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:08,790
As long as I can chew and shred those shoes which are trying to stomp me to death,

434
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,520
even if I have to die, I will probably die smiling.

435
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,230
Your Majesty, it's time to cook a meal for Grand Queen Dowager.

436
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,950
Oh, in the same vein,

437
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm taking my leave to go chew.

438
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,560
<i>I will die smiling.</i>

439
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,880
Die smiling...

440
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,170
My Lord, My Queen's father.

441
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,360
Oh, oh, Byeong-in.

442
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,500
No, our dear Lord Minister of the Military.

443
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,760
- Are you teasing me?
- No way, how could I?

444
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,880
Please call me comfortably as you always do.

445
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,330
To be honest, I've waited for you,

446
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,690
as there is something to tell you about the queen, my So-yong.

447
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,840
I also have something to tell you regarding Her Majesty the Queen.

448
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,720
Where did I put it?

449
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,160
Where is it?

450
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,520
I saw it.

451
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,320
You rascal!

452
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,930
You haven't worked in this royal kitchen long. How dare you use that knife already!

453
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,250
Well, we didn't behave like that when we were young.

454
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,800
These days, even if I ask the young cooks to go for a drink after work,

455
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,350
they are always running away, saying they don't want to.

456
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,460
Geez, why do they hate drinking with me when I'm buying for them?

457
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,760
I feel the same, I can't really understand the young palace maids these days either.

458
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,880
When I tell them to come about 2 hours late, they really come 2 hours late.

459
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,510
Oh, dear! They should've come at least 15 minutes earlier.

460
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,780
- Those young kids these days...
- Those young kids these days...

461
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,740
To Tongmyeongjeong.
<i> (Grand Queen Dowager's quarters)</i>

462
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,480
What the... There is one more revenge match left.

463
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,600
Revenge pancake?
<i>(Both "match" and "pancake" share same phonetic word - "jeon")</i>

464
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,810
<i>It would be better to pay back in kind, wouldn't it?</i>

465
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,860
<i>A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye, and a eunuch for a eunuch...</i>

466
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,300
Then... Bracken? Job's tears?
<i>(T/N: Traditionally thought to decrease virility) </i>

467
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,400
Bracken and Job's tears... This pancake uses a lot of ingredients that are good for health.

468
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,020
<i>But by feeding them, what time will it be done? That's a long term plan taking too much time. </i>

469
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,690
Let's go wild.

470
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,580
Castration.

471
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:22,510
Castration? I've never heard of such an ingredi—

472
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,940
Ah, castration. Using such a rare ingredient...

473
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,380
I didn't come to burden you.

474
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,630
I am a man who knows how to give up.

475
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,150
I'm sorry.

476
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,180
Don't be, please.

477
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,730
For the last time, may I ask you one thing?

478
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,590
- Yes.
- My Lady, why...

479
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,580
why do you not like a man with ambition?

480
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:00,600
While living in the palace, I've known too many men with ambition,

481
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,320
and even the difficult end those men had.

482
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,860
I find that scary and undesirable.

483
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,320
Thank you for answering my question.

484
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,530
If I can dare to wish something for you, My Lady,

485
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,080
I wish...

486
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,540
that your bright smile lasts forever.

487
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,620
Oh, my friend.

488
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,160
- It's over, isn't it?
- Everyone knows you have senses as sharp as a sickle.

489
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,680
You're really quick at sensing things.

490
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,550
When you cry like this, who wouldn't know?

491
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,250
Don't look at me.

492
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:55,660
I don't want to show my state like this to anyone.

493
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:01,290
Then, go over there and cry there by yourself. People might think that I made you cry.

494
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,110
No, it's not me.

495
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,300
I will no longer cry.

496
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,150
Giving up my feelings cleanly is also a part of love, isn't it?

497
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,950
Maybe it's something harder to do than continuing to love.

498
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,590
You're almost like a poet.

499
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,950
Let's go. Stop crying!

500
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:31,440
So she insisted on serving this table to me after all?

501
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,940
This sinister picture is...

502
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,070
Oh my! It is so beautiful.

503
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,800
Court Lady Chun, you'd live even if you were poisoned.

504
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,970
Since you can't read the room.

505
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,470
Your compliment is so sudden!

506
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:21,070
Your Majesty, I offer you my greetings. I'm Sim-ong of the Han family.

507
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,430
Didn't we meet elsewhere?

508
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,660
I'm frightened!

509
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,850
I'm sorry... No, no. Forgive me.

510
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,390
Instead, would you like to tell me something else?

511
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:46,000
For example, "I deserve to die."

512
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,830
Thanks to you, I flew all of the popcorn that I worked so hard to make.

513
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,620
I literally flew them in the sky.

514
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,530
I didn’t know you were the queen, I really didn't know.

515
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:03,590
That’s... why I committed such an offense.

516
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,210
Oh, you didn't know I was the queen!

517
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:13,340
- Then, why did you run away?
- Oh, well. I did it because such an invaluable person was chasing me.

518
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:18,710
I was surprised. That’s why I did it, there’s no other reason.

519
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,580
Okay.

520
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:27,360
In fact, Mr. Han,

521
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,570
- I summoned you to give you a seat in the government.
- Eh?

522
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:39,310
It's a good position. You’ll have that position for your whole life and don't worry, you won't ever be fired. You’ll be well paid, too.

523
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,220
- But in return, there’s something you’ll have to lose.
- Pardon me?

524
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,800
What am I going to lose?

525
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,830
Although we had a very brief meeting, I could see that your physiognomy is perfect for this position.

526
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,480
I'm grateful, Your Majesty!

527
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,820
So... be my eunuch.

528
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,400
What!

529
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:10,440
Wait a second. Stop. One second.

530
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:15,380
Your Majesty, please withdraw your decision. Your grace is immeasurable.

531
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,970
Wait, but why are you doing this to me?

532
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,350
First, for pretending to be a noble with fake identification.

533
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:28,010
No... this isn't your fault. We should blame society for discriminating against those who aren't nobles.

534
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:30,780
You're correct!

535
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:37,390
Again... First, for pouring poisonous herbs into the water in the royal kitchen and ruining the king's banquet.

536
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,760
Second, for having a bad descendant.

537
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,450
D-Descendant... Maybe you spoke wrong, didn't you mean my ancestors?

538
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,430
No. I'm sure.

539
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,660
You have a bad descendant.

540
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,070
But a d-descendant is...

541
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:05,860
Y-Your Majesty! Your Majesty, if I become a eunuch, I can't even have any descendants.

542
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,350
I can't have any descendants. Hey, eunuch, do you have any descendants? No, right?

543
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:14,130
I'm telling you, I won't be able to have any descendants!

544
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,430
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

545
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,570
Your Majesty, the Lord Minister of the Military came.

546
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,550
Your Majesty.

547
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,970
<i>Ansong Kim family. He's definitely in the same conspiracy with all of them. </i>

548
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,210
<i>But my father is also a member of the Ansong Kim family. Wait, I just said "my father" too naturally. </i>

549
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,480
Emotional transference is too serious here.

550
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:59,580
I belatedly figured out what happened to you after I had had an audience with you.

551
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,630
I didn't know you had gone through such a big incident...

552
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,060
So, you're saying you had no idea that they were trying to kill me?

553
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,950
I'm neither my father's person nor the Kim family's person.

554
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,420
<i>However, you can be free from neither of them. </i>

555
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,980
You will come to know that in the end.

556
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,380
Is he my enemy or my ally...

557
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,880
God...

558
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,610
Damn it!

559
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:54,400
Even so, how could they... to my queen?

560
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,460
Kim Jwa-geun, that bastard! Immediately, I will—

561
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,080
On top of that, The Office of Correction for Three Taxes?

562
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,870
In the end, that is also a scheme to use the corruption of local government officials as an excuse

563
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:16,610
and bring our family down, I presume.

564
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,570
Please do not be concerned.

565
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,150
If he tries to call it exploitation and tries to find fault in it,

566
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,950
no one will be free from accusation.

567
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:29,150
Even if it's only for protecting themselves, all of them have no choice but to protect those local government officials, too.

568
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:33,660
So, The Office of Correction for Three Taxes will end up as an empty shell.

569
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:41,410
Even if we momentarily join our hands with them, don't even blink your eyes in front of Queen Dowager Jo.

570
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:46,860
With her smiling face, she's always harboring a knife behind her back.

571
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,200
I'll keep that in mind.

572
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,780
- Court Lady Chun.
- Yes, Your Highness.

573
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,430
Take the table out and call Nurse Park.

574
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,010
Yes, Your Highness.

575
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,330
Have you already finished your meal, Your Highness?

576
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:07,080
I don't have any appetite.

577
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,980
I heard that you've been quite satisfied with the royal table, prepared by the queen so far.

578
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,390
It wasn't that great, but good enough for me to eat.

579
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:19,910
The queen is very heartbroken.

580
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,600
She said, because of Eui Bin's trick, she had misunderstood that our clan had turned its back to her.

581
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,120
She was blaming herself very much.

582
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,360
- Eui Bin?
- I also heard it from the queen's father today.

583
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,880
The person who deceived Your Highness wasn't the queen, but Eui Bin.

584
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,630
<i>His Majesty the King is here.</i>

585
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,940
Escort him in.

586
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,170
- Your Majesty.
- I'm sorry for barging in without notice at this late hour.

587
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,840
No, it's all right. I'm grateful for your visit any time.

588
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,880
I came here as I have something to let you know, My Lady.

589
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,080
What is it, Your Majesty?

590
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,880
It's about the palace maid's corpse found in the well a while ago.

591
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,100
Queen Dowager ordered her people to stage the corpse that way.

592
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,410
Her Highness the Queen Dowager did? But why...

593
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,140
Do you also not have any clue about why she did so?

594
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,490
Then, that corpse was...

595
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:40,010
I guess it was probably not Oh-wol.

596
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,780
That's not possible. That was definitely Oh-wol.

597
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,640
I was told that the corpse's face was unrecognizable, but why are you so certain that it was Oh-wol?

598
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,700
She was wearing a palace maid's uniform too,

599
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,540
and... the only missing palace maid was Oh-wol.

600
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,400
So, she must have known that you would be certain it was Oh-wol.

601
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:07,250
What Queen Dowager wants is probably your dependency on her.

602
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,340
But why was it in the well, of all places?

603
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,970
I told her about what we had experienced in a well.

604
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:21,940
Because, to me, a well is a place where I had met Your Majesty for the first time, but also a place that gave me heartache.

605
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:27,110
It was overlapped with the image of Your Majesty, so I was certain that I had lost the person dear to me.

606
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:34,350
I see now that here in the palace is where I shouldn't even share my painful memories recklessly.

607
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:56,950
<i>Please drag the queen down to the nightmares where I'm living. </i>

608
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,800
Going forward, you must never trust Queen Dowager.

609
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,650
Since we should hide the source of this information, please don't even show that you already know what Queen Dowager did.

610
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,810
I've also felt a huge disappointment and betrayal about Queen Dowager.

611
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:24,010
The well is a place layered with the fear of death,

612
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,590
but I've never thought she would use that...

613
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,440
<i>[Daejojeon]
(Queen's quarters)</i>

614
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,700
So, this is similar to poker or hwa-tu. <i>(Flower Card Game)</i>

615
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,870
Indeed, for wasting time and life, gambling and games

616
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,800
are the best.

617
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,500
That's a relief, Your Majesty.

618
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,500
We thought that you might still be having a hard time because of Dam-hyan—

619
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,930
I apologize, Your Majesty.

620
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,850
Don't worry. Dam-hyang is in a better place now.

621
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,850
Yes, you're right. She's probably in a better place now, right?

622
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,860
Dam-hyang...

623
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:12,520
No, no, I mean she's really in a better place now.

624
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

625
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,720
Dam-hyang!

626
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,520
She's really in a better place!

627
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,430
Why do you keep crying?

628
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,010
I apologize.

629
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:35,110
Come to think of it, I wasn't able to say goodbye to Dam-hyang.

630
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,110
Dam-hyang...

631
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,150
Your Majesty.

632
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,470
Dam-hyang...

633
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,380
Seven.

634
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,450
Eight.

635
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,860
This is what they would call

636
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,980
nine.

637
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,310
I apologize.

638
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,850
Dammit.

639
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,770
Dam-hyang...

640
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,870
All in.

641
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,770
How do you think Queen Dowager Jo got her hands on the ledger?

642
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:23,780
We couldn't even find it after going around looking for it.

643
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:29,160
Looking at this, isn't it better for us to recruit Queen Dowager Jo for our team?

644
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,150
It's a joke.

645
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:36,680
Since she's better at this work than me, who can freely walk around outside of the palace, I feel a bit ashamed.

646
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,630
But Queen Dowager Jo is always cooped up in Seonwonjeon Hall, how did she get her hands on the ledger?

647
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,970
Seeing how she manipulated the corpse,

648
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,660
it's possible she has access to people who act as her hands and feet.

649
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,790
Then, should we recruit those hands and feet...

650
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,910
Is the composite of the man with the goblin mask not done yet?

651
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,680
Lately, I've been struggling with too much work.

652
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,160
You know like freeing Dam-hyang's mother from slavery and finding her missing father, too.

653
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,800
But you couldn't find Dam-hyang's father, though.

654
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,480
How am I supposed to find people hiding in the mountains?

655
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,380
He must have become a bandit.

656
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,840
These days, with the thought of a vacation that I will get after the business trip as a royal inspector,

657
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:21,390
I am barely... barely, barely, barely holding.

658
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:25,090
My friend, what I meant by a vacation was—

659
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,970
But, if possible, why don't you make me a secret royal inspector, instead of a royal inspector?

660
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,530
They have a better style.

661
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:37,090
First, hiding my identity and then, "Ta-Da" pulling out the mapae! <i>(T/N: mapae - Badge of the Royal Inspector.)</i>

662
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:41,050
You're a natural-born secret royal inspector. Go ahead with it.

663
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,110
- Do it one more time.
- Ta-da!

664
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,970
I really didn't see my father like that.

665
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,990
People like Kim Jwa-geun deserve to die, but him—

666
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,750
He's the only family I have left.

667
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,920
You were out to kill your father-in-law and wife, how can you sleep at night?

668
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,110
You aren't.

669
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,860
Don't act up, heart.

670
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,450
It's hurting my pride.

671
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,050
<i>She was in the water for such a long time.</i>

672
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:13,200
<i>How suffocating and painful it must have been.</i>

673
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,060
<i>The body in the well was either a horrifying coincidence</i>

674
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,120
<i>or someone's way of pitting us against each other. </i>

675
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,990
I was caught up in my thoughts.

676
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,800
The shock must have been big.

677
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,810
This palace is too big for me.

678
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:47,840
Not only is it lonely, but it's easy to lose your way.

679
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,310
I've found a palace maid who sold the accessory that you gave to Oh-wol.

680
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,960
She said she had just found it buried underground in the palace.

681
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,830
Is that so?

682
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:01,480
Per Queen Dowager Jo's orders, the one who put the body in the well was also her.

683
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,390
Oh-wol is alive.

684
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,170
She must have suffered some misfortune inside the palace.

685
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:10,760
She wasn't able to even step foot outside this palace.

686
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,120
Shouldn't you hope that the corpse in the well isn't Oh-wol?

687
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,840
Shouldn't you be happy that the corpse in the well isn't Oh-wol?

688
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,520
Why is it that you want to believe that corpse is Oh-wol? What exactly...

689
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,520
What are you hiding?

690
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,770
Last time,

691
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:43,950
when you handed an object over to Queen Dowager Jo. What was it?

692
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,960
You saw?

693
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:03,600
If My Lady tells me I didn't see anything, then I did not see it.

694
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,660
Anyone can lose their way momentarily.

695
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,760
You can still come back to your original position.

696
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:18,470
What if isn't momentary?

697
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:23,960
Will I still be able to return to where I was?

698
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,430
I can't go back now.

699
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,640
My Lady.

700
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,330
That corpse has to be Oh-wol!

701
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:48,000
Why are you making Samyang ramen this late at night?

702
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:56,500
Why do people crave ramen at night? It's obvious you'll be bloated the next morning.

703
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,700
It's hard to endure this temptation despite knowing that fact.

704
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:04,760
You've worked hard to make it, but what a shame.

705
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,640
Her Highness the Grand Queen Dowager has never eaten anything at this late hour.

706
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,330
I will try some instead.

707
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,650
No.

708
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,920
If you're here you should say something.

709
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,560
Why are you tapping the door and standing there?

710
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,290
Do you want... to eat ramen before you go?
<i>(T/N: This is an expression equivalent to 'Netflix and chill?' Have sex.) </i>

711
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,460
What is ramen and where am I supposed to go after eating it?

712
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,710
No strings attached. Shall I say, it's a sort of research?

713
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,860
Or a test?

714
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:14,020
No. I shouldn't be like this.

715
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,490
But just one spoonful.

716
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:20,010
No, no. This ramen is an addicting food.

717
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,530
Once you have a bite you can't stop.

718
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,750
What are you doing?

719
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,590
Inner conflict.

720
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:40,260
If you were me, what would you do?

721
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:43,420
Would you eat the ramen or not?

722
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:47,100
Please explain first what ramen is—

723
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:51,150
- First,
- First?

724
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,930
let's have some.

725
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,490
Right? Whatever it is, you should experience it first to know about it.

726
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,670
Whether it was because I was drunk

727
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,260
or I've really gone crazy. Or if neither is right, then maybe because this is really

728
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,520
the right thing for me.

729
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:09,690
Are we talking about the same thing?

730
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:14,110
Of course. We're talking about ramen.

731
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,160
Come closer. Ramen tastes the best when it's hot.

Oh no, this precious thing.

Do you know what this is that you consider it precious?

Why is this children's book precious to you?

That—

Is it you, My Queen?

739
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:02,060
Are you the one who saved me?

740
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,240
Were you the one who saved me from the well?

741
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:21,450
That's right. It was me.
