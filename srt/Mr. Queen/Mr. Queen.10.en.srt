All right. Think about whatever you want.

Good morning.

- What happened?
- Good question, I almost touched—

45

I mean, I almost died!

46
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,440
You were so heavy!

47
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,500
That was dangerous.

<i>The ledger was not in there.</i>

49
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,190
Did you save me? By yourself?

50
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,940
You told me no one could know.

51
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,170
I used up all the strength that I had, even pulled some from my soul.

52
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,660
<i>I can do this. I remember the days when I used to lift 150kg.

<i>Your strength doesn't come from your muscles.</i>

<i>It comes from determination, from your soul.</i>

55
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,960
Why on earth did you go into a well at that hour?

56
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,230
It was dark, so I didn't see the well and fell inside.

57
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,690
Do you have night blindness or something? It's hard to climb out of a well.

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,140
<i>Are you awake?</i>

59
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,200

60

Hold on. Please wait for a second.

61
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,870
Yes, you can come inside now.

62
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,700
If I had known that you would stay here,

63
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,820
I would have prepared the Golden Bedding in a larger and wider size.

64
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,260
<i>Father, no! Please, no! Please.</i>

65
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,080
<i>Father! You can't do this! Father, Father!</i>

66
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,010
<i>Father, no!</i>

67
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,190
I apologize.

68
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,930
There is no need.

69
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,190
Because of your efforts, I was comfortable here.

70
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,260
I should not bother you anymore

71
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,050

72
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,990
What do you mean bothering?

73
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,080
Please don't say that.

74
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,100
I came to relay a message

75
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,650
that Grand Queen Dowager sent.

76
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,010
As I see it, Grand Queen Dowager has been seeking out your presence in the palace every day,

77
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,020
She must really need you.

78
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,060
Without me, the palace is not running properly

79
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,790
All right.

80
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,480
Even though you are very busy and it is difficult, that is good.

81
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,350
Don't worry about anything else,

82
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,640
just fulfill your obligation and play your role as the queen. That's all.

83
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,540
Even though your father may not be sufficient,

84
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,570
don't forget as your father, I am here to support your back.

85
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,010
Yes.

86
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,120
Please return safely to the palace, Your Majesty.

87
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,930
Even though I may appear to be brazen-faced, I request Your Majesty to take good care of the queen.

88
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,210
To ensure the queen doesn't feel lonely,

89
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,080
going forward, I will pay more attention to her.

90
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,290
My goodness, I greatly appreciate your kindness, Your Majesty.

91
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,280
Let's start to depart.

92
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,270
<i>Pretending like he is one of the kindest fathers in the world, </i>

93
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,610
<i>but he is just a greedy man who is using his daughter as a tool after all.</i>

94
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,600
<i>Making his daughter marry the very person he tried to kill...</i>

95
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,960
<i>Is that why the king tried to kill Kim So-yong?</i>

96
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,560
Why are you wearing a facial expression that says you lost your country?

97
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,040
No, I'm not.

98
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,650
If not a country, did you lose anything else?

99
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,520
Uh? Is it real?

100
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,970
It's not possible.

101
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,460
This is a happy day when you are returning to the palace safely, My Queen.

102
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,280
It may not look like it, but this is my facial expression for being very glad.

103
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,940
Fine as long as you're glad.

104
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,610
<i>Finally, is the bloody revenge about to start?</i>

105
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>However, I feel like I am missing something very important...</i>

106
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,590
A mission that is very important?

107
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,530
Look! Oh, His Majesty is so handsome.

108
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,020
- Oh my god...
- Oh, wow.

109
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,400
<i>Selecting the concubines! How could I forget such an important thing?</i>

110
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,930
I have something urgent, so bye! Hong Yeon! Let's go! Hurry up!

111
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,780
What... Why are you running?

112
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,490
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.

113
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,580
Proceed slowly, please.

114
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,970
Oh, dear... My Queen!

115
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,490
Your Majesty!

116
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,390
Let's go inside for now.

117
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,050
- What about the head eunuch?
- I have him occupied with something else.

118
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,550
Could you not find it?

119
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,150
It has disappeared completely.

120
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,030
Did the queen's father relocate it after noticing our movements?

121
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,370
No, I'm sure that's not it.

122
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,530
There has been no change in his attitude even as I left his house.

123
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,850
The queen's father is not talented at hiding his feelings.

124
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,890
Then, could it be that other fellow?

125
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,590
The guard from the Royal Investigation Bureau, that wore the mask?

126
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,250
If that book was taken by Kim Jwa-geun,

127
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,540
then that ledger may not exist anymore.

128
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,630
There is no way he could possibly know where it's been relocated.

129
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,500
Since it is an item with a lot of issues,

130
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,170
the queen's father cannot even tell anyone that he lost it.

131
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,420
He must be sick all by himself.

132
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,250
But then... he must be chasing after the book, too.

133
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,560
He will move himself. Assign a person to follow after the queen's father.

134
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,490
Yes.

135
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,360
It seems like that book is out of our hands, so let's give up on it.

136
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,330
Without that ledger, all of our plans will come to naught!

137
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,020
We cannot give it up so easily.

138
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,030
Behave in such a manner, as if Her Majesty the Queen is always here.

139
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,580
<i>Go faster! Hurry up! Let's go! </i>

140
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,490
Your Majesty!

141
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,700
- Hi, Lady Choi!
- Your Majesty.

142
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,160
Your Majesty... I've missed you.

143
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,140
Lady Choi, gather all the women in the land of Joseon.

144
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,050
And you must find all information and genealogy books of the Han family, without missing a single one.

145
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,070
From now on, we will start selecting the royal concubines.

146
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,690
<i>Using the selection of royal concubines as an excuse, I'll take a census to find the Han registry.</i>

147
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,270
Of course, the answer was the selection of royal concubines!

148
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,900
That right! Now, I need to go to say 'hi' to our Grand Queen Dowager.

149
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,750
<i>Looking forward to seeing</i>

150
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,000
<i>the perfect queen cosplay <i>(costume play)</i>. A combination of Jang Bong-hwan's soul and Kim So-yong's memories.</i>

151
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,420
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager,

152
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,400
how have you been?

153
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,980
What has changed, I wonder?

154
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,390
For some reason, I feel like you're a bit different.

155
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,340
After visiting my family home, I regained my initial intentions and determination.

156
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,360
How very fortunate!

157
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,020
I sincerely apologize for causing all this anxiety and worry.

158
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,090
Yet, you have been very understanding, with your kind heart.

159
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,970
I am just very grateful for your mercy.

160
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,200
To make up for my lackings in the recent past,

161
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,030
from now on,

162
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,600
I will do my best to fulfill my role as queen, better and better.

163
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,790
Then, can you begin with a very urgent matter?

164
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,490
<i>I know, I know.</i>

165
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,060
I was also excited to perform that duty

166
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,270
so I rushed back to the place as soon as I recovered.

167
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,780
As expected from you, My Queen.

168
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,980
Although it has been only two days since I left the palace,

169
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,690
there was much concern I had about that duty.

170
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,690
How could you have had exactly the same mind as me?

171
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,970
- Then..
- Now.

172
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,190
- Immediately?
- Shall we?

173
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,150
- The queen's work?
- Great!

174
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,460
This is not the picture that I had in my mind.

175
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:33,010
Your Majesty, instruct us in a lesson, please.

176
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,530
<i>At this point when I need to be "irreplaceable,"</i>

177
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,430
<i>how can I divulge my skills?</i>

178
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,390
I am not qualified to be a teacher yet.

179
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,200
What the... Move aside.

180
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,260
You may come as you wish with your free will,

181
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,320
but you cannot leave as freely.

182
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:27,100
My Lady, I'm told that His Majesty the King has arrived in the palace.

183
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,520
- Is that so?
- Shall we go to Seonjeongjeon Hall <i>(King's study)</i> immediately?

184
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,700
No, I am going back to my quarters.

185
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,490
The fire is too weak. All the ingredients might get squashed.

186
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,040
The fire sparks are flying!

187
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,180
It seems like the fire is sparking in your eyes too, Head Chef.

188
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,110
Oh, that's not possible.

189
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:05,630
With my eagerness to learn, my eyes are just filled with alert smartness.

190
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,620
But, when are you going to teach the recipe?

191
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,560
Why behave like this when you're someone who knows the physiology of a kitchen?

192
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,640
Even when you are hired at a Chinese restaurant, you only get to peel onions for the first month.

193
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,170
Make sure you keep the fire burning well.

194
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,540
But I have worked in the royal kitchen for more than 30 years and as Head Chef for the last 12 years during that time!

195
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,390
Why give me so many needless details? Why did you even count all those days?

196
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,550
What an attitude for learning! Forget it, I'm not teaching!

197
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,410
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Should I do this? Like this?

198
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,250
Like this, eh? Like this?

199
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,880
Open it up.

200
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,200
Did you just sneak up here and look? Such an industrial spy!

201
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,680
Just to ensure the fire was at the right temperature, that's all.

202
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,110
Head Chef, you shouldn't think, I'm the one who will do the thinking.

203
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,960
Why do you keep crossing the line?

204
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,720
<i>If the soup with rice is the commoner's soul food, ox bone soup (gomtang) shall be the nobles' soul food.</i>

205
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,470
<i>To the gomtang, I shall add consommé for a French-style beef soup.</i>

206
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,000
<i>Remove the stinky smell with egg whites.</i>

207
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,310
Egg whites? What a strange way...

208
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,910
Your Majesty! Your Majesty...

209
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,660
Are these good enough?

210
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,150
Oh, really good!

211
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,370
By the way, what kind of food are you cooking with these?

212
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,710
It's food that will move your soul.

213
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,840
Soul, did you say?

214
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,120
Good! On top of this, as the finishing touch...

215
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,830
Are they ready outside?

216
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

217
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,880
If its bubbles die, you guys will die, too.

218
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,040
With that mindset, keep focusing on its safe and speedy delivery.

219
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,050
Now, move out!

220
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,870
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,870
Hurry, let's go.

222
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,170
The taste you know is usually the scary one.

223
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,070
Your Majesty!

224
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,960
Dam-hyang!

225
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:02,210
<i>(In modern Korean )</i> Afraid of not being able to see Your Majesty again, I was freaking out.

226
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,690
Seriously, I so freaking appreciate your return.

227
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,610
I made our Dam-hyang worry.

228
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,800
This Majesty should really get scolded, huh?

229
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,580
So sorry.

230
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,780
What...

231
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,810
Am I seeing it wrong?

232
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,740
Is the thing underneath these... rice?

233
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,110
Well... It is, even to my eyes, Your Royal Highness.

234
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,720
Did she just serve rice with soup for the royal table?

235
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,470
According to the rules of the royal table, rice and soup should be served in separate bowls no matter what!

236
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,560
How could she serve them together in one bowl, that's so vulgar!

237
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,030
Shall I tell them to take it away?

238
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,930
Yes, do it—

239
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,900
But to do it when the queen put so much effort into it.

240
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,100
Let me taste it at least for now.

241
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,010
Yes.

242
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,980
<i>So far, I've spent my days in the royal kitchen </i>

243
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,570
<i>full of pride,</i>

244
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,050
<i>even counting the number of those days.</i>

245
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:40,900
<i>However, overnight, I've fallen down to the level of a lowly servant, tending the fire.</i>

246
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,880
<i>This is all because of Her Majesty the Queen.</i>

247
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,150
<i>It's not that I'm not good at cooking,</i>

248
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,870
<i>but the queen is strangely too good at it.</i>

249
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,710
<i>Damn it.</i>
- Your Majesty!
<i>- Your Majesty!</i>

250
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,940
- Damn it. Your Majesty!
<i>- Your Majesty!</i>

251
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,950
<i>- You, too?
- You, also?</i>

252
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,910
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

253
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,440
Goddamn it! Isn't this too harsh?

254
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,950
You're still wet behind the ears! You, $@#%&%@#$!

255
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,600
@#$@%#@ and #$%&@!

256
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,450
You think anybody can become the Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen?

257
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,620
Putting me in charge of tending a wretched fireplace, really?

258
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,780
God, that felt great.

259
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,740
Court Lady Choi, when did you...

260
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,320
I would not go that far.

261
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,840
As I've been harassed by Her Majesty so much,

262
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,060
I must have gone bad, like a radish dish in May and June.

263
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,210
Blowing my breath into the fiery oven all day long like this...

264
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,860
What are you doing!

265
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,500
Well, what I meant was—

266
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,430
- Let me explain—
- Shush! Shush! Go away!

267
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,500
- What did I d—
- No! Go away.

268
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,750
All right.

269
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,720
Excuse me then.

270
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,890
Now it feels as if I'll be on the same level as that scamp,

271
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,590
so I can't "bad" mouth Her Majesty any longer.

272
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,710
But since I still need some relief...

273
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:42,010
Although, I really tried to quit this...

274
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,770
Why... is that man... in there?

275
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,540
No! It shouldn't be! No, no! It shouldn't be!

276
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,960
No, it shouldn't be!

277
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,140
No, no, please, no!

278
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,920
<i>Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager, the queen is here.</i>

279
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,850
Let her enter.

280
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,080
<i>I'm screwed...</i>

281
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,000
<i>She should have had soul first to fully appreciate soul food.</i>

282
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,690
Well, Your Royal Highness,

283
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,480
since I left the royal kitchen for a while,

284
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,840
I guess my skills got a little rusty in the meantime—

285
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,470
It's a taste that I know yet I don't know.

286
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,270
And also a taste that I don't know yet I'll still know.

287
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,070
Your skills to enhance the taste are even scary to me now,

288
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,850
even as my long-forgotten memory is conquered.

289
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,850
<i>Say, "Ah."</i>

290
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,650
<i>Good, good girl.</i>

291
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,720
Mother...

292
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Your Highness.

293
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,910
There is one rice grain here—

294
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,850
Don't you dare!

295
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,490
By the way, I heard you're trying to keep such amazing skills to yourself only.

296
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,050
Is the Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen, not a good talent for you to teach?

297
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,630
Well, he is quite an unpleasant "kkondae," indeed.
<i>(T/N: snobbish old man)</i>

298
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,730
Then, let's cut off the head immediately,

299
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,940
since there was an arsenic incident too.

300
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,450
Arsenic, you say?

301
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,930
Didn't you know that?

302
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,360
The reason why you went into the "Sigwol" state was because you were poisoned in the royal kitchen.
<i>(Sigwol - coma like state)</i>

303
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,780
<i>Poisoned?</i>

304
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,260
<i>If that were the case, there is no way I'd be perfectly fine now.</i>

305
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,900
Although the head chef is a "kkondae,"

306
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,420
if you fire him so suddenly like this...

307
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,300
Fire him?

308
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,500
I meant to behead him.

309
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,540
<i>In whose hand did that ledger go?</i>

310
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,380
<i>Moreover, it's more important why that person took it.</i>

311
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,140
<i>Will it become like poison to us?</i>

312
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,470
<i>Or come as a benefit?</i>

313
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:54,020
<i>Whether his job is cut off or his neck is cut off, what does that have to do with me?</i>

314
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,190
<i>Since she keeps telling me to teach my know-how of cooking and my recipes, </i>

315
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,220
<i>it doesn't seem like Grand Queen Dowager was saying empty words about deposing me.</i>

316
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,530
Gosh, I'm not in the position to be worrying about that kkondae.

317
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,990
My life is on the line, too.

318
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,510
Oh, it's Jong Jong. Cheoljong is over there.

319
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,860
Your Majesty, it's Her Majesty the Queen.

320
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,910
- What are you doing?
- As I was taught that a woman from the royal family should walk in this way,

321
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,610
and since I am a perfect queen...

322
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,590
Who is? Who is?

323
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,700
That's what Court Lady Choi said. Is it not?

324
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,740
No, what I'm saying is, who is the perfect queen?

325
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,130
As you can see, it's me.

326
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,190
How scary. Just act as you usually do.

327
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,500
By the way, which type does Your Majesty prefer?

328
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,250
Sexy? Cute? Innocent?

329
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,280
What are you—

330
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,660
Per Grand Queen Dowager's command, I'm in charge of choosing a few concubines.

331
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,530
But since they're your concubines, I was going to take your preferences into consideration.

332
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,400
Concubines?

333
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,190
Concubines, you say...

334
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,500
<i>Look at this dude.</i>

335
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,410
<i>Are you slowly starting to show your true colors?</i>

336
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,270
What a great idea!

337
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,470
I apologize. I was too excited.

338
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,330
There's something I need to make sure you know.

339
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,810
Get rid of any lame old thoughts thinking that the concubines belong to you just because you're the king.

340
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,210
The concubines are not your possession.

341
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,910
That's a great saying. That saying—

342
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,900
- They are mine.
- I'm sorry?

343
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,490
They are my possession.

344
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,360
So don't step anywhere near the concubines' quarters.

345
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,750
You should be satisfied with Eui Bin.

346
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,040
Oh, right.

347
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,180
However, there's one condition.

348
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,840
- Wait a moment.
- What? What?

349
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,060
It's okay.

350
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,040
I get to decide what family they're from.

351
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,340
What?

352
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,750
I don't want to! I care more about looks than backgrounds. Looks!

353
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,890
If you insist, then I shall strongly suggest to Grand Queen Dowager

354
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,840
that I don't need any more concubines.

355
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,170
Okay, I see. Let's not touch each other's territories.

356
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,580
I'm in charge of the looks and you're in charge of the family line.

357
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,070
My Queen, you are indeed my anti-fan.

358
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,350
I was very worried but I figured out a way.

359
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,480
Don't smile.

360
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,210
No smiling allowed.

361
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,510
And no more grabbing my hand as you did earlier!

362
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,030
Also, no lying down on my tummy is allowed either!

363
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,110
- Is everything not allowed?
- That's right.

364
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,610
Everything isn't allowed for you. You're not allowed!

365
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,610
I took too much time out of my day already.

366
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,740
Let's go.

367
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,510
That is really who she is.

368
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,320
Would you like to go see His Majesty?

369
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,800
I will return to my quarters.

370
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,310
Is this what you are looking for?

371
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,230
Did you say a court lady sold this to you?

372
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,120
Yes. She looked young.

373
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,780
She was in a court lady's uniform under her outer jacket.

374
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,440
Do you remember her face?

375
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,580
That depends... on how much you are willing to pay me.

376
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,820
I will return with a painter.

377
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,590
The clearer your memories are,

378
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,960
the higher my offering will be.

379
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,060
Please come in.

380
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:42,340
<i>[General Store] [Went To the Toilet]</i>

381
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,420
<i>[Seal]</i>

382
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,940
I am pretty sure this is a fake.

383
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,010
You mean, it is a forged identity paper?

384
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,340
It is not new, but

385
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:59,210
it is revised from one that either belonged to a deceased or missing person.

386
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,840
To make one as neatly as this one,

387
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,160
it must have cost quite a lot.

388
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,260
I thank you.

389
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,760
Just to become a low-ranking military officer,

390
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,720
he put in this much effort?

391
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,430
<i>Your Majesty, I have something to give you secretly away from others' watchful eyes.</i>

392
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,460
<i>I will wait for you where we always meet.</i>

393
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,170
<i>My Lady.</i>

394
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,020
I'm told that Prince Yeongpyeong is out of the palace at the moment.

395
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,030
- Then, Lady Go, I would like you to deliver this to His Majesty personally.
- Yes, My Lady.

396
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,360
<i>[Your Majesty, I have something to give you secretly away from others' watchful eyes. I will wait for you where we always meet.]</i>

397
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,150
She has something to give to the king?

398
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,300
If she could not give it to him since he seemed content with the queen,

399
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,630
then it must not be something ordinary.

400
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,900
The council session in the royal presence will commence in about 15 minutes, right?

401
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,040
Yes, Your Highness.

402
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,080
You should go after taking a little break

403
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,620
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,580
Lady Eui Bin sent this message, Your Majesty.

405
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,410
<i>[Pye]</i>

406
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,930
I am sure things must have been busy with me absent.

407
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,130
Thanks to you, there is no work left for me to do.

408
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,360
<i>Many, many thanks, Your Majesty.</i>

409
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,530
To show you my appreciation,

410
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,430
I would like to hold a banquet on Suritnal.
<i>(T/N: Dano - 5th day of 5th lunar month, for a good harvest)</i>

411
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,640
As there are many natural disasters and complaints from the people,

412
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,140
celebrating with a banquet in such a situation,

413
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,430
will make the people think the government is throwing a grand event

414
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,730
while putting the people's well-being aside.

415
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,010
This is not a sage king's action.

416
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,430
However, King Yeongjo also celebrated the fact that he got better after being ill for more than a couple of months

417
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,670
by throwing a banquet; a precedent.

418
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,940
The queen made a full recovery after falling into a Sigwol state due to her overworking.

419
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,660
We should celebrate this.

420
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,440
We are still investigating the cause of her illness.

421
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,890
So we cannot pinpoint that cause yet.

422
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,790
She has made a full recovery after resting for two days,

423
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,290
so I'm sure that she just needed some rest.

424
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,520
- However—
- Since Her Majesty the Queen

425
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,740
overcame a serious illness and made a full recovery,

426
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,490
we should hold a small feast to celebrate this good occasion.

427
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,370
I believe that the occasion deserves a celebration.

428
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,590
Yes. That is my duty as her husband and your king as well.

429
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,760
Your Majesty, you can do this.

430
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,850
An attempt to assassinate the queen is a serious offense.

431
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,310
If you end this case prematurely through a banquet—

432
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,270
Minster of the Military,

433
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,000
are you not happy the queen has recovered?

434
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,270
Don't tell me that you wanted the queen to be harmed by someone?

435
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,860
No, I did not, Your Majesty.

436
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,000
Is using this occasion for your political agenda

437
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,920
more important than the queen's health, Minister of the Military?

438
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,220
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

439
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,640
If that is your wish, we will gladly accept your kindness.

440
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,910
Then, please look forward to it.

441
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,940
Perhaps, it is because you've had a lot of rest. You are full of enthusiasm.

442
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,970
<i>[Injeongjean - The Great Throne Hall]
(For all state affairs, meetings, envoy visits, or ceremonies.)</i>

443
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,030
"Defeat an enemy by making another enemy fight with it."

444
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,770
I will conquer the barbarians by using other barbarians.

445
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,980
We must establish a new clan that will go against the Ansong Kim Clan.

446
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,160
- Establish a clan?
- We will use the selection of the royal concubines, which the queen is in charge of.

447
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,000
Head Chef, please take a look at this.

448
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,300
Sure. Does it taste similar?

449
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,870
Let me taste it.

450
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,810
Bring me more seasoning. I must add more.

451
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,250
Hey, that is too watery. Do it again.

452
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,930
Why are you working so hard?

453
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,060
Dishes made with milk will be very popular from now on.

454
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,580
We cannot starve the calves whenever we want.

455
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,090
I am sure even without milk

456
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,630
we can bring out a similar taste.

457
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,050
What now? Is he trying to do molecular cuisine in the Joseon Dynasty?

458
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,830
He is working so hard especially today.

459
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,000
Head Chef.

460
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,690
<i>I can feel the sadness on his face.</i>

461
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,380
<i>I bet he has a whole family to feed.</i>

462
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

463
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,550
Make a bigger fire here.

464
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:04,020
Goodness, goodness, goodness.

465
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:09,370
<i>He is probably carrying all of the burdens, as the head of a family, on those small shoulders.</i>

466
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,870
Now that I think about it, I don't even know your name.

467
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,900
What is your name?

468
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,790
It is Man-bok.

469
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,760
Tell me about your family.

470
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,250
I bet you have like ten family members to support.

471
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,210
I am not married.

472
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,390
I have enjoyed the life of a lone male for a long time.

473
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,930
But I am sure you have some family members you have to support?

474
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,910
Think about it again!

475
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,600
I do feed stray cats some fish heads from time to time.

476
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,230
That's right. See?

477
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,070
Without you, Man-bok, those stray cats would starve.

478
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:54,140
I won't do it for you, but I will do it for those cats!

479
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,390
I will teach you my recipes.

480
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,920
Oh, your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

481
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,000
You are creeping me out.

482
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,060
Hey...

483
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,000
Bring me some paper.

484
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,580
Hong Yeon, tell the palanquin bearer to deliver this to the royal doctor.

485
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,610
<i>Recommend herbs, which are good for the skin and also have a nice fragrance.</i>

487
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,990
<i>If you don't recommend properly, you will be transferred to a new job posting.</i>

488
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,730
<i>Transfer to a new job posting?</i>

489
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,310
There is something more written on the back.

490
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,700
<i> You know... I need more eunuchs who will help me in selecting concubines.</i>

491
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,430
Why is Her Majesty so eager to make me into a eunuch?

492
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,020
<i>Your Majesty, please walk slowly. You might get hurt.</i>

493
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,710
Where are the books on royal banquets?

494
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,740
I'll search the library.

495
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,490
I'd like to refer to the record book regarding King Yeongjo's "Gapjajinyeon Banquet."

496
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

497
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,890
When I went to Seonjeongjeon Hall to see Your Majesty, I was told you came here.

498
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,910
To what do I owe this honor?

499
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,530
I thought I've been keeping too much of a distance from Your Majesty thus far.

500
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,330
So, I came here to have a conversation with you.

501
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,770
Please try it.

502
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,780
Maybe it's because you brewed it yourself,

503
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,500
I feel the tea tastes more profound.

504
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,740
When I see you, My King, you remind me of the late king.

505
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:47,040
That is why it's hard for me to get close to you.

506
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,760
I'm sorry that I couldn't understand such a feeling as yours.

507
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,340
I thought that I knew the late king very well.

508
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,920
Maybe, the late king,

509
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:07,210
my son, was a king greater than I thought he had been.

510
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:12,620
He tried with all his might to strengthen the royal authorities against the Kim family.

511
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,200
The fact that I didn't give a bit more support to his plan by moving my family

512
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,270
is very regretful to me.

513
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,920
Please don't blame yourself.

514
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,900
The late king wouldn't want that either.

515
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,760
Maybe... through you, My King,

516
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,740
will I be able to redeem my mistake done to the late king?

517
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,340
But I'm lacking in so much that I can't compare myself to the late king.

518
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,630
Are you?

519
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,140
By chance, if you get determined like the late king,

520
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,860
will you... please hold out your hand to me?

521
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,300
I will never make the same mistake like that again.

522
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,750
I'll keep that in mind, Your Highness.

523
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,630
I'm glad that it seems I got to know you a little today, My King.

524
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,080
It was my honor, Your Highness.

525
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,380
Please get some rest, then.

526
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,330
<i>[Your Majesty, I have something to give you secretly away from others' watchful eyes...]</i>

527
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,370
<i>His Majesty the King arrived.</i>

528
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,890
I'm sorry, My Lady. Did you wait long?

529
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,900
Please leave us alone for a moment.

530
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:39,560
Realizing you weren't coming, I came back quickly.

531
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,060
It was because I read the letter too late.

532
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,950
You must have been so busy that you couldn't read my letter.

533
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:50,660
In fact, Her Royal Highness the Queen Dowager paid me a visit, so we had a conversation.

534
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,320
What did you two talk about?

535
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,510
It was just a friendly visit.

536
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:04,750
Your Majesty, you're keeping more and more secrets that I shouldn't know about.

537
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,530
Then, what have you discussed with Her Majesty the Queen?

538
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,470
I mean, in front of the lake today.

539
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,880
Ah, did you see us?

540
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,080
Was I not supposed to see that?

541
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,630
No, it isn't that. We were talking about installing more concubines, My Lady.

542
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,420
Concubines...

543
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm sure you told her you didn't want that.

544
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,160
It's necessary to avert the Kim family's eyes.

545
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,520
If I throw a new family with power at them so that they can attack and bite each other,

546
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,530
their restraint on the royal authorities may get weakened.

547
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:36,680
- So, did you tell her you liked that idea?
- I did.

548
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,820
This is the queen's scheme!

549
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,460
- Lady Eui Bin.
- Why do you call me Eui Bin?

550
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,960
Why do you no longer call me by my given name?

551
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:52,440
You used to tell me that I was the one who made you both happy and sad, Your Majesty.

552
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,070
Now, the person who becomes your mood has changed?

553
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,540
- Hwa-jin...
- Please tell me your sincere feelings.

554
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,650
Your Majesty,

555
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,630
do you have feelings for the queen?

556
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,060
The base of western cuisine is sauces and dressings.

557
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,720
Especially since a dressing is like the flower of western cuisine.

558
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,810
Try it.

559
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,640
Wow, if I use this, will I be able to make soybeans taste similar to milk?

560
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,930
- By the way, why are you alone?
- Yes?

561
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,580
Oh, while focusing only on work, I missed the timing for getting married.

562
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,490
What about your parents and siblings?

563
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,640
In the year of Gihae (1839), all the Catholics were arrested and executed, so that's when I became alone.

564
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,780
Why did they believe in such a thing...

565
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,210
That's why I believe in nothing.

566
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,440
Ah, the Gihae Persecution...

567
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,610
You must be really lonely.

568
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:04,640
Well, it's not just one or two people who had such an experience.

569
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,770
Although it's a bit lonely to be alone during holidays,

570
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,530
one good thing is...

571
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:16,840
As all of them died at the same time on the same day, I can observe just one death anniversary for all of them.

572
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,450
What's this? What's wrong with all of you?

573
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:29,490
How did you all know that I get weak when a man's jjannae?
<i>(T/N: Modern slang - describes a person's sad and poor situation, also sounds the same as "salty scent.")</i>

574
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,430
- A salty scent, you say?
- The food will become too salty.

575
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,830
Originally, if a cook got sad, his or her food would get ruined because it became too salty.

576
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,490
Ah, I see, I know.

577
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,650
That's why, before coming into the royal kitchen,

578
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:46,350
I shake off all feelings of joy and sorrow.

579
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,900
But you were always worked up.

580
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,300
That's because, since Your Majesty started to come here, you've worked me up so much.

581
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,360
You should blame yourself for lacking training. Why blame me?

582
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,460
See? See, see?

583
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,680
"See, see?" Did you just drop your honorifics?

584
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,040
Please see, please see.

585
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,760
Oh! Oh, that pisses me off even more!

586
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,990
I should've just let you be behea—

587
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,520
Damn, I'm too soft-hearted.

588
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:28,300
It hasn't been too long since I had my meal.

589
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,650
I'm not sure either.

590
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:46,980
<i>Please don't eat it, but offer it to your skin.
<i>(T/N: A famous catchphrase for SKINFOOD, a Korean cosmetic company)</i></i>

591
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,170
This is how I can become irreplaceable.

592
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,330
On top of K-Food, now it's even K-Beauty.

593
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:03,760
Wow, this is the perfect weather to dry seeds.

594
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,030
Your Majesty the Queen.

595
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,530
I didn't see you at all yesterday,

596
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:30,710
so I wondered if you suffered from a hangover?

597
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,350
I apologize for leaving my post.

598
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,990
There's something I need to ask you.

599
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,230
Do you remember anything before you went into the Sigwol state?

600
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:51,980
Any suspicious or doubtful acts?

601
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,530
If you're asking about suspicious acts, who are you referring to?

602
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,290
Anyone.

603
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:03,240
You know actually, I think my fainting had something to do with the other side.

604
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,420
"The other side" meaning a "foreign force"?

605
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:14,520
Oh, no... What I meant was that whatever happened was natural.

606
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,760
You may be shocked to hear this, but I must tell you.

607
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,150
I am suspicious that the king was involved.

608
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:26,270
From what I have investigated so far, the very person who was going to harm you near Oktajeong

609
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,000
was under the king's command.

610
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,790
I'm sure you're very shocked.

611
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:36,110
How did you know that? No one else knows that but me.

612
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,390
You knew all along?

613
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:44,850
Oh, well... There were a lot of situations where we got tangled up so we just agreed to cover it up and let it slide.

614
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:48,400
You still did all that knowing everything, Your Majesty?

615
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,000
Regardless of what the king did, hasn't your love for him changed yet?

616
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,720
What? My love for him?

617
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,990
Why would you say something so disgusting!

618
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,540
I need to get along with the king in order for me to live well here,

619
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,470
so I'm just going with the flow!

620
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,790
How can you with that mindset—

621
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:09,230
I'm already having an identity crisis, so how can you say something like "my love for him"?

622
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,320
What's going on with the preparations to select concubines?

623
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,180
Court Lady Choi! Court Lady Choi!

624
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,370
Ladies! I'm here!

625
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,620
Where are they? The candidates for concubines?

626
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,000
They're right here.

<i>[Personal information of candidates]</i>

628
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:48,650
What is this? I have endured for the entire day, looking forward to this moment.

629
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:51,830
What the hell is this?

630
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:13,870
<i>There is no way that I can quit that magic glass...</i>

631
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:25,640
To do such things for the family...

632
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,960
What was the name of this again?

633
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,650
She called it "Mi In Mak" <i>(Mask for The Beauty).</i>

634
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,030
As I look for a replaceable thing,

635
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,410
she's showing off new skills?

636
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,400
<i>Your Royal Highness, it's Kim Byeong-in, the Director of the Royal Investigation Bureau.</i>

637
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,590
This late at night?

638
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,990
Come in.

639
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,300
I requested your father to tell you to pay a visit to me once in a while.

640
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,140
But don't you think this is too late at night?

641
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,680
I wasn't able to hear that message.

642
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,540
The reason I dared to look for you this late at night

643
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,420
was because I have to tell you something while avoiding my father's eyes.

644
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,970
I'm sure my father told you

645
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,270
that the king is different from the late king.

646
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,020
My father is wrong.

647
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,010
Don't follow me.

648
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:16,390
This isn't something great, but this is... red ginseng

649
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,480
I thank you.

650
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,160
But anyway everything is fine, right?

651
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,680
What do you mean?

652
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,030
Say what you really want.

653
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,600
What I want to say?

654
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:37,750
I just wanted to see how things were going.

655
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:43,590
By the way, it seems like Byeong-in is still in the palace.

656
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,290
Have you come, My Lord?

657
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,670
I'm home, Father.

658
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:55,850
You're late.

659
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:59,360
Ever since I got appointed to this position, I have not had enough time with my officers at the Royal Investigation Bureau.

660
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,460
I went out for a drink with them.

661
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,070
Good job.

662
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:05,940
It's late. Go in and get some rest.

663
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,120
Yes. Please continue talking.

664
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,800
Yes. Go rest.

665
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,970
- You.
- Yes, My Lord.

666
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:22,930
You look anxious.

667
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:27,160
Whenever you create a mess bigger than you can handle, you become anxious.

668
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,970
What do you mean?

669
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:35,250
Why don't you know that if you cause something dangerous, it will affect not only you but also the queen?

670
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,070
If I am anxious then it is because

671
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:42,190
I wasn't able to catch the person who harmed the queen.

672
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,990
Is that so?

673
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,500
Oh my! It's getting late and I'm keeping you up.

674
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,480
My purpose was to deliver this gift,

675
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,880
so now I will get going.

676
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,990
<i>I see he lost the ledger.</i>

677
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:05,130
<i>If it wasn't him, then Byeong-in acted alone?</i>

678
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,630
<i>Or could it be?</i>

679
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,020
Thank you for not letting it be me.

680
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,930
Finding a corpse with a similar build as her

681
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,950
took some time.

682
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,720
What kind of corpse was it?

683
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,630
It was a corpse, drowned, and submerged in water for a long time

684
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:54,870
so the face was hard to recognize.

685
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:02,130
<i>Please tell me your sincere feelings.</i>

686

<i> Your Majesty,</i>

687
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:09,460
<i>do you have feelings for the queen?</i>

688
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,210
<i>I— </i>

689
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,260
<i>I am someone who should not have any feelings for the queen.</i>

690
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,680
<i>You're not saying you don't have those feelings,</i>

691
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,390
<i>but that you shouldn't have them.</i>

692
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,180
<i>My Lady, this is Prince Yeongpyeong.</i>

693
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,730
Yes, please come in.

694
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:59,160
I'm sorry for coming this late at night. It's the news you've been waiting for.

695
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,820
Did you find Oh Wol?

696
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,900
Is this the item you gave to her, My Lady?

697
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,260
Yes. I'm sure of it.

698
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:22,430
I was told that the person who sold it was a palace maid.

699
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,100
Oh Wol is still alive.

700
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,890
That's a relief.

701
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:32,990
Why do they want water in the middle of the night?

702
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,570
They should've ordered me to do it earlier.

703
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,960
Is something stuck?

704
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,890
What is that?

705
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:07,490
We called a painter to make a composite of the palace maid who sold it.

706
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:10,230
After seeing that, we'll be more certain.

707
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:19,490
To be honest, I found something to help His Majesty—

708
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,500
<i>My Lady!</i>

709
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,520
In the well...

710
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,280
The well?

711
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,180
There was a corpse found in the well

712
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,170
and I think it was your maid, Oh Wol.

713
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,100
Oh Wol?

714
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,280
It may be a big shock, please allow me—

715
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,230
No.

716
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,460
I need to see her with my own eyes.

717
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,490
No!

718
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:35,820
Looks like she was left underwater for a long time.

719
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,040
It must have been awfully suffocating and painful.

720
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,060
Please stop.

721
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:11,900
I am only getting started.

722
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,490
My Lady...

723
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:16,920
I want to be alone.

729
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,920
What were you looking at?

730
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,840
I was just reading the arrears on letters of appeal.

731
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,120
Looking at you, My King, you're more enthusiastic than usual.

732
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:42,130
I got curious about your time at the queen's family home, so that's why I'm here.

733
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:47,090
It was the time when I could momentarily forgot the worries of the court.

734
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,320
That's a relief.

735
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:57,090
I wish that... you are happy, My King.

736

I'm grateful for that.

737

You went through a very hard time.

738
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,560
Have you forgotten already?

739
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:12,470
Maybe the thing called fate is handed down to the next generation of family.

740
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:15,050
If people stay still and know how to appreciate the current life,

741
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:20,460
both they themselves and the dear people around them will remain safe.
