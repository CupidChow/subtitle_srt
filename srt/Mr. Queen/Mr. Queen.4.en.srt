<i>We hereby notify you that the characters, people, and events in this drama are not based on historical fact, but were created as a work of fiction.</i>

4
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,210
<i>I smelled it last time, too.</i>

5
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,430
<i>It filled the room.</i>

6
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,980
<i>The fragrance that was also embedded in the sleeves...</i>

7
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,170
It was you.

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,060
You...

9
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,660
<i>Left sleeve in the worst case.</i>

10
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,310
What I need exactly right now is... you.
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

11
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,290
This tea.

12
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,520
I'm glad you're pleased.

13
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,640
<i>You've been pestering me in order to find out if I remember.</i>

14
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,000
Your Majesty, why are you so pale?

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,160
You're breaking out in a cold sweat, too!

16
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,280
I'm fine. It's because I'm tired after staying up last night.

17
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,040
This tea is very helpful for that.

18
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,450
Please have a cup and lay down.

19
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,060
Fix it.

20
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,920
You can drink it now.

21
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,510
I'll pour it. You may leave.

22
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,720
Try some. It's very fragrant.

23
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,780
<i>I've got to pretend I know nothing. That's the only way I'll stay alive.</i>

24
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,460
<i> But why does he keep on insisting on this tea?</i>

25
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,060
<i>No way... Poison!</i>

26
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,480
What's the matter?

27
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,280
The taste is...

28
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,720
so good.

29
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,180
That's a relief.

30
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,590
When did you have dinner?

31
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,140
<i>On an empty stomach, the poison will be more toxic.</i>

32
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,360
<i>That's what he's curious about.</i>

33
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,100
You seem to have a lot of interest in me.

34
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,820
I've just been busy.

35
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,900
I've always been interested in you and your family.

36
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,950
Then...

37
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,900
why don't you drink this...

38
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,460
in order to show your love?

39
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,470
If you insist.

40
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,760
<i>Was I wrong?</i>

41
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,200
This bas—

42
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,520
Since you spoke of showing love.

43
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,370
- What are you trying to do?
- Let go of me! I've got to throw up!

44
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,270
Are you saying that I tried to poison you?

45
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,800
Why? Is there a reason that I would?

46
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,170
Let's wait and see then.

47
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,070
If you're all right after time passes,

48
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,600
it will prove my innocence!

49
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
What if I don't agree?

50
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,170
The initial symptom of poisonous material is a numb tongue.

51
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,920
If it feels like your tongue is starting to become numb,

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,510
move this hand without hesitation.

53
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,510
Do you think I can't?

54
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,590
I think you can.

55
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,130
And very well at that.

56
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,430
You're so right.

57
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,310
<i>Even if I die, I won't die alone.</i>

58

<i>[A Man Who Knows Too... Much]</i>

59
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,560
- Her Majesty!
- I can't do this anymore!

60
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,010
I couldn't do it even if there was a knife to my throat!

61
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,470
I'm dying, too!

62
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,800
Damn it!

63
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,370
Be careful!

64
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,380
Are you going to hurt me while half asleep?

65
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,330
Something is real wrong.

66
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,810
What did you give me?

67
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,320
There's something I'm curious about.

68
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,440
The night I went to Eui Bin's quarters,

69
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,650
what were you doing?

70
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,180
I'm leaving. I've got to get out of here.

71
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,580
The road back is right in front of my eyes.

72
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,200
I can't die like this.

73
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,500
That night, what happened to you?

74
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,390
<i>It's too dangerous. I can't say a thing.</i>

75
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,020
I got it.

76
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,640
- What did you just say?
- That night...

77
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,470
you tried...

78
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,610
to kill me!

79
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,830
<i>She knows!</i>

80
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,160
While knowing that fact,

81
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,860
why did you keep it hidden until now?

82
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,910
What are you planning to do!

83
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,750
Since I didn't know,

84
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,290
thanks to the fragrance of that tea you drink, I only just realized it.

85
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,500
It's too bad!

86
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,230
If I had known sooner, I would have killed you.

87
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,650
Bastard. Even if you're crazy over another woman,

88
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,410
how could you try and kill your own wife?

89
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,460
How can you call yourself a human being?

90
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,210
Jo Hwa Jin was your concubine anyway!

91
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,610
Is legal adultery not enough for you?

92
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,550
Did you have to try and kill your wife?!

93
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,950
<i>She doesn't know the reason.</i>

94
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,600
Queen,

95
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,960
you heard something that night you shouldn't have.

96
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,790
What did you hear?

97
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,280
Answer me. What did you hear!

98
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,220
So there's another reason!

99
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,990
Underlying the action of trying to kill this woman,

100
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,710
there was a justifiable reason?

101
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,880
Is that what you're saying?

102
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,550
You have to be kidding me!

103
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,670
Whether it's because I heard something or because you're crazy about a woman,

104
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,530
there's only one reason for you to try killing me.

105
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,280
Because I'm weaker than you!

106
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,590
If I was stronger than you, you wouldn't have attacked me so easily.

107
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,650
Since I can be so easily killed,

108
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,370
I'm weaker than you!

109
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,890
That is the real reason!

110
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,260
Here. Go for it again!

111
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,590
Prove to me that you're just a murderer who kills those who are weaker than you!

112
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,470
Your Majesty!

113
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,220
How dare he think I'm an easy target!

114
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,930
If this were the original me, I would've knocked him out with just one punch!

115
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,550
What happened?

116
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,530
I thought I was the weak one fighting against the strong.

117
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,500
So my actions and methods...

118
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,470
I considered them to be fair.

119
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,890
The queen already knows... that I tried to kill her.

120
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,810
I thought there was sufficient reason why she deserved to be killed.

121
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,110
Not only because she overheard us,

122
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,160
but because she's the queen who condones and aids those people in their lawless acts.

123
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,310
So I believed that it was justified to kill her.

124
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,710
But that's just a cowardly excuse.

125
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,250
It's because I'm not confident enough to go up against the strong

126
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,760
that I tried to kill the weakest one, the queen.

127
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,870
- Your Majesty--
- If I fight against the weak,

128
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,620
how am I any different from those people?

129
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,960
You must concentrate on the fact that your goal is righteous.

130
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,340
If the results are just, the method will also become just.

131
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,110
The Kim Clan cannot be beaten with righteousness.

132
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,000
You must not waver.

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,080
I'm sure those people are scheming something scary.

134
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,000
No one else other than the queen knows right now

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,180
and since the queen only just realized it...

136
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,660
You must stop the queen from talking!

137
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,740
It's only a matter of time before they all find out!

138
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,900
I will not use these cowardly methods anymore.

139
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,270
Your Majesty!

140
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,160
I judged the queen merely on the fact that she's a part of the Kim family,

141
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,600
but all her actions keep going against my expectations.

142
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,520
<i>I'm not who you think I am!</i>

143
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,820
<i>What you see isn't everything!</i>

144
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,510
She told me she was a different person.

145
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,680
Maybe the queen was trying to tell me that she is different from the rest

146
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,810
and that she is someone who can make a different decision?

147
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,040
What are you expecting?!

148
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,110
The queen is also... a Kim.

149
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,360
I may just be a puppet king,

150
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,360
but they won't be able to do whatever they want just because of the queen's words.

151
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,200
Since they don't have solid proof,

152
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,780
I will watch to see what decision the queen makes.

153
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,590
With that, I'll be able to know what type of person she is.

154
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,840
<i>[General Store]</i>

155
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,620
I found out where this material came from,

156
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,730
but it's... inside the palace.

157
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,780
But it would've been too noticeable if they snuck out such a high valued product made for the king, though.

158
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,440
So, that means it could never have been done under any regular noble family's power.

159
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,400
Well, I'm not sure how much you will pay for my efforts.

160
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,800
I've gone through quite a trouble to find this out, Young Master.

161
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,640
Good job.

162
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:44,030
Going forward, if you have any other hard or dirty work to do, please let me handle all of it, sir.

163
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,370
From the palace, you say...

164
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,350
It won't be

165
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,130
enough to simply shake Eui Bin's mind only.

166
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,570
We need some chance to shake her mind more firmly.

167
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,910
At this moment, Eui Bin's weakness is the lake incident.

168
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,050
If you say so...

169
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,890
We can create a culprit for her.

170
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,580
Someone who doesn't have any power or allies,

171
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,090
like a fawn without parents.

172
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,260
A kid like that.

173
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,920
Has my opponent gambler gone somewhere?

174
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,560
What are you doing, not playing the game?

175
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,540
You wouldn't even notice even if I took everything you had, including your hair.

176
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,810
The thing is...

177
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,030
No, never mind.

178
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,480
You must have some concerns.

179
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,350
These days, I think there are many heinous criminals in the street market.

180
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,740
I newly became friends with a good man, named Lee Saeng-mang.

181
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,710
But I think,

182
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,100
he also got attacked by the horrible people wandering outside the palace.

183
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,090
He also...? Who else got attacked, too?

184
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,920
- You know how extraordinary my senses are.
- Sure.

185
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,190
You know my older cousin, Hyungnim Byeong-in,

186
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,660
was holding a piece of fabric from a jacket.

187
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,890
He seemed to have done some background checking on someone.

188
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,740
According to my sharp senses,

189
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,510
that jacket's owner, that heinous criminal,

190
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,770
I think he not only attacked my friend,

191
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,340
but also had some run in with Hyungnim Byeong-in.

192
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,060
What do you think?

193
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,060
In my opinion, a great talent like you, with such good senses, is being wasted at Sungkyunkwan,
<i>(T/N: The foremost educational institution during the late Goryeo and Joseon Dynasties)</i>

194
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,710
and that's a huge loss to Joseon.

195
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:24,190
I see you have sharp eyes, just like mine.

196
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,700
I'm sure something scary is happening right now.

197
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,740
Please spare me.

198
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,220
I'll do whatever you ask me to do, so please spare my life, please!

199
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,130
Sir! My Lord! My Lady!

200
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,460
I don't know who you are, but please, I'm begging you.

201
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,120
Please...

202
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,420
I've seen nothing!

203
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,670
Raise your head.

204
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,670
I won't! I don't want to die.

205
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,800
You won't be able to see my face anyway.

206
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,830
There are some words a higher-up wants to hear from you.

207
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,540
I... I know nothing.

208
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,910
What would a mere girl like me know, sir?

209
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,410
You know the culprit who tried to harm Her Majesty the Queen, by pushing her into the lake.

210
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,620
You should say that name to save your life.

211
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,370
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness.

212
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,080
Although its taste is disgusting, its effectiveness is good too.

213
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,070
Yesterday, the king's father-in-law <i>(Kim Moon-geun)</i> brought something very precious. If you drink it on an empty stomach,

214
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,010
your day will feel very much lighter.

215
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,200
He always manages to find something precious.

216
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,530
Since he's in charge of the tributes and gifts especially sent to the king

217
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,790
and working as the Advisor to the Saongwon office, I guess that helps him.

218
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,590
By the way, how is it going with the matter of Eui Bin?

219
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,350
As there was someone I could trust with this task, I've given him the order.

220
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,840
All right.

221
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,330
When it's finished today, I guess one of the matters causing wrinkles on my face will be gone.

222
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:49,030
Yes, they will never get away this time.

223
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,370
I heard that Kim Byeong-in

224
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,030
is following our trace, with the fabric cut from His Majesty's jacket.

225
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,830
I've taken care of your jacket. However, the queen now knows, so...

226
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,730
If Kim Byeong-in finds out everything and attacks me,

227
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,100
my judgment of the queen will be wrong.

228
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,480
This is a dangerous wager.

229
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,390
I know.

230
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,660
However, if my judgment is correct,

231
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,260
no innocent people will get harmed.

232
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,040
Today is the first day my father-in-law will be the Commander of the Royal Guards.

233
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,760
Your Majesty.

234
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,020
I thought you were still in the queen's quarters, so I came here to ready your office.

235
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,920
It's just because I had some knowledge to share with Prince Yeongpyeong secretly...

236
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,120
Is it that surprising?

237
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,960
Oh Ho, Head Eunuch!

238
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,460
<i>What a psychopath-like jerk. I thought of him as some absent-minded idiot, but it was all an act.</i>

240
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,620
<i>The king tries to kill his queen, himself...</i>

241
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,070
<i>If I reveal such a huge scandal like this, I will get involved in some useless stuff and get myself in more danger. </i>

242
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:49,470
<i>I will quietly hang out until the lake is filled with water. Then I can get back. </i>

243
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,540
Are your arms all right? You've been in that pose for a long time, Your Majesty.

244
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,270
I can keep my mind calmed down with this pose.

245
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,990
My tongue was babbling so independently. What on earth did he feed me?

246
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,280
Indeed, I should never let my guard down even for a moment.

247
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,590
<i>But if he wanted to kill me, he should've fed me a real poison. Why...</i>

248
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,680
Ah, whatever! I don't have to understand that psychopath's circumstances.

249
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,080
I'd better go check how much water the lake is filled with now.

250
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,350
Don't we have something like a whip? I'm in a hurry, you know.

251
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,690
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

252
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,190
Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager asked you to come.

253
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,810
Come on! My business with her was done!

254
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,310
Why does she keep summoning me? So bothersome.

255
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,210
<i>Cheer up! Everyone, gather more strength!</i>

256
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,670
What are you doing? Hurry up, move! Move, move!

257
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,370
Quickly, quickly. Hurry, hurry up.

258
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,140
It's urgent! Cheer up.

259
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,340
Careful. Hurry up.

260
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,110
I can't hold it anymore. I'll run to the toilet quickly.

261
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,420
Gosh, all right. Hurry up and come back quickly!

262
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:24,210
I heard you would come, so I was waiting for you, My Lord.

263
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,430
For what did you want to see me...

264
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,040
Her Royal Highness the Queen Dowager, is caring for you especially.

265
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
How grateful I am...

266
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,870
Because of debt, your younger sister became a slave in government employ, I heard.

267
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,130
Yes, My Lord. She's my one and only blood-related family.

268
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,850
I heard that you have a lot of concern for her.

269
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,340
To reinstate your sister's status, you're working very hard, aren't you?

270
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:53,220
Although I'm saving money, by all means, a huge amount of money is needed to begin with.

271
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,130
Queen Dowager deeply cares about you, so she has a suggestion for you.

272
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,940
This will be the opportunity of a lifetime for you.

273
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,930
How long do you think it will take?

274
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,700
She won't be able to resist too long.

275
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,340
Make her confess to this as well.

276
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,900
The person who sent this letter should be Queen Dowager.

277
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,520
I understand, My Lord.

278
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,730
If I take responsibility for such a big crime, it will harm not only me but also my sister, My Lord!

279
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,460
Don't worry about your sister at all.

280
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,600
With your sacrifice, your sister will gain a new life.

281
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,250
However...

282
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,730
How long your sister, that little young thing,

283
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,180
do you think would be able to endure such a hard life?

284
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,060
You can't guarantee that she won't get harmed by someone tomorrow, can you?

285
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,500
Get harmed...

286
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,500
Have you summoned me, Your Royal Highness?

287
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,820
The reason why I summoned you is that I'd like you to work on an important task.

288
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,420
<i>Damn, how bothersome. What does she want me to do now?</i>

289
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:18,240
Since I'm still lacking, it's too early for me to be in charge of an important task, Your Royal Highness.

290
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,570
Are you? Then, what can I say...

291
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:28,750
I'm thinking to appoint several more royal concubines. Excellent ladies who can make the king fall for them hard.

292
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,670
I will have to select them myself, then.

293
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,280
According to Mencius, if you strive for virtue, you will also gain a lot of help from people.

294
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,080
It's called, "Deuk-Do-Da-Jo."

295
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Although I'm lacking, I've been striving after virtue so far, so I have many people who can help me.

296
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,890
So I'll do my best for this matter.

297
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:50,400
By the way, what's the maximum number of concubines?

298
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,700
Maxi?

299
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:57,740
Ah, I mean, if we select the girls, as many as possible, how many girls would that be?

300
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,750
Well, I'm not sure. According to the "Book of Rites," an emperor can have

301
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,400
six "Goongs," three "Bu-ins," nine "Bins," twenty-seven "Se-bo,"

302
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,710
and eighty-one "Eo-cheop," so that he can listen to the world's inner minds... <i>(T/N: Different concubine ranks)</i>

303
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,560
Six plus three, plus nine,

304
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,620
plus twenty-seven and eighty-one more...

305
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,070
- But for us, let's make it three "Goong," thriftily.
- No way...

306
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,490
Yay!

307
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,570
You're absolutely right, Your Royal Highness.

308
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,990
Ah, since we already have one concubine, you're telling me to select two more.

309
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,760
No, please select three women.

310
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,130
There is one palace maid named Oh-wol, whom Eui Bin came with when she was appointed.

311
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,720
<i>Ah, that girl, accompanying her all the time?</i>

312
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,540
That girl misplaced her tongue. She might have thought it was out of her loyalty to Eui Bin,

313
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:56,680
but she blabbered that you had jumped into the lake in front of Jo Hwa-jin's eyes so that she would be framed as the culprit.

314
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,620
But that means the false alibi the king made to protect her was now broken by her own maid.

315
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,500
The king did?

316
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,960
Since we're about to take the king's favorite toy away, we're going to give him a gift of new toys.

317
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,820
Right, why don't you prepare my lunch today again, My Queen?

318
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,000
I can't eat any meal made by others anymore.

319
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,080
Ah, that would be difficult for me though...

320
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,760
What if you become younger than me after eating my healthy food every day?

321
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,000
That will put me in a very difficult position.

322
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,830
<i>Until the lake is filled with water, let's keep buttering her up. </i>

323
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,630
<i>In the end, things are turning out the way Kim So-yong had hoped.</i>

324
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,110
<i>She managed to get Jo Hwa-jin to fall into her trap.</i>

325
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,860
Hey, Lady, you're going to get punished by the heavens at this rate.

326
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,530
In the end, only Jo Hwa-jin ended up being pitiful.

327
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,610
But who cares? When I get back, it's got nothing to do with me.

328
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm too busy taking care of my fate to be worrying about someone else's.

329
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,000
Let's go in double-time speed.

330
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,620
Ladies, take your time. You'll fall over if you hurry.

331
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,630
Hurry, hurry!

332
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,250
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

333
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,680
That's it! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

334
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,700
That's it!

335
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,240
<i>Ah, this comfortable ride, only someone in another class level can enjoy this.</i>

336
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,060
<i>[Geum-wi-yeong (Royal Guard Barracks)]</i>

337
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,870
Great!

338
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,110
Welcome, My Lord.

339
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,770
Today is your last day here, Prince Yeongpyeong.

340
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,640
You must be sad.

341
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,380
Not at all, because you will run it better than I did.

342
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,280
Well...

343
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,900
That's a very handsome horse.

344
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,560
This is the warhorse that His Majesty has bestowed on the Commander of the Royal Guards.

345
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,560
- Why don't you try riding him?
- No way.

346
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,240
It has been a while since the last time I rode a horse.

347
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,680
Also, until I get His Majesty's decree from today's throne room meeting, I'm not officially appointed yet.

348
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,600
About this horse, I'll take time to ride it.

349
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,260
My Lord, do you even know how to ride a horse?

350
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,180
Who are you...

351
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm His Majesty's best friend,

352
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,860
as well as one of the five most attractive men in the palace, selected by palace maids—

353
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,190
You don't really have to know him, My Lord.

354
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,590
That's because Prince Yeongpyeong was not on that list.

355
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:19,490
By the way, you don't have the body shape to ride a horse.

356
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,460
Especially since this horse is too tall,

357
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,540
I doubt you can get into the saddle with those legs.

358
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,330
What are you talking about? When I was young,

359
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,970
my horseback riding skills were so excellent that I could ride a horse without holding the reins.

360
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,600
How comfortable I felt on top of a horse! Sometimes,

361
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,750
I even fell asleep on it, dreaming.

362
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,340
Gosh, it's true! Let me prove it. Here, hold this for me.

363
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,690
If you don't really have to ride it, why are you going overboard...

364
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,500
Gosh, I mean it.

365
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,510
I'm not going overboard.

366
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,040
Or I am...

367
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,680
Here, please.

368
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,480
Just a sec, hold on.

369
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,220
How is it? Wasn't it easy?

370
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,620
Ah, I got it!

371
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,560
<i>Aigoo, that hurts...</i>

372
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,820
- My Lord!
- Ah, my legs...

373
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,160
My legs, legs...

374
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,860
Potatoes, salt, and woo-yu. <i>(T/N: Modern Korean term for milk)</i>

375
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,800
Woo-yu?

376
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,640
I've never heard of it.

377
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,430
- In this era, the word is tarak <i>(dairy)</i>.
- Ah, I see.

378
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,080
She would use that precious tarak again as if it was water.

379
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,040
They won't have butter though...

380
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,910
- Do you have black pepper?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:21,640
She would throw black pepper, which is more valuable than gold as if it was sand.

382
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,440
No need to say anymore. I won't tell her anything.

383
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,520
I can hear everything though.

384
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,760
Your Majesty!

385
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,720
I told you to take your time. Why are you running?

386
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,290
But Court Lady Choi was also coming in with me.

387
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,690
She's quite old. What if she collapsed from running for no reason?

388
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,670
I'm here! Court Lady Choi is here.

389
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,630
Although I might be a bit late,

390
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,620
I will never collapse, Your Majesty.

391
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,690
She has some tenacity.

392
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,840
- Pour it all.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,990
What the?

394
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,470
- Are you kidding me?
- Well, the thing is...

395
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,480
Your Majesty, do you know how precious and scarce milk is?

396
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,690
I'm using it now because it's precious.

397
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,760
Because 80% of cooking is from the quality of the ingredients.

398
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,440
If we squeeze all milk out of a cow, its calf will starve.

399
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,100
She even has good notions, too.

400
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,200
How sad.

401
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,770
But there is a thing called intermittent fasting. Fasting once in a while is good for health.

402
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,990
So, the milk should be up to this line.

403
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,810
If it's a drop less than that, you know what's coming, eh?

404
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,880
Y-Yes, Your Majesty.

405
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,670
What a... Geez.

406
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,400
Who are you? How dare, a girl coming in the Royal Kitchen—

407
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,140
A cough! Cough...

408
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,990
Come over here.

409
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,870
- What's your name?
- It's Dam-hyang, Your Majesty.

410
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,130
But I see we have a dog in the palace.

411
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,590
That Sir Dog has a higher official position than mine.

412
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,230
A dog brought here by Ming's ambassador

413
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,640
is that dog's prestigious bloodline or whatever.

414
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,880
If you say Ming, it's more than 200 years ago.

415
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,490
During that long period of time, if that dog's line was bred with other breeds,

416
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,970
this is just a mutt.

417
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,630
What's this mutt's name?

418
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,630
It doesn't have any name, Your Majesty.

419
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,590
Yeah? Then, let's call him Daeng-daeng-yi.

420
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,160
Daeng-daeng-yi?

421
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,650
See?

422
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:11,980
If we see these letters, Meong-Meong-Yi, in a different way,
<i>(T/N: 'meong-meong' is a Korean way of saying 'bow-wow')</i>

423
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:18,910
Daeng, Daeng. It looks like "Daeng-Daeng-Yi," right?

424
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,250
That's why his name is Daeng-Daeng-Yi.

425
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,630
Ah, Daeng-Daeng-Yi.

426
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,150
You keep checking out this place because you're hungry, don't you?

427
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,030
Wait a sec.

428
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,910
Ta-da!

429
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,110
Eat it.

430
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,920
Why aren't you eating it?

431
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,080
I can't eat it because it's too precious, Your Majesty.

432
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,780
Don't worry, this isn't for free.

433
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,110
After finishing it, you should help me peel potatoes.

434
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,240
She can't.

435
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,790
Your Majesty is a member of the royal family, so I can let you cook,

436
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,450
but the food in this Royal Kitchen is traditionally not supposed to have anything touched by females,

437
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,420
except for when the dishes are decorated and placed on a table or it's being served...

438
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,160
Such a lowly wench without any official position—

439
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,660
I mean, a child, that child can't dare

440
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,790
to join us in cooking.

441
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,200
Gosh, what a kkondae!
<i>(T/N: Kkondae - snobbish old man )</i>

442
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,760
You try it too, <i>"Kkondae!"</i>

443
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,700
Kkondae.

444
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,440
Good girl, you say it so clearly.

445
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,940
Same for this, you can change its letter to <i>"Kkonmeo."</i>

446
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,830
Go ahead, eat it.

447
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,880
It really feels like eating a cloud, Your Majesty.

448
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,210
You have a knack for describing the taste.

449
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,220
You can be on a <i>"Mukbang"</i> too.
<i>(T/N: 'Mukbang' - media show in which a host consumes large quantities of food while interacting with the audience.) </i>

450
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,270
By the way, isn't she too young to come into the palace?

451
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,610
Her parents couldn't avoid taxes and got caught before running away.

452
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,110
So all her family became slaves as government employees.

453
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,620
I heard her father ran away by himself.

454
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,060
Gosh, how could he call himself her father...

455
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,960
Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen!

456
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,410
How could you say such things in front of the kid?

457
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,600
Dam-hyang, you should see and hear only good things. Okay?

458
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,510
<i>Daeng-cheong-yi!</i> Say it.
<i>(T/N: "Meong-cheong-yi" means 'idiot' but she's switched meo and dae)</i>

459
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,680
Daeng-cheong-yi.

460
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,920
<i>[Daeng-cheong-yi to Meong-cheong-yi (idiot)]</i>
Idiot?!

461
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,970
Why do you make a potato ongsimi so big?
<i>(T/N: ongsimi - a Korean food, similar to gnocchi)</i>

462
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,190
Why does it take so long to get milk?

463
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,260
Your Majesty!

464
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,280
I've squeezed out all of the milk

465
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,010
from every single cow in the place!

466
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,490
I mean, good job.

467
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

468
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,500
Oh, tarak <i>(dairy)</i> porridge?

469
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,270
Oh no, in such a precious tarak porridge, you're putting ongsimi?

470
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,810
No, no...

471
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,700
Come on, geez. Are you my mother-in-law?

472
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,590
These days, even mothers-in-law are cautious in the way they treat their daughters-in-law.

473
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,400
What? Mothers-in-law are

474
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,870
cautious around daughters-in-law... What kind of degenerate world is this!

475
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,160
I'll serve it myself.

476
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,780
It's delicious.

477
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,410
However, it's a bit cooled down, so it thickened.

478
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:56,120
And it's a huge waste to lose such precious tarak porridge dripping off the plate.

479
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,180
Well, it can't always be perfect, I guess.

480
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,330
What's the point of making the food perfectly, when the serving can't be done perfectly?

481
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:13,480
How can I deliver the dish without letting anything spill or get cold?

482
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,830
That's the key point.

483
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,010
Oh, the master of life!

484
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,220
- Checkmate.
- I've told you several times to glue it,

485
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,070
but you haven't done it yet?

486
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,250
- Your Majesty the Queen!
- Your Majesty!

487
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,360
A palanquin... I need a palanquin for food.

488
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,590
Your Majesty!

489
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,150
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

490
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,590
A palanquin for food, Your Majesty?

491
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,780
- A palanquin for food...
- What's that?

492
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,400
- A palanquin for food?
- A palanquin for food?

493
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,330
(Do you know) A palanquin for food?

494
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:51,510
A palanquin for food... What do you mean?

495
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,950
Careful, be careful.

496
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,980
- God...
- Huh?

497
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,610
Her Majesty the Queen is coming!

498
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,420
Hurry, one, two, one, two!

499
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,880
- One, two, one, two!
<i>- One, two!</i>

500
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,990
One, two!

501
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,240
One, two...

502
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,550
<i>[Chun-dang - Pond of Spring]</i>

503
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,950
It's still at this level?

504
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,690
<i>One, two, one, two...</i>

505
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,490
- Is it really true that you've worked all night long?
- Yes.

506
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:26,230
We've even used the next shift's people to carry and pour water all night long,

507
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,490
but since this was quite a big lake, to begin with.

508
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,180
Draining it took just one day, but why does filling it back up take so much time?

509
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:37,850
This lake is located on high ground, so draining can be easily done by just one furrow...

510
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:43,760
The way I see it, you guys must have been slacking off because there was no manager.

511
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:58,480
Tonight, after finishing the dinner shift, how about going for a drink together?

512
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,430
I asked you, what do you think? Huh?

513
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,940
What do you think! These punks...

514
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,670
Oh, what brought you here alone?

515
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,200
Her Majesty ordered you to serve some cool beverages.

516
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,310
Her Majesty did?

517
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,560
Is that so?

518
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,890
Then, shall I make a simple Dugyeon fruit punch?

519
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:32,640
<i>In a juice of omija preserves, made after the first frost,
(T/N: Omija - fruit of the schisandra chinensis vine) </i>

520
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,520
<i>add honey to emphasize its sweetness. </i>

521
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,890
<i>With pieces of pear and mandarin oranges, the refreshing taste is added. </i>

522
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,630
<i>Then, it will be refreshing enough without using ice extravagantly. </i>

523
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:49,560
<i>Usually an azalea petal is used, but as they aren't available now, I'll use an evening primrose after removing the stamen, </i>

524
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,330
<i>coating it with starch, blanch it in boiling water, and cool in cold water.</i>

525
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,200
<i>Add all these pieces to the punch bowl. </i>

526
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,850
<i>The last touch is with three pine nuts, like the final stroke on a painting of a dragon!</i>

527
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,110
Well, I can make this kind of beverage even while closing my eyes, like this!

528
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:20,030
I saw you make it with your eyes wide open.

529
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,630
Why did she stare at me only?

530
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,830
I feel so shy now.

531
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,590
Cheer up, all of you. Cheer up.

532
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,370
Your Majesty, here is the beverage you mentioned.

533
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,430
Let me see...

534
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:05,530
I'm not in a good situation right now, but they say that if I can't avoid it, I'd better enjoy it.

535
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,980
Ah, good!

536
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,610
Hey!

537
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:18,750
How long do you think it will take?

538
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,900
At this speed, maybe within tonight...

539
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,520
By sunset.

540
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,630
That's definitely not possible.

541
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,910
Gosh, then finish it by the end of today.

542
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,180
Or you will lose your neck!

543
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

544
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:38,510
<i>One, two, one, two!</i>

545
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,850
Tell the Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen,

546
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,880
to serve one bowl of this per person for everyone here.

547
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,620
<i>One, two, one, two!</i>

548
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,500
To these many people?

549
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,870
<i>One, two, one, two!</i>

550
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,730
<i>One, two, one...</i>

551
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,940
Seeing her running here already, she must have fallen for my skill.

552
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,150
It must be an order to make one more bowl of beverage.

553
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,560
All right, please go ahead.

554
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,590
Her Majesty ordered you to serve the beverage again.

555
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,220
I knew she would say that.

556
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:20,870
Well, how was it? Did she drop the bowl because it was so delicious?

557
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:25,020
Or... did she cry?

558
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,250
Court Lady Choi,

559
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:33,030
I'm such a man, you know!

560
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,450
<i>Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen! Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen!</i>

561
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,860
Drop it, you rascals.

562
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,390
Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen, the thing is—

563
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:45,880
Oh, don't worry, I'll make another bowl for you too.

564
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:52,760
Court Lady Choi, you must like my beverage 'berry' much, too.

565
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,240
He changed very to "berry: from beverage!

566
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,150
Wasn't it funny? Right?

567
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,750
I'll make one more bowl for you. Please wait there.

568
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:18,800
While making one more bowl, please make a few more.

569
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,690
S-Sure, how many more?

570
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,800
- Here it is.
- It's so good!

571
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

572
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,290
Thank you, Your Majesty!

573
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,220
<i>It's so delicious!</i>

574
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,320
Tasting such a precious drink. Thank you, Your Majesty!

575
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,560
What a relief you know that.

576
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,020
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

577
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,190
<i>- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!</i>

578
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,170
All right, all right, sure. It was nothing special.

579
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,110
Drink it, drink it!

580
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,390
It's really delicious!

581
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,220
How easy it is to order them around...

582
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,960
My perfect skill of staking out, fooling even those birds!

583
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,480
I've been standing here so long,

584
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,230
so what good timing when I'm so thirsty!

585
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,860
You've been working so hard since yesterday.

586
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,430
Although I'm not sure what you're actually doing.

587
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,500
Can you see me?

588
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,020
Of course, when you're as noticeable as this.

589
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,130
N-Noticeable...

590
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,130
T-That's what I'm saying.

591
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,090
Earlier, two palace maids were talking about all sorts of stories, without realizing I was here.

592
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:56,800
Now I need to go to assist Her Majesty.

593
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,210
The bowl, please.

594
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,960
Since my identity was caught, that's it for today.

595
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,160
<i>"When she noticed my existence, </i>

596
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,350
<i>I went to her and became her flower boy."
(T/N: a parody of Kim Chun Su's poem, 'Flower')</i>

597
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,400
You'll get hurt.

598
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,770
Please don't pick them with your bare hands.

599
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,230
<i>My heart, willing to get hurt, </i>

600
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,020
<i>that's love.</i>

601
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,280
I ordered our people to ask around.

602
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,260
I’m sure it’s nothing serious. So you have nothing to worry about.

603
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:28,800
Oh Wol is not the kind of person who leaves without saying a word. I’m sure something happened to her.

604
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,190
<i>Her Royal Highness the Queen Dowager is here.</i>

605
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,240
Your Royal Highness.

606
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,610
All of you leave.

607
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,280
Mark my words with what I'm about to tell you now.

608
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,920
The only person you can trust in this palace right now is me. I'm the only one in the same boat.

609
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,160
You must tell me everything without hiding anything from me.

610
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,210
That’s the only way to save that girl as well as us.

611
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:34,310
This is really nice.

612
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,790
Me, Prince Yeongpyeong, and even the Head Eunuch.

613
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:47,730
Head Eunuch, last time the Queen coveted my "Book of Changes," I asked you to get me a new copy. Did you get it?

614
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,230
I beg your pardon?

615
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:54,310
You never ordered me to do anything like that.

616
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:58,550
Oh dear, Head Eunuch. Are you losing your memory with age?

617
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:04,230
I clearly told you to do it. Go to the Royal Libray and give them my orders, right now.

618
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,120
Do you want me to go there right now?

619
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,460
Then, will you forget it again?

620
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,590
After escorting Your Majesty to Daejojeon Hall, I'll follow up with your order.

621
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:18,640
I am not going alone, Prince Youngpyeong is escorting me, what are you worried about?

622
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,150
Hurry up and go!

623
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,220
Yes, I'll do it.

624
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,610
Ouch!

625
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,150
Oh, that was like a rock!

626
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,520
Head Eunuch! Are you hurt?

627
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,660
I'm fine. I'm fine.

628
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,560
I think your nose is broken.

629
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,530
That's the way my nose normally looks!

630
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,360
No way! How can a person have a nose like that?

631
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,050
Let's go to the clinic right now.

632
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,940
Good Heavens! I said I'm fine!

633
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:17,940
Oh Wol accompanied Eui Bin to the palace the day the queen fell into the lake.

634
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,160
I think they're intending to make her give false testimony.

635
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,150
All this happened as soon as the queen found out that you were the person who aimed the sword at her.

636
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,880
They're trying to get rid of Eui Bin, not me.

637
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,410
Revenge. Is this the queen’s choice?

638
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,570
Your Majesty.

639
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,370
Hwa Jin.

640
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,690
I apologize.

641
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:55,060
It's not something you need to apologize for since all this happened because of me.

642
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,240
What are you saying?

643
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,630
Recently, I tried to get rid of the queen by my own hands.

644
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:10,240
And now she's trying to get revenge by framing you for the lake incident.

645
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,830
It's a tactic frequently used by those people, ensnaring an innocent person with false evidence.

646
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,930
I’ll tell everyone I tried to kill the queen.

647
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,740
Your Majesty!

648
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,940
You and I know a lot about vengeance, don't we?

649
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,520
Paying them back in the exact same way. That's revenge.

650
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,360
The queen is trying to hold a knife to Eui Bin's neck, just like I did to her.

651
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:43,080
The only other way to quell her vengeance is for me to... drop to my knees.

652
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,200
That is all.

653
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,270
The queen has planned this since the beginning in order to falsely accuse me.

654
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:54,060
If I step up, this will be over.

655
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,950
You still have a cause to carry out, Your Majesty.

656
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:02,720
Please remember what you've been preparing for the past two years while tolerating all these humiliations in this palace.

657
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,680
For the cause... you need to evade this matter.

658
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,220
I have never once wanted to be king.

659
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,430
Even more so, a puppet king.

660
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:22,450
But there's only one reason I set foot in this palace.

661
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,190
In order to not run away anymore.

662
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,490
So please don't tell me to run away.

663
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,420
I will not run away anymore.

664
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:51,660
I will search every corner of this palace and find Oh Wol.

665
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,260
I'm sure she's being interrogated inside the palace,

666
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:59,010
so they can punish Eui Bin as soon as they obtain false testimony.

667
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:03,770
Until I find her... please hold on.

668
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:05,160
I understand.

669
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,260
But in the final moment, I will step forward.

670
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:14,070
When that time comes, none of you should come forward. This is a royal command.

671
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,900
We have lost too many people.

672
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:22,200
I don't... intend on losing anyone today.

673
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,200
You must... never get hurt.

674
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,100
I won't get hurt.

675
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:47,480
Whether I kneel down more as they want or insist that it's a misunderstanding,

676
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,630
I will do my best not to get hurt.

677
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,430
Your Majesty...

678
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:14,450
All of you, prepare yourselves with proper outfits.

679
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:20,200
What we are looking for is a servant and she's inside the palace.

680
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:26,840
You must pay special attention and do your utmost to go unnoticed more so than any other time.

681
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,550
I'm dying of boredom.

682
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,140
Is there anything I can do to ease this boredom?

683
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:58,160
Your Highness, these are silk threads from the Qing Dynasty that I've obtained.

684
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,480
You've been carrying these with you every day?

685
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,570
I had hoped you would want to go back to your hobby.

686
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,700
I'm sorry, but it's a "no thank you."

687
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,520
I don't know whether I'm sewing or pricking my finger.

688
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,220
That's why... I got this ready for you.

689
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:19,800
Are you telling me to "eat taffy?"
<i>(T/N: ''eat taffy" means the same as "the finger"/f*** you)</i>

690
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,440
Why are you calling a thimble "taffy"?

691
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,720
Do you want to eat taffy, Your Majesty?

692
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:30,210
Court Lady Choi, do you really not know what this means?

693
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:35,470
Hong Yeon, you too?

694
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,600
Does the thimble have some kind of meaning?

695
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,870
I only prepared it so that you wouldn't prick your finger.

696
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:49,020
It just doesn't really sit right with me.

697
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,950
Your Majesty! I was worried!

698
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:05,690
You arrived first, Head Eunuch.

699
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,450
I was walking in order to maintain a king's dignity, so I arrived late.

700
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,600
Is the queen inside?

701
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,470
I hear she's at the lake.

702
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:21,460
For what reason?

703
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:27,570
What Eui Bin said isn't that different from what His Majesty has said.

704
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:31,680
That night, she didn't see the queen

705
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,030
and said she only ran away after hearing a loud noise.

706
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm not certain whether or not she's telling the truth.

707
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,210
The woman Dosulli (Head Sulli) and the workers saw while stealing the gifts for the king was...

708
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:49,880
really... Eui Bin, it seems.

709
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,040
Did she end up falling into the trap the queen set for her?

710
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,260
Before she even got to spread her wings?

711
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:05,560
Your Highness, Lady Eui Bin is headed to Tongmyeongjeon. <i>(Grand Queen Dowager's quarters)</i>

712
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:27,350
<i>I will protect you, My Lord.</i>

713
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:36,200
She came on her own.

714
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,640
She must be closer to Oh Wol than we thought.

715
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,570
I'm glad. Things are working out smoothly.

716
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:46,460
She came on her own, so please make her confess to it willingly.

717
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:51,130
There's nothing more important than health, so let's finish up first.

718
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,760
You are quite right, indeed.

719
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,220
It's so unfair.

720
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,500
My Lady Hwa-jin would never do that.

721
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:56,580
Even if you kill me, the truth doesn't change.

722
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:07,900
Poor thing. You're just like a dog that's

723
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,420
licking the fingers of the owner who's out to kill you.

724
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,350
It's too late now, even if you confess.

725
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,940
Your Lady framed you as the culprit.

726
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,280
That's impossible...

727
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:37,660
Here. Oh, not bad! There.

728
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:48,370
- Ouch! Damn it.
- Such valuable thread...

729
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:52,660
This is the issue with valuable things. They're too delicate!

730
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:58,270
Let me see if there's a tougher and stronger thread.

731
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,430
<i> Giving up my false self...</i>

732
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,750
<i>- Giving up my false self?</i>
- Is this...

733
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:15,480
You embroidered it whenever you had a chance up until recently!

734
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,960
I don't know the meaning since I can't read, but I'm sure it's a beautiful poem.

735
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,470
I have never seen it before.

736
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:27,320
Strangely, she embroidered on something else whenever Court Lady Choi came by.

737
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,980
It's a love poem, isn't it?!

738
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,850
<i>This is... a will!</i>

739
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:39,310
- You're saying that before I fell into the lake, I embroidered this. Right?
- Yes.

740
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:43,070
Wasn't I also unable to sleep and had no appetite?

741
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,530
Yes, and you would keep sighing heavily.

742
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,670
And I also looked gloomy all the time?

743
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,390
You would cry for no reason, too.

744
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:54,280
- Huh?
- Your Majesty! Your memory came back finally!

745
01:06:54,280 --> 01:07:00,580
No. Did I freely give away things I treasured to those around me?

746
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,870
You gave this to me.

747
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:10,540
You used to treasure it so much. Also, you gave a ring to Court Lady Choi.

748
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,280
<i>Jo Hwa-jin was wrong!</i>

749
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,790
<i>Kim So-yong wasn't trying to ensnare Jo Hwa-jin.</i>

750
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,680
<i>She killed herself.</i>

751
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,870
Isn't that Cheoljong?

752
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,270
His Majesty the King!

753
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,800
Didn't he tell me a king doesn't run?

754
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,030
Oh, seeing that face makes my blood pressure go up!

755
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:39,100
What's up with him? Are you asking for a fight?!

756
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,240
You want to go at it!

757
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,480
Is this it? Is this your decision?

758
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,040
- What are you talking about all of a sudden?
- Are you pretending not to know anything again?

759
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:54,070
Was I fooled by your lying eyes and speech?

760
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:58,470
You're the one who's been fooling everyone all along, not me.

761
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:01,550
I slept in the same room with you, not realizing you're the bastard who tried to kill me.

762
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,850
Shouldn't I be the one who's angry, not you?!

763
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:06,480
You told me yourself,

764
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,470
how cowardly it is to hurt the weak.

765
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:16,860
If it's revenge... if that is the reason why you're using the same tactic,

766
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,180
I will not just stand by and watch either.

767
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,960
What is he talking about?

768
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,940
Seriously...

769
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:48,590
What?

770
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,120
What should I do...

771
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,610
with this weak and foolish child?

772
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:35,890
Your Royal Highness, if you seek to punish someone, please punish me only.

773
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:40,350
Who do you think I'm trying to punish that you're uttering those words?
<i>[Tongmyeongjeon]</i>

774
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:44,990
My servant, Oh Wol, whom I brought with me has disappeared.

775
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,780
You're saying I did it? For what reason?

776
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:52,020
Since there's something you wish to hear.

777
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:57,990
What you want to hear, I will say it for you.

778
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:02,180
Let me hear it then.

779
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:08,770
The moment the queen fell into the lake, I was with her.

780
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,950
<i>You will also surely...</i>

781
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:16,490
<i>lose someone precious to you!</i>

782
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:37,570
Overwhelmed by momentary feelings,

783
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,160
I pushed Her Majesty the Queen into the lake.

784
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:57,410
So please punish me only and spare the innocent child!

785
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:03,090
The sins I have committed, I will take with me.

786
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,580
Is that so?

787
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:16,450
You must know very well the contents of this letter.

788
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:20,190
Since it's a letter you received from Queen Dowager Jo.

789
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:24,450
That child, Oh-wol, gave it up.

790
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:27,820
The location, date, and time that's written in this letter,

791
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,420
aligns with the accident that the queen endured.

792
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,400
What do you think this means?

793
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,400
I have... never received such a letter!

794
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:44,790
Did you think you could step forward and cover all of this yourself?

795
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,280
You must really think highly of yourself.

796
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,760
You're no more than a mere tail.

797
01:11:56,410 --> 01:12:02,250
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager, that letter is definitely false!

798
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,300
That's not possible!

799
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:09,080
As part of the same Jo family, it's obvious that the Queen Dowager and Eui Bin aimed for the same goal!

800
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,930
Queen Dowager would never take part in such a heinous act

801
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:17,390
just because she is part of the same family as Eui Bin!

802
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:23,540
Then, exactly who made up this falsified letter?

803
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,520
You must have needed someone...

804
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,700
in order to get powerful support for your plan.

805
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,990
<i>His Majesty the King!</i>

806
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:43,950
Your Majesty...

807
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:46,270
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

808
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,260
You're here. I'm glad.

809
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,150
Eui Bin just gave her confession,

810
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:55,550
that she harmed the queen by pushing her into the lake.

811
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,110
That is a false confession!

812
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:02,650
Your Majesty, watch your words!

813
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:06,530
No matter how much you've fallen for a woman,

814
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:11,570
if your judgment is so cloudy, how can I leave you to take care of the royal court properly?!

815
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:16,200
Are you protecting this cunning culprit?!

816
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,820
She tried to harm your wife, the queen!

817
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,680
Confess it yourself clearly!

818
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,330
Who tried to harm the queen?

819
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:39,290
I did.

820
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,950
Eui Bin...

821
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:46,630
You heard it for yourself.

822
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:56,160
If you wish to insist that you alone planned and carried it out, I will give you an opportunity to prove yourself.

823
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,690
You may enter now!

824
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,400
We got the confession we wanted. What should we do with her now?

825
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,970
Tend to her wounds since we need her as a witness when we receive the order.

826
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,760
What's going on?

827
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:00,730
Catch them!

828
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:27,290
If you admit your sin here before me and agree to be beheaded,

829
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:31,220
I will not doubt your sincerity.

830
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:45,500
<i>They said that Cheoljong has a nightmare every night that he's beheaded.</i>

831
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,940
<i>He's totally frozen. They're doomed.</i>

832
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,550
I will admit to the truth.

833
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:12,150
I will accept your punishment, Grand Queen Dowager!

834
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:15,430
The one who should be beheaded is not Consort Eui Bin!

835
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:23,170
Your Majesty...

836
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,840
please...

837
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:36,130
Are you going to disobey my royal order?

838
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:14,730
Cheoljong, that bastard... he's so cool.

839
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,160
<i>Why is he being so gloriously cool all by himself?</i>

840
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:30,750
<i>Hold on, by tonight, the lake will be filled and I'll get back.</i>

841
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:33,610
The one who tried to harm the queen is...

842
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:35,760
Wait!

843
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,110
What's the matter?

844
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:04,060
There's no more water!

845
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,820
What?!

846
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:13,960
We took so much water that the well seems to have dried up.

847
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,950
Now I'm... dead.

848
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:55,160
Since I'm the one who's at the heart of the matter, I will reveal the truth.

849
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,160
I...

850
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,250
tried to take my own life.

851
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:18,160
<i>Did you think I'd let you act all cool by yourself? I'm the hero here.</i>

852
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:26,670
<i>I'm going back home, so it doesn't matter.</i>

853
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:34,000
So no innocent person's blood should be shed.

854
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:41,030
<i>Now that is awesome!</i>
