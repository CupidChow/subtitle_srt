00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,030
No, wait. That's not what I meant.

5
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,480
<i>Then, is there only the last resort?</i>

6
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,010
<i>He's fast.</i>

7
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,700
- What is this?
- That's what I wanted to say.

8
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,790
I figured we only needed the moonlight while we are drinking so I blew out the flame.

9
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,530
<i>[Episode 2 ]</i>
Well, I just wanted to loosen up our throats before we started drinking for real.

10
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,480
- You could say it's like a warmup of sorts.
- I see.

11
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,970
Like this?

12
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,940
- So...
- What the heck are you doing, Mister!

13
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,100
We are loosening each other's throats.

14
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,530
- <i>That evil little bastard, did it on purpose.</i>
- You just...

15
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,090
<i>Are you done? As if.</i>

16
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,300
Well, now that our throats are prepared, let's start drinking in earnest, My Queen.

17
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,250
Drinking alone isn't any fun!

18
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,880
Oh, my mind, I didn't realize...

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,640
There.

20
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,840
Thanks to the warm-up, the alcohol goes down easily.

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,370
<i>Huh? Then what were you doing this whole time?</i>

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,880
There. Drink up!

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,450
Here.

24
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,170
You should have plenty as well.

25
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,320
The king should drink up first.

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,800
The queen should drink up first.

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,180
<i>He's changed his tactics.</i>

28
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,940
<i> I know all your dark thoughts well.</i>

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,660
Then let's each have a drink in good favor

30
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,610
and retire since it was an exhausting day.

31
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,640
Like hell. We were just getting started!

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,580
Let's not do that and take this lovely one-shot like a man!

33
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,730
One sho—

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,300
I have sensitive sleeping habits, so make sure to keep your distance.

35
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,580
<i>What kind of crappy tactic is that?</i>

36

<i>[Wins in the morning and withdraws at night.]</i>

37
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,180
Oh, I see...

38
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,540
<i>The king who was known for his love of alcohol and women...</i>

39
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,000
<i>I was scared for no reason!</i>

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,460
<i>Still, I can't let my guard down.</i>

41
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,400
<i>I'm finally using the granny knot I learned during my military service.</i>

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,340
<i>He'll have to cut it to get this off.</i>

43
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,190
Okay.

44
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,430
<i>This selfish king bastard. He's hogging the comfortable blankets to himself.</i>

45
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,020
Queen, it is not that I do not understand how you feel;

46
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,400
however, I wish to merely sleep tonight.

47
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,110
It's not that. I was brought up very delicately, so I can't sleep on the bare floor.

48
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,230
Just give me one.

49
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,950
If even one layer is missing from a 3-layer bed, I can't sleep.

50
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,030
I doubt you were brought up more delicately than the king.

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,560
<i>It's a historical distortion. He's nothing but a young master of Ganghwa.</i>

52
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,890
<i>I hope he gets sleep paralysis.</i>

53
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,020
<i>Since things ended up this way, I'll take the first watch.</i>

54
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,630
I keep getting reminded of my enlistment days.

55
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,290
<i>[Episode 2]
[Nobody Knows]</i>

56
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,350
<i>Have you awoken, Your Majesty?</i>

57
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,730
Damn it.

58
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,850
I had my doubts, but sure enough, I'm still here.

59
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,570
How does it feel after your first night as Your Majesty the Queen?

60
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,610
Like f**k.

61
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,650
Dear me.

62
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,970
Huh? My granny knot.

63
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,060
Did you lose something again?

64
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,800
- This time, I will look thoroughly—
- No!

65
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,570
<i>I probably undid it in my sleep because I was uncomfortable, right?</i>

66
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,930
No!

67
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,510
Your Majesty!

68
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,900
Why have you awoken so early, Your Majesty?

69
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,100
I deeply apologize for not escorting you.

70
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,560
I did not want to disturb the queen's sleep, so I slipped out quietly.

71
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,020
Did you have another nightmare?

72
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,500
The queen cannot be disturbed from sleep because of me. It is her first day as queen, after all.

73
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,570
I will prepare jasmine tea again for a restful sleep tonight.

74
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,520
The queen is probably on her way to greet the elders, correct?

75
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,670
I heard she has just departed.

76
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:45,930
I am looking forward to seeing how she will act.

77
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,200
There was a wedding yesterday, so fine.

78
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,690
But why am I busy from the second I wake up again today?

79
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,210
Now is when you formally greet Grand Queen Dowager and Queen Dowager.

80
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,390
You must also be greeted by government officials.

81
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,710
Once the official celebration is done—

82
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,610
That's when the royal wedding is over?

83
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,960
No, His Majesty the King has to issue a message announcing the investiture of the queen.

84
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,780
It's a never-ending wedding.

85
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,980
Hold on. If it's Grand Queen Dowager...

86
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,150
<i>This is what Grand Queen Dowager herself ordered</i>

87
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,520
<i>If I were to refill the lake, I would be going against her wishes.</i>

88
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,430
What is Grand Queen Dowager like?

89
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,190
Grand Queen Dowager is the elder from the same Andong Kim family as Your Majesty,

90
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,160
and Queen Dowager is from the Pungyang Jo family.

91
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,970
My mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law are rivals.

92
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,760
I, the queen, am on my grandmother-in-law's side.

93
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,910
<i>I should be able to tell which is which, right?</i>

94
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,100
<i>Since the older one will be Grand Queen Dowager.</i>

95
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,850
What else?

96
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,350
This is very important to me, so tell me everything you know.

97
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,700
She is the older sister of Lord Kim Jwa-geun.

98
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,570
Upon entering the palace, she has never once set foot outside the palace.

99
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,770
- Furthermore—
- Stop.

100
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,760
Not you, the palanquin!

101
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,360
Stop! (English was not used in the Joseon era) Stop!

102
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,850
Halt!

103
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,130
Back, back, back! (English) Reverse, reverse, reverse!

104
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,520
Reverse!

105
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,950
Stop!

106
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,070
I just found something more important to do.

107
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,860
Did you lose your way because of the palace's complex layout?

108
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,330
It's a pleasure to meet you. And you are?

109
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,750
Seriously.

110
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,490
I'm still not yet used to this body.

111
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,290
Your elegant bearing is not ordinary at all.

112
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,790
Are you a member of the royal family, too?

113
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,420
Perhaps, are you a princess or something?

114
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,970
I apologize.

115
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,000
If I have offended you with my arrogance, please forgive me, Your Majesty.

116
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,720
- No, no. What I was trying to say was that—
- Your Majesty!

117
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,790
You walk so quickly that you've already come this far.

118
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,840
Greetings, My Lady.

119
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,950
Do you know her?

120
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,780
She is Lady Hwa-jin, the daughter of Lord Jo. She is to become the king's royal concubine.

121
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,160
I know she's the queen, but she's messing with you too much!

122
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,590
She keeps being sarcastic!

123
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,390
There's a rumor in the palace that she was the one who pushed Your Majesty into the lake.

124
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,180
I'm certain that the rumors that the queen lost her memory are lies.

125
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,680
- You should be careful.
- You should be careful.

126
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:49,170
I'm pretty good with physiognomy since I've spent a lot of time with women. <i>(Assessing one's character from facial features)</i>

127
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,930
How should I put this? You are a good person.

128
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,000
I guess you and this person haven't had the best relationship in the past, but shall we start anew?

129
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,270
I like you.

130
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,580
Let's be friends.

131
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,600
Did you decide to change your method?

132
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,660
Method?

133
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,280
Thanks to you, I have a very clear picture of what this place is like.

134
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,470
Now I feel like I'm in the palace.

135
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,730
No, no. I think you misunderstood me a little bit.

136
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,560
I apologize, but I must go.

137
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,360
Your Majesty.

138
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,100
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

139
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,050
I went to the royal villa, but you were not there.

140
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,090
I also went to give you my greetings, but you were not there.

141
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,770
We must have missed each other. Our hearts connected.

142
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,550
<i>If she's the royal concubine, then she's Cheoljong's second wife?</i>

143
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,640
<i>I should have entered that body, not this one! </i>

144
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,820
The jealousy in Her Majesty's eyes makes me tremble with fear.

145
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,590
All right, get a room.

146
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,150
My Queen, I'd like you to hurry up the investiture of the royal concubine.

147
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,490
What to do? I can't do that because I'm too busy.

148
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,310
It's a royal command.

149
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,740
<i>Screw you, polygamist!</i>

150
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,650
Your Majesty, the elders of the Inner Court are waiting for you—

151
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,450
Your Majesty!

152
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,400
Well, I have something important to do.

153
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,120
What was that!

154
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,810
You must have been startled.

155
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,120
Hwa-jin, I'll finally be able to have you as my wife.

156
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,030
Now, I live in the same palace as you.

157
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,600
We have to go through the customary formalities. Actually,

158
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,080
the head sulli saw you at the lake.
<i>(Sulli - eunuch in charge of gifts and food for the king)</i>

159
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,890
They were trying to blame you for the lake incident, so I had to rush the installation.

160
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,100
I was just surprised to hear a loud noise from the lake...

161
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,790
Don't worry.

162
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,120
Even the Andong Kim family cannot do anything to you when you are innocent.

163
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,170
No, I will make it so that they can't do anything to you.

164
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,400
I will put everything on the line and protect you.

165
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,770
Your Majesty.

166
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,250
But I surely have nothing to offer you.

167
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,190
Just a mere throne for appearance, a brother who's full of worry,

168
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,290
one troublemaker of a friend,

169
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,430
and... one beautiful woman.

170
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,060
You're rich.

171
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,320
Your whereabouts on that day have been fully accounted for, so don't worry.

172
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,890
<i>What? Who is Grand Queen Dowager?</i>

173
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,850
Please give your greetings, Your Majesty.

174
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,090
<i>Damn it! Whatever!</i>

175
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:48,300
I hope you had a peaceful night, Your Royal Highness, Grand Queen Dowager.

176
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,360
The night has rejuvenated you so well that you’ve regained your youth!

177
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,930
I nearly mistook you for Queen Dowager!

178
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,050
This wench!

179
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,200
Is that so?

180
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,340
It was worth all my effort then!

181
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,780
<i>Good. That was natural.</i>

182
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,910
After that tragic accident...

183
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,490
Oh my. It seems to me that you haven’t fully recovered.

184
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,410
Can't you tell at once?

185
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,100
She has the perfect appearance of a queen!

186
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,480
Her keen eye is as good as ever!

187
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,620
Yes. Oh my, yes. You're right.

188
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,290
<i>A war of nerves with a smile on their faces.</i>.

189
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,320
<i>I better keep my head on straight.</i>

190
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,890
Now, you just have to put all your effort into giving us an heir.

191
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,250
Ah, there is a secret to conceiving a prince,

192
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,410
which has been passed down from generation to generation in the palace.

193
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,200
Is that so?

194
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,420
This is what you have to do when you spend the night with the King. When he’s lying down on his back, you can...

195
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,030
<i>She’s the worst mother-in-law I’ve ever seen.</i>

196
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,600
And at the exact moment, you must—

197
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,100
Mother, I’ll take care of that myself!

198
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,260
<i>Oh, I should have held that in! </i>

199
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:43,130
Well, I am well-educated in those things.

200
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,860
That’s right! You took a lot of bridal classes to become a good wife to him.

201
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,210
I’m sure you’re very well prepared for that.

202
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,900
I see.

203
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,420
I've been overstepping.

204
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,170
<i>She doesn't like having a second-class daughter-in-law,</i>

205
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,250
<i>but it's thrilling when the daughter-in-law's daughter-in-law is second-class.</i>

206
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,370
<i>[Injeong-jeon]</i>
<i>(The throne room)</i>

207
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,870
Ah, so cumbersome! There sure are many ways to kill a person, really!

208
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,180
Ah, my neck hurts!

209
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,360
You look very tired.

210
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,550
I suppose we did overdo it last night.

211
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,040
We didn't even drink that much.

212
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,200
They are waiting for us. Please enter.

213
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,650
<i>[Injeong-jeon]</i>

214
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,750
Chief State Councilor, Kim Byeong-hak.

215
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,210
Congratulations.

216
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,860
Left State Councilor, Kim Seok-geun.

217
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,720
Congratulations.

218
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,130
Minister of Military Affairs, Kim Chang-hyeok.

219
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,620
Congratulations.

220
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,160
<i>One after another, family name: Kim.</i>

221
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,070
<i>So they are the famous Andong Kims?</i>

222
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,210
<i>With Grand Royal Queen Dowager and the king's consort on their side,</i>

223
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,650
<i>they taxed the people every which way, making them suffer.</i>

224
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,640
<i>It would be equivalent to modern-day military service corruption, real estate corruption, and tax corruption.</i>

225
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,540
<i>All kinds of corruptions known as "samjeong munran" took place,</i>

226
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,760
<i>chipping away at Joseon, becoming a symbol for corrupt politicians;</i>

227
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,970
<i>the Andong Kim family.</i>

228
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,330
Right State Councilor, Jo Man-hong.

229
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,720
Congratulations.

230
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,680
Minister of Personnel, Jo Deok-moon.

231
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,780
Congratulations.

232
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,240
<i>Ah, the Pungyang Jo family.</i>

233
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,860
<i>This family with Queen Dowager Jo as its head is also famous.</i>

234
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,400
<i>While Queen Dowager Jo's son Hoen-jong was the king, they had their fill, but after Hoen-jong died</i>

235
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,680
<i>and now that the Andong Kim family's Kim So-yong has become the queen, I believe they're screwed.</i>

236
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,790
<i>Other than these minions, there is someone...</i>

237
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,250
<i>This era's leading figure...</i>

238
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,550
General of Training, Kim Jwa-geun.

239
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,220
Congratulations, Your Majesty the King and Your Majesty the Queen.

240
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,060
<i>The real influencer among the power-wielding Kim family.</i>

241
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,900
With the joyous royal wedding ceremony, there is something I would like to mention.

242
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,410
What is it?

243
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,630
For the Commander of the Royal Guard who protects Your Majesty,

244
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,950
may I suggest that you appoint your father-in-law, Buwon-gun Kim Moon-geun?

245
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,170
You mean my father-in-law?

246
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,780
Yes.

247
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,000
Suddenly that kind of important matter...

248
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,880
Her Majesty, the Queen's concern for you

249
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,810
prompted us to rush this.

250
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,840
Did you personally request it?

251
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,950
<i>I wouldn't know...</i>

252
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,430
<i>But the winning team is my team.</i>

253
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,780
I worry only about Your Majesty.

254
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,430
Why else would I stay up all night while you are sleeping?

255
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,790
Why that fox...

256
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,210
I understand. I will take it into consideration.

257
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,350
Grand Royal Queen Dowager also greatly praises Her Majesty, the Queen's thought.

258
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,620
Since it's a position currently held by my brother, Prince Yeongpyeong,

259
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,700
could you give me a little time to think?

260
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,310
As there is nothing more urgent than Your Majesty's safety,

261
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,760
please understand us wanting to rush,

262
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,100
Your Majesty.

263
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,620
Your concern for me is immense.

264
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,940
Then, we shall proceed accordingly.

265
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,690
<i>Kim Jwa-geun, the king above the king who has powerful authority,</i>

266
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,860
<i>he is the true head of this government.</i>

267
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,940
<i>This is like sitting back and watching a fight while eating popcorn.</i>

268
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,060
<i>Ah!</i>

269
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,300
I am sorry. Continue, please.

270
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,720
Since the queen seems to be tired, why don't we quickly end the congratulatory greetings?

271
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,430
Sleeping together is only a sacred affair of the state,

272
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,130
it shouldn't be about emotion or pleasure.

273
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,920
But last night I was unable to control myself...

274
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,950
It's not a fault for a married couple to get along well.

275
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,320
Is that right?

276
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,590
<i>What is he saying now?</i>

277
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,060
Then let's end the congratulatory greetings.

278
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:18,230
<i>- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.
- Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.</i>

279
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,700
You are pretending to be strong, aren't you?

280
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,780
What are you talking about?

281
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,650
Nothing happened last night, right?

282
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,470
I am disappointed. Even though we drank,

283
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,820
how could you forget the first night that only happens once?

284
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,770
What are you saying?

285
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,230
I understand it though.

286
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,430
You did have memory loss not too long ago. It must be an aftereffect.

287
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,130
It's impossible. It could never be.

288
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,760
There was light red.

289
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,730
Light red? What is that?

290
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,620
It is confirming the blood on the bed on the first night.

291
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,050
I have other business so...

292
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,760
Wait! You should finish what you were saying...

293
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,810
Your Majesty, we shall escort you.

294
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,430
<i>Don't get intimidated, Jang Bong-hwan. That's a bluff.</i>

295
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,830
<i>Hey, you! You don't think I would know if I went through something like that?!</i>

296
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,400
<i>No way! Never!</i>

297
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,160
<i>If it gets out that the king withdraws "it" at night, it will become difficult.</i>

298
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,790
<i>And he's too used to distorting history.</i>

299
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,010
Still, does he have to be so thorough with his lies?

300
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,740
Even fabricating light red or whatever?

301
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,140
Wait! Stop for a moment.

302
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,860
Perhaps...

303
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,670
Is it possible for a woman not to know after doing that?

304
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,050
"That"?

305
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,270
What are you referring to doing?

306
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,780
<i>An innocent face.</i>

307
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,200
<i>Court Lady who is more prudent than a monk...</i>

308
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,880
There is no one here I can ask.

309
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,900
Oh, my!

310
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,390
Is she crying after seeing me?

311
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,620
It couldn't be, Your Majesty.

312
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,780
The wind is cold. I will close the window.

313
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,960
- What do you mean the wind is cold. I am so hot—
- It's very cold.

314
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,560
- You will catch cold.
- I am hot!

315
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,260
Let's go.

316
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,180
Ah, what that Cheoljong punk said is bothering me!

317
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,160
You can have your meal now, Your Royal Highness.

318
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,690
Having met the queen in person, the queen's condition is not all right for sure.

319
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,770
How shall I say?

320
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,090
She is too straightforward...

321
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,000
She has always been somewhat bold,

322
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,120
but she wasn't so unaware as to be reckless.

323
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,460
Even at the ceremony for congratulatory greetings, she was not very proper.

324
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,140
We will need to set her straight.

325
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,760
There is no need to give food to the world unnecessarily.

326
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,550
Anyhow, was Jo Hwa-jin really with the king that night?

327
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,840
Yes, her whereabouts are flawless.

328
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,550
Only one gak <i>(15 minutes)</i> between the incident suffered by the queen and her entry inside the palace does not match.

329
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,070
Of course, that is not direct proof that she did not harm the queen,

330
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,960
but they will use it that way.

331
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,260
It's indeed a mystery.

332
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,630
If not Bin, then who else would?

333
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,270
Could there be another power?

334
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,920
It's possible.

335
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,200
But to us,

336
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,050
who it should be is more important than who it is.

337
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,940
"Who it should be"?

338
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:12,330
- Ji-rok-wi-ma. If we point to a deer and say that it is a horse then it becomes a horse.

339
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:17,960
In our situation, that deer can really become a horse in the future.

340
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,150
For now, please forget about politics

341
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,730
and have your food, Your Highness.

342
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,800
Since you volunteer to be my meal assistant like this,

343
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,110
how could I neglect my health even if I wanted to?

344
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,440
I won't ever let that happen.

345
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,050
Please eat.

346
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,390
The daughter of Vice Secretary Jo Dae-su from the Pung-yang Jo family,

347
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,910
Jo Hwa-jin will be appointed as Bin (Royal Concubine), Level 1 of the Inner Court.

348
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:04,580
Also, regarding her beauty and upright personality highly, I am bestowing the title name, Eui Bin...

349
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,400
<i>Pungyang Jo family...</i>

350
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,210
<i>Did this woman, a rival in terms of family and position, really push Kim So-yong into the lake?</i>

351
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,450
<i>Because she's a dangerous woman... I'm drawn to her even more.</i>

352
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,620
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

353
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,190
Let's get along.

354
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:33,150
<i>Although the winning side is my team, such a beauty like her is the demilitarized zone. </i>

355
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,410
Let's do our best to get along.

356
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,410
You'll soon find this out through experience, but I'm perfect.

357
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,590
Except for all those flaws I have.

358
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,760
Oh, since we're family now, could I ask you something?

359
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,880
I don't have anyone else to ask.

360
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,080
I'm not sure whether I can answer because I'm so lacking.

361
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,610
It's something you'd know well since it's about the king.

362
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,260
Does the king have... a tendency to tell lies?

363
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,850
You know, I heard girls tell each other everything.

364
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:23,830
Speaking of which, His Majesty the King is actually WDWN, right?

365
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,890
WDWN...

366
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,770
I've never heard of an idiom like that.

367
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,010
Oh, "He wins during the day but withdraws at night."

368
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,840
Yet, he's lying as if we had a passionate night and trying to distort the history of last night—

369
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,130
Your Majesty, my apologies, but this is inappropriate.

370
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,110
Oh, if I made you uncomfortable, I'm sorry. It was just bothering me a lot.

371
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,850
I have a lot to do after arriving to the palace yesterday.

372
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,700
Oh, I was keeping you when you were busy.

373
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,260
Then.

374
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,750
And His Majesty isn't like that.

375
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,700
If he isn't like that... are you saying that he isn't a liar,

376
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,020
or that he doesn't withdraw at night? Huh?

377
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,030
I feel worse now!

378
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,820
Oh my god!

379
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,520
<i>(Document is upside down)</i>

380
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,550
<i>It... It's a thief!</i>

381
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,220
<i>There's a thief!</i>

382
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,160
<i>Thief! Thief!</i>

383
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,350
<i>Over there! Over there!</i>

384
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,230
<i>Baby, let's sleep.</i>

385
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>You can't!</i>

386
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,930
<i>Your Majesty...</i>

387
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,670
<i>In this secret warehouse, nothing was found...</i>

388
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:38,160
<i>If it's not in that place, which is the most secretive with the highest security,</i>

389
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,760
<i>did you really hide it in a tiger's den?</i>

390
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,790
<i>Your Majesty! Her Majesty the Queen, has arrived.</i>

391
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm a little bit busy working for the official affairs of state <i>("jeongsa").</i>

392
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Our issues are the same! That's the exact problem I'm having.
<i>(T/N: "jeongsa" also sounds like the word for "intercourse")</i>

393
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,400
How busy must you be if you can't even hold this up the right way?

394
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,320
For personal reasons, I have a lot of thoughts right now.

395
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,580
Finish your thoughts. I'll wait.

396
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,800
Why are you looking at me that way?

397
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,070
I mean... I was just thinking that you're trying too hard.

398
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:41,070
As the king, it's a given for me to work on the state affairs <i>("jeongsa").</i>

399
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,820
<i>Maybe this bastard keeps mentioning "jeongsa" (state affairs/intercourse) on purpose.</i>

400
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,160
Since I finished the ceremony of appointing the concubine as you wished, you can sleep at her quarters from tonight on.

401
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,250
Sounds good to me.

402
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,530
You don't have anything you want to say to me?

403
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,800
Since you came to me, isn't it that you have something to say?

404
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,610
Since it's just the two of us now, let's be honest. Last night, we—

405
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,820
Had a great time.

406
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:13,460
Well... if that's how you're going to go about this.

407
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,920
Seriously. Don't you understand you're disturbing me?

408
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,050
If it's too awkward to talk about, what if we give some kind of sign that only we know about?

409
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,070
Like this.

410
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,500
What is this?

411
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,130
It means that I'm lying right now.

412
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,240
What do you think? It's so easy, right?

413
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,430
Kings do not lie.

414
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,470
Please leave.

415
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,190
He's so annoying.

416
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:15,560
Since he keeps insisting so seriously, it makes me feel like something really did happen!

417
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,290
Your Majesty, everything was so tiring today, wasn't it?

418
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,550
I'm ticklish!

419
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,160
<i>I'm ticklish. It tickles.</i>

420
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,330
Your Majesty, starting today, we will begin etiquette classes.

421
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,430
Who maintains etiquette as well as me?

422
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,550
This is the special training for palace etiquette!

423
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,170
I don't want to.

424
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,090
It's a command from Her Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

425
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,900
<i>Well, the light red mark or whatnot doesn't matter, as getting back is my priority. </i>

426
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,730
<i>Getting Grand Queen Dowager's favor comes first.</i>

427
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,890
I may not look like it, but I finished the course at Cheonghakdong Manner School when I was 4.
<i>(T/N: traditional manner school in Southern Gyeongsang province)</i>

428
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,890

<i>What's wrong, Your Majesty?</i>

464
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,200
<i>These are Kim So-yong's memories</i>

465
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,190
<i>and her heart again....</i>

466
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,230
She was poisoned! Call the royal physician immediately!

467
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,710
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

468
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,960
- Please spit that out, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

469
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,070
<i>It's not pain.</i>

470
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:05,030
<i>Does she... love Cheoljong?</i>

471
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,420
<i>You must love me!</i>

472
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,580
<i>His gaze was full of hate. It's more than just not loving her, he hates her! </i>

473
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,290
<i>Please, Your Majesty!</i>

474
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,950
<i>I prefer snacks to alcohol.</i>

475
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,700
<i>That's great. All the alcohol in this room is for you my queen.</i>

476
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,250
<i>From the beginning, Cheoljong had no intention of spending the night with her.</i>

477
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:53,720
<i>That's why he tried to give me a drink. He had the same plan as I did.</i>

478
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,740
<i>Now, all you have to do is give us an heir.</i>

479
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,340
<i>Please recover your senses, Your Majesty!</i>

480
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,150
<i>Bring some water! Water!</i>

481
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:07,530
<i>Cheoljong did it to fool the Kim clan, who was trying to convince him to sleep with her.</i>

482
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,660
Hong Yeon, nothing happened to me!

483
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:24,420
I was so bothered! I trusted myself but couldn't trust that bastard. But...

484
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,400
What are you all doing?

485
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,810
More! Pull them up. More!

486
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,760
Yes, Your Highness.

487
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:55,610
This is how difficult maintaining my position is.

488
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,000
Looking old means that very soon you will become weak.

489
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,640
To prevent deep wrinkles, you have to do this twice a day.

490
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,770
I get it. You're working so hard.

491
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,090
By the way, why did you come?

492
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,180
After taking the etiquette class you ordered,

493
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,960
I learned a lot of things about how a queen should behave.

494
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,150
That pleases me.

495
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,800
That's it. That's enough.

496
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,750
Yes, Your Highness.

497
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,230
But last night when we were sleeping together,

498
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:38,110
I felt like I was lacking energy and didn't have any desire.

499
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,530
I thought about the reason why and I realized,

500
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,800
Since all the palace lakes have been drained,

501
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,720
the yin energy is weak!
<i>(yin - female energy)</i>

502
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,590
I feel like if the lakes are refilled with water, I will get pregnant with an heir right away.

503
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,840
That cannot happen!

504
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,080
<i>- Damn it!</i>
- You nearly lost your life in the lake!

505
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,220
If we went by the book, it wouldn't be enough to put all your servants to death!

506
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:08,980
We were only lenient since there was a joyous celebration of the royal wedding coming up and it wouldn't be good to shed blood!

507
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,830
If you must refill the lakes, then let's do everything in order first.

508
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,210
Hong Yeon and Lady Choi... and who else?

509
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,940
I will severely punish everyone who's responsible!

510
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,900
<i>Brutal... This old lady does not play around.</i>

511
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:32,150
Three days to sleep together! In order to conceive an heir, I will get to it right away.

512
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,270
In return, if you would refill the lake.

513
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,130
Seven days!

514
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,420
Five!

515
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,310
You out there, take all those who serve Her Majesty and severely punish--

516
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,120
Seven days!

517
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,860
That's perfect.

518
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:49,800
If you promise to refill the lake in seven days, I will conceive an heir.

519
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,750
<i> An heir or whatever, once I leave, it's not my issue!</i>

520
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,880
Eui Bin is here.

521
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:27,610
My goodness, you are as elegant as I've heard.

522
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:32,630
His Majesty has a very good eye for women.

523
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,960
You're being too kind.

524
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,240
It's a present.

525
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:49,930
It's something very important for your palace life.

526
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,120
Take it out and see.

527
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,100
You know palace life is such that

528
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:16,010
there's no one you can freely open your heart to; and once you feel uneasy, there's no end to it.

529
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:20,670
Oh, right! What exactly is your birth date and hour?

530
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,170
What would be best to do in order to conceive an heir?

531
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,250
Oh my, listen to me! Physical compatibility with His Majesty would come first, right?

532
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:39,800
By chance, if you need another strong talisman, let me know.

533
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,040
I know a very skilled female Buddhist who specializes in curses.

534
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,760
Last time, it worked out really well and--

535
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:53,530
Your Highness, I apologize, but I only came here to assist His Majesty.

536
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,010
I was... being foolish.

537
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:03,230
My apologies, Your Highness. My words and actions were out of line.

538
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,570
Not at all. Do not trouble yourself.

539
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,030
Anyway, it seems that you will have to be alone

540
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,880
for quite a while now that you were just installed.

541
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,850
Too bad, I feel terrible for you.

542
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,290
Pardon?

543
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:26,360
The king and queen have seven days to conceive an heir.

544
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:32,130
Usually, for a consummation day, thunder can't strike and there can't be fog nor wind.

545
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,480
But this time the dates have been set day after day.

546
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,850
Do not concern yourself.

547
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:43,570
I doubt that His Majesty's feelings for you will change in the meantime.

548
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,270
<i>You will surely...</i>

549
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,450
<i>end up losing someone precious to you, too!</i>

550
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,880
My Lady!

551
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:52,830
I ruined it too much to fix in any way.

552
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:56,680
It's too bad, but I'll have to throw it away.

553
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:02,950
Oh, dear... Character-wise and in every way, you are best suited to be the queen.

554
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:07,270
She's being so pushy with His Majesty while only trusting her connections.

555
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:12,290
Bo-wol, the queen is like any other sovereign.

556
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,060
There's a strict sense of duty pertaining to those above. Don't use harsh words.

557
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,650
But still, she's using her ladies to fabricate the date that is best for conceiving.

558
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:25,840
Also, you're being blamed for something you didn't even do! Why did that accident have to happen right when you were walking b—

559
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,500
I'm not used to palace life yet.

560
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,090
This mouth of mine.

561
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,600
I apologize, My Lady.

562
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:47,310
What can I do for His Majesty this time around?

563
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,300
You told me to sleep at Eui Bin's quarters,

564
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,400
but now you want to sleep with me, so you asked Her Royal Highness, the Grand Queen Dowager.

565
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,160
It's really hard to read a woman's mind.

566
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,010
I have a favor to ask you.

567
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,710
Will you do it?

568
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:15,440
Fine. Since it's a favor asked by My Queen.

569
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,110
- Let's have a "no-touch" rule between us.
- I don't want to.

570
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,990
- You said you would grant my wish.
- I've never heard of those words.

571
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,900
You didn't know their meaning but rejected it unconditionally?

572
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,130
Since I don't know their meaning, I don't want to do it.

573
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,170
Listen carefully, Your Majesty.

574
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,840
A "no-touch" rule means that let's live happily and delightfully, but separately.

575
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,260
It has such a good meaning.

576
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:40,160
So, for example, we said we would sleep together like this, but you would go to Eui Bin's quarters and be happy.

577
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,240
Then I will be happy here, too.

578
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,460
- So, let's do "no-touch."
- I see...

579
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,880
But I don't want to.

580
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,470
My god, why not?

581
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:54,760
Somehow, your attitude is unpleasant.

582
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,380
<i>What the... You total nut-job!</i>

583
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,970
<i>Well, one nut-job knows very well how to handle another nut-job.</i>

584
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,830
Then, since I don't remember well about last night,

585
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:10,050
let's review it again.

586
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,730
That TPN, okay?

587
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,420
- TPN?
- That passionate night.

588
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:21,880
Tonight is our true first night.

589
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,340
If you say so...

590
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:42,810
Hey! Hurry up, hurry! At this rate, we will get caught!

591
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:46,480
A king never runs.

592
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,500
Court Lady Choi!

593
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:03,210
At this rate, you will really get in big trouble.

594
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,800
I should see the hardships and worries of people for myself so that I can become a great queen.

595
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,400
Your intention is noble, but this is too dangerous.

596
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,050
If it was Your Majesty's order, I would do everything, even die at your order, but...

597
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,530
The map.

598
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,640
- But this time—
- The identity tag.

599
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,900
I really can't let you do this.

600
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,720
The name is... Lee Saeng Mang.
<i>(T/N: Modern Korean slang for "I'm doomed in this life.") </i>

601
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,070
Why such an unfortunate name?

602
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,760
Saeng means "take care" and Mang means "try hard."

603
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,630
It's a good name, meaning take good care of the country and try hard for it.

604
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,050
Well, all right, it's not my real name anyway.

605
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,450
When is the curfew, you said?

606
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:48,990
At the time of "Ja" (rat), the bell will toll 12 times and then the city's gate will be locked. <i>(Ja - 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.)</i>

607
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,320
Ah, so you mean they will hit the bell.

608
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,300
If you say the time of "Ja," that's 11:00 p.m.

609
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,820
That's the prime time, though.

610
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,500
Okay, I'll make sure to come back by then.

611
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,580
No! By all means,

612
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,640
I will stop you from going out, Your Majesty.

613
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:24,460
Hong-yeon, what kind of person was I originally?

614
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,880
Your Majesty was, well, always...

615
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,080
You were benevolent and positive all the time,

616
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,170
and you smiled a lot, and also you were very kind to other people.

617
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,270
Don't you think it's better for me to hear from you,

618
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,640
than from other people?

619
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,410
I guess that's right.

620
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,070
Then...

621
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,000
<i>A while ago, one day you were reading a book.</i>

622
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,480
<i>I can't read the book at all.</i>

623
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,730
<i>How loudly your breathing sounds!</i>

624
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:07,280
<i>Its noise rings in my ears so loudly.</i>

625
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,820
<i>Look over there! Beat this man severely!</i>

626
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,980
<i>I-I have rhinitis, that's why!</i>

627
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,160
<i>Please forgive me, Your Highness!</i>

628
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,610
<i>Your beat is one-fourth of a beat late.</i>

629
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,050
<i>You have such a messy sense of the beat, </i>

630
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:37,410
<i>so how dare you work as a teacher?</i>

631
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,260
<i>Look over there! Beat this wench severely!</i>

632
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,810
<i>Oh my goodness, that's so funny!</i>

633
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,090
<i>Did you just laugh?</i>

634
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:53,330
<i>I guess you girls have easy lives. </i>

635
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:57,270
<i>Look over there! Beat these girls severely!</i>

636
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:59,780
If one sighs, "How dare you sigh in front of me?"

637
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:02,100
If one smells nice, "How dare you try to flirt?"

638
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,470
If one walks with noise, "It's too noisy!" but if one walks gently, "Do you think you're the king?"

639
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:10,330
Gosh! Since you nitpicked at every little detail of all the people in front of you and punished them harshly,

640
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:14,190
your nickname is "The Witch of Royal Villa."

641
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,070
I'm sorry.

642
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,710
I was just trying to relay the stories vividly but got carried away.

643
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:28,460
<i>So, not just one or two people would want to push this woman into the lake.</i>

644
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,210
That's why those palace maids earlier...

645
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,800
That's because all of them don't know your true self.

646
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,410
Then, do you know it?

647
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,780
Of course, I do.

648
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,180
The Your Majesty, whom I've been serving since my childhood,

649
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,600
is originally warm.

650
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,720
And how smart you are! Once you make up your mind on something, you surely make it happen, no matter what.

651
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,830
You're such an awesome person.

652
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,480
It's just because you were a little lonely in this palace,

653
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,380
since His Majesty the King openly shows his affection to another woman...

654
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,160
But I see this woman isn't always lonely,

655
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,020
as she has a person who understands her like this.

656
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,760
"This... woman"?

657
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,690
I mean, I'm not lonely, thanks to you.

658
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:17,110
Oh, please, Your Majesty.

659
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,490
Hong-yeon, don't worry and have a good night's sleep.

660
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:26,540
For you, at least, I will never get caught.

661
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,610
I'm going to kill you all!

662
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,990
Just gouge out this eye as well!

663
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:37,370
I can't watch my wife and child become slaves, too!

664
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:40,130
If you don't have money for tax, it's only right to pay it with your body.

665
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,760
T-That sinful bastard!

666
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,670
If I'm a sinner,

667
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,580
my sin is to have brought a child

668
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,650
into this damnable world!

669
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,220
Don't come near! Don't!

670
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,870
That crazy bastard is trying to add treason to his crimes!

671
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,190
If killing such bastards like you is treason, I'll commit treason.

672
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,270
Sure, I'll do it!

673
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,300
Dam-hyang's father!

674
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,910
Don't.

675
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:11,660
Even so...

676
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,160
But those bastards are killing us every day!

677
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,980
What do you mean, don't!

678
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,580
Dam-hyang...

679
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,510
<i>- Catch him!</i>
- Get out of my way!

680
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,520
Father, you've arrived.

681
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,810
Yes. How were your travels?

682
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,740
I'm sorry that I was absent when there were important events in our household.

683
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:19,520
Have you made up your mind? Do you know what position you'd like?

684
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:25,390
I've decided the direction of my dream but I haven't decided the magnitude of my dream.

685
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,680
The magnitude?

686
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:34,560
Sure. I will trust you and not rush you.

687
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,000
The truth is, while you were gone, something did happen.

688
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,940
Her Majesty the Queen fell into a lake the night before the wedding.

689
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:49,790
After falling into the lake, she lost consciousness for a day and the wedding was postponed.

690
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:54,570
How is she now? Is she all right?

691
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,400
Wait!

692
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:18,170
Seeing that a man, whom I've never seen before in the palace, is looking around in a rush...

693
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:22,680
It's your first time in the palace and you've lost your way, haven't you?

694
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,510
I was the same my first time, too.

695
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:26,570
You're right!

696
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,410
But why do you look so familiar?

697
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:44,110
<i>Seeing his luxurious outfit and his confident attitude with no wariness of other people... </i>

698
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,210
<i>definitely a silver spoon.</i>

699
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,210
That's what I was going to say.

700
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:53,170
Aren't you that famous young master? You're not only from a prestigious family but also very handsome.

701
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:56,830
Rumor says you're excellent in both literary and martial arts. Your name was...

702
01:01:56,830 --> 01:02:01,410
Kim Hwan. I'm Hwan from the Andong Kim family.

703
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,380
<i>Gosh, he's a relative.</i>

704
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:05,270
Am I that famous?

705
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,880
Of course, you are.

706
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:12,190
Well, the rumor spread all over the place. Well, it's my honor to be acquainted.

707
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:16,590
I'm also on my way to get out of the palace, so let's go together.

708
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,690
Ah, that's the way I came from, though.

709
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,280
Oh, I was mistaken for a moment in this darkness.

710
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,980
- Bam! Beheaded.
<i> - Wow...</i>

711
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,750
<i> He's so freaking talkative. How can he keep talking without any break? </i>

712
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,090
...the energy of this place is a bit damp.

713
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:41,760
That's why His Majesty the King also has a nightmare every night.

714
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,230
A nightmare?

715
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:49,720
The king has had the same nightmare since his days on Ganghwa Island.

716
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:56,590
It's about him getting beheaded for treason!

717
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,890
<i>[Kim Hwan]</i>

718
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,230
I'm sorry for not recognizing you.

719
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:06,280
No, don't worry as there are many people coming and going.

720
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,940
<i>[Lee Saeng Mang]</i>

721
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,040
Ah, to commemorate becoming good friends with you, I'm thinking of going to the gisaeng house. <i>(gisaeng - courtesan)</i>

722
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,260
Which one is the best in this city?

723
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,930
Oktajeong! That's the best place.

724
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,430
It's the women's laughing sounds, "Ho, ho, ho!"

725
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:34,760
Like the sound from hitting jade, that's why it's called Oktajeong. <i>(Ok - jade and Ta - hit)</i>

726
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:39,200
Let's go together. Seeing the moon shining so brightly tonight,

727
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,720
this is the perfect night to enjoy a taste of the arts!

728
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:45,650
Here it is.

729
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,280
Let's go.

730
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,500
You're working hard.

731
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,190
Ah, yes.

732
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,180
You seem to be at the same age as me

733
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:57,810
and even have the same hobby. How nice to be acquainted with you.

734
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:03,150
Oh, by the way, I haven't heard your name yet. Your name is...

735
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:05,560
My name is Lee Saeng Mang.

736
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,300
Lee Saeng Mang, meaning "I'm doomed in this life."

737
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,620
Good work.

738
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,090
<i>What's your name?</i>

739
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:38,520
I'm sorry.

740
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,110
<i>Open your mouth!</i>

741
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,160
Here we have a female guest.

742
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,270
What do you mean, to a perfectly fine young man?

743
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:56,830
We don't accept female guests.

744
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,350
Girls! We have a young master!

745
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,790
Yeah!

746
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,020
It's my great honor to meet you, sir.

747
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:48,420
Please allow me to offer a drink—

748
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:56,030
I don't drink more than three glasses of alcohol per day.

749
01:05:56,030 --> 01:06:01,400
Since I've already had the second one, I'd like to have the third one with my friend.

750
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:05,820
Since he's very upright, you know.

751
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:11,820
It's Sir Yu's son who passed the Grand State Examination this time.

752
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,760
Congratulations.

753
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,570
Well, despite his skills, he couldn't get a good position in Hanyang. <i>(Hanyang - what is now Seoul)</i>

754
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:25,200
As long as you're leading him in the right direction, I'll show you my gratitude, no matter how much it is.

755
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:32,880
Are you telling me now to sell a government official post for money?

756
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,370
Well, what I meant was... because I think I would be very grateful.

757
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:41,790
By the way, as far as I know, it has been a while since your son passed the test,

758
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:42,980
why now?

759
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,970
That was...

760
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:50,770
You must have contacted the Pungyang Jo family first.

761
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,800
As my wife's family is a distant relative to the Pungyang Jo family,

762
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,430
I'm deeply ashamed.

763
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:12,620
I fully understand your desperation,

764
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:18,210
worrying if your talented son might not be able to spread his wings due to his family's lack of virtue.

765
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:22,840
I'll give you my support to let him clear his name and get a position in the Royal Secretary's office.

766
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,760
In the Royal Secretary's office?

767
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,190
Thank you! Thank you, thank you!

768
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:30,240
Forget about the gratitude.

769
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,930
Instead, I need a friend.

770
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:37,690
A friend who can give up his life for me.

771
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,210
All the lives of my family

772
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:45,360
are yours from now on, Sir!

773
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,650
Please pour me a glass,

774
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,490
as we have become friends now.

775
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:57,500
Yes, Sir, much obliged!

776
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:09,420
- Come in, girls!
<i>- Yes, Sir.</i>

777
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:16,410
Now let's enjoy tonight like beasts until we get totally drunk!

778
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:20,930
Oh, come on!

779
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,000
You're so funny!

780
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,070
Please come here.

781
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:27,390
Young Master, please accept a glass.

782
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:31,140
Young Master!

783
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,770
You're so elegant.

784
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:40,760
Who will untie my string tonight?

785
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:54,310
In the 20 years of my gisaeng career,

786
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:57,530
I've never seen such a perverted man like him.

787
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,730
This is miserable.

788
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:27,870
Even at a place like this, we should drink by ourselves...

789
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:30,530
This isn't the time to say such things.

790
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:33,640
The item wasn't in the secret storage room, which we thought was the most highly probable place.

791
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,970
Then, there is one last place left, the house of the king's father-in-law.

792
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:41,060
But of all people, they want to appoint the king's father-in-law as the Commander of the Royal Guard,

793
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,080
so it will be even harder to sneak in.

794
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:47,570
When they say they want to take over the Royal Guard, it means they want to control the king's life.

795
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:51,320
It will also take just a moment for them to catch the king's bodyguards who are disguised as regular royal guards.

796
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,020
What? Then, we'd really be in a dire situation.

797
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:00,210
If those bodyguards get their identities exposed and get dismissed, the job of following after corrupt people every night

798
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,400
and the job of finding the illegal ledger and attack their storages,

799
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,620
all of that must be done by me and you, Prince Yeongpyeong.

800
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,900
We work as royal guards during the day and as assassins at night.

801
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,580
We will suffer from a too heavy workload, you know?

802
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:17,610
Did you call me all the way from Ganghwa Island to boss me around like this?

803
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:21,590
When I was on my way to Hanyang,

804
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:26,300
I had a great dream in this heart of young blood.

805
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:30,550
"I will become successful by selling my friend's name!"

806
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,980
You're the one who followed me frantically

807
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,430
on my words that I would save this rotting Joseon.

808
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,600
You didn't say it like that.

809
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:46,710
Since you kept talking about Hanyang, I asked you and this is how you answered exactly.

810
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,970
<i>What on earth are you going to Hanyang for?</i>

811
01:10:55,830 --> 01:11:01,000
<i>I'm going to give this rotting and dying Joseon ddongchim! (meaning 'shove it up one's ass)</i>

812
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,620
Yes, I said that.

813
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,940
I didn't know that such stirring words meant I should work my ass off like this.

814
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:19,150
How foolish this me in the past was.

815
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,270
- Now is greatly different from the past, isn't it?
- Eh?

816
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:32,010
By any chance, did they notice our moves and now are trying to control the Royal Guard?

817
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:37,300
No way. If they noticed, they would've put some spies in here to listen to our words even now.

818
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,190
They might...

819
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,110
<i>Great!</i>

820
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:47,120
<i>Damn it.</i>

821
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,410
So tight.

822
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:53,380
<i>Oh, I'm getting drunk!</i>

823
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,180
Where the heck is the restroom?

824
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,390
There it is!

825
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:39,990
You know...

826
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:43,650
I'm so jealous of you.

827
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,480
I used to have one of those.

828
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,070
That thing which is

829
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:53,110
no longer mine... Bye!

830
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:58,380
My dragon! Bye-bye, my yong-yong <i>(dragon)</i>!

831
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,420
I can't even pee while standing.

832
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:09,400
This dirty world where only the haves can pee while standing.

833
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,830
It's so sad that even my pee stopped

834
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:15,800
and my tears stopped, too.

835
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:32,460
Now that I don't have my dragon,

836
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,660
I don't have my balls either.

837
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:38,790
If it's going to be this way, they should've killed me.

838
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,680
What is this cruelty you've done? Eh?!

839
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:46,480
<i>Here, accept mine. </i>

840
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,440
Huh...

841
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,700
Maybe they also caught our fabrication of light red made with pig's blood.

842
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,300
To put the king's father-in-law in the position of Commander of the Royal Guard

843
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,850
is actually proof that they haven't figured out our moves.

844
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,370
If they had found it out, they would've

845
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:15,900
already beheaded you two, my brother and Officer Hong.

846
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,480
Then, why all of a sudden...

847
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:24,350
Nothing has changed except for the queen and Lady Eui Bin entering the palace,

848
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:27,760
so maybe the queen used her influence to keep Lady Eui Bin in check.

849
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:33,630
As soon as the royal wedding is done, she's putting a sword to her husband's neck.

850
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:36,040
How scary this woman is.

851
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,000
As the situation isn't in our favor, let's put a stop to the plan to find that item.

852
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,510
What we're preparing is the fight for power and justification.

853
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:46,930
The only way to punish those powerful people

854
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:52,360
<i>is to prove their corruption with concrete documental evidence. </i>

855
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,800
Securing that key evidence, their double accounting book,

856
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,280
cannot be delayed.

857
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,480
Then, what shall we do?

858
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,360
Let's obediently give away the position of the Commander of the Royal Guard.

859
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,180
- But—
- If we throw them a prey, they will be too busy eating it

860
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,360
to look around at their surroundings.

861
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,830
If their attention is focused on the commander's appointment,

862
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:14,470
that will help us find the location of their double accounting book.

863
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:18,910
We can take that commander position back while they think they have it.

864
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:21,200
It's hard not to lose the position,

865
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,690
but it's even harder to take it back.

866
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,190
The Commander of the Royal Guard is the position of a warrior.

867
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:27,210
Even if he's appointed, it's in name only.

868
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:31,160
If he can't physically work in the position, he can't stay there.

869
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:36,860
On the first day of his appointment, let's make a small accident to drag him out of it.

870
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:40,000
What if Kim Mun-geun is quicker at sensing things than we anticipated,

871
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,170
and figures out the existence of our bodyguards right away?

872
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:45,950
Then, we will have to use our last resort

873
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:49,980
to secure the Royal Guard as well as get their double accounting book.

874
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,410
If you have such a good method, why don't we use it now?

875
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:55,360
What is this last resort?

876
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,500
Assassination.

877
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,360
He will end up that way anyway.

878
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:27,610
<i>What's this gloomy room? </i>

879
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:50,890
Damn it, the bell is tolling!

880
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:01,880
Wasn't that the queen?

881
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:04,040
Did she even disguise herself as a man and follow us?

882
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,700
We can't let her go like this.

883
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,690
However, we don't even know how much she heard

884
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,330
and I'm sure she's not here alone.

885
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:14,160
That's why we must hurry up, chase after her, and silence her.

886
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,560
Your Majesty.

887
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:34,010
This isn't the time you can hesitate out of personal feelings.

888
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,990
I'll do it myself.

889
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,790
Ten times...

890
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:26,920
Eleven times, okay...

891
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:30,960
If it rings one more time, I'm done for.

892
