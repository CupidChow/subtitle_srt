Look, pretty. Right? It's yours.

<i>Is she trying to buy time?</i>

16
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,070
Oh, what! What is it? Aren't you a robber?

17
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,410
Ah, do you even know who I am?

18
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,530
I am...

19
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,460
<i>She will probably reveal that she is the queen.</i>

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,670
I was with the special operations forces!

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,290
Come at me.

22
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,310
Hey, not all soldiers on cook's duty are the same!

23
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,400
A soldier on cook's duty with the special operations forces can even catch a ghost with a knife!

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
Come at me. I am not scared at all.

25

<i>How does she say such strange things with such a sincere gaze?</i>

<i>The face is his weakness.</i>

28
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,430
Looking at how His Majesty is covering his face,

29
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,990
it's a situation where he is hiding his identity.

30
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,990
Who's there?

31
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,980
I am Kim Byeong-in of the Kim Jwa-geun family.

32
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,270
What brings you here?

33
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,680
- Did you get robbed?
- He couldn't have gone far.

34
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,180
Search the surroundings thoroughly. He's not alone.

35
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,740
Yes.

36
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,590
Scatter and search.

37
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,840
Are you all right, Noo-i?
<i>(female relative)</i>

<i>Why does your gaze towards a younger relative look that way?</i>

40
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
So-yong!

41
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,320
How great the shock must have been...

42
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,780
How dare anyone...

43
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,790
You scared the crap out of me!

44
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,390
What is this ruckus!

45
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,100
We are looking for a suspicious person.

46
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,790
What are you doing now?

47
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,240
I blurted out my hand because they surprised me, didn't I?

48
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,610
- So, this game is invalid.
- Says who?

49
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,430
Then, do we continue when you saw my hand already!

50
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,190
You made the mistake so why do I have to pay for it?

51
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,560
What a miser!

52
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,700
Ah, that's a lot.

53
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,090
Did you just spit on my face?

54
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,290
Ah, whatever!

55
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,590
You... You!

56
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,190
- Detain him.
- Detain him.

57
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,350
Why are you all just standing and watching?

58
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,280
So that Byeolgam Hong can't run away, close the door and leave immediately!

59
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,040
You sure know how to look the part when you can't even fight well!

60
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,990
This guy, I am going to teach him a lesson today!

61
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,170
- Please protect me!
- Next time.

62
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,650
Why aren't you all leaving!

63
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,260
Ah, if you leave like this—

64
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,100
Byeolgam Hong, I will fix your bad habit today!

65
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,120
It seemed very real.

66
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,450
Can't I even joke?

67
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,380
If you really swing the sword...

68
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,470
<i> Not there! I haven't even wed...</i>

69
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,980
Let's go.

70
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,290
You call that wielding a sword?

71
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,160
Are you hurt anywhere?

72
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,230
I am fine.

73
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,660
To have Kim Byeong-in accompanying her...

74
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,580
could the other side have set a trap?

75
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,180
There is no way that they would use the queen as bait for a trap.

76
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,500
Also, the queen's reaction was so unusual that it bothers me.

77
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,030
There may be a bigger problem if we act rashly without knowing the situation.

78
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,070
Let's first ascertain the truth.

79
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,700
But... if the queen heard everything.

80
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,170
I was the one who dealt with the queen.

81
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,610
Please trust my judgment.

82
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

83
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,630
If my judgment is wrong,

84
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,970
we won't be able to stop the blood bath anyway.

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,190
No matter how noble he is unless he is the king...

89
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,970
- Put away the sword.
- Put away the swords!

Yes.

Oh, my god!

94
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,030
She fainted from shock, so tidy up her bedclothes

95
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,390
and come back ready to nurse her without being seen by others.

96
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,190
Yes.

<i>Why are you here when your wedding ceremony is tomorrow?</i>

101
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,400
<i>I felt like I was going crazy so I left the palace</i>

102
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,130

103

<i>so that I won't forget myself.</i>

<i>So that I...</i>

117
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,300
<i>don't let go of myself.</i>

118

<i>What could you be so scared of?</i>

<i>I am... not me.</i>

120

<i>[Daejojeon Hall - Queen's Residence]</i>

Kill me.

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,680
<i>I've summoned the Royal Physician so please endure for just a little while, Your Majesty.</i>

132
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,620
That quack! I already have a headache. If I see his face...

133
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,220
I will really make him a eunuch this time!

134
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,160
Then, please try eating this at least.

135
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,250
Eww, makes me nauseous. I think I am going to vomit.

136
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,270
How much did you drink that...

137
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,270
This woman is not trained on alcohol at all.

138
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,050
It's the first time in a long time my memory got affected by drinking.

139
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,520
How did I get in last night?

140
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,510
It was so fortunate that your cousin, Young Master Byeong-in, brought you back.

141
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,050
Otherwise, something terrible could have happened.

142
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,140
Thanks to him, no one other than myself knows about your outing.

143
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,680
My cousin?

144
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,060
How did I meet my cousin?

145
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,700
I am not sure, either...

146
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,440
But... Young Master told me that you fainted from shock.

147
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,030
What shock?

148
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,850
Faint? It's more like I passed out drunk.

149
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,080
Wow, but the queen's power is nice. You can even have the gate opened after the curfew.

150
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,250
He is your cousin but he is also the stepson of Daegam Kim Jwa-geun.

151
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,380
He is?

152
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,300
But I don't see Court Lady Choi. Is she late for work?

153
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,200
Young Master sent her outside the palace on an errand so that she didn't find out about your alcoholic illness.

154
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,070
She doesn't like going outside the palace so we had a hard time forcing her to go.

155
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,820
But why does everyone hate going outside the palace?

156
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,320
It's dangerous outside the palace

157
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,720
and everything is perfect inside the palace.

158
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,150
Is everyone under group hypnosis or something?

159
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,650
Inside the palace, something crucial is missing, don't you see it?

160
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,990
- What is it?
- Freedom.

161
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,750
Is it any different outside the palace?

162
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,570
Anyway, it's nice not to have that nag, Court Lady Choi, around.

163
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,570
Ah, my head...

164
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,430
Ah, times like this, eating Yeul Bul Ramen
<i> (T/N: Yeul Ramen mixed with Buldak Ramen, two of the spiciest )</i>

165
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,960
and sweating a bucket is the best!

166
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,880
Here, there is no ramen and no drinks to cure a hangover...

167
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,070
But there is power...

168
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,500
Hey, really!

169
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,680
- Get the fire going.
<i>- Get the fire going!</i>

170
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't understand what she is saying...

171
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,280
Why?

172
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
It's food for Daejojeon Hall.

173
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,890
And?

174
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,100
What are you saying?

175
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,810
Is the boiled meat ready?

176
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,790
This is not it.

177
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,410
Then, this time...

178
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,020
Is this your best?

179
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,300
What is the problem?

180
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,240
It's too healthy.

181
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,750
It's not spicy at all.

182
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,120
It's too spicy! Are you trying to kill someone?

183
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,220
I won't do anymore! No, I won't! If she's not happy with my dishes, go tell her to come here and cook it herself!

184
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,350
How frustrating! I'll do it myself!

185
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,300
<i>This traditional fireplace has strong firepower but it's hard to control it subtly</i>

186
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,220
<i>and a caldron has a high rate of heat conduction, so...</i>

187
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,930
What if Your Majesty gets hurt? You've never set your foot in a kitchen since we were done playing house.

188
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:07,300
All I may have learned about cooking is from playing house, yet I'd be still be better than his food.

189
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,250
This is a dangerous tool, Your Majesty.

190
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,800
Is this supposed to be held like this?

191
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,190
Please be careful with your hands.

213
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:58,370
I'm sure she just imitated its shape roughly. I doubt she seasoned it properly!

214
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,090
Of course, of course.

215
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,870
Of course, Sir, you're totally right.

216
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:08,300
Damn it! I've spent 30 years in this royal kitchen.

217
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,070
Does she think cooking is that easy?

218
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,560
Let me see. Let me see how terrible it is.

219
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,270
I doubt she could even get the taste right.

220
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,800
Is it that terrible, Sir?

221
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,000
The fragrance of a shitake mushroom and a large green onion,

222
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,670
and even the deep fragrance of beef...

223
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,210
How could these three different fragrances... How... This flavor is...

224
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,140
"Sam" meaning three, "Hyang" for fragrance, and "Ra" for a small pot!

225
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,090
Meaning "putting three different fragrances in a small pot," this is "Sam Hyang Ra"!

226
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,890
This is "Sam Hyang Ra Myeon"!
<i>(T/N: 'Myeon' - noodle. Word play for famous Samyang Ramyeon.) </i>

227
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,340
Wow, now I finally feel that my guts are cleansed. Well, it would be even more perfect with a tiny bit of MSG,

228
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,230
but this will do.

229
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,930
I've tasted all kinds of delicacies, thanks to Your Majesty and my job of testing your food first,

230
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,190
but this is my first time to taste such wonderful food like this.

231
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,060
Have one more bite.

232
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,610
Hey, when someone gives one bite of his ramyeon to another person, that means true love. Got it?

233
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,530
Then, please excuse me, I'll take one bite.

234
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:37,650
Seriously... You've never learned how to use a kitchen knife, but your cooking is better than the Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen.

235
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,200
What on earth can you not do well, Your Majesty?

236
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:49,990
Originally I was a perfect existence who could do almost everything, but now I can't do the most important thing.

237
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,830
The thing I did the best and liked to do...

238
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,030
You mean, embroidery? You're right, you were so excellent at it.

239
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,070
As soon as my touch reached, flowers bloomed, butterflies flew,

240
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,050
and everything went crazy, seriously.

241
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,700
<i>His Majesty the King is entering.</i>

242
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,820
No, why now of all— Damn it, it won't taste good when it gets soggy.

243
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,660
My Queen.

244
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,960
On my way back from the morning greetings to the elders, I stopped by at your quarters to see if you were well overnight.

245
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,560
<i>Did he sense that I went out for fun?</i>

246
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,620
Why wouldn't I be well? Did you enjoy a nice night as well, My King?

247
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,210
<i>Let's change the subject.</i>

248
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,530
<i>She's changing the subject. </i>

249
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,060
Thanks to you.

250
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,200
By the way, My Queen, did you have drinks?

251
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,680
Me? No way. Maybe you had drinks.

252
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,570
<i>Is this a staring contest?</i>

253
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,120
<i>Was she always this good at lying? </i>

254
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:44,060
Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm not usually such a mannerless jerk, but it happened just as you suddenly approached me too closely.

255
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,480
My nose is already ruined. Then, I'll take my leave as I'm busy.

256
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,780
Y-Y-Your Majesty!

257
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,260
I'll head to the Seonjeongjeon.
<i>(T/N: The king's office in Changdeok Palace)</i>

258
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

259
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,690
I'm pretty sure he's not busy, but even so, why did he come here, then?

260
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,910
Damn it, this got all soggy.

261
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,630
Greetings, Your Majesty.

262
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,610
Brother, to see if there's any smell permeating from my face...

263
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,990
could you please come closer and check?

264
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,980
Smell, Your Majesty?

265
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,890
I'm not sure yet. Please order that thing for me.

266
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:44,000
What on earth did the queen eat? Gosh, how disgusting!

267
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,730
Your Majesty, Young Master Kim Byeong-in is here.

268
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,750
Ah, my cousin?

269
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,960
I appreciate what you did last night for me.

270
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,920
I just did my duty.

271
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,950
As you’re my guest, I’ll ask them to bring some tea.

272
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,360
I missed you.

273
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,920
<i>What's with this sudden line? Well, let's just go along roughly. </i>

274
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,800
I missed you, too.

275
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,770
I'm glad to hear you say that.

276
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,000
Hearing that takes away all my worries.

277
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,370
<i>Why is that one line of mine so touching to him?</i>

278
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,980
I heard too late

279
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,210
that you fell into the lake after meeting me. That day, you told me that you were scared.

280
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,330
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

281
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,920
I told you... I was scared that day.

282
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,820
What scares me is...

283
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,210
People are the scariest things in the world.

284
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,100
Did you feel threatened?

285
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:04,180
The person who harmed Your Highness by pushing you into the lake and the person who tried to hurt you last night, did you figure out who they were?

286
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,830
Hold on!

287
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,940
I know about the lake, but who tried to hurt me last night?

288
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,070
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you remember?

289
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,160
- You were attacked by an assassin last night.
- Assassin!

290
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,540
I was about to die? Who? Why me?

291
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,650
I thought Your Highness knew, but I see that you don't.

292
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:32,570
<i>Why? They’ve tried to kill her twice already? Is this woman in danger? </i>

293
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:38,220
It could be somehow related to you being scared the day you fell into the lake.

294
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,680
I guess you don't know it yet, but my memory wavers.

295
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,370
You probably know better what we spoke about that day.

296
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:53,170
Did you really lose... all the memories of that day?

297
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,700
Yeah. I don't remember anything.

298
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,210
What matters is, what did that—

299
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,600
scoundrel try to do to me?

300
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,840
You escaped harm by a mere second.

301
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,140
The assassin was skilled in swordsmanship and judging by his clothes he was not an ordinary person.

302
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,670
I don't know how many people there were, but there were more men that were helping him.

303
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,220
If it weren't for you, I'd be dead.

304
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,710
Thank God we met yesterday.

305
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,640
<i>You...</i>

306
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,410
Why were you outside the palace last night?

307
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:52,360
I felt stifled, so I went to get some fresh air.

308
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,200
If Grand Queen Dowager finds out I was outside the palace, I'll get in big trouble.

309
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,950
<i>The surveillance will become more severe, and not only will I be unable to budge, but Hong Yeon will lose her head.</i>

310
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,300
Can't we just keep it between ourselves and let it go quietly?

311
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,060
But we must track down the culprit.

312
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,860
We can do it quietly. Otherwise, it'll put me in a tough spot.

313
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,710
I understand. Who else knows Your Highness was out last night?

314
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,970
Hong Yeon is the only one who knows.

315
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,980
I’ll have people keep an eye on her.

316
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:32,720
Hey! Hong Yeon is so loyal, she'll even feign death for me! She has nothing to do with it!

317
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,510
Your Highness, you shouldn’t trust anyone anymore.

318
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:41,910
I've known her for a long time, too, but it's those closest to you who are scariest.

319
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,910
You're not safe just because you're within the palace walls.

320
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,810
Rather... the palace could be more dangerous.

321
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,700
<i>Right. I've been forgetting what this place is all about.</i>

322
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,750
<i>A palace full of intrigue.</i>

323
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,020
<i>A dangerous place where life expectancy is no better than that of a battlefield.</i>

324
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,600
You don't need to be too afraid. I will protect you, Your Highness.

325
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,550
I appreciate it, but I should be protecting myself.

326
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,220
<i> This isn't the time for sightseeing.</i>

327
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,430
<i>You don't need to pretend to be strong in front of me.</i>

328
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:39,420
<i>You may have forgotten, but I can never forget</i>

329
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,090
<i>the memories of that night which have been etched as if with a branding iron. </i>

330
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,780
I will make sure to find out who they are...

331
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,490
<i>[General Store]</i>

332
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,790
Is this the place where they sell the silk thread from the Qing Dynasty?

333
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,830
I'm here because I heard you have a valuable item from the Qing Dynasty.

334
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,430
The rumors sure spreads fast!

335
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,410
This way.

336
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:01,100
You keep such valuable items in this messy place?

337
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,380
It is because they are extremely valuable.

338
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,710
- Here.
- What is this?

339
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,040
Oh, this is... Close one of your eyes,

340
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,880
and look into it like this.

341
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,560
<i>Hey there! Anyone around?</i>

342
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,900
I think you misunderstood me. I came to buy the silk thread—

343
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,330
...silk thread from the Qing Dynasty.

344
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,830
Where am I supposed to use this strange tube? Gosh.

345
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:08,830
<i>Kim Byeong-in... telling me not to trust anyone. How am I supposed to trust him then? </i>

346
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:14,750
<i>No way. Is it possible that Hong Yeon really wants to hurt me? Or Jo Hwa-jin again...</i>

347
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,950
A week is too long. I'm going to die without knowing why at this rate.

348
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,330
<i>Let's do what I'm good at. Taming them with food. </i>

349
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:26,970
<i>My food can even pierce through a steel plate. I'm certain it will work on Grand Queen Dowager, too. </i>

350
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,410
Oh, wait! Is this table coming back from Grand Queen Dowager's quarters?

351
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,500
Yes, Your Highness.

352
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,430
Let me see.

353
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:46,160
Tables coming back from the royal family contains important health and preference information. They can't be examined freely.

354
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,940
Take it away!

355
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,660
What's wrong with you? I'm the queen.

356
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,420
With all due respect, Your Majesty, everyone calls me the Head chef of the Royal Kitchen.

357
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,500
That means, as long as we're in this royal kitchen, I'm the head.

358
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,430
Then, let's prove it by competing with skill.

359
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,830
Let's see who the boss is here.

360
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:13,370
How can you say that? Since we have to prepare the next meal for the king, please leave this kitchen now.

361
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,650
Eh... you're afraid you might lose, right?

362
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,310
To me, whose cooking skill is only from playing house...

363
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,460
Well, is the preparation of the king's table going well...

364
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,640
<i>Go, Boss, Go!</i>

365
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:26,620
<i>You're doing great, Boss!</i>

366
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:33,370
Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen! Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen!

367
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,560
Damn it!

368
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,350
This is so frustrating, seriously!

369
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:06,080
When it comes to cooking, s-speed is also important, but the taste is the most important!

370
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,990
True.

371
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,670
- You.
- Me, Your Majesty?

372
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,150
Seeing by your outfit, you don't work for the royal kitchen. Where do you work?

373
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,950
Yes, I'm the Dosulli under Saongwon.
<i>(T/N: Head Eunuch in charge of King's tribute gifts)</i>

374
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,060
- You should taste it.
- Me?

375
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,810
All these people are this guy's underlings, so I doubt they're able to be honest about the taste. Come and try it.

376
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

377
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,440
Then, please allow me...

378
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,990
Until now, this kind of flavor has never existed, Your Majesty.
<i>(T/N: a parody of famous quote from the movie, "Extreme Job")</i>

379
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,280
Just like its name, Yeolguja-tang, this dish pleases the mouth.
<i>(T/N: yeolgujatang - it makes the mouth happy)</i>

380
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,810
Among all the dishes I've ever tasted in my life, it's making the tip of my tongue dance with—

381
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,980
Who are you!

382
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,090
How dare a girl come into the royal kitchen!

383
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,970
That little brat!

384
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:40,630
You said that for me to hear, didn't you? The part, "How dare a girl come into the royal kitchen?"

385
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,510
N-N-No way, why would I...

386
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,420
Your Majesty.

387
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,220
Whatever.

388
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,870
I was quicker and my dish also had an impeccable taste,

389
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,680
so as long as I'm in here, I'm the head of this place.

390
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,570
You all should cooperate with me.

391
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,020
<i>- Yes, Your Majesty!</i>
- That bastard...

392
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:27,980
Going forward, watch closely how this "girl" cooks and learn, okay?

393
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:36,700
Your Majesty! His Majesty is at Daejojeon Hall right now!

394
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,810
Why did you come so early today?

395
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,640
Because I missed you, My Queen.

396
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,620
Your sense of humor is particularly good today.

397
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,260
You should head to Eui Bin's quarters soon.

398
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,890
- Special Forces.
- Huh?

399
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,910
Don't you have anything to say about these words?

400
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,140
<i>Does he mean to play "the game of connecting words"?</i>

401
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,400
S... S... Scram, right now.
<i>(T/N: Connecting the word from the last letter of previous words)</i>

402
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,210
Army Cook.

403
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,760
K...?

404
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,310
You're the king after all, so if I use this word, I might lose my neck. <i>(T/N: She's thinking of a 'k' word for 'moron')</i>

405
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,060
Try it, please.

406
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,600
Kookie with a load of freaking bullshit.

407
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,210
Seeing that you have such an incoherent foul-mouth,

408
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,900
I guess you have a lot of complaints about the world.

409
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,300
Why don't you tell me all those complaints today?

410
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,190
I won't go to Eui Bin's quarters tonight.

411
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,980
Oh, no, no, I have no complaints.

412
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,990
These days, I'm thinking, "Have I ever had such a perfect life like this before?"

413
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,000
Have you met anyone today?

414
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,960
What do you want to know?

415
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,910
<i>How much you heard.</i>

416
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,870
I just want to know your daily life, My Queen, that's all.

417
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,080
I'll leave after having a little conversation with you.

418
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:02,480
Well, my cousin came by.

419
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,560
When you say, your cousin...

420
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,820
Did he say his name was Kim Byeong-in?

421
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,390
Why did he come by?

422
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:12,230
Why does it feel like I'm being interrogated right now?

423
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,140
You're being too sensitive.

424
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,610
It's because I'm concerned whether something is going on with your family.

425
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,900
It wasn't anything special. He came to just say hello and congratulate our royal wedding.

426
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,710
If that's the case, I'm relieved.

427
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:29,320
But... why do you hate me so much these days?

428
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,870
<i>Is she being hostile because she knows I was the assassin? </i>

429
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,770
Now we're married!

430
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:40,090
Even if a couple used to love each other to death, they often end up hating each other to death after marriage.

431
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,620
Satisfied now? Okay, go now.

432
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,580
Anyone out there? Prepare the bedding.

433
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,410
What's wrong with you? This isn't what we agreed on!

434
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:56,040
While having a conversation with you, I got tired and now have no energy to go to Eui Bin's quarters.

435
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,510
I knew it, WDWN.
<i>(T/N: Wins during the day, withdraws at night.)</i>

436
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,500
<i>He's suspicious. </i>

437
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,100
<i>She's suspicious.</i>

438
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:24,540
<i>Your Majesty, you can trust no one from now on. </i>

439
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,880
<i>That's right, this punk is the most untrustworthy.</i>

440
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:33,690
<i>Throughout history, regardless of place or time, the prime suspect in a wife's murder is the husband.</i>

441
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,610
<i>You never know what words she might utter during her sleep. </i>

442
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,160
<i>What if he does something to me during my sleep?</i>

443
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,360
<i>- I must not fall asleep.
- I must not fall asleep.</i>

444
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:53,440
No... No... No, you can't!

445
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,230
No, no, don't! No...

446
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,970
Hey, look here! What's wrong? Oh, he might die at this rate!

447
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:09,140
Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Wake up! Wake up, wake up!

448
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,640
Hwa-jin...

449
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,620
You saved me again. Many thanks.

450
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,490
What the... Are you nuts!

451
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,000
Hwa-jin...

452
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,090
Oh, My Queen.

453
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,630
You won't be able to kill me by hitting me like that.

454
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:47,060
It seemed like you'd die if I left you alone. You were struggling and squirming around so much!

455
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,710
I think I was being hit because I called out another woman's name.

456
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:53,600
Please don't mind it too much.

457
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,900
I don't care about such a mere thing, so come on! Please, "no-touch"!

458
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,710
You're using that word again.

459
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:09,130
Since you're awake now, why don't you go to Eui Bin's quarters or even your own quarters to sleep comfortably?

460
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,980
Ah...

461
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,290
If I move too early in the morning, it will be too harsh on the people serving us.

462
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,920
What a great sage king you are.

463
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,780
Many thanks for the compliment, My Queen.

464
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:34,310
Oh, dear, My Queen, you're too greedy.

465
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,580
- You're very full of strength.
- Just sleep quietly and leave soon.

466
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,570
Well, concessions are also one of the virtues a sage king should have.

467
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,590
Strangely, whenever I sleep here, my body feels out of sorts.

468
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,000
That's why this should be our last time sleeping together.

469
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,290
I think this is because I'm not accustomed to this place,

470
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,520
so I'd better keep coming here until I feel accustomed.

471
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,060
I don't want to be forced to wake up early again because of your nightmares, though.

472
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,840
I don't know about the nightmare,

473
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,980
but I remember I woke up because I was being hit for calling another woman's name.

474
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,720
Tonight, no matter what, by all means,

475
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,700
I'll call out your name, My Queen.

476
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,710
Geez, I totally lost my appetite.

477
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,090
If you're done, let's finish our breakfast, as I'm busy today.

478
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,970
Why are you so busy?

479
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,520
Operation! <i>(T/N: The literal meaning of 'Jak-eop' is 'operation' or 'work', but it's also used as a slang for 'flirting'. )</i>

480
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,070
Since I can't get any phone numbers or SNS information here,

481
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,910
I'd better find out by physically running around.

482
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,020
Ae-soon-ae-su?
<i>(T/N: trying to pronounce 'SNS')</i>

483
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,550
"Ae-Soon-Ae-Su?"

484
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,520
Ae as in love, Soon as in innocently, Ae as in with lovely, and Su as in touches?

485
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,830
Tonight, I will treat you in that way.

486
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:32,580
<i>It hit the bull's eye!</i>

487
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,890
Nice!

488
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,380
Oh, when did you learn something like this?

489
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,750
You're flattering me, Your Majesty.

490
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:46,160
Then, shall I show you my skills, too?

491
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,920
Well,

492
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,880
it wasn't my intention, but I happened to sleep with the king.

493
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,010
But, in fact, it wasn't really "sleeping together"

494
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,000
but a fake one, you know?

495
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,550
You must know as he went to your quarters the night before last.

496
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:17,340
But, damn, I don't know what he's thinking, but he wouldn't go over to your place last night even though I told him to.

497
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,240
But please don't worry about it.

498
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,660
Nothing happened last night and nothing will happen in the future as well.

499
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,490
Did you want to see me here to just say that?

500
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,960
Well, the thing is...

501
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,880
<i>Is she really the real culprit of the incident at the lake? And of the second attempt as well? </i>

502
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,230
<i>If that's the case, please put a stop to it for a few days. </i>

503
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:41,140
I can't bear being hated by a beautiful woman.

504
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,510
I don't want you to hate me.

505
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:49,150
Oh no, the arrow caught the wind this time!

506
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:53,120
Anyway, if you just trust me and wait for a few days—

507
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,410
Do you know who I trust the least in this palace?

508
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,240
That's none other than Her Majesty the Queen.

509
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,160
Therefore, I don't trust any of the words I just heard.

510
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:11,580
So, if you're trying to come between His Majesty and me, please give up.

511
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,340
Oh, but these days, I've become a totally new person.

512
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,940
Can't you notice that I've totally changed?

513
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,740
You've changed to a much scarier person,

514
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:23,700
because, while being kind to my face, you're trying to frame me for the lake incident behind my back.

515
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,250
Whoa! I've never framed you for anything!

516
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,840
Since no one knows who the culprit is, I guess you're being suspected in this circumstance—

517
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,940
Your Majesty, you know the culprit.

518
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:44,760
The culprit is none other... than yourself, Your Majesty.

519
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,710
You threw yourself in the water on purpose,

520
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,500
so that you could frame me.

521
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:11,900
Seeing how upset she got, she's not lying. Now I understand her cold stare.

522
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,820
<i>The lake incident was fabricated... now I need to find out about the assassin.</i>

523
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:21,010
<i>But it doesn't change the fact that someone is after me.</i>

524
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:26,490
Your Majesty, please, let's go back to your quarters.

525
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,330
You go and wait for me there, Court Lady Choi.

526
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,620
If anything happens, just come up with an excuse and tell Hong Yeon to let me know.

527
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,630
- I cannot.
- That's how you can save me. I ask you.

528
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,020
Oh, over here!

529
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:50,380
Head Chef of the Royal Kitchen, how many times do you send a table to Grand Queen Dowager?

530
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,820
I don't know the exact number, but many times.

531
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,830
I didn't want to say this,

532
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,670
but there are plenty of people in Joseon who can be the Head of the Royal Kitchen.

533
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:19,150
Morning porridge, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night snacks, as well as appetizers in between.

534
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,360
- She eats all that?
- Every three or four days,

535
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,760
she tells me not to send over lunch.

536
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,800
On those days, she asks for ginger tea with honey.

537
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:40,410
<i>Looking at her leftovers, they're usually foods that are cold or chewy.</i>

538
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:44,700
<i>But asking not to exclude them means she's trying to hide that fact.</i>

539
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,220
<i>I pick them based on physiognomy rather than talent.</i>

540
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,650
They're all very handsome, don't you think?

541
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,630
- Bang.
- Listen up!

542
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:00,420
Is that the loudest gunpowder sound you can make! Louder!

543
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,990
Bang!

544
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:06,620
- Bang!
- Oh, our Minister of War, that must have given you a fright!

545
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,270
Watch your hands!

546
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:15,620
But... I heard that you asked His Majesty yourself and got assigned to the Eoyeongcheong?
<i> (Special Army Unit that issues coins)</i>

547
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:20,430
Eoyeongcheong is not considered to be an army unit, so it's called the Idle Unit.

548
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:22,870
I heard gossip about it, so I said, "That is it!"

549
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:27,720
and picked it for myself. You see, I don't really like being busy.

550
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,460
- And the item?
- Is it tonight?
- Yes.

551
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,560
It's a powder made from fly agaric,
<i>(A type of poisonous mushroom)</i>

552
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,960
but it has no smell or taste, but if you add it to alcohol, it becomes a drink of confession.

553
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:05,290
But... if the queen knew something, why would she keep it quiet?

554
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:12,460
Either she's preparing something in secret or she's waiting for the right moment. It's best to make sure.

555
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,930
Yeongpyeong-gun doesn't have huge ambitions.

556
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,630
He sticks right by His Majesty all day,

557
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:30,890
and at night, with Byeolgam Hong in Yejang,

558
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,120
playing card games all night long.

559
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,720
As for Byeolgam Hong...

560
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,530
he's still a loafer skimming off military provisions.

561
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:47,520
Eoyeongcheong has no power or influence behind its name anyway, so I think it's best to leave him be.

562
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,670
He's lost his father, brother, mother, and grandparents in front of his eyes,

563
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,930
so I'm sure he's learned his lesson.

564
00:55:54,930 --> 00:56:00,590
But... when will you be appointed as the Commander of the Royal Guard?

565
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,090
Is there a problem?

566
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:06,030
I only want to clean up things before you start your new post!

567
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,860
Did you play an interesting game with military provisions again?

568
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:20,430
Watch yourself! How many times have I warned you that an unstable army poses the greatest danger!

569
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,930
Yes. I will correct it.

570
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:32,230
I think there's a dangerous person running around outside the palace.

571
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,630
What do you mean?

572
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:37,070
While on my way to Oktajeong two nights ago—

573
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:40,500
Oktajeong, two nights ago?

574
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:47,020
Yes. I found myself a good friend with the great name of Lee Saeng-man.

575
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,210
- Lee Saeng-man...
- Do you know the name?

576
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:56,920
No. It sounds familiar, so he must be the son of a nobleman,

577
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,650
but it's my first time hearing it.

578
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:03,300
But while I was walking to Oktajeong with him,

579
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:09,030
I lost my consciousness all of a sudden from shock.

580
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,880
When I came to, that friend, Lee Saeng-man,

581
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:16,090
had disappeared without a trace.

582
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,900
- Do you remember what he looked like?
- Of course.

583
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,270
By chance,

584
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,190
was he wearing a robe made with this material?

585
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:33,320
No.

586
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:41,130
Fine. If you find that friend of yours,

587
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,990
let me know what exactly happened.

588
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:50,010
By that you mean... you're giving me a special mission?

589
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:52,840
I wouldn't call it a special mis—

590
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,940
You... You come into the palace every day, but yet, you don't do anything. Right?

591
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,050
What do you mean?

592
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:06,380
Just saying my greetings to those I know takes the whole day.

593
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,250
There's a perfect job for you.

594
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:16,830
- A real special mission.
- Finally!

595
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:38,290
<i>[No Ta Chi]</i>
<i>(No touch)</i>

596
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,100
<i>[No Ta Chi]</i>

597
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:52,430
Sire, Yeongpyeong-gun is here to see you.

598
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,160
- Do you know what this means?
- Pardon?

599
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,060
Oh, come close and take a look.

600
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,590
<i>[No Ta Chi]</i>

601
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:14,140
According to the queen, it means, "Let's both be happy,"

602
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,200
but where could this phrase have come from?

603
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,020
It's my first time hearing it.

604
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,710
Maybe... from Buddhist scriptures?

605
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:31,370
♪ <i>No Ta Chi</i> ♪
<i> (Being sung as a Buddhist sutra)</i>

00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,640
Oh!

607
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,120
I see.

608
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,270
I would like to have some tea with my brother.

609
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:42,110
Yes, I will prepare it.

610
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,400
Among all the strange words the queen has uttered,

611
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,430
I'm tracing back to see if there was anything significant that was said.

612
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,640
This is what you asked for.

613
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,950
Well done.

614
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:12,600
- Is today the day?
- It's better to get it done sooner than later.

615
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,310
Good.

616
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,980
Put more mud there.

617
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:27,540
Even if it's your command, if you make a mess of the furnace this way—

618
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:31,090
I’m not making a mess of it but upgrading it.

619
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,920
What nonsense...

620
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:45,280
What a nonsensical fellow. That stone is too small!

621
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,220
Why? Is it heavy?

622
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,640
I'll help you. This stone looks good.

623
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,320
That stone is too big, Chef.

624
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,260
Why would you put that on it?

625
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,690
- Your Majesty.
- Is it the oil?

626
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:58,410
Yes, it is. Just as you ordered, I brought all kinds of oils, including canola oil, sesame oil.

627
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:00,490
I brought everything I could find.

628
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,560
You did a good job.

629
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,230
Those are extremely valuable things. Your Majesty,

630
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,730
that oil is enough to last us the whole year.

631
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:16,760
Eighty percent of cooking depends on ingredients. My fate depends on this meal.

632
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,020
Your Majesty, His Majesty has been waiting for you at Daejojeon Hall for a long time!

633
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,220
Go and tell him that I'm doing my filial duty.

634
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,380
My goodness. She poured it all out.

635
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:47,470
How could you bring all those precious gifts for the king?

636
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,660
I would have died if I hadn’t brought them.

637
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:55,230
We can get more if we squeeze it out of the people. What are you worried about?

638
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:03,590
What is she doing without taking off the scales?

639
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,810
That’s an extremely valuable ingredient.

640
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:20,620
Okay, there. It's good.

641
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:25,770
Good job.

642
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,240
- Take this.
- Yes.

643
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,530
- Put that right inside.
- Pardon?

644
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:32,230
- I said put that right inside.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

645
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,040
It's done.

646
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,520
How could she burn the croaker, which was the best of all the gifts?

647
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,460
Wh-Wh-What a strange sight?

648
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,520
Your Majesty, please forgive my boldness.

649
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,670
In order to handle the making of Grand Queen Dowager's meal herself,

650
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,010
Her Majesty is in the Royal Kitchen.

651
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:21,460
Fine. I'll wait here.

652
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,370
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

653
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,110
She's avoiding me.

654
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,820
- Your Highness, are you all right?
- Oh my goodness.

655
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,010
I fell asleep here for a moment.

656
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,920
My fate depends on you.

657
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,620
It's going to sting.

658
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,490
Please announce my arrival.

659
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:08,770
I said I didn’t want lunch today.

660
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:13,390
The queen made it herself.

661
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,620
The queen cooked this?

662
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,500
Yes, Your Highness.

663
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,560
She spent the whole night cooking it.

664
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,540
I appreciate her effort,

665
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,520
but what is this made with?

666
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,930
This looks unfamiliar.

667
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:37,020
She said that she cooked

668
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:41,960
an assorted dish of beef, pork, and croaker.

669
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:46,280
This doesn't look like food but some embroidery artwork.

670
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:53,080
Although I really don't have any appetite, as she stayed up all night long to cook this dish,

671
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,860
I'll take just one bite to appreciate her effort.

672
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,070
Is there any news from her?

673
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:26,860
No.

674
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:33,390
This won't work. I'll go myself.

675
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:36,990
<i>Grand Queen Dowager is here!</i>

676
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,500
<i>Did I succeed?</i>

677
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,450
How could you do this!

678
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,580
<i>I failed?</i>

679
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,160
Why have you been hiding this kind of talent?

680
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,630
Pardon?

681
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:11,260
I don’t know when the last time was that I enjoyed a meal like this.

682
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:16,920
The food moved me so much that... Whoa!

683
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,330
<i>It was a complete success!</i>

684
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,570
I'm glad you liked it.

685
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:25,900
Obviously, I liked it.

686
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,260
I think I could eat this every day.

687
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,190
How did you learn to cook like that?

688
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:37,390
Such a soft texture and abundant decadency I've never tasted before...

689
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:44,570
I cooked it in oil all night on low heat.

690
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:49,490
<i>The fish basted with oil was cooked at low temperature in a fireplace with burnt charcoal all night long,</i>

691
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:53,520
<i>so it could have both the crisp skin and soft texture inside. </i>

692
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,780
<i>In the case of the beef and pork, which have tougher textures than fish, I put the pieces in the deep cauldron with oil</i>

693
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:01,040
<i>and left them to be cooked at low temperature overnight, just like I did for the fish. </i>

694
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,620
This method preserves not only their tastes but also their nutrients at the maximum,

695
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,440
so this is healthy food to help you maintain your health and youth.

696
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,150
<i>This is Confit, a cooking method from French cuisine. </i>

697
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:17,670
Not only the taste but also health?

698
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,880
Where on earth did you learn such a method?

699
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:28,160
Well, should I say, some sort of inspiration? How can I please Your Royal Highness,

700
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,610
I've spent several days and nights thinking about it.

701
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:36,660
<i>Now, this is the moment to throw my final punch.</i>

702
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,200
I'll help you every day,

703
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:45,260
so that... you can stay young and healthy... for your entire life.

704
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:49,950
♫ <i> Bong-hwan!</i> ♫

705
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,200
♫ <i> Bong-hwan!</i> ♫

706
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,250
I'll permit you to fill the lake with water.

707
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,100
Yes!

708
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:05,280
♫ <i>I, who doesn't have any fear in this world,</i> ♫

709
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,760
♫ <i>I, who is the fearless free spirit</i> ♫

710
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:12,150
♫ <i>How did I end up locked in this body?</i> ♫

711
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:15,540
♫ <i>What on earth should I do now? </i> ♫

712
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:18,140
♫ <i>How amazing this is! </i> ♫

713
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,480
How long will it take to fill it up in this way?

714
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,860
Even if they work as fast as possible, it will take 10 days at least.

715
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:27,260
Fill that up immediately or I will behead you guys!

716
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,750
Move, move! Move, move!

717
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:39,270
Just now, it got extended by two more days.

718
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:41,630
All of you, stop!

719
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,880
I have a way.

720
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,230
<i>Here the water goes!</i>

721
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,430
Here we go.

722
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:55,000
<i>- Here another bucket!</i>
- Here we go!

723
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:02,150
How convenient this way is! Good, good!

724
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:04,570
Hurry up, hurry!

725
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,330
What an innovative system this is.

726
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:17,950
Good, very good.

727
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:21,250
Until the lake is filled with water, don't even think about going to bed, all of you.

728
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,220
<i>- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!</i>

729
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:46,880
So, her name is Hong Yeon? If that sweet attitude of yours is just a fake mask,

730
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:52,430
you might be able to fool everyone, but not me.

731
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,360
Well, it is really a rare fabric,

732
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,560
but I'm not so skilled that I can tell where it came from just by looking at it.

733
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:23,750
But, I should put in more effort to figure it out,

734
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:27,960
since, as a people, we should make more effort if lacking in skill.

735
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,840
I like your attitude.

736
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:37,660
I was bothered that he gave the queen no affection,

737
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:41,070
but I don't think I need to worry about that anymore.

738
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,900
Any other news?

739
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:50,400
Last night, while the queen spent the night in the royal kitchen,

740
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:56,260
His Majesty desperately waited for her in her quarters all night.

741
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:01,620
Even when I asked that he go over to Eui Bin's quarters, he insisted on staying.

742
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,750
I cannot believe that His Majesty was so desperately waiting for the queen!

743
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:11,010
I see. You can leave now.

744
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:12,830
Yes, Your Highness.

745
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:20,980
Sleeping together often makes you develop feelings.

746
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:24,400
The queen made a promise to me with confidence.

747
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,660
Promise?

748
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:29,120
That she would conceive a royal prince.

749
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:35,070
Then a royal prince is going to come from our family finally?!

750
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,800
What is this?

751
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,050
Oh, yes.

752
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:47,590
Here. It's said that if you eat this, you'll generate new skin.

753
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:50,820
Such a precious item!

754
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:56,390
If it's to your liking, I will do my utmost to bring you some more.

755
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:58,760
I thank you.

756
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:07,270
I never knew such a joyous day would come. When the queen fell into the lake,

757
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:10,290
I was in torment.

758
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:15,990
I'm very proud that such an innocent child is enduring her position so well that...

759
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:19,290
I am full of tears.

760
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,190
You need to say it correctly.

761
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:27,560
To be honest, she isn't an innocent child. The queen is... how should I put it...

762
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,060
Bright?

763
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,520
Rather than that...

764
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,070
Meticulous.

765
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:39,960
That's not it. A more direct expression.

766
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,000
Rough?

767
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:48,730
Unique?

768
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:51,880
That's it! She's a unique child.

769
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,260
She's a fine choice as the Mother of the State.

770
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:57,990
That's right! It's like seeing how you were

771
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:00,520
in your younger years!

772
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,800
I doubt that!

773
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:13,900
Are you crazy?! Did you see it yourself? Did you?

774
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:19,320
Has anyone in this palace seen My Lady push the queen into the lake?

775
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,730
Do we have to see to know when the rumor has already spread?

776
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:23,870
That's true. Right.

777
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:25,470
- We all know.
- Usually,

778
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:31,390
the guiltier you are, the crazier you react. Rumors don't spread for no reason.

779
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:41,030
This girl! There will be a rumor tomorrow that you're bald!

780
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,800
Let me go!

781
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,070
Let go! Let go!

782
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:48,230
The queen framed her!

783
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:52,050
When My Lady was passing by the lake, she jumped in on purpose!

784
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:55,060
Know the truth before gossiping!

785
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:13,590
Tonight, I will surely...

786
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:42,270
Your Majesty, I thought you were going to work on calligraphy.

787
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:49,870
I went to Yejang to play a card game with Byeolgam Hong and saw something extraordinary.

788
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:57,040
He threw this right at the target from afar.

789
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:02,830
I thought I could do it, too.

790
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:07,490
It's dangerous. What if you get hurt?

791
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:18,220
How long have you served me?

792
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:23,220
It's been a little over two years.

793
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:28,140
I see.

794
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:36,890
During this short time, you've come to completely understand me and serve me.

795
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:40,810
I feel like it's been much longer than that.

796
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:44,240
It's my obligation to do my duty.

797
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,390
Obligation?

798
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:54,770
Looking at your faithfulness, whether you're doing your duty out of obligation

799
01:16:54,770 --> 01:17:01,190
or... you're doing it with sincerity, I can clearly tell.

800
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:04,990
I can see your sincerity.

801
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,190
Thank you for the recognition, Your Majesty.

802
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:11,690
Do you trust me?

803
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:15,350
If I didn't trust you, who else would I—

804
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,270
It's harder than I thought.

805
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:28,970
But... you trust me so little?

806
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,440
I-I-I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

807
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,980
With my age, I seem to have become less brave.

808
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:40,750
I'll go to Daejojeon Hall a little early tonight.

809
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:43,190
I will prepare for it, Your Majesty.

810
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:22,730
I finally get to see you now that I'm here early.

811
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:27,330
You have more integrity than you look. Seeing how hard-working you are about sleeping together.

812
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:31,070
We're bringing in the drink table.

813
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:32,330
Why the drink table?

814
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,540
You like drinking. I told them to prepare it.

815
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,870
I've stopped drinking.

816
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,630
I thought you might have...

817
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:46,560
We're bringing in a snack table.

818
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:01,400
It's jasmine tea.

819
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:06,570
If you have insomnia or worries, it helps you to settle.

820
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:18,000
Jasmine tea? The fragrance is very powe—

821
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,230
<i>Gosh...</i>

822
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:31,030
<i>I smelled it then, too. It filled the room.</i>

823
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:39,600
<i>The fragrance that was also embedded in the sleeves... </i>

824
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,630
It was you...

825
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:18,030
You were...

826
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:21,530
<i>It's dangerous to show true feelings.</i>

827
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:30,560
<i>Especially... inside this palace where everyone is hiding the truth.</i>
