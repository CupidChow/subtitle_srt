Stop!

6
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,280
- Search them.
- Yes!

7
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,300
There's nothing wrong.

8
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,590
We've arrived.

9
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,660
Search for the king in each and every cart of commodities very thoroughly.

10
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,140
Yes.

11
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,740
- Your Majesty!
- Dosulli.

12
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,280
The k-king!

13
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,060
I've finally caught that bastard.

14
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,130
When is the coronation going to start?

15
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,900
- It will be at the time of the lamb. <i>(1:00 - 3:00 p.m.)</i>
- Then we have enough time, right?

16
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,170
But we can't become relaxed. Let's hurry.

17
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,940
Wait.

18
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,450
- What was that?
- I don't know, either...

19
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,360
This much will be all right to spare.

20
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,050

Wait a bit, I haven't finished the packing yet.

25
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,720
Your Majesty,

26
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,050
how wronged you must feel

27
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,020
that your soul is still wandering around this world?

28
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,780
Your Majesty...

29
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,450
Head Eunuch... come with me.

30
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,370

G-Get lost now!

32
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,240
Your Majesty, I hope you reach nirvana.

33
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,890
Let's go. Come with me.

34
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,040
Your Majesty?

35
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,120
Your Majesty?

36
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,110
- Your Majesty! You're aliv—
- Shush!

37
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,840
Oh my goodness! Your Majesty, what happened?

38
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,760
That scarf looks good on your dragon robe, too.

39
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,750
My crazy sense (of style) is indeed good.

40
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,230
Over there!

41
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,280
This way!

42
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,450
What the...

43
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,030
Oh, yes!

44
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,080
How come you're so good at that?

45
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,770
Well, shall I say, it's the vibe from my experiences?

46
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,670
W-What's from your experiences?

47
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,730
Whenever I'm holding a knife, I let fly, you know.

48
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,190
Stop doing any useless attempts.

49
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,440
How many soldiers are stationed in the palace at the moment?

50
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,420
<i>(Without honorifics)</i> You're too late. That's the sound announcing the coronation.

51

52
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,810

<i>First bow!

56
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,000

Excuse me, you know...

58
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,210
Well... Just in case, I took out some insurance.

59
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,280
What are you doing? You should hurry up and proceed!

60
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,140
Well...

61
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,890
The Royal Seal has disappeared!

62
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,020
The Royal Seal is gone!

63
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,030
I must have gone crazy!

64
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,050
Because of those damnable words of "special mission,"

65
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,560
my heart heated up again...

66
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,020
<i>Raise your head.</i>

67
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,180
<i>This is the first time meeting you, Your Majesty.</i>

<i>L-L-Lee Saeng-mang!</i>

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,030
<i>This situation now is... Have you gone crazy</i>

71
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,340
<i>or have I gone crazy?</i>

72
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,690
Stole the Royal Seal?

73
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,930
You know I'm a bit crazy.

74
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,760
If so, we still have a chance.

75
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,500
- Let's go.
- Okay.

76
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,700
Darn it, it opened easily last time.

77
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,860
- Do it better—
- Quiet, quiet!

78
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,980
This man...

79
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,000
<i>Sir!</i>

80
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,660
Is it you again?

81
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,330
Gosh, I told you not to come!

82
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,110
The thing is... because there are no other people but you that I can ask this.

83
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,880
I stole a small item because of the queen's request.

84
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,750
This is shiny and looks precious, so it's somewhat very ominous.

85
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,890
What is that?

86
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,260
The Royal Seal!

87
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,940
What!

88
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,050
Where do you think you came after stealing the Royal Seal?

89
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,440
Of course, it's the Royal Investigation Bureau.

90
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,070
Did I just walk into jail with my own feet?

91
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,610
W-Why are you giving it to me?

92
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,530
What are you doing here?

93
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,100
I just came to see my friend's face for a moment.

94
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,890
You shouldn't do this. Please come out immediately.

95
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,860
Wait!

96
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,940
Who are you to touch my best friend's body?

97
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,420
Are you insane? How could you show him the Royal Seal so openly?

98
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,030
The Royal Seal?

99
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,490
Will you take a look?

100
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,250
- It's a bomb!
- Everyone, run!

101
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,910
They're attacking Hanyang? All of the main gates of the capital?

102
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,110
Yes, My Lord. If you allow us to use firearms—

103
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,380
For now, it's more important to finish the coronation safely, so just stand by with the firearms.

104
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,030
Mobilize all the troops and send them to each main gate of the city. Hurry up!

105
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,970
As soon as the coronation is done,

106
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,910
I'll wipe out all of you.

107
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,830
How can we proceed with the coronation without the Royal Seal!

108
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,630
What a disaster this is...

109
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,300
Brother, what on earth have you been doing?

110
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,570
How can you be so useless like this!

111
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,040
What is it?

112
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
So?

113
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,660
At the moment, because of the unidentified acrid smoke, it's not easy to attack them.

114
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,800
Since the coronation needs to be completed safely, I sent all the troops to each gate of the city

115
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,600
and they're completely blocking them.

116
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,490
Attacking the West side after creating noise at the East side...
<i>(T/N: Military strategy of diversion)</i>

117
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,550
What's going on?

118
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,030
It's nothing. I'll go and find the Royal Seal myself.

119
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,960
Call those troops back to the palace immediately!

120
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,450
- Pardon me?
- Did you not hear me!

121
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,060
Yes, My Lord.

122
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,100
How could this place be so empty like this?

123
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,970
This means that our people out there are doing a good job.

124
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,060
In the end, we've come this far.

125
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,730
Are you nervous?

126
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,630
I am nervous and...

127
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,830
I'm overwhelmingly excited.

128
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,410
That's right! This feels as if the ultimate target is about to appear at the last stage in a game.

129
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,540
True, the ultimate target.

130
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,850
If I die before winning against the ultimate target, I can't help myself but curse

131
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,840
since I have to start again from the beginning.

132
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,830
To us, there is only one chance.

133
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,310
Gosh, it makes me so nervous.

134
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,470
Shall we go?

135
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,060
So, he got them.

136
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,570
My Queen!

137
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,630
Ah, I'm okay, I was just shocked by the sound. It doesn't hurt at all.

138
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,610
My Queen!

139
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,000
My Queen!

140
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,730
My Queen, please, don't move!

141
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,570
We should go to stop the coronation, though...

142
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,050
You're my priority!

143
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,530
We should check the wound.

144
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,020
My King...

145
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,840
<i>Am I going to go back?</i>

146
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,900
No...

147
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,990
<i>Why now, of all other days?</i>

148
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,970
<i>Please...</i>

149
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,110
Just until after seeing if he survives...

150
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,800
Just until after checking if he's all right...

151
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,270
<i>My body? Am I back?</i>

152
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,230
<i>What about Cheoljong? </i>

153
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,440
<i>No, I must save him.</i>

154
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,040
But how can I?

155
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,310
<i>It happened 200 years ago.</i>

156

Oh? Patient Jang Bong-hwan?

You shouldn't run suddenly like that! Patient Jang Bong-hwan!

- Mr. Jang Bong-hwan!

Why didn't you just stay still?

I'll make you breathe at least.

What is it like to live in only a shell?

You will get to engrave it deep within your bones.

00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,060
Your Royal Highness the Grand Queen Dowager.

325
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,910
They have been accumulated for hundreds, thousands of years!

326
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,280
You think those things will crumble in a moment!

327
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,960
They're already crumbling.

328
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,860
The change you were so afraid of...

329
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,710
has already begun.

330
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,500
Oh, f***, that was so freaking satisfying!

331
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,100
Court Lady Choi, what did I just say?

332
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,800
"Oh, f***, that was so freaking satisfying!"

333
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,530
That's what you said.

334
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:55,580
Maybe he awakened my hidden true nature.

335
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,440
This refreshing feeling deep in my mind.

336
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,470
I can't quit... Damn it! Oh, no...

337
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,380
Bulls***.

338
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,670
Oh, this feels great!

339
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,160
F*** you!

340
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,400
F***ing bastards!

341
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,180
Oh, f***.

342
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,760
What is this about?

343
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,430
"(Queen Dowager) Jo, the criminal, spread rumors to slander the queen,

344
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,990
and defamed the royal family's honor by causing doubts about the royal bloodline.

345
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,070
For the charge of putting the country in crisis,

346
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,940
this is the royal order confining her to the Western Palace."

347
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,040
This is another slander,

348
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,210
because I've never done such a thing.

349
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,120
Is that true?

350
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,250
On the honor of the former king,

351
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,420
I can swear that I've never done such a thing.

352
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,490
Come in, please.

353
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,610
"For the criminals, as follows, all their properties and wealth are to be confiscated

354
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,970
and after 100 strokes of flogging, they will be placed as government slaves under the Jeju Island Bureau.

355
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,030
However, their wives and children won't be punished through quilt-by-association.

356
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,150
Former Prime Minister Kim Byeong-hak, Former Right State Minister Jo Man-ho,

357
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,130
Former Left State Minister Kim Seok-geun, Former Minister of Military Kim Chang-yeob,

358
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,490
Former Chief Royal Secretary Kim So-hoon, Former Minister of Personnel Jo Deok-mun,

359
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:00,300
and all the rest of the people written on the pact will not be executed, but all their properties will be confiscated

360
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,550
and they will be imprisoned for three years."

361
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:07,810
<i>- We've been wronged, Your Majesty!
- We've been wronged!</i>

362
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:13,210
This was all because of the threat made by Kim Byeong-in who single-handedly plotted this treason,

363
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,980
but we never, never...

364
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,030
we never had any intention of plotting treason.

365
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,890
Please consider that, Your Majesty, please.

366
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,630
He's right, Your Majesty.

367
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:31,130
Our sin is just our foolishness of believing that false news

368
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,500
of Your Majesty being killed by the Thieves of Donghak.

369
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:41,220
Is that so? Then, I'll tell you, your other crimes.

370
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,350
Right now, in Joseon,

371
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,820
the people with full stomachs are the biggest sinners.

372
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,990
Among your lot, is there anyone who has gone hungry?

373
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,690
You have fattened your stomachs with the people's blood and tears.

374
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,830
You have forgotten your duty to govern the country and take care of the people.

375
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:07,220
You've put the people beneath your feet and just trampled on them.

376
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,290
You charged a huge tax on a rocky mountain that won't even yield to picks and forced the people to farm it,

377
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,480
and on that payment, you've pocketed even bigger taxes.

378
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,730
While you were lying down in a warm room and patting your full stomachs,

379
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,060
the people had to stay up all night on a cold ground, worrying about the next day.

380
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,630
"How can I fill my stomach more? How can I climb higher? How can I become bigger?"

381
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,100
While you weren't even thinking of their desperation,

382
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,100
the people, whose very breaths were painful too,

383
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,060
couldn't even dare to dream about their futures,

384
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,750
but had to live the present in a living hell!

385
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,750
That was...

386
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,930
Your first crime was to treat your lives preciously while considering the people's lives lightly,

387
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,180
and the second one was to prevent them from dreaming of a future and made their present into hell.

388
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,450
The third crime was to give despair

389
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,380
to the fathers who couldn't protect their families and their country.

390
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,690
If anyone here is innocent of these charges,

391
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,000
come forward.

392
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,260
You must engrave all your crimes deep in your bones

393
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,790
and repent for them.

394
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,910
You are just...

395
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,170
shameless thieves.

396
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,970
Y-Your Majesty...

397
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,130
<i>That bastard is coming!</i>

398
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,310
That bastard deserves to be beaten to death!

399
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,320
Leave them behind.

400
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,240
But Your Highness uses them all the time.

401
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,870
Even if you wouldn't have any chance to see other people since you will be confined to the Western Palace, still—

402
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,430
The reason why I have kept you by my side, Court Lady Cheon,

403
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,600
is because you show your inner thoughts so thoughtlessly.

404
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,910
You can't have any second thought by nature.

405
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,340
True,

406
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,620
all people have their own way of living.

407
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:45,050
Your Highness, why don't you get mad at me like you always do?

408
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,090
Court Lady Cheon, you're so clueless until the last moment.

409
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:55,260
I'm holding back my tears, but how could you cry?

410
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,730
Your Highness...

411
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,630
I'll survive.

412
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,720
Surviving is...

413
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,140
winning after all.

414
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:17,920
<i>Hold my hand just until you escape safely.</i>

415
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,110
<i>- What are you scheming?
- If you remember,</i>

416
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,750
<i>then that means So-yong is still inside you.</i>

417
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,550
Orabeoni, you found me again.

418
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,890
The "me" hidden deep...

419
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,790
- What do I do?
- Really?

420
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,440
Oh, hey.

421
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,230
<i>- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.</i>

422
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,310
The sound of your laughing was nice.

423
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,660
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty...

424
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,340
You've changed a lot, Your Majesty.

425
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,930
I wasn't like "me" for a while after the wedding, was I?

426
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,940
Just...

427
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,490
Consider that it was a big deal becoming the queen.

428
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,970
You've also changed a lot from the time before your wedding, Your Majesty.

429
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,770
Back then, the only choice I could make on my own

430
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,370
was death, I thought.

431
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:32,170
<i>[I came for no reason and I am leaving. Jang Bong-hwan]</i>

432
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,440
<i>Did you get back safely, Sir?</i>

433
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,760
<i>[I came for no reason and I am leaving. Jang Bong-hwan]</i>

434
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,920
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

435
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,240
- Father!
- No!

436
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,310
Please don't come since you're carrying a baby.

437
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,130
I'll come to you.

438
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,700
- How is your health?
- How is your health?

439
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,340
Father, you should speak first.

440
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,320
No, no! Your Majesty is first.

441
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,670
- I'm perfectly fine.
- I'm perfectly fine.

442
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,440
Have you been well?

443
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,930
Of course, of course. I'm saved, thanks to you, Your Majesty.

444
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,130
During that last coronation, because of the rebels who even came into the city,

445
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:27,960
all the noblemen were shaking in fear, you know?

446
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,060
But at that time, the villagers stepped forward and protected our manor.

447
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,720
Because it's the house of virtue that opened its storage to help them.

448
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:41,340
All I did was follow your instructions,

449
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,860
so I felt a bit embarrassed and sorry.

450
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,670
You can show them your virtue from now on.

451
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,640
Of course! Of course, I should.

452
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,880
Even for the sake of our royal baby, I should become the respectable grandfather.

453
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,090
Is that a fetal movement?

454
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,330
Already fetal movements?

455
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,840
Is my grandchild a genius!

456
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,450
Is the onion smell too strong?

457
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,680
What are you making so diligently?

458
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:33,650
I'm trying to copy the queen's infamous Samhyang ramen.

459
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,450
Then, let me have some ramen before I go.

460
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,680
It'll cook quickly.

461
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:01,650
I expected I would be able to enjoy some leisurely time when the peaceful reign came, but why am I even busier now?

462
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,570
No one's here.

463
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,630
Hong Byeolgam.

464
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:08,630
Yes, I'm busy. Let's go and gamble some other time.

465
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,880
I've quit gambling.

466
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,820
You did?

467
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,680
Since the merit I accomplished this time was so huge,

468
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,870
His Majesty the King said he would give me an official position, don't you know?

469
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:29,710
I know, right? While I'm still the same Hong Byeolgam.

470
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,640
Well, did you ask him for the position of Prime Minister, or what?

471
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,180
What is that ugly object?

472
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,350
How weak you are in new cultures.

473
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:53,740
This time, I've volunteered to be an ambassador under the Translation Department.

474
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,840
For someone like me, this Joseon land is too small.

475
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,340
Congratulations on quitting gambling.

476
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,440
What about the part of my becoming an ambassador?

477
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,270
Well, traveling around until you get blisters on your feet isn't something to be congratulated.

478
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,840
By the way, I still can't believe that Lee Saeng-mang was the queen.

479

Now, what's next?

I plan on giving power to each and every one of my people.
