00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,410
- Ah!
- Ah! So why are you standing there?

5
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,630
<i>This way!</i>

6
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,920
I won't "no touch" today.

7
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,110
Your Majesty! Are you all right?

8
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,050
Ah, what rascal?

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,040
Let's go. Let... Let's go.

<i>[Episode 9]</i>

11
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,220
I had them use separate rooms so that they could rest comfortably,

12
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,000
but I did not think it through.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,700
I heard something breaking in the main house.

14
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,860
I woke up at that noise as well.

15
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,530
The window paper on the door was cut as well.

16
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
It is suspicious so I need to search.

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,090
But... that will be disruptive.

18
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,340
It isn't strange for household items to get broken.

19
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,690
It's a honeymoon vitality...

20
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,980
Shouldn't we protect their privacy?

21
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,790
Stand guard far away from the main house.

22
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,120
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,610
It might be better for me to go to the guest house.

24
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,500
- Would you stand guard, please?
- Yes.

25
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,330
I'll ask you for this favor then.

26
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,760
Enough already, woman!

27
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,040
Ugh, you're causing trouble to the end!

28
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,920
You want to have a go at it, is that it?!

29
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,080
Who... in the world are you fighting with right now?

30
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,970
You stay back. Kim So-yong and I...

31
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,150
This is between the two of us.

32
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,620
As long as I am inside, I am in control of this body.

33
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,030
The soul is the owner of the body!

34
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,520
It seems that you are still very much intoxicated.

35
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,400
So much so that you can't differentiate between a dream and reality.

36
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,030
- That is fortunate.
- What are you talking about?

37
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,140
Even when I am drunk, I always go hom—

38
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,730
No, this is not a dream.

39
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,630
You wouldn't be appearing in my dream.

40
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,500
That I appeared in your dream...

41
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,150
I am sorry.

42
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,170
Please forget this bad dream.

43
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,830
<i>[Episode 9]
[Light and Darkness]</i>

44
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,700
It's ticklish...

45
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,920
<i>It's not here. If not here, then...</i>

46
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,990
<i>Why are you like that, Your Majesty?</i>

47
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,620
<i>He wasn't that surprised because of a past event.</i>

48
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,310
- Hey! Hey!
- Why?

49
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,900
- We are not supposed to go near the main house.
- Why not?

50
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,270
I wouldn't know. Sit here for a bit.

51
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,010
All right.

52
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,650
To be honest,

53
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,760
I am worried about our queen. Did you hear anything?

54
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,210
Her Majesty the Queen, I heard that she gets up abruptly and runs around.

55
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,510
That's not possible!

56
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,000
I've never ever seen Our Lady running around!

57
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,350
Running?

58
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,420
Let's go.

59
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,110
No.

60
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,760
That's not it!

61
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,170
Oh, no!

62
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,900
Catch it!

63
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,770
<i>He had his Royal Investigation Bureau uniform on.</i>

64
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,700
<i>Then...</i>

65
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,990
You will die at this rate. Stop drinking now.

66
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,430
I get thirstier... the more I think I can't.

67
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,510
I feel like I am going to die of thirst.

68
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,600
If you are that thirsty, you should drink water, not alcohol.

69
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,710
Please bring some water here.

70
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,530
<i>Yes.</i>

71
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,470
Alcohol makes you more thirsty anyway...

72
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,580
Ahh... I slept well as if I got knocked out.

73
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,160
That's what I say. My body feels very light.

74
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,670
You. Y-Y-You...

75
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,490
Maybe it's the house, but I had an unusually deep sleep.

76
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,100
How can you get up so naturally?

77
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,460
What's there not to be natural about?

78
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,470
Since there is no need for a set date to go to bed together,

79
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,570
it is more natural to sleep together in your childhood home.

80
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,380
<i>I guess... since it is in the middle of enemy ground, you would need to fake a night together.</i>

81
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,360
Your acting is crazy good today.

82
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,170
Okay. Let's say we had a hot night.

83
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,790
It was so hot, it was totally—

84
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,190
a mess.

85
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,270
This time you remembered.

86
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,300
I would have been disappointed if you hadn't remembered like you didn't remember our first night together.

87
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,980
Is it a side effect of the memories returning?

88
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,990
I normally sleep just like a gentle baby.

89
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,210
<i>This is no time for me to idle around here.</i>

90
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,480
<i>I need to become someone indispensable to Sister Sunwon as soon as possible, (Referring to the Grand Queen Dowager)</i>

91
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,370
<i>so that she can't remove me even if I cause a bloodbath for the family.</i>

92
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,670
<i>The fellow wearing the mask definitely had the same goal as I did.</i>

93
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,770
<i>How much does Kim Byeong-in know?</i>

94
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,830
<i>That ledger can never end up in their hands.</i>

95
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,800
<i>Today, I will definitely go back to the palace.</i>

96
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,100
<i>Today... I will obtain that ledger for sure.</i>

97
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,230
You will ruin your health.

98
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,980
When is the queen coming back to the palace?

99
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,930
I will send a message so that she and the king return to the palace as soon as possible.

100
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,020
I've never felt so bored with palace life,

101
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,900
but it feels very empty because the queen's been gone a few days.

102
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,760
Are you missing the queen's food?

103
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,130
It's not because of the taste, but rather because I've become attached... Attached.

104
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,080
Attachment can be dangerous.

105
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,480
Ah, early this morning, I was so hun— No...

106
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,780
I woke up because I missed the queen.

107
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,490
Oh, you poor thing...

108
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,190
This is why getting tamed is dangerous.

109
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,170
I think that I am using the other person,

110
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,140
but at some point, I see that it is me who got tamed.

111
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,470
That's why there always has to be a different use.

112
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,910
I will have the palace kitchen staff learn the queen's cooking method.

113
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,650
Since you make palace life so perfect for me,

114
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,450
there is no reason for me to ever go outside the palace.

115
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:34,580
That's the reason I'm in this position... to protect your perfect world.

116
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,770
Ah, that's right! Have Byeong-in come and visit me once in a while.

117
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,490
Is there...

118
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,240
some business to take care of?

119
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,930
He is your adopted son, but I've been neglecting him.

120
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,360
It would be good to have him take care of small things once in a while, too.

121
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,980
You have your age (to consider), too. You should just take care of important matters.

122
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,330
Everything concerning you is important to me.

123
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,990
What are you doing?

124
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,340
From now on, the Royal Investigation Bureau will check the identity of all royal guards.

125
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,570
Since the royal guards serve His Majesty the King in close proximity,

126
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,000
there is a need to be thorough with the status checks.

127
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,060
Don't let them take even one more step!

128
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,440
They are all warriors who, through a certain method,

129
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,050
have been verified.

130
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,360
A pedigree can be bought and sold. So who would know?

131
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,900
In order to plot treason, an imposter could have infiltrated here.

132
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,340
Please cooperate so that the Royal Investigation Bureau can carry out its duty.

133
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,550
If you can't find evidence of what you just said,

134
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,480
I, too...

135
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,320
will do my duty as the Commander of the Royal Guards.

136
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,580
If you continue to retain that position, that is.

137
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,120
If you are not also complicit, please step aside.

138
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,850
- Search!
- Yes, Sir!

139
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,840
Be sure to search thoroughly!

140
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,880
Do not miss a single document and move everything found to the Royal Investigation Bureau!

141
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes, Sir!

142
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,590
Did you have a good night?

143
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,060
I got a pretty bird. What do you think?

144
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,550
It has beautiful feathers.

145
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:57,020
It is a valuable bird that I got as a celebratory keepsake.

146
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,470
Did something good happen?

147
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:08,230
The ill fate between Queen and Eui Bin goes back farther than I thought.

148
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,890
<i>I have a secret.</i>

149
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,780
<i>A secret that I have not told anyone. A secret between Her Majesty the Queen and I.</i>

150
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,210
<i>Her Majesty the Queen, thinks that I took His Majesty away from her</i>

151
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,710
<i>because of what happened eight years ago.</i>

152
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,080
Our arrow is slowly getting poisoned.

153
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Now, it's time for us to use the second item.

154
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,210
Ah, I see.

155
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,260
It's not easy to find a similar item so...

156
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,560
it is taking a while.

157
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,160
But even if I have to have it made, I will surely bring it to you.

158
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,980
Put these on.

159
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,850
They will find the truth about our royal guards in no time.

160
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,360
Let us find a way.

161
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,510
Last night, a man from the Royal Investigation Bureau saw you. Do you think that will be a problem?

162
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,120
I don't think he knew who I was.

163
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,740
If we run into each other again, he will realize I was going after the ledger.

164
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,860
But he was wearing a very unique mask.

165
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,050
It looked like a goblin.

166
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,550
Did he have a scar on his cheek or chin?

167
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,100
Yes. It seemed like an old scar.

168
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,830
He is the one who tortured Oh Wol.

169
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:02,270
This confirms that Kim Jwa-geun has made moves through Kim Byeong-in.

170
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:07,830
Fortunately, he doesn't know that the location of the ledger has changed.

171
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,730
Tonight is the last chance we have.

172
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,930
<i>Your Majesty, there is a message from the palace.</i>

173
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,320
This is a letter from Councilor Kim Jwa-geun

174
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,190
and the Head of the Royal Investigation Bureau has come to deliver it.

175
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,520
Any member of the Royal Investigation Bureau could have easily brought it to me. Why did you bring it instead?

176
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,800
Do you have that much free time?

177
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,570
I have brought it personally since it is very important.

178
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,220
Your Majesty and the queen are asked to return to the palace right away.

179
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,130
The councilor is ordering me to return to the palace?

180
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,920
He is relaying the message from Grand Queen Dowager.

181
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,330
I will stay here one more night for the queen's health. Please tell him that.

182
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,390
- But—
- I am done speaking.

183
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,430
Don't disturb the queen's rest and go back.

184
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,690
Well...

185
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:14,730
His Majesty seems very concerned about the queen's health.

186
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,690
I will convey that to him.

187
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,800
I will have breakfast in the queen's room.

188
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,270
Please make it as usual.

189
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,100
Yes. We will make what we eat usually.

190
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,990
Since Eui Bin's house is nearby, I will stop by there to see her about Oh Wol and return.

191
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,160
That's a good idea.

192
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,870
I feel bad for making her wait last night.

193
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,310
I will be away from the palace for one more night, so please look after her.

194
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,050
The queen used to stay here all day. But now that the queen is gone...

196
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,640
the royal kitchen feels so empty.

197
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,300
Now, I can finally breathe again!

198
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,730
You... Put in some more oil.

199
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,380
You... Chop it much finer.

200
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,000
Do it faster and don't crush them!

201
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,640
Things here are so pleasant

202
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,130
and so peaceful now.

203
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,600
I do love being the boss.

204
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,600
<i>Royal Chef! Royal Chef! Royal Chef!</i>

205
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,500
<i>Royal Chef! Royal Chef! Royal Chef!</i>

206
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,000
<i>Royal Chef! Royal Chef!</i>

207
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,460
<i>- Royal Chef! Royal Chef!</i>
- Stop it.

208
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,230
Excuse me, Court Lady Choi.

209
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,270
Court Lady Choi.

210
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,960
By the look on your face, is the queen still

211
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,200
not well?

212
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,590
No. She is well.

213
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,810
Then, why the long face?

214
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,400
Lately, Her Majesty has put me through a lot.

215
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,210
So when she is not around, I thought I would not have to nag.

216
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,870
And I thought I would feel at ease.

217
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,250
And?

218
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,750
It's crazier.

219
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,700
How freely will she behave without my nagging?

220
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:01,100
Oh my! They say you care more about the troublesome child rather than the good child.

221
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,790
Stop frowning. Here.

222
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,030
Open it, open it.

223
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,820
I picked it up off the ground on the way here.

224
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,560
These days you seem like mine.

225
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,160
You seem like mine, but not mine.

226
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,350
You seem like mine but not mine.

227
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,660
These days, you seem like mine but then not.

228
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,710
<i>These days...</i>

229
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,040
Why did he give me the trash he picked up on the way here?

230
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,570
Oh, my goodness.

231
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,530
The more I see him, the weirder he gets.

232
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,220
Why did he give this thing to me?

233
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,320
Have you...

234
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,430
heard anything from Oh Wol?

235
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,640
Oh no. Do you think something bad happened to her?

236
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,600
She didn't arrive at the house.

237
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,300
She probably went somewhere else since she felt sorry to you. I will ask around.

238
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,720
Don't worry about it too much.

239
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,810
I told her again and again, but still...

240
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,610
I am looking for the amber coat accessory you handed to her.

241
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,920
If she had to go to another place, she would have sold it.

242
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,120
I'll be so scared,

243
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,770
if I lose all my people.

244
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,530
When is His Majesty coming back to the palace?

245
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,410
He is staying back one more night.

246
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,020
It is not what you are thinking,

247
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,070
but I can't tell you the details.

248
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,180
It will be over by tonight.

249
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:55,380
It's probably because he does not have time to care about other things,

250
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,220
but his feelings for me might have changed.

251
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:04,350
It's probably only me who is hanging onto childhood memories.

252
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:10,360
I remember when I came back to Hanyang two years ago and met you with His Majesty.

253
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,050
Even if that day had been the very first time he saw you,

254
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,750
he would have ended up loving you.

255
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,900
Your words always encourage me.

256
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,080
A meal prepared just like you have eaten every day...

257
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,020
Why are you staying one more night when I am the one who needs to rest?

258
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,980
I am staying a little longer to take care of your wellbeing.

259
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,130
Go to a doctor for diagnosis and to a pharmacist for prescription medicine.

260
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,010
A king should take care of the county and its government. Why only me?

261
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,820
Don't you know the people are suffering like dogs now?

262
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,640
Yes, you are saying the correct things.

263
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,780
That's right. Go act like a king after you eat up the soft-shelled turtle soup.

264
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,280
Don't make the life this turtle lived, meaningless.

265
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,120
More importantly than the life of this turtle, I'm going out to observe the people, as an ordinary nobleman instead of a king.

266
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,990
Since I may return late, of course, I needed to stay one more night here.

267
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,890
You don't like being in the palace, either, do you?

268
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,920
How can the palace be more uncomfortable than the in-law's place?

269
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,740
Yes, it is very, very comfortable here.

270
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,590
<i>What kind of a person is Grand Queen Dowager?</i>

271
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,950
<i>She is the older sister of Lord Kim Jwa-geun, a high ranking official.</i>

272
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,380
<i>Ever since she entered the palace, she has never set foot outside its walls.</i>

273
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,710
<i>If I serve her food from outside the palace as a surprise...</i>

274
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,420
When I watch historic dramas, people often eat a rice-like soup. What does it taste like?

275
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,850
How would I know the taste of such a lowly food?

276
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,900
Well... it's nothing too crazy.

277
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,350
Usually, the familiar taste is what's scary.

278
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,470
<i>She used brisket to make the broth, added soybean paste, then pours a little of the broth over the rice at a time, to keep it hot.</i>

279
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,420
<i>There's a lot of meat and even though it's unrefined, it's appealing. </i>

280
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,650
<i>For the side dishes, the radishes aren't plated with chopsticks but placed on top of the soup...</i>

281
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,690
I guess there's a reason why they always had this when they left the palace.

282
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,590
My goodness!

283
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:44,470
He's telling me to pay tax since the person who was supposed to pay it ran away! What a thief.

284
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,860
Be careful what you say. You could get killed!

285
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,090
I'll either die by biting my tongue off,

286
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,900
or running away and getting beaten. It will be one of the two anyway.

287
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,280
Who cares if I'm careful or not! I don't have anything to lose.

288
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,680
We're losing everything. What is the king doing?

289
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,130
That's what I'm saying! He's gaining from it, too!

290
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,510
He's turning a blind eye and letting them do whatever they want.

291
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,780
He's just a puppet!

292
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,510
Oh, hey, wait! Hey!

293
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,720
I heard your conversation from over there.

294
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,350
How hard your lives are!

295
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,890
Because of that useless king, the citizens are dying.

296
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,350
Please take this drink and relieve some of your hardship.

297
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,530
Oh, well...

298
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,900
You look like a nobleman with a pretty high status.

299
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,290
I'm a fake nobleman.

300
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:49,050
How expensive that genealogy was! Now aside from this outfit and that genealogy book, I'm technically like a beggar.

301
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,960
Well, I've heard that among the youngsters lately,

302
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,390
there were such guys, like empty shells.

303
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:00,330
Oh ho! When this country is already like an empty shell, what's the point of people filling their lives to the fullest?

304
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,310
All that brings them is the feeling of them just getting robbed again.

305
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,370
That's jolly good!

306
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,610
Look at this rascal! This fake nobleman is really amusing.

307
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,650
Well, I mean they made someone from a traitor's family into the king.

308
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,870
So, of course, his insides are not just empty, but rotten!

309
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,930
His grandfather, father, and even his older brother.

310
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:23,190
All of his family through the generations have committed treason, so does it even make sense to make him the king?

311
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,020
And what about that scoundrel accepting becoming king when they put him on the throne?

312
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,980
That same Kim family, which annihilated his own family,

313
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,880
he's mooching off so shamelessly and gutlessly!

314
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,830
- True!
- Damn it!

315
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,680
How pathetic!

316
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,440
Now you're really being too harsh.

317
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,020
Talking trash is your own freedom,

318
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,710
but talking about family isn't right!

319
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,960
Even with hate comments, there's a line you shouldn't cross.

320
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,190
And... do you think being a king is that easy?

321
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,770
You could die from being poisoned or have your head cut off in an instant! It's a constant war!

322
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,050
Oh... Are you from the palace?

323
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,480
Are you ...the king's voice or something?

324
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,440
Who are you anyway?

325
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,340
Me? I'm...

326
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,590
in the king's fan club.

327
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,430
What?

328
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,250
Fan club?

329
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,310
I'm saying that anti-fans are fans, too. Okay?

330
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:23,360
Regardless... go for his family one more time,

331
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,540
then I'll flip this table!

332
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,740
- Oh, no, no! Not this table!
- Let go, no! Let go!

333
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,640
Gosh, don't come near us! Don't!

334
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,870
Oh, I'm sorry!

335
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,200
We'll pay now. Please come this way, please.

336
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,210
My goodness...

337
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,060
How can you have such fire in your heart?

338
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,180
Let go! Okay, let go, let go.

339
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,470
I wasn't really upset.

340
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:51,130
You said it was a secret visit. Your identity can't be revealed, so I got upset for you.

341
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,600
What? What?

342
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,910
Your acting is "dope."

343
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,760
Do you even know what that means?

344
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,330
Well, it's good, isn't it?

345
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,230
But what is a fan club?

346
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,570
Let's say it's someone who, out of a pure heart,

347
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,810
hopes for someone's happiness and success?

348
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,470
So, it's like a guardian spirit.

349
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,800
And what's an anti-fan?

350
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:31,020
Well... someone who has even more of an interest than someone in the fan club.

351
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,770
A stronger guardian spirit.

352
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,740
I'm unworthy of these affections of yours.

353
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,610
Ah, well... If I get deposed from being queen, I'll make soup for a living.

354
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:50,570
Don't say that! I'll never let that happen.

355
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,800
I'm also your anti-fan.

356
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,770
Oh... okay. That's great.

357
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:01,510
Well, let's split up since our goals are different.

358
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,990
Let's see. Are there any popular restaurants where people are waiting in line?

359
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:13,070
So, "an" must mean "peaceful," but "ti"? "Fan"?

360
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:19,610
I thought proudly since I've been studying a lot, but I guess I still have a long way to go.

361
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,510
Oh, that looks so yummy!

362
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,900
Oh, you scared me! What are you doing?

363
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,640
If you wear such nice clothes as these and walk in these streets, it's too easy to become a target.

364
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,450
- Target of what?
- Oh dear! What brought such noble people like you two here?

365
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,680
I meant this kind of target. Move aside.

366
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,800
I don't want to hurt you.

367
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Do you like her? Dang, that's meaningless.

368
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,460
And drop that complacent idea that I will be the only poor soul here.

369
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,040
This is something I always feel from you.

370
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,100
But since you're an educated thief, your expressions like that sound so classy.

371
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,210
- With dignity.
- Oh, yes, Sir.

372
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:29,030
Please don't worry, I'll protect you.

373
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,310
Aren't I, your anti-fan, after all, My Queen?

374
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,400
What is he saying?

375
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,430
Dang, that was scary.

376
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,440
Regardless of the era or country, you still shouldn't set foot in a place of dark alleys.

377
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,700
Take care of the aftermath, Cheoljong.

378
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,670
But, by chance, if something bad happens to Cheoljong, will history change?

379
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,670
I trained in Special Force Oper—

380
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,590
Did I come too late?

381
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,840
Cheoljong? Are you dead?

382
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,850
But I don't know the way back to my house!

383
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:26,280
Oh dear! What brought such a noble person here—

384
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,510
I thought you came back because you were worried about me,

385
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,110
but did you come back because you didn't know how to go back to your home?

386
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,410
Where did all those other punks go?

387
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,510
After seeing a person with a more expensive robe, they followed him.

388
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,730
<i>Please don't worry, I'll protect you. </i>

389
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,040
<i>Aren't I, your anti-fan, after all, My Queen?</i>

390
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,600
<i>What is he saying? </i>

391
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,340
<i>This isn't the time for you to show the back of your head recklessly.</i>

392
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,950
<i>It's not such a peaceful time in this era now.</i>

393
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,470
<i>How could you lack so much a feeling of danger?</i>

394
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,240
<i>Wow, that was like a poem.</i>

395
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,340
<i>Hey, is this from Qing? Huh?</i>

396
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,340
<i>Wow, this looks great. If we sell it, it will feed us for five days at least. Hey, take it off.</i>

397
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,710
<i>You shouldn't show the back of your head so recklessly.</i>

398
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,940
<i>I didn't kill him.</i>

399
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,540
<i>But I'm thinking of killing the next person, though.</i>

400
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,010
What happened to this man... here?

401
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,770
He must be drunk.

402
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,960
As expected, how lucky you are.

403
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,100
By the way, what's with your outfit?

404
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:59,380
As I think again, a nobleman's outfit might limit me in this observation done in disguise.

405
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,070
What are you doing?

406
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:09,840
Well, there are some things I wanted to buy. I didn't bring money as I was rushed in coming here.

407
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,530
- Okay.
- Robbing a thief...

408
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,270
Whoa... Wait, look here.

409
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,640
It's not good manners to take all of his money.

410
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,260
Get some soup with rice.

411
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,030
Okay...

412
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,990
Here. Let's go.

413
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,800
What did you want to buy?

414
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,660
So...

415
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,950
He knew how to fight.

416
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,130
Seeing how he was guarding the room, I am sure the item exists.

417
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,010
Will you be able to recognize that face if you see it again?

418
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,010
Yes, My Lord.

419
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,930
I need the medicine.

420
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,180
I made myself clear.

421
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,990
I said if you failed, I will not give you the medicine.

422
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,960
How will you pay me back?

423
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,500
Will you give me your hand?

424
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,980
I will definitely repay you.

425
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,990
I swear it on my life.

426
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,670
Here! Guess what this thing is?

427
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,850
This is a moon jar from the Goryeo Dynasty.

428
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,820
Really!? This precious thing.

429
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,880
- How much?
- It is fake.

430
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,110
But buy it if you want to use it for protection again.

431
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,470
How dare you con me?

432
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,880
Pick one.

433
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,070
All in.

434
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,720
My goodness, My Lady. You cannot gamble that much money.

435
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,110
This is a capitalist society where money always wins.

436
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,960
- All in!
- I am sorry.

437
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,220
- What are you doing?
- My Lady.

438
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,850
Open it.

439
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,440
A trickster like him has to have his gang around the table, too.

440
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,310
I am sure all the people there are to encourage gambling.

441
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,710
You were born a king;

442
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,490
and yet, you seem to know the streets inside out.

443
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,830
Goodness, and you denied it so strongly.

444
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,860
That is my weakness.

445
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,920
My family was swept away in a scheme to commit treason.

446
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,790
Prince Ghanwa.

447
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,230
My family history is the weakness that drags me down.

448
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:59,400
Do you have nightmares where you get chewed out in the court or what?

449
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,950
A real nightmare is not the dream I have when I go to sleep.

450
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,300
A real scary nightmare...

451
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,050
Why did you stop midway?

452
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:21,560
I forgot what I was about to say. Actually,

453
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,600
I have been meaning to ask you a question.

454
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,690
How come you have not told anyone about that night?

455
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:34,220
- What night?
- That night I tried to harm you.

456
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,830
Oh, that? I do not want to get involved.

457
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:42,370
I just want to skate over all the hardships.

458
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,850
The reign of peace needs to come quickly so I can freely be lazy.

459
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,650
Saving the empire is totally not my style.

460
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,820
I should get up to greet you,

461
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,060
but I slept on a cold mountain,

462
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,460
so my whole body aches.

463
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,970
Had I stayed there for one more night, my handsome lips would have gone numb.

464
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,340
- Are you done?
- With?

465
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,920
Your whining and some bragging.

466
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,510
I do have more to go, but it looks like you have some important matter to talk about,

467
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,920
so I will stop here.

468
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,570
All right. What do you want?

469
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:00,860
I heard that you make the best masks.

470
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,730
Pick one from those.

471
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,680
Oh gosh... These teeth.

472
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,110
I don't want these typical masks.

473
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,710
I am thinking about selling special masks to civil servants.

474
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,720
Special?

475
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,200
These days, you seem like mine but not mine.

476
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,800
You seem like mine but not...

477
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,000
Boil the water.

478
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,620
Boil the water.

479
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,720
Yes, Sir.

480
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,320
- Royal Chef.
- Yes?

481
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,720
The Grand Queen Dowager would like a late-night snack,

482
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,120
but I am not sure if you will be able to make it or not.

483
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,520
This person...

484
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,660
I have worked in the royal kitchen for 30 years,

485
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,810
and for 12 years as the Royal Head Chef.

486
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,730
How can I be worse than the queen? In fact, I am better than her.

487
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,460
I trust you fully.

488
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,810
Again.! Sheesh!

489
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,880
Again.

490
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,110
What?

491
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,960
I milked all the cows we had in the barn.

492
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,350
There is not... a single drop... left.

493
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:30,460
What?

494
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,830
You incompetent jerk!

495
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,510
Your Royal Majesty!

496
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,830
I suddenly feel so annoyed and everything upsets me.

497
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,560
This confused body and the one on the other side that's laying like a corpse,

498
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,080
both of them don't seem like me!

499
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,700
I don't even know now if my name is Jang So-yong or Kim Bong-hwan.

500
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,820
Your memory came back and that itself can be confusing.

501
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,510
Do you know what I hate the most?

502
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,430
I am getting more and more used to this body.

503
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,910
I even feel comfortable wearing a skirt now!

504
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,070
You must be on your period!

505
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,710
I will bring you a pad.

506
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,910
I am... on my period?

507
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,600
Court Lady Chun!

508
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,240
Yes, Your Highness.

509
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,940
Why is the queen not coming back to the palace?

510
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,380
I will send another letter right away.

511
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,350
It is not like we are at war! Send it as soon as the sun rises tomorrow!

512
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,810
Yes, Your Highness.

513
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,590
Is my brother's word not as powerful anymore?

514
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,740
It is a sin to get older. A sin.

515
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,990
I am so hungry!

516
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,160
I still have one left.

517
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,350
There is nobody here.

518
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,020
<i>Byeolgam Hong...</i>

519
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,390
It is you. Come inside.

520
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,830
Were you waiting for my return?

521
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,370
How did you know I just came back?

522
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,050
Hold on.

523
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,700
How can you look so terrible in just two days?

524
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,830
Byeolgam Hong...

525
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,850
Did you lose all your money to a swindler? Or did you lose the deed to your home?

526
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,610
That was the mistake I made when I was 14.

527
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,050
This is a bigger problem.

528
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,510
Did you lose your land?

529
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,610
That already happened when I went to get back the...

530
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,120
Your family has had a lot of misfortune, too.

531
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:56,650
Should I choose family or love?

532
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,460
That is the question.

533
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,070
Oh, no.

534
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,730
It's fine!

535
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,450
It really is a big problem.

536
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:28,500
Your Highness, Grand Queen Dowager is requesting you to come to Tongmyeongjeon Hall quickly.

537
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,740
Did you call me, Your Highness?

538
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:50,380
You don't believe that you are at fault for the death of the late king, right?

539
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:55,010
That is why you are doing all that you can to blame my family.

540
00:49:55,010 --> 00:50:00,450
Your Highness, you may insult me all you want but

541
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,120
please protect our late king.

542
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,410
You are using your son as a shield again.

543
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:11,580
It's detestable that you are trying to cover your guilty feelings by blaming others.

544
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,250
People need to know themselves well,

545
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,590
in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

546
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:27,120
I greatly appreciate your lessons and teaching.

547
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:39,120
Since I am too tired to take off my socks...

548
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,600
I will gladly take them off for you.

549
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,520
Soon, it will be Surit-nal.
<i> (Dano Festival, 5th day of 5th lunar month - symbol is the wheel)</i>

550
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,710
That is the last day of my generosity.

551
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,420
I have returned.

552
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,310
I see.

553
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,690
I heard that the Royal Investigation Bureau was quite busy today. I heard you were up against the Royal Guard Division.

554
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,930
There were many suspicious issues, so I was going to report to you after finding evidence.

555
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,540
There are several suspicious men among the king's guards.

556
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,750
Probably seven, to be precise.

557
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,370
So you already knew?

558
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,260
Do you think I left them alone because I did not know about them?

559
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,330
If you poke around like that, what do you think they will do?

560
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,820
They will hide, dig a deeper cave,

561
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,070
become cleverer, and more invisible.

562
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:19,830
There is no threat if I can see them clearly.

563
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:24,080
Making them falsely believe that they have the king covered and they're hiding well.

564
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,810
We can stop them from breathing by twisting their necks when they cause any trouble.

565
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,810
I hadn't thought it through.

566
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:40,680
Do you think I put the king in his position only because he lacked intelligence and talent?

567
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,470
I placed him on the throne because I am the very one who puts fear into him.

568
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:48,640
It's easy to control those who know fear.

569
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,470
If a person in a high post fears me, I am above him

570
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:55,340
and my power is above that position.

571
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,370
From now on, in anything related to the king,

572
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,370
I will consult you first, Father.

573
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,910
Go and get some rest.

574
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:06,470
<i>Nobody will think of this place. I'll make sure to come and fetch you.</i>

575
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,570
<i>You must never come out until then.</i>

576
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,160
<i>What about my older brothers and you, Mother?</i>

577
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,480
<i>I'm fine as long as you survive.</i>

578
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,680
<i>You are my... only son.</i>

579
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,230
<i>If you die, I'll also die anyway.</i>

580
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,820
<i>Go on!</i>

581
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,240
<i>Hurry!</i>

582
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,370
It's all an illusion.

583
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,670
It's not real.

584
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,350
I should find the ledger quickly.

585
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,780
<i>Did I see wrong? </i>

586
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,280
<i>Impossible!</i>

587
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,150
<i>I'm wronged, Won-beom.
(Won-beom - Cheoljong's given name before he became king.)</i>

588
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:47,230
<i>I, your father, was wronged so much </i>

589
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,810
<i>I can't close my eyes!</i>

590
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,180
<i>- Won-beom!
- Won-beom!</i>

591
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,410
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

592
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,880
<i>Won-beom.</i>

593
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,200
<i>Won-beom.</i>

594
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,350
<i>How can you not say anything?</i>

595
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,490
No, this is all false...

596
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,620
It's just the fear in my mind.

597
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,280
No! No...

598
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,380
<i>Father.</i>

599
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,020
<i>Kim So-yong!</i>

600
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,420
<i>What is this? She looks exactly like her.</i>

601
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,770
<i>As if she could possibly become Kim So-yong, the best of all time.</i>

602
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:51,650
<i>There is something that's exactly the same. She's motherless, too.</i>

603
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,600
<i>"This book is written by our country's scholars.
[Dong-mong-seon-seub, Kim So-yong]</i>

604
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,600
<i>In its first chapter, it discusses the "Five Relations in Confucianism" in general,</i>

605
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:10,200
<i>and later specifies the details of king-subject, father-son, husband-wife, elder-younger siblings, and friends separately."</i>

606
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:16,920
<i>You've already memorized all the pages of this book until the pages are worn out, but why are you reciting it again?</i>

607
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,960
<i>Because today is the anniversary of my mother's death.</i>

608
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,830
<i>This is the book my mother used.</i>

609
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:28,050
<i>So you do that when you miss your mother.</i>

610
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,740
<i>In my case, I cry every day.</i>

611
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:35,050
<i>While doing so, I've found a way to see my mother.</i>

612
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,940
<i>How? </i>

613
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:41,310
<i>If I die, I'll get to see my mother.</i>

614
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,090
<i>You're alive.</i>

615
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,830
<i>Did you also come down here to die?</i>

616
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,740
<i>What do you mean?</i>

617
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,610
<i>Because I came down here to die.</i>

618
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:34,640
<i>Do you want to live? Because it's scary to die.</i>

619
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:45,610
<i>No. If everybody else dies but me, that scares me even more.</i>

620
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:50,540
<i>Then... let's go together.</i>

621
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:07,830
<i>- Let's do it after counting to three.
- All right.</i>

622
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,830
<i>I hear something down there!</i>

623
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,630
<i>Brother Byeong-in?</i>

624
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,580
<i>Do you know how worried we were?</i>

625
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,580
<i>We searched the entire house inside and out!</i>

626
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,180
<i>Byeong-in...</i>

627
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,970
<i>I'll come down.</i>
