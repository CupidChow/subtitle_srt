4
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,970
Did Officer Hong find out anything?

5
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,010
It seems Kim Byeong-in found out

6
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,030
that the fabric cut from the jacket originated from the palace.

7
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,090
So he's right on our heels, then. Let's hurry up.

8
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,320
- This isn't the training for attack.
- Is that so?

9
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,190
Why are you acting this way?

10
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,530
Unlike your usual self, you lost your reason, Your Majesty.

11
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,610
As I've been cowering down all the time,

12
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,720
my whole body is itching.

15

Here it is.

16
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,070
Let's go!

17
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,460
Are you coming back from hunting, Your Majesty?

18
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,370
In an old saying, be at ease...

19
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,780
Ah! "Be at ease while waiting for your enemy to get tired," they say.

20
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,630
During the time when I'm at ease, my enemy gets tired.

21
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,040
That's true.

22
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,140
By the way, how could you hunt without a bow...?

23
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,040
Well, a bow always gives my arms and fingers pains,

24
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,770
so it feels like it was not made for hunting,

25
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,460
but for torturing.

26
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,090
Oh, a bow is hunting its archer,

27
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,490
so I guess it's also a sort of hunting?

28
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,080
Anyway,

29
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,690
it's easier to hunt with a snare.

30
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,710
But it's dangerous if only two of you go hunting.

31
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,830
At any time, anywhere,

32
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,720
you should accompany your guards.

33
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,110
Starting from the next time, I will do so.

34
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,750
Prince Yeongpyeong, it must be hard for you to keep working as the acting Commander of the Royal Guard.

35
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,400
As soon as the king's father-in-law gets better,

36
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,100
I'll hand over the position to him.

37
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,590
That's right!

38
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,470
For the food to enhance your health, our dear General of Training, here.

39
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,370
Oh, no! It's okay. I'm fine.

40
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,300
Please don't decline it.

41
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,920
This is my royal gift to you.

42
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,140
Ah, yes...

43
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,430
I assume you haven't heard the news yet that the queen has woken up.

44
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,840
Is that so?

45
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,590
How is she doing?

46
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,710
Fortunately, Her Majesty restored her health.

47
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,740
So she overcame it. What a relief she overcame it.

48
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,890
I should go to the queen immediately.

49
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,290
Aish!

50
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,480
This isn't the time for you to go and pay her a visit.

51
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,990
Since the queen recovered,

52
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,900
the worst case is now avoided.

53
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,850
I'll go there and find the ledger myself.

54
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,860
Then, please allow me to accompany you.

55
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,340
If we move together, they will put their guard up higher.

56
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,200
Please keep monitoring the situation within the palace, Hyungnim.

57
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,320
The weather is so nice.

58
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,290
<i>Catch me if you can!</i>

59
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a spring day.

60
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,800
Will you... Will you marry me?

61
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
I may not look like it, but I'm a man owning one goat.

62
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,490
Oh dear, I don't know.

63
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,880
Your Majesty!

64
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,180
<i>As I keep begging her to come back, </i>

65
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,430
<i>her soul didn't come back, but her memories did?</i>

66
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,570
<i>Even before, sometimes this woman's memories came into my mind, too. </i>

67
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,880
<i>Whenever that happened, I had a headache and ringing in my ears...</i>

68
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,610
But this time, as if breathing, it came smoothly.

69
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,430
Hong Yeon, you're 19 years old this year.

70
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,260
Your first name isn't Hong-yeon, but your family name is Hong and your given name is Yeon.

71
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,070
It's the scent. The memories engraved in my sense of smell are coming back.

72
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,840
But you know what?

73
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,770
Why am I so good at this?

74
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,940
That's because you've played it since you were very young.

75
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,080
As your memories are coming back,

76
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,440
now even your talents are coming back, too!

77
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,310
<i>Things got tangled...</i>

78
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,240
<i>When that heart attack or Sigwol thing hit me, everything got mixed up. </i>

79
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,800
<i>Wait!</i>

80
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,920
<i>Why have I been using this woman's voice for my thinking since earlier?</i>

81
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,810
My voice...

82
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,780
Did I lose it now?

83
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,560
What are you talking about, Your Majesty?

84
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,970
I can hear you so well now.

85
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,570
This situation that I gained fingers but lost my voice is like...

86
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,470
The Little Mermaid?

87
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,860
The witness who sold Court Lady Han arsenic for killing rats,

88
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,150
and the circumstance of how it was moved to the royal kitchen,

89
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,800
to allow nobody to be able to doubt and question these two points,

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,610
everything must be clearly confirmed.

91
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,330
I need to talk to the Director of Uigeumbu for a moment.

92
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,230
It's strange.

93
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,110
This palace was so big and grand to begin with,

94
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,540
but why does it feels so vastly empty, especially today?

95
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,520
<i>Her Majesty the Queen is coming!</i>

96
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,330
No way...

97
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,000
Do I...?

98
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,670
For your information, we've decided to give some time to Queen Dowager.

99
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,560
I beg your pardon?

100
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,790
This is to follow the order of the Inner Court, so we'll wait for now.

101
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,730
However, you should still make the picture so that we can use it anytime when needed.

102
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,600
Instead, in complete secrecy.

103
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,560
Although, this time, we've made the picture on our end,

104
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,650
Queen Dowager might have some relationship with the people who are trying to harm the queen.

105
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,120
If we leave it alone, Her Majesty the Queen might get in more danger.

106
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,290
The people who are trying to harm the queen?

107
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,120
The lake incident was her suicide attempt and she revealed it herself.

108
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,480
And this time, it was her health issue.

109
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,780
Is there something else?

110
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,180
After her entrance to the palace, Her Majesty's life keeps being threatened.

111
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,550
That's why I'm suspicious about it.

112
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,050
I see.

113
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,750
As I will run the council meeting without His Majesty, there are a lot of things I have to prepare.

114
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,990
I'll leave now.

115
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,110
Did something happen to His Majesty?

116
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,300
He went to visit the queen.

117
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Did he?

118
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,860
<i>Hyungnim! Hyungnim!</i>

119
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,260
Oh, you were here, too, My Lord?

120
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,860
Enjoy your conversation.

121
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,590
Wish you a safe trip back home, My Lord.

122
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,410
Expecting His Lordship to go home when the sun is high in the sky?

123
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,240
As I stayed up all night long, I was confused.

124
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,220
What are you working so hard for that you had to stay up all night?

125
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,120
I did it to accomplish my secret mission, you know.

126
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,260
Oh, thanks to it, I experienced something peculiar, too.

127
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,950
So? Did you find out anything?

128
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,690
Hyungnim, it's a big problem.

129
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,670
You know what? I'm in love with someone whom I shouldn't love.

130
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,020
Who on earth is that woman?

131
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,240
No wonder it felt as if the entire palace was empty today. I felt so empty,

132
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,830
so I deeply thought about why.

133
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,010
Then, I realized that there is only one woman who isn't in the palace right now.

134
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,630
Her Majesty the Queen.

135
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,520
I think I'm in love with Her Majesty the Queen.

136
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,710
- What?
- In love with my cousin!

137
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,240
What an immoral thing it is!

138
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,570
We share the same family name, too...

139
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,410
and this is just the same as incest.

140
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,900
Moreover, she's married to His Majesty the King, so she's someone else's woman, too!

141
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,230
I must be out of my mind. Not just crazy,

142
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,030
but disgustingly crazy!

143
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,590
Well, let's forget all of them. But out of them all,

144
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,370
she's much older than me.

145
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,290
This is really not right, is it?

146
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,260
Is her being older than you important right now?

147
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,310
Why-Why are you suddenly getting angry...?

148
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,760
You're talking nonsense right now!

149
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,200
I won't say anything anymore.

151
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,610
Forget it. I'm sorry for getting angry at you.

152
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,490
You've never gotten angry or yelled before,

153
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,790
but now you're changed after becoming a government official.

154
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,700
It's just because I was flustered.

155
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,480
I wasn't really angry at you.

156
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,050
What on earth made you think so?

157
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,850
It's because I keep thinking of the scenes.

158
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,600
Holding the parasol for Her Majesty,

159
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,670
and staying right next to Her Majesty.

160
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,370
Carrying the herbal tonic for Her Majesty and running.

161
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,380
I mean, that girl, Hong Yeon, serving Her Majesty the Queen.

162
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,320
If you're thinking of the girl, Hong Yeon, then why do you think you're in love with Her Majesty?

163
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,840
Come on, who am I?

164
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,120
I'm Kim Hwan, the 16th descendant of Lord Pangwan's branch and the only heir.

165
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,340
Such a man like me would never fall in love with a mere palace maid, who used to be a slave.

166
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,110
So, obviously, it must be Her Majesty the...

167
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,210
No way, then it's that palace maid...?

168
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,090
I'm rooting for that difficult love of yours.

Where is His Majesty?

174
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,040
He went to the queen's family's house.

175
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,300
Why did His Majesty go there suddenly?

176
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,150
The queen regained consciousness.

177
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,800
With the excuse of visiting her, he wanted to search her father's house.

178
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,190
Are you hurt?

179
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,340
It's nothing serious.

180
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,550
I will go to see Her Majesty, too.

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,550
What brought you here in person...?

183
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,670
The skinny one, the fat and bloated one,

184
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,610
the pole-like one, the shorty.

185
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,660
All of you look different, one by one,

186
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,230
but there is just one thing that you all have in common.

187
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,560
It's this one.

188
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,190
All of you, who have the best eyesight and best skill at rifles,

189
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,610
are the firing squad, which I selected specially.

190
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,330
I'm average in both height and build,

191
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,990
so where do I belong...?

192
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,710
You can take the role of tactless.

193
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,960
Therefore, I'm calling you guys,

194
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,850
the Foreign Legion.

195
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,490
Until now, you've gotten nothing so that you had to stand on the edge of the world.

196
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,440
But as long as you have this rifle,

197
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,020
you are the best in Joseon.

198
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,620
Just like I am.

199
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,020
The gun can kill a person,

200
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,000
but it can...

201
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,460
also save a person.

202
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,200
Five in a row, repeating the shooting practice!

203
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,960
Although it's bothersome, we have to save the country.

204
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Fire!

205
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,950
I came here as I need something.

206
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,870
One of them is an ornamental hairpin in a Phoenix shape.

207
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,790
If you mean by Phoenix hairpin...?

208
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,930
Are you going to give the queen a present?

209
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,330
If it were for the queen, I would've inquired the Sangeuiwon office.

210
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,410
What I need is not the queen's ornamental hairpin, plated in gold,

211
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,800
but the one in jade.

212
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,700
But according to the law of rites for the palace,

213
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,000
the Phoenix hairpin is allowed to the queen only.

214
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,490
That's exactly why.

215
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,080
I see...

216
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,530
And another item that I need is...

217
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,500
Indeed, it was to lure His Majesty to her family home.

218
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,920
Speed up, we must get there as soon as possible.

219
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,350
Yes, My Lady.

220
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,320
Speed up, you all.

221
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Before the queen reveals the secret.

222

<i>The difference from the Little Mermaid</i>

223

<i>is that I only gained fingers and toes for losing my voice?</i>

224
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,220
<i>What the heck with all these shocking things in a row...</i>

225
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,820
<i>Will I lose myself gradually like this?</i>

226
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,460
<i>If I keep living here, then what about that bastard, Director Han?</i>

227
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,480
<i>The things will go as that bastard wanted.</i>

228
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,770
<i>I can annihilate the Han family, framing them as traitors!</i>

229
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,920
<i>I'd annihilate all three generations so that he can't be born or even can't exist as a seed. </i>

230
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,010
<i>By the way, which Han family did he come from...?</i>

231
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,400
<i>Why is her mood so swinging like a crazy bitch's?</i>

232
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,770
Geez, are all the people here from a circus?

233
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,510
Why are you so good at Neolttwigi?
<i>(Korean traditional jumping game)</i>

234
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,870
This level of Neolttwigi is nothing to any of the Joseon women,

235
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,180
as this is the only way we can see outside of the fence comfortably.

236
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,410
Ah, it has such a deep meaning...

237
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,870
True, as I lived for a week here, it's not easy to live as a Joseon woman.

238
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,590
On top of that, I'm the queen...

239
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,480
<i>However, if it's for my revenge of blood?</i>

240
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,260
Let's go.

241
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,540
All I have to do is not smell.

242
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,630
Then, this woman's memories will be blocked and my voice will come back.

243
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,850
<i>From today on, I will live for my revenge. </i>

244
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,870
<i>To do so, I have to get the mighty power.</i>

245
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,400
Hong Yeon, if I want to get the mighty power as the queen, what should I have to do?

246
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,310
There is indeed one sure way for that.

247
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,300
What is it?

248
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,900
No matter what, producing a prince is the best.

249
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,620
How could you use the word, "producing"? What a violation of human rights term, it is!

250
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,850
That's right!

251
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,460
I have the one with superpower, Sister "Sunwon"!
<i>(Meaning 'Grand Queen Dowager') </i>

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,360
Who is Sister Sunwon?

253
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,320
Her name is so tacky.

254
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,400
Queen Sunwon, our dear Grand Queen Dowager.

255
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,120
Hong Yeon, to get our Grand Queen Dowager's favor, what should I—

256
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,270
No matter what, you should produce a prince!

257
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,650
A gift would be great. What should I give her?

258
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,680
A little but sparkly and beautiful...

259
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,280
Wait.

260
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,140
This smell is...?

261
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,430
I remember. I remember...

262
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,010
Oh, dear!

263
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,690
This storage's name is "Cheon" (meaning "sky"), and the one in the backyard is "Ji" (meaning "earth").

264
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,280
And the one near the annex building is "Hyeon" (meaning "black")?

265
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,420
Yes. I guess maybe His Lordship's wealth has increased but all the storage rooms are full.

266
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,540
Sky "Hyeon," earth "Ji," black "Hyeon"...
<i>(T/N: the first line of "The Thousand-Character Classic")</i>

267
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,180
If I count all the storages all over Joseon, including the ones in this residence...?

268
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,270
You may need to write the entire thousand letters.

269
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,600
<i>Ah, it's so dazzling!</i>

<i>My dazzling life as a gold spoon!</i>

271

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,790
This one, too.

273
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:45,570
Except for those two, everything in this room; all of them.

274
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,740
All of these?

275
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,000
Taking all of them, I'll go back to the palace immediately.

276
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,620
I can already hear the sound of His Lordship fainting, though...

277
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,600
From now on, I'll become the Queen of Lobbying.

Why did he come?

280
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,970
I'll go back shortly too, so tell him to go back to the palace first and wait for me.

281
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,490
What are you talking about, Your Majesty?

282
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,830
At this timing when I have to stand in line for Grand Queen Dowager, I have to cut ties with the king.

283
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,750
Oh, why? Hey, what the...?

284
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Gosh, I'm telling you... When I'm playing in a team, I have to make myself clear.

285
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,070
Let go! Come on!

286
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,430
Why did he take some parade car?

287
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,380
Geez, the royal family are all attention seekers.

288
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,750
Please show some respect, Your Majesty.

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,600
What's with "I picked it up on my way here?"
<i>(T/N: It's a popular line in modern Korea, used by a boyfriend to express his love but without any bragging.) </i>

316
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,170
Why has the history of such a freaking pick-up line lasted more than 200 years?

317
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,560
I mean it. I really picked it up on my way here.

318
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,080
Ah, I see. I got it.

319
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,410
Oh, dear. It's really true!

320
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,370
Yeah, yeah! Right!

321
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,470
A king doesn't lie!

322
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,950
Yeah, yeah! Right!

323
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,010
- What's wrong with her?
- Gosh! Oh, dear...

324
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,700
My goodness, Your Majesty the King!

325
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,120
Oh, Your Majesty!

326
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,060
You're personally paying a visit to such a humble place like this,

327
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,610
your grace is immeasurable!

328
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,310
No, it's nothing. Please, stand up.

329
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,540
Of course, I should come and visit to check on the queen's state.

330
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,290
Are you well, Father-in-Law?

331
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,110
Of course... Of course, I am.

332
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,110
First, please come inside.

333
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,860
Yes.

334
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,060
Then, Your Majesty, please enjoy the welcome from your wife's family.

335
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,860
I'm busy with preparations to go back to the palace, so see you. Let's go!

336
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,720
W-What? Already?

337
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,530
Are you planning to go back to the palace today?

338
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,690
Because my recovery was pretty quick.

339
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,020
But still...

340
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,930
You just got up from the bed, though.

341
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,070
He's right.

342
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,860
There is no need to rush, so please take your time for recovery.

343
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,990
I'm worried how the Inner Court without me can be run.

344
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,450
The Inner Court is at peace, much better than when you're there—

345
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,380
I mean, maybe better.

346
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,670
I'm sorry. I've tried all my best,

347
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,120
but I guess my hospitality wasn't enough for you.

348
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,650
You got used to the palace life in such a short period of time,

349
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,000
so the time spent with this mere father

350
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,480
is not satisfying Your Majesty, I guess.

351
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,250
Well, I was only focusing on my duty as the queen too much,

352
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,120
so I wasn't able to consider how you might feel, Father.

353
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,970
Then, I'll return to the palace tomorrow.

354
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,090
In that case, I'll escort you two to my study building.

355
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,240
<i>I'm had by him...</i>

356
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,440
Let's go.

357
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,590
Why on earth is she acting like that?

358
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,370
There is something you have to do.

359
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,830
It seems there is an item that shouldn't have existed, so go and bring it to me.

360
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:35,300
Its location is in the secret safe at the residence of the king's father-in-law.

361
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,070
Yes, My Lord.

362
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,770
Seeing you two loving each other right in front of my eyes,

363
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,370
now I'll have no regrets even if I die now.

364
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,680
I should've paid a visit to you earlier. I'm sorry.

365
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,280
Oh, please, don't say so.

366
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,200
Just listening to the story about the famous conjugal harmony between you two

367
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,610
makes me feel so grateful.

368
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,720
As the queen is so outstanding, different from other women,

369
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,390
I was wondering what kind of environment she grew up in.

370
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,570
It was a place like this.

371
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,150
As I raised her alone without her mother,

372
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,600
I was worried about her lacking, so I've raised her with everything in double folds.

373
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,130
How hard it must have been for you.

374
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,160
No, not at all.

375
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,290
Her Majesty has done everything well by herself

376
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,190
since she was little.

377
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,620
I'm well aware of it from the rumors.

378
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,160
But as she has such a strong personality,

379
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,900
she doesn't share her mind with me easily.

380
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,840
I'm not sure if maybe I'm lacking or a woman's mind is complicated,

381
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,010
but it's really not easy to understand such a woman like the queen.

382
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,710
Oh, dear! There is no way that Your Majesty is lacking.

383
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,020
Naturally, a woman's mind to a man

384
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,520
is as difficult as Buddha's words.

385
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:12,010
Please don't try to understand. A married couple is supposed to feed on misunderstandings, rather than understanding.

386
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,140
Ah, what does that mean...?

387
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,140
It's because, without any misunderstandings, there would be no mistake marrying to begin with, either.

388
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,020
I want to understand all of you.

389
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,010
Don't.

390
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,970
That's why I'd love to look around this place, where the queen was born and raised. Would that be all right?

391
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,780
And conversing and taking a walk with the queen, too.

392
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,830
Well, it's just a regular family's residence, so there is nothing s. special,

393
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,670
But if you want, I'll give you a tour, Your Majesty.

394
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,160
Then, you two, enjoy the walk.

395
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,980
<i>It's advantageous to have the queen by my side. </i>

396
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,360
Although it has been only one night that I couldn't see you,

397
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,290
I'm missing you even when I'm seeing you like this.

398
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,870
Something is on your face.

399
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,820
Oh my god! It's my beauty spot!

400
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,540
I see. It's no wonder you look different today.

401
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,500
- Then, Your Majesty should accompany us, too.
- Shall we go now?

402
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,340
Oh, please wait a second. Please take your time.

403
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:29,610
I'm not sure if the house is well organized...

404
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,500
Excuse me.

405
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,840
What's wrong with you? Didn't we agree to do "No touch"?

406
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,460
I find that word, "No touch," a very good one when I think of it more and more.

407
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,830
Even if we don't share the same goal,

408
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,450
we can co-exist and be happy.

409
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,450
How admirable it is, don't you agree?

410
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,160
Admitting the difference between us, overcoming that difference, and heading toward understanding each other.

411
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,950
Wow! Are you some philosopher or what?

412
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,220
With that one word, "No touch," you went that far?

413
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:09,640
Ah, right! You're a politician, right?

414
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,130
Your father is so happy like that, can't you see?

415
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,430
I'm just trying to be a filial son-in-law to him.

416
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,430
Please cooperate.

417
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,830
Darn it!

418
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,360
<i>The bulky builds and movements of servants</i>

419
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,090
<i>don't look ordinary. </i>

420
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,020
<i>Moreover, they know this place's structure completely well.</i>

421
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,780
- Let's go.
- Ah, yes.

422
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,560
If I didn't see this place, I would've regretted it.

423
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,870
Ah, indeed you recognize them.

424
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,450
Here. This white porcelain and that folding screen,

425
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,080
I put a lot of effort to get them.

426
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,900
Can I take a close look at them?

427
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,400
Ah, sure! Of course, of course. If you come this way—

428
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,180
Well, it's unnecessary to check the backside of a folding screen, though.

429
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,510
If it's nice artwork, even its backside is made great.

430
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,640
Oh, be careful, My Queen!

431
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,120
- What is it?
- A bee came in this room, it must be bewitched by your beauty today!

432
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,590
A bee?!

433
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,650
Oh my god!

434
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,890
Over there! Back there!

435
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,790
- Look carefully!
<i>- But I can't find it!</i>

436
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,680
<i>Where is it? Where?</i>

437
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,350
It flew away now.

438
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,430
In your eyes, what do you think, My Queen?

439
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:15,850
The brush strokes show strength, and its landscape style looks very lavish. So it must be expensive.

440
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:21,430
As you have so many valuable things like this, you must feel uneasy.

441
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,760
But on the other hand, you must have a separate group of night guards anyway. Right?

442
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,510
I don't have any separate night guards.

443
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,440
The guards I hire to protect my properties

444
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,090
might become thieves in this world, you know.

445
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,300
Then?

446
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,400
I've trained trustworthy slaves who grew up in my household since they were little

447
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,220
and use them for guards, too. One rock to kill two birds.

448
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,830
That's rather cheaper, too.

449
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,200
You're wise. How many of such capable slaves do you have?

450
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,380
That's... confidential information for security though.

451
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,000
If so, you don't have to tell me.

452
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,670
But as this place is where My Queen stays,

453
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,990
I'm worried.

454
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,570
My Queen?

455
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,430
I have about 26 to 27 people.

456
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,420
What secret would there be between Your Majesty and me?

457
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,410
It's a good number, enough to protect this grand mansion with 99 rooms.

458
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,650
After hearing that, now I'm relieved.

459
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:39,350
By the way, you wouldn't have old books, hundreds of years old, in your study, would you?

460
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,160
Such things can't be easily obtained even if you have a lot of money.

461
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,680
You would be so surprised!

462
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,280
Really? Suddenly?

463
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,100
On the way to my study, there is a pine tree I cherish a lot.

464
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:05,050
Its shape looks exactly like a Phoenix.

465
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:11,440
In fact, as I heard that if I plant it, a "mother of a nation" would be born in this house, so...

466
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,880
That's quite amazing.

467
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,190
It's nearby. Please follow me.

468
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,630
That damnable pine tree, I'll use it for a fire this winter.

469
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:27,670
It's nice to hear that rough and arrogant way of your speaking again.

470
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:32,700
When you first changed, I thought you were exercising your authority.

471
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:38,780
I thought you were weighing down on me using your family name, but I was mistaken.

472
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,080
You were just...

473
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,580
Just?

474
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,900
...lacking any manners.

475
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,600
I possess so many traits that

476
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,690
I can do without any manners.

477
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,420
I mean when I say that I wish to understand you.

478
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:01,720
I'm curious as to what kind of upbringing in a noble family of Joseon produces a woman such as you.

479
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,610
There's no need to be curious.

480
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,400
It's impossible for a woman like me to come out of Joseon.

481
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,260
"In the whole universe, only I exist."

482
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,780
You really are arrogant.

483
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,000
Geez, what the...?

484
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,840
<i>[Yi-gwak]
(T/N: meaning "deposing a king and enthroning a new king") </i>

485
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,650
What's wrong with you?

486
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,090
It's nothing.

487
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,130
I think his worry over you has weakened him.

488
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,500
I'll get someone and take you inside. Please keep an eye on His Majesty.

489
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,880
What's wrong? It looks like you’re seeing some kind of ghost.

490
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,730
<i>This damp smell...</i>

491
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,060
<i>- Save me.
- It's all because of me.</i>

492
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,950
<i>He died because of me.</i>

493
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,340
In this well...

494
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,490
Your Majesty.

495
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,320
Hurry! Hurry up and take His Majesty to...

496
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,080
Lady Eui Bin?

497
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,260
What's going on here? You are so pale.

498
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,210
No way...

499
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,960
Father, would you take His Majesty inside?

500
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:08,390
I think Bin came here because she has something to talk about with me.

501
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,700
I’ve been worried about your condition, Your Majesty,

502
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,680
but His Majesty's condition is more serious. What happened?

503
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,800
I just couldn't sleep last night.

504
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,360
It’s just momentary dizziness.

505
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,310
Let's first go to the room. I've called for a doctor.

506
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,710
You don’t need to call a doctor.

507
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,880
I'll be fine in a moment.

508
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,560
Hurry up and take care of His Majesty.

509
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,430
Be careful.

510
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,550
Be careful.

511
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,620
You may leave us.

512
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,270
Would you like to lie down?

513
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,690
No.

514
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,900
I’ll just sit here and take a break.

515
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:22,470
Your Majesty, I heard you lost most of your childhood memories in Hanyang. <i> (T/N: Hanyang is the current Seoul)</i>

516
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,340
It was when I was young,

517
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,510
but also because I left Hanyang for something unfortunate that happened,

518
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,780
I don't remember much.

519
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,960
That's a relief.

520
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,820
I meant it’s better to forget the bad memories.

521
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,340
I think so, too.

522
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,380
My damn sense of smell has opened up Pandora's box.

523
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,700
Contrary to what I’ve heard, you seem fine.

524
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,230
I thought perhaps not, but...

525
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:08,400
Don't worry. I didn't tell him anything.

526
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,190
Isn't that why you came running here?

527
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,160
Then, what do you want?

528
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,580
There must be a reason for calling His Majesty here.

529
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,040
I really wanted to get along with you.

530
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,700
Call it a wellspring of hormones or the last bastion,

531
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,010
even with this body, I could still be myself as long as I had indecent desires towards you.

532
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:35,410
But I found out the truth about you.

533
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,710
The truth?

534
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,600
That you're a fake Kim So-yong.

535
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:51,410
Did you just call me a fake?

536
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,650
- My memory is back.
- I bet what came back is not your memory but your true colors.

537
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,730
I'm telling you this with affection as someone who once was my wellspring of hormones.

538
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,750
You better tell him with your own mouth.

539
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,920
How betrayed he’ll feel if he finds out from someone else?

540
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,440
This is a threat.

541
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,990
I fully understand what you want from me.

542
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,800
Your Majesty, I'll bring in the refreshments.

543
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,590
I can't say anything to her!

544
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:33,380
Holding onto that twisted thread of fate is why she's so twisted and unattractive.

545
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,290
Let's go inside.

546
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,350
Your Majesty.

547
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,620
Are you done talking to her?

548
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,660
Leave us alone for a moment.

549
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:03,980
- Are you all right?
- I am sorry for worrying you when there is nothing wrong.

550
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,960
You do not have to be so formal.

551
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,310
It is just us two here.

552
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,720
Your Majesty, since the queen has made a full recovery...

553
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,200
- Please come back to the palace with me now.
- I can't.

554
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,150
I need to look into something.

555
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,840
"Look into something"?

556
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,090
May I ask what it is?

557
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,330
I apologize for my bad manners.

558
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,590
I have set up a nice room.

559
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,720
Please let's go to that room.

560
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,020
I must go back to the palace.

561
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,600
Then, I will wait for you at the palace.

562
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,570
Please go back safely.

563
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:02,740
<i> His grandfather was Prince Euneon. He was framed for treason, exiled, and eventually executed. </i>

564
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,570
<i> His father was Prince Jeongye. He lived in exile with his father, got sick, and died. </i>

565
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:11,140
<i> His grandmother and aunt got killed for getting baptized. </i>

566
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,160
<i> His half-brother, Lee Won-gyeong also got killed for treason. </i>

567
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,960
<i> This isn't "Emergency Escape Number 1"... </i>

568
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,170
<i> Why did every member of his family end up dying? </i>

569
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

570
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:37,840
- How am I looking at you?
- You are looking at me like I am a pitiful mutt.

571
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,750
<i> Please don't smile. I already feel bad for you </i>

572
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,150
This is why they talk about the harmful side effects of early education.

573
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,580
I keep remembering such useless knowledge.

574
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,970
You, what do you want from me? Why do you keep sticking to me like glue?

575
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,570
What do I want from you?

576
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,580
<i>If by chance the queen ...</i>

577
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,870
<i>indeed turns out to be one of our enemies,</i>

578
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:07,180
<i>I will behead her with my own hands.</i>

579
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:12,760
I want you to not be my enemy.

580
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,410
You do not have to be my ally.

581
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:18,880
Just don't become one of my enemies, please.

582
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,180
You have a good eye.

583
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,430
I may not be very helpful as an ally,

584
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,070
but I can be scary as an enemy. I won't let go until the end.

585
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,060
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

586
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,070
Young Master Kim Byeong-in is here.

587
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,850
I have so many guests today.

588
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,490
It's like I am a popular restaurant.

589
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,410
Are you feeling okay?

590
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,060
The trouble is that I am too well.

591
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,860
What is the problem to bring the Uigeumbu here?

592
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,680
The king and queen are here right now,

593
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,190
so it might as well be the palace.

594
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:31,400
Your Majesty the Queen, from now on, we, Uigeumbu, will protect you.

595
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,850
I have brought the Royal Guard, so you don't have to worry. You can leave.

596
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,530
Then the Royal Guard will protect you, Your Majesty, and...

597
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,660
the Uigeumbu will protect the queen.

598
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,990
- Do you want to waste man-power for no reason?
- Then you should have the Royal Guard leave.

599
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,880
You are standing in the wrong direction.

600
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,890
If you are facing outward, you are a standing guard.

601
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,680
But if you are facing this way, you are watching us.

602
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:20,610
I guess my fate is to be surrounded by the Kim family all the time.

603
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,040
Who are you?

604
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,920
Are you okay?

605
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,460
This person...

606
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,370
What are you doing here?

607
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,110
Do you know him?

608
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,820
Wake up, Young Master.

609
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,680
Please save me, Hyungnim Byeong-in.

610
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,670
Hyungnim?

611
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,500
If he's close to you, then why did he try to harm the queen?

612
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,560
She could have been in danger.

613
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,460
Get lost, you woman. Get out of the body. Get lost.

614
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,990
My Queen.

615
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,960
<i> What is that big mouth kid doing here again?</i>

616
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,380
What were you thinking?

617
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,850
I was so excited to see her face.

618
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,330
That's right. I am...

619
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:50,930
- I am Joseon's...
- Lady Hong Yeon.

620
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,820
Queen...

621
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,700
He is here to see your maid.

622
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,380
Is he really unable to recognize me because I have a beauty mark? <i>(T/N: a reference from "Temptation of Wife")</i>

623
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,180
You said the Uigeumbu would protect the queen,

624
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,320
but I guess you showed how vulnerable you actually are.

625
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,690
Why are you so dissatisfied with the protection of the Uigeumbu?

626
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,490
Are you by chance planning on doing something?

627
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,360
What could I be planning on doing?

628
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,000
These days, a lot of storehouses in the capital have been robbed.

629
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,300
- So?
- So we must increase security.

630
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,740
But if you are preventing us from doing so,

631
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,830
I am wondering if you have been making pocket money.

632
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:46,840
<i> Despite his past, he is still the king. </i>

633
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,000
Director of Uigeumbu, today,

634
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,170
we will put an end to this.

635
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,360
This is exactly what I wanted.

636
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,330
I am skilled at martial arts,

637
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,190
so I am fine as I avoided his kick with my fast instincts.

638
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:19,370
But there is something, I would like to find out from you...

639
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,960
which is why I had to see you.

640
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,410
Oh, I see.

641
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,980
I have another request.

642
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,970
I am not sure if I can ask you this request.

643
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,810
Go ahead.

644
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,950
Can you blow on my bruise?

645
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,490
Even your breath has a pleasant scent.

646
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,670
Even at this moment,

647
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:01,760
I can't tell what this surge of emotions means.

648
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,400
There's only one way to find out.

649
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,700
Excuse me. I must confirm.

650
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,880
- Why are you here?
- I felt bad for not being able to recognize such an important person.

651
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,750
Why are you looking at me like that?

652
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,000
It's a smile with hopes that you will forgive me.

653
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,900
It's a smile that is better than my good breath.

654
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,940
You know how to drink very well.

655
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,300
You hold your liquor very well, too.

656
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,610
I'm the king, Am I not?

657
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,560
They have already finished this much?

658
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,430
The time has finally come. HDW.

659
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:55,830
HDW.

660
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,230
The hour of dog and wolf.

661
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,780
Those people who are perfectly normal during the day,

662
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,140
turn into dogs and wolves. It's the magic hour.

663
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,770
Let me ask you one thing as a man.

664
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,190
I hope you do not...

665
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,600
have feelings for the queen, do you?

666
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:46,180
If not, why are you so desperate to take me down?

667
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:50,540
There are bad men like that occasionally.

668
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:55,550
He doesn't give love,

669
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:58,120
yet he can't stand

670
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,230
other men giving love.

671
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:10,620
I... am a fool who's only full of possessiveness?

672
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,750
A foolish man who doesn't even recognize

673
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,390
what great woman he has beside him.

674
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,270
What are you guys doing? I'm not interested in either of you.

675
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:40,380
Wrong. I know you like me.

676
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,920
Look at my eyes.

677
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,190
You...

678
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,340
Magnanimity is also a virtue of a superior man.

679
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,450
I won!

680
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,360
Goodness.

681
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,450
It's time you earned your keep.

682
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:56,030
Oh, dear! In the end, I ran into you like this.

683
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,740
I was trying to keep my distance as I didn't want to be a cause of harm to you.

684
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,590
Please, don't say such things, Your Royal Highness the Queen Dowager.

685
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:05,070
I have a gift for you.

686
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,290
This is...

687
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,310
You are the one who deserves to be next to the king.

688
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:29,120
In every aspect, you are more suitable to be the queen.

689
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,690
What were you looking at?

690
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:47,080
I was just looking at the moon's reflection in the lake.

691
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,780
There are many horror stories circulating in the palace.

692
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,320
Stories about ghosts, for instance.

693
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,300
One of them is that, on a night of the full moon like tonight,

694
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,540
you should never look at the reflection.

695
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,400
"When you leave, your reflection left on the lake

696
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,450
will start moving on its own," it says.

697
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:22,680
I feel as though I have been submerged in the lake all my life.

698
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:33,740
It is now time to come out of the lake.

699
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:28,180
He should be going after I get back. He's in such a hurry!

700
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,520
But the outhouse is this way.

701
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:14,740
There is something I have not told you.

702
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,720
I haven't told anyone. It is a secret that only the queen and I know.

703
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:32,760
<i>A werewolf turns into a wolf in the moonlight on a night of the full moon.</i>

704
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,200
<i>But we know...</i>

705
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:43,060
<i>that the full moon is just an excuse to</i>

706
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,900
<i>unleash the wolf inside us.</i>

707
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,820
This is the chamber pot?

708
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:27,570
I can't deal with this delicate pot.

709
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,320
Tango?

710
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,660
Are you up?

711
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,230
Take me to the queen's chamber. I will guard her myself.

712
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,470
My Queen...

713
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:18,880
<i>How dare he try to hurt my poor king?</i>

714
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:26,600
In the name of justice, I will not forgive you!

715
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,950
My move was not precise because I drank before.

716
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,420
Hey, get up. Are you okay?

717
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,150
Why were you standing there?

718
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,030
<i>This way!</i>

719
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,920
I won't do "no touching" today.

720
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,240
Your Majesty!

721
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,600
Are you okay?

722
