What is this?

13
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,981

(Mao) Ah.

34
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:52,973
(Mao) It was the last time I got in touch at 1am.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,975
(Sho) What is it?

36
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,979
But I'm glad I didn't push you over.

37
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,049
(Mao) Thank you so much, it really helped.

38

(Sou) It's the best.

46
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,939
Can I eat it? (Mao) Please.

47
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,007
(Shu) We will be offering it.

48
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,511
So, starting with miso soup.

49
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,018
(Sou) What? It's delicious.

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,522

Yeah! Delicious! (Mao) Hehehe.

52
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,464
(Sou) It's the best dish I've ever had.

53

(Mao) That's a big deal. (Sou) Really.

54

Leave the cleaning up to me. (Mao) What?

59
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:12,920
(Sou) They've made this kind of thing so please do that much.

60
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,923
