(Asana) Since joining the company, Mao has been a lunch box.

174
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,408
(Sainame) Protein, vitamins, and carbohydrate balance is perfect.

175
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,410
No, it's really amazing.

176
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:00,914
I want to make one too, but isn't it difficult every day?

177
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,416
(Mao) Hmm, I guess I'll get used to it.

178
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,420
I've been doing housework naturally at the top of my four siblings.

179
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,422
>> Mao looks like a sister.

180
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,425
That amount of work is to do it without whining.

181
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,429
(Mao) No, no, I'm just not good at being spoiled by others.

182
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,933
(Yuka) I respect Koshiba.

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,936
(Mao) Wait, wait, wait, and say something cool.

184
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,438
Lunch boxes are just saving money.

185
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:28,942
And I'm a boring person and no hobby →

186
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,445
Cooking is my only hobby...

187
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:37,884
The more elaborate cooking like this, the more stress it relieves.

188
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,387
>> Koshiba-san, did you have anything?

189
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,888
(Mao) What?

190
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,891

(Mao) Thank you Yagi-san. (Yuka) Hehe.

193
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,902
(Asana) That's right. Have you heard of the new manager? He's a super handsome guy.

194
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,905
It's already checked, not just the face →

195
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:03,410
In his first year of joining the company, he launched a project that sold 10 billion yen a year →

196
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,413
It looks like a hit maker. (Saina) That's insane.

197
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,983
He's a real elite, I'm looking forward to it! (Yuka) Hey.

198
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,423
Thank you for your hard work. (Everyone) Thank you for your hard work.

199
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,491
Everyone, it's a bit nice.

200
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,429
(Ikezaki) Introducing a new manager.

201
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,932
This is Ando, ​​Director Sou, who has been assigned to the sales department from today.

202
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,434
(Sou) This is Ando.

203
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,935
(Mao) ⟨What??⟩

204
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,938
(Ikezaki) Manager Ando has been in my 13th year since joining the company →

205
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,875
He's an elite returning from overseas.

206
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,878
(Sou) Well, I won't deny it.

207
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,381

213

(Ikezaki) It was a shame to have time, so please go back to work.

214
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,404
(Everyone) Yes. Manager, this one.

215
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,473
The deepest part of that. (Sou) Thank you.

216
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,478
(Mao) Okay.

219
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,921
(Mao) Yes.

220
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,991
(Sou) Can I come to the conference room in a little ten minutes?

221
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,497
(Mao) ⟨It's a lie, isn't it?⟩

Ah, what should I do?

223

What... I wonder what it's about?

224
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,875
I've just waited a moment, let's sort it out.

225
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,877

(Mao) Yes.

259
