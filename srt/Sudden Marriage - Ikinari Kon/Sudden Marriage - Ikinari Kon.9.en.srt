1
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,943
(Mao) ⟨ I was an ordinary office lady →

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,445
With my company's elite boss, drunkenly

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,447
I got married all of a sudden! ⟩

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,950
(Sou) Please marry me.

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,953
(Mao) ⟨ But this encounter wasn't a coincidence⟩

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,956
(Sou) I will continue to love Mao forever.

7
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:25,026
(Mao) I love only So-san for the rest of my life.

8
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,462
(Sou) I have only Mao.

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,965
(Mao) ⟨ What will happen if I fall in love with you any more?

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,967
(Future) There's an important story.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,536
(Sou) To me... (Mao) What?

12
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,473
(Sou) Hey, Mao Where should I put it around here?

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,976
(Mao) Oh, then, please do so near the kitchen.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,477
(Creation) OK.

15
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:47,481
(humming)

16
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,483
(Mao) So-san, you're in a good mood.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,485
(Sou) Of course it is. (Mao) What?

18
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,054
(So) Because Mao has moved.

19
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,058
(humming)

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,998
(Sou) I'll stay together forever.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,936
(Mao) So-san. (So) Huh?

22
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:12,006
(Mao) Umm...｡ (So) Yes.

23
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,447
(Mao) I hope you'll start working with me again today.

24
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,449
(Sou) Please

25
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,452
(Mao) No, this is it. (Sou) Hahaha.

26
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,455
I love that kind of thing about Mao.

27
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:31,459
What will you do to make me do you like any more?

28
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,462
What are you going to do? (Mao) Hehehe...

29
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,465
(Sou) Now, let's try harder. (Mao) Yes.

30
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,533
(Sou) It's good.

31
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:46,474
(Mao) ⟨ If you really fall in love with me any more →

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,043
I wonder what will happen ⟩

33
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,482
(Mao) It's over.

34
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,984
(Sou) Mao.

35
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,053
You're tired.

36
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,428
(Sou) Hmm.

37
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:10,431
(Mao) So-san, what's wrong?

38
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:13,501
(Sou) So, well...

39
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm so happy to be with Mao forever since today.

40
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,442
(Mao) I can't talk about anything interesting.

41
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,945
(Shu) Hehe, that's interesting.

42
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,948
And not that,

43
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,952
From today, I'll be eating with Mao forever →

44
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:36,457
Get your lap pillow and sleep together →

45
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,459
When I woke up in the morning →

46
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,462
It's only natural that Mao is there →

47
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,464
I'm happy.

48
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,467
(Mao) Yes. (Sou) What? Yes.

49
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,970
Mao: Are you not happy? (Mao) I'm happy.

50
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,973
(So) I don't think I'm happy. (Mao) I'm happy.

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,477
(Sou) Come over here and let me massage a little.

52
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,480
(Mao) Hehehe! (Sou) Huh? Are you weak here?

53
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,483
Hehehehe Where is this?

54
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,419
(Mao) No...｡ (Sou) Hehehe.

55
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,922
Mao.

56
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,425
You can speak as much as you want here.

57
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,428
(Mao) I won't put it out. (Shu) Let's put it out.

58
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,497
(Mao) I won't let it go.

59
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,937
(Ikezaki) Product delivery should be carried out without delay →

60
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,440
Please check each of us. (Everyone) Yes.

61
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,943
(Ikezaki) Then, Manager Ando will be held all next week →

62
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,946
I'm on a business trip to Canada overseas, so if something happens, I'll be away while I'm away...

63
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,949
(Mao) ⟨ It's a week...⟩

64
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,951
⟨ It's long⟩

65
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,954
>>Thank you for your continued support today.

66
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,523
(Sou) Thank you very much. (Everyone) Thank you very much.

67
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,538
(Yuka) Please wait a little.

68
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,041
(Yuka) Takada-san.

69
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,914
(Yuka) Takada-san, I'm on the phone.

70
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,484
(Kota) Where? (Yuka) It's from Sugiyama-san.

71
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,488
(Kota) Sorry, can you say you're not here?

72
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,428
(Yuka's voice) It's not the first time.

73
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,498
I've been living in Takada recently so often.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,437
What's more, it seems suspicious when someone calls out something.

75
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,439
(Mao) Is it suspicious?

76
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:37,444
>> I think it's probably a money collection.

77
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:41,448
(Mao) Does that mean debt? >> Yes, that's definitely true.

78
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,951
My father is a police officer →

79
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,953
I know something like that.

80
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,022
(Mao) Hmm, that's right.

81
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,960
>> Hmm, the dashi roll looks delicious.

82
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:57,464
(Mao) Hehe Yagi's lunch box looks delicious too.

83
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,467
>> I'm doing my best with Koshiba-san as a reference.

84
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,904
I want to make it for him next time.

85
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,973
(Mao) Hmm! >> Hehehe.

86
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,910
(Mao) Are you going to eat it? >> Hmm! Is it okay?

87
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,912
I'll enjoy having this.

88
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,481
So mine too. (Mao) Ah, thank you.

89
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,421
(The sound of the door opening)

90
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,923
(Mao) I was surprised.

91
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,925
(Sound of door closing) (Mao) What is it?

92
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,495
>> What does this baggage mean?

93
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,433
[What is this?]

94
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,436
(Mao) You said you were going to break up, right?

95
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,438
>> Mao →

96
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,441
Let's get married.

97
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,942
(Mao) Huh?

98
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,445
>> I've noticed it.

99
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,515
Mao is the only one who will accept me, who is bad.

100
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,453
To make me decide to marry →

101
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,955
Did you say you're going to break up on purpose?

102
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,958
Sorry.

103
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,462
Let's start an account together and get married.

104
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,897
Let's be happy.

105
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,400
(Mao) What are you talking about?

106
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,903
>> I'm going to Mao's house today.

107
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,406
Because I'll be kind.

108
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:15,409
(Mao) Please take care!

109
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,911
I don't seem to understand so I'll say it again →

110
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,981
You and me have no relation to anything anymore.

111
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,984
Well then.

112
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,922
>> Is my father about to die? (Mao) What?

113
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,926
>> In a serious injury and in danger.

114
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:37,498
The medical costs and hospitalization costs are quite high.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,437
Mao: Could you lend me 400,000 yen?

116
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,940
No, 20 is fine.

117
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,942
(Mao) ⟨ When love cools down⟩

118
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:53,013
⟨ Everything this person says is a lie⟩

119
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,452
I moved.

120
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,456
>>Huh? (Mao) She's no longer in that house either.

121
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:06,894
>>Where? (Mao) It's irrelevant.

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,899
Also, I used up my savings as well after moving.

123
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,901
If necessary, just ask Higashi-san.

124
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,903
She seems rich.

125
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,405
>> I just had a little fun with Higashi-san.

126
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,407
I'm not serious.

127
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,910
I want to marry Mao. (Mao) Stop it!

128
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,412
>> I only have Mao! (Mao) Take it easy!

129
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,916
>> Pain! What are you doing?

130
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:33,420
(Mao) I don't have a single yen to give you scum like you!

131
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,922
>> Scum?

132
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,991
(Mao) Don't get involved in my life again!

133
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,429
>> If you're not good at it, it's good to be there!

134
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,931
(Mao) Stop it, let it go!

135
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,933
>> Listen to what you say! (Mao) Stop it!

136
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,935
(The sound of the door opening) (Ikezaki) What are you doing?

137
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,438
Are you okay? Koshiba. (Mao) Yes...

138
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,941
>> Section Chief: This is nothing.

139
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,944
We're dating... >> It's fine →

140
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,012
Get out.

141
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,954
(Door opening and closing sound)

142
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,891
(Mao) That's helpful.

143
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,462
>> Is it really okay? Takada's guy seems to be persistent though.

144
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:21,468
(Mao) It's okay, I have So-san too.

145
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,905
>> Koshiba →

146
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,976
Can you come to our house with So tonight?

147
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,416
(Sou) Mao. (Mao) Ah, welcome back.

148
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,419
Manager Ikezaki is tonight...

149
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,488
So-san?

150
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,926
(So) What did Takada say?

151
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,428
(Mao) You heard it.

152
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,431
It's okay. (Sou) I was worried.

153
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,935
From now on, if anything happens, please say it properly.

154
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,503
(Mao) Yes.

155
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,878
📱(Vibration sound)

156
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,881
(Mao) So-san Your smartphone is ringing. 📱 (vibration sound)

157
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:15,889
📱(Vibration sound)

158
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,458
(Shu) I'm a bit sorry. 📱(Vibration sound)

159
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,396
(Sho) What if?

160
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,399
It's not possible today.

161
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,968
I have important things to do now.

162
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,473
(Oki) I'll have you.

163
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,412
(Oki) Can I use a delicious hamburger steak?

164
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,480
(Mao) There's still more, eat a lot.

165
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,917
>> Hmm, it's really tasty!

166
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,420
Can you make such a delicious hamburger at home? Hehe.

167
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,922
(Sou) Isn't it? (Ikezaki) So is every day →

168
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,924
I feel like I know that I want to eat Koshiba rice.

169
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,427
You've been bad friends lately.

170
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,429
(So) It's not just food.

171
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,432
I'm home to meet the cute Mao.

172
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:02,436
I'm impressed that (future)'s curse is so proud.

173
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,439
(Mao) Sorry. (Future) Ugh.

174
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,442
