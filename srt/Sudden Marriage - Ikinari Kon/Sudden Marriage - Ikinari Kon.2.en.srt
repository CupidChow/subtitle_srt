00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,914
(Sou) Mao supports top-class salesmen in the company →

174
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,917
I heard from Ikezaki that he handles multiple people.

175
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,420
(Mao) Ah, no... (Sou) There are some people who don't work at all →

176
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,923
Even with the same salary, there is such a difference in work:

177
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,926
That's a weird story.

178
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:10,430
(Mao) It's amazing that he's so well understood that even though it's the first day of his assignment.

179
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,933
(Sou) What's amazing is Mao.

180
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,936
Being assigned to that kind of work means

181
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,438
That's amazing.

182
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:22,509
Well, I guess Mao's usual work is appreciated.

183
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,949
(Mao) This is the first time I've been told that.

184
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:33,019
⟨ What kind of praise I'm happy about?

185
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,958
I'm glad you worked hard.

186
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,397
(Sou) I like the honest Mao too.

187
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,400
(Mao) Don't ruin it with a lighthearted thing.

188
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,402
(Sou) Following his previous manager →

189
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,905
I'll ask my manager too, but does it look okay?

190
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,407
(Mao) Yes, I heard this from Director Ueda.

191
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,910
(Sou) It would be helpful if Mao supported me.

192
00:12:56,977 --> 00:13:00,413
But please don't overdo it.

193
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,415
(Mao) Yes. (Shop clerk) Sorry for keeping you waiting.

194
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,984
(Sou) Oh.

195
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,922
It's here.

196
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,925
(Mao) ⟨Even if no one can look at work →

197
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,927
I thought it was good ⟩

198
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,429
⟨If you can do a job that you can be proud of →

199
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,499
That alone makes me happy ⟩

200
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,937
(Sou) Yes.

201
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,439
Try starting with the dashimaki.

202
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,009
(Mao) I'll take it. (Sou) Please.

203
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,388
(Mao) Yes! delicious!

204
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,891
The egg flavor is rich and the dashi aroma is elegant.

205
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,393
(Sho) That's good.

206
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,397
Honestly, I was really worried about where to go to the store.

207
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,401
(Mao) There's no need to worry about anything for me.

208
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,904
(Sou) Don't say "something."

209
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,908
I was thinking it seriously.

210
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,979
So I thought Mao would like to eat this.

211
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,984
(Mao) Thank you. (Sou) You are welcome.

212
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,923
Hey, does Mao usually eat at home?

213
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,926
(Mao) Yes, I usually have lunch at lunchtime too.

214
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,928
(Sou) Hmm.

215
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,431
I want to eat Mao's homemade dishes.

216
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,932
(Mao) What?

217
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:30,003
(So) Next time, can you cook dinner for me?

218
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,383
(Mao) I refuse, I don't want to make it.

219
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,885
(Sou) Why?

220
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:49,389
(Mao) But there seems to be a high hurdle.

221
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,459
I can only do plain home cooking.

222
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,895
(Kota) [This is this]

223
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,898
(Mao's voice) Before he eats it,

224
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,401
Mayonnaise and soy sauce poured on it →

225
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,903
At the end I got bored and couldn't eat it.

226
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,973
[Today...] >> [I'm fine with a cupler now]

227
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,913
(Mao) Ah, sorry, complain.

228
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,483
But I'm not confident.

229
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,421
(Sou) Hmm.

230
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:26,926
Even if Mao perfectly recreates the food at this restaurant →

231
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,429
He didn't say it was delicious, right?

232
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,431
To him →

233
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,868
I had no desire to taste Mao's homemade dishes anymore.

234
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,371
See, cooking is tough.

235
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:43,376
Thinking about a menu, going shopping, taking the time to do it →

236
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,947
I don't think I can do that if I taste that too.

237
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,385
I can do any dish →

238
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,889
If it was something you made for me only →

239
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,458
Everything feels special though.

240
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,963
(Mao) ⟨ It's bad... I'm going to cry⟩

241
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,908
(Mao) Delicious... Please enjoy the manager too.

242
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,478
(Sou) Yes, I'll eat it.

243
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,981
It's been a while since I last saw it.

244
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,420
(Mao) It was really tasty and thank you for the meal.

245
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,922
(Sho) No.

246
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,424
I think Mao was right when she married me.

247
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,362
(Mao) Ah, please continue on with the conversation in the conference room.

248
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,864
(Sou) What's more?

249
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,367
(Mao) I have no intention of getting married.

250
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,869
Please make sure it wasn't Friday night.

251
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:46,373
Please. (Sou) Don't worry if you say that.

252
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,875
I've already submitted my marriage registration.

253
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,377
(Mao) That's it...

254
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,880
(Sou) Also, I don't think it's a bad story for Mao either.

255
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,383
My mother in the countryside is getting married, but...

256
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,885
Are you having trouble telling your boyfriend that he's cheating on you?

257
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,887
(Mao) What, why...

258
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:03,957
(Sou) The other day, Mao told me everything about him.

259
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,895
(Mao) It's true that's the situation, but →

260
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,897
But suddenly we got married on the first day we met →

261
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,400
What do you think in common sense?

262
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,902
(Sou) It's common sense.

263
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,405
Being caught up in such ambiguous values ​​→

264
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:22,909
Is it okay to let the good man in front of you escape?

265
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,479
Isn't it good if we learn about each other slowly from now on?

266
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,916
(Mao) Why did he accept this marriage →

267
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,419
Please tell me the exact reason.

268
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,487
(Sou) I'm particular about it.

269
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,923
(Mao) Of course that's right.

270
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,925
Because if I were the manager, it wasn't me →

271
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,927
How much else does it cost?

272
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,930
(Sou) I like Mao.

273
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,933
(Mao) I can't trust that!

274
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,935
Because →

275
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:53,440
The manager has no advantage in marrying me...

276
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,009
(Sou) Mao is good.

277
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,451
(Sho) It's interesting.

278
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,953
So will you come over to me?

279
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,457
(Mao) That's not possible! (Sou) Why?

280
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:15,462
(Mao) I can't marry someone I don't like.

281
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:21,034
And I haven't yet broken up with him clearly...

282
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,971
(Sou) Are you curious about your ex-boyfriend?

283
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,974
(Mao) I mean, I mean...

284
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:32,479
(Sou) Even though he was cheated and was half-heartedly kidnapped →

285
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,914
If he's back then

286
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,983
Can you forgive it?

287
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,989
I can't do Mao to be treated like that.

288
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:48,428
I can't forgive anyone who makes Mao cry.

289
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:52,499
(Mao) It's okay, I'm not crying.

290
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,002
[Aerospace…]

291
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,506

292
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,010
(Shu) I will make you forget.

293
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,451
(Sou) Marriage continues.

294
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,953
(Mao) Oh no, wait a moment.

295
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,955
(Sou) It's impossible, because Mao has no veto.

296
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,459
Because it was Mao who said she was going to get married first.

297
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,028
(Mao) [I'll get married anyway]

298
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,467
Ah, I understand now!

299
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,469
(Sou) Okay, then let's decide the rules.

300
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,972
For now, I prepare for the move and live together.

301
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,410
(Mao) No, please forgive me for that. (So) Dismissal A newlywed life is essential.

302
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,413
But I guess it won't be possible right away →

303
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,917
For now, when the timing is right, we eat together at Mao's house.

(Mao) What? (Sou) And when you're alone, →

(Mao) What is a penalty? (Sou) It's decided.

307
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,994
(Mao) Um!

308
00:19:56,996 --> 00:20:00,500
