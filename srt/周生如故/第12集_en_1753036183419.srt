I'm sorry.

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Did I say something wrong just now?

89
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You mean Madam Wan?

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll find a chance to take you to see her in the future.

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll find a chance to take you to see her in the future.

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll find a chance to take you to see her in the future.

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll find a chance to take you to see her in the future.

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll find a chance to take you to see her in the future.

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll find a chance to take you to see her in the future.

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll find a chance to take you to see her in the future.

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll find a chance to take you to see her in the future.

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm thinking about it.

99
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm thinking about it.

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I should take revenge on them for a few days.

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I should take revenge on them for a few days.

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What do you think, Madam?

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're right.

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're right.

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I just want Cui's collection.

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I just want Cui's collection.

108
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's worthless.

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's worthless.

110
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Today, those guys are talking to her.

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Today, those guys are talking to her.

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A bunch of people can't even talk about a little girl.

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's why Miss Cui said it's hard to find.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's hard to find.

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
His wife has already...

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They were born together.

117
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They were six years old.

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They got married when they were 16.

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Two years later, the Han Army was liberated.

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We abandoned everything.

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We left our old old records behind.

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We were willing to die for the desert.

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He died in the desert.

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I...

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm still alive.

126
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Then what about you?

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You began to think about this a lot when you were young.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How did you getirsin all along?

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So you've just started to think about me?

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So you've just started to think about me?

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Stop it.

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't have any sorrows left because of you.

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I need to live with you.

134
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Cui.

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,840
No

136
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Thank you

137
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,900
My wife told me a while ago

138
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,280
Ah Yue

139
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,020
Don't want to set up a row for me

140
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,300
No matter what, to you

141
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,960
I won't step back

142
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,900
So there's no row

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,820
My wife

144
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,420
country called the Transformers.

145
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,660
If you don't make the arrangement,

146
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
they may get taken in.

147
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,160
Don't worry.

148
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,400
We will make it through.

149
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,960
Are you sure?

150
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,560
Yes.

151
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,840
Careful.

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,080
Mrs.Huan promised

153
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,860
to the unfaithful.

154
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,260
It shows that the power of promise

155
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,980
is so precious to the family.

156
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
But master...

157
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,260
What's wrong with master?

158
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,380
Master is wrong.

159
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,860
What's wrong with me?

160
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,540
Master said that

161
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
when a person dies,

162
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,020
what he left behind is empty.

163
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,860
Except for sorrow,

164
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,860
there's no extra use.

165
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,260
A promise is more important

166
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,140
than life to a soldier.

167
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,180
I can promise you.

168
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,420
If one day,

169
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,060
I meet something bad,

170
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,300
someone will tell you

171
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,380
when I die

172
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,900
and where I die.

173
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
I promise you.

174
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,060
Master is a general who has fought for hundreds of years.

175
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,620
He will live a long life.

176
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,780
This is Longkang Academy.

177
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,900
Yes.

178
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,820
You have given your bow and arrow to Mr. Huan.

179
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,780
I'm sorry.

180
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,980
Never mind.

181
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,580
Hi.

182
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,460
I'm here to see Jinfeng.

183
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,620
I'll d жизнь��tue for you.

184
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,420
Sir.

185
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,940
There's a teacher

186
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,380
Here he comes.

187
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,380
The fish is not dead. Say it again.

188
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,180
You are the old man who took the name of Nan Xiao Xiao.

189
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,980
You are here with another old man.

190
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,380
Only two people.

191
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,380
Guard Mei.

192
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,780
Yes, Guard Mei.

193
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Dress him up.

194
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,380
Yes, dress him up.

195
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,780
Fang Lian.

196
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,180
I don't know who he is.

197
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,580
Of course I want to put my face on him.

198
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,980
Your Highness, is that right?

199
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,980
Yes.

200
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,180
Miss Cui,

201
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,980
who do you think he is?

202
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,580
He dares to call Nan Xiao his own son.

203
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780
His surname is Xiao.

204
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,580
He is the emperor of Nan Xiao.

205
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,980
Let them out.

206
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,380
Mr. Huan's residence

207
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,780
only has students who are looking for a job.

208
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,780
They know how to get in touch.

209
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,980
There is no army, nor any officials.

210
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
I heard that

211
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,980
there is a guest from Xizhou.

212
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,980
I wonder if Mr. Huan

213
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,180
can open the curtain

214
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,780
and let us meet him?

215
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,580
There are no guests here.

216
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,180
I want to see him.

217
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,380
I want to see him.

218
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,780
I want to see him.

219
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,180
There are no guests here.

220
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,780
The old man is a guest.

221
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,180
The guest from Xizhou is also a guest.

222
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,580
I am

223
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,580
the one who pays the most attention to the first come, first served.

224
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,380
This guest is the first one.

225
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,980
You should ask him

226
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
if he wants to see you.

227
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,980
It makes sense.

228
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,780
Can the guest from Xizhou

229
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,180
come out and meet him?

230
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,180
The curtain hasn't been opened yet.

231
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,580
You and I

232
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,380
can pretend that we have never met.

233
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
That's the easiest way.

234
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,580
But when you were in Jiangling City,

235
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,380
it was spread all over the place.

236
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,780
Everyone knew it.

237
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,580
It's hard to believe.

238
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,380
It can be said that

239
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,780
you have seen it wrongly

240
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
and misjudged it.

241
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,180
Such a way

242
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
is enough to explain to others.

243
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,180
But

244
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,980
Zhou Shengchen,

245
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,180
how can you let me

246
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,580
leave you alone?

247
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,380
I don't want to fight with you.

248
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,780
Since you don't want to fight,

249
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,780
you'd better let me go back.

250
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,580
But I am the emperor.

251
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,780
I let you go for no reason.

252
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,180
I'm afraid that when I think about it,

253
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,980
I will feel uncomfortable.

254
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,180
I am an old man, young man.

255
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,980
You should be able to

256
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,580
save the old man some dignity.

257
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,380
Before His Majesty allows me

258
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,180
to enter Jiangling City,

259
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,180
I hope His Majesty will forgive me.

260
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,580
You should have a reason to apologize.

261
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,980
What is your reason?

262
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,380
Since His Majesty asked me this,

263
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
I think

264
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,780
I have thought of something.

265
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,580
Wu Er.

266
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,380
Xiao Wen.

267
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,780
Are you afraid that you will never come back?

268
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
I have known him for many years.

269
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,780
He will not come back empty-handed

270
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,380
when he arrives in Jiangling City.

271
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,780
He will force His Highness to kill me first.

272
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,780
Go back.

273
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,580
Xiao Di can't kill His Highness.

274
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,980
But it's easy to kill you.

275
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,380
You are a military counselor.

276
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,780
It's right to save your life.

277
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,180
You can't beat me.

278
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,580
How can you save me?

279
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,180
You talk too much.

280
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,380
Hurry up and row the boat.

281
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,980
If I can come back,

282
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,980
I will teach you how to beat me.

283
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,380
In the past, you were a monk.

284
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,380
You were always around.

285
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,980
How do you know that I can't beat you?

286
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,380
I heard from His Highness that

287
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,380
you are a talented martial artist.

288
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,780
Anyway,

289
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,380
no one can beat me except my master.

290
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,980
He has been renamed to Xiao Yan.

291
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,180
He is the military counselor of the King of Nanchen.

292
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,580
As the commander of the army,

293
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,780
how can I give up my military counselor

294
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,380
for my own sake?

295
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,580
You never doubted him.

296
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,780
He is the most favored son

297
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,380
I have raised for more than 20 years.

298
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,180
I don't doubt you.

299
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,580
I don't need you anymore.

300
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,980
I just want my son back.

301
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,780
Whether he wants to come back

302
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,580
depends on his own will.

303
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,780
Zhou Shengchen.

304
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,180
You are in Jiangling City now.

305
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,380
If you are not from Xizhou,

306
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,980
aren't you afraid that I will be confused

307
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,580
and kill you?

308
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,180
I always keep my word.

309
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,980
It's the same in Xizhou.

310
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,380
It's the same in Jiangling City.

311
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,780
Your Majesty.

312
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,580
The matter of the second prince

313
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,980
can be discussed with the servants.

314
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,580
The matter of the King of Nanchen

315
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,980
helping the army in the case

316
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,180
has spread in the capital.

317
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,780
Now it is a rumor.

318
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,580
It is believed that the south and north will be re-opened.

319
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,180
If Your Majesty doesn't think of a way to invite him back,

320
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:57,980
I'm afraid that

321
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,380
we will be in trouble.

322
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
You and I,

323
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
regardless of our identities

324
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,780
and age,

325
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,180
should be you

326
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,580
to make me an old man.

327
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,180
Am I right?

328
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,180
You are right.

329
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,980
Then, sir,

330
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,380
is there anything else you want?

331
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,980
I can see if I can give it to you.

332
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,980
Since it is a apology,

333
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,580
you should make it.

334
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,980
I have already prepared a apology gift.

335
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
The Cui family's collection of books is ancient.

336
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,180
When the war in the Central Plains was at its peak,

337
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,180
our family

338
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,180
saved the priceless treasure.

339
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
I brought out the collection of books from the Cui family.

340
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,180
Five thousand six hundred books.

341
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,180
They are all my dowry.

342
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,980
They are also my private collections.

343
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,980
I'm willing to give half of the King of Nanchen

344
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,180
of Xizhou to Your Majesty.

345
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,780
But I only have one request.

346
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
This book

347
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,180
must be stored in the Longkang Academy.

348
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,580
Really?

349
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,380
Your surname is Cui?

350
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,180
Where are you from?

351
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,980
My mother is Cui of the North Chen family.

352
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,380
Cui San Niang from the Wushui House.

353
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,580
She is also the current owner of the family.

354
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,180
In the past,

355
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,380
the three demons, Cui and Nan, were in Nanxiao.

356
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
But they couldn't move you.

357
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,580
Only one of them came.

358
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,380
But they moved back in a few decades.

359
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,380
It hurts my heart.

360
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
It's hard to leave your homeland.

361
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
It's a long-standing relationship.

362
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,780
Please forgive me.

363
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,780
No.

364
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,180
It's hard to leave Nanxiao.

365
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,580
I can't make a decision about the move of the family.

366
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,980
I won't talk about the past.

367
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
I'll only talk about today.

368
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,180
Your Majesty, are you willing to accept the gift?

369
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,780
It's me. It's me.

370
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,980
Huan Yu greets Your Majesty.

371
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,380
I've been looking for the Cui family's book.

372
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,780
I can't get it.

373
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,780
If Your Majesty accept this book,

374
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
I'll be your demon

375
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,580
to be the...

376
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,180
the Crown Prince's wife.

377
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,380
Yes, the Crown Prince's wife.

378
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,980
Mr. Huan, you...

379
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
You're being too rude.

380
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,580
It's okay.

381
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,180
I can get you out of the mountain.

382
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,780
It's the court's will.

383
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,180
The book is still in the Green Dragon Temple.

384
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,380
Find a chance to send it here.

385
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,980
I gave him the book and the dowry.

386
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,380
It's been only three days.

387
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,380
It's a bit of a loss.

388
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,380
I can copy the book when I'm back.

389
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,980
The mountain is far away.

390
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
I'll ask my mother to send me the official book.

391
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,580
I'll go back to the palace and copy it slowly.

392
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,580
In my opinion,

393
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,380
this sand lotus can be removed.

394
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
It's a good thing.

395
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,380
It's a good thing.

396
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,380
It's a good thing.

397
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,580
The sand lotus can be removed.

398
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,180
Your Majesty.

399
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,380
Prince of Xiao Nan.

400
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,380
I, Cui Shiyi, greet Your Majesty.

401
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,780
Your gift is not as good as what I want,

402
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,780
but it's sincere enough.

403
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,180
Go back and say something for me to your mother.

404
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,580
Nan Xiao is looking forward to seeing Nan Qian.

405
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,180
This heart has never changed.

406
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,780
I will definitely bring it.

407
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,780
The manor of Prince of Nan Chen is full of tigers and dragons.

408
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,580
It's not easy to go.

409
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,580
Your Majesty.

410
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,980
Prince of Xiao Nan is asking for an audience by the river.

411
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,780
Hurry up. Go to the river.

412
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,580
Rencang.

413
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,180
Father, rest assured.

414
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
Someday,

415
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,780
I will lead the troops to the river

416
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,580
to complete father's high ambition of uniting the world.

417
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,580
You are the most sincere, the most sincere.

418
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,780
Wen Er!

419
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,580
Wen Er.

420
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,580
Wen Er, why did you shave your hair?

421
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,580
Come up here.

422
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
Come back with me.

423
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,180
Come back with me to Jingang.

424
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,380
I'm Du Jiang.

425
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,980
I'm here to bring King of the Five-Tailed Prince back to Xizhou.

426
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,780
You are my second son.

427
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,180
Why do you have to sit under a little prince?

428
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,980
Wen Er, don't believe in Chan Yan.

429
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,780
You are my biological son.

430
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,580
You and I not only have hatred for our father's murder,

431
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,580
but also hatred for the destruction of our country.

432
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,980
In this life, only blood and sea will be hatred.

433
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,980
There will be no love between father and son.

434
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,780
Leave!

435
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,380
I said,

436
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,780
whoever dares to touch my son's hair,

437
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,380
I will cut him into pieces and cut him into pieces.

438
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,380
Your Majesty, I think

439
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,780
I think we should ask the second prince to go back first.

440
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,580
You father and son can talk slowly.

441
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,580
There will be a day when everything will be resolved.

442
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,780
No need.

443
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,980
I will wait for you to change your mind.

444
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,780
Your Majesty, are you willing to let King of the Five-Tailed Prince go?

445
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,580
He will go back tomorrow.

446
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,780
Wen Er.

447
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,980
My husband was talking nonsense a few days ago.

448
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,780
He misunderstood you two.

449
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,380
Your Highness and Miss, don't worry.

450
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,380
My husband is used to talking nonsense.

451
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,380
It's fine.

452
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,580
Then I will clean up the next room.

453
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,380
I will let Miss live tonight.

454
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,580
Isn't the room next door full of garbage?

455
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,380
No.

456
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,380
Teacher,

457
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,980
Teacher.

458
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,380
I told you to talk.

459
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
You are so talented.

460
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,780
You guys enjoy your meal.

461
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,580
Teacher, please wipe your hands.

462
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Why did you suddenly change your name to Teacher?

463
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,580
Everyone in the academy knows who you are.

464
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,380
They also know who I am.

465
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,180
They are all scholars. They are the most important.

466
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,180
If I don't call you Teacher, they will gossip behind my back.

467
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,380
Besides, Guo Jiang is coming tomorrow.

468
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,380
I have to change my name when I go back.

469
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,180
Tomorrow is tomorrow. Tonight is tonight.

470
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,580
But it's only a few hours.

471
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,180
Why are you lying to yourself?

472
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,780
Teacher, eat more. You won't be able to eat it when you go back.

473
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,180
I know you like this place.

474
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,780
But we are both from Beichen.

475
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,780
We can't stay in Nanjing.

476
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,380
I understand.

477
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,780
It's all for me. What do you want to eat?

478
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,580
I'm not very hungry.

479
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,380
Since you're not hungry, why don't we go down the mountain?

480
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,180
Why do we go down the mountain?

481
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,780
The crown prince of Nanxiao is very generous. He often plays the zither at noon.

482
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,380
Since you like zither so much, why don't we go down the mountain and see?

483
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,780
Let's go. I'll take you there.

484
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,580
My husband likes to talk nonsense.

485
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,780
He also likes to drink.

486
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,380
Four months later

487
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,380
You are a man. Why are you covering your face?

488
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,180
That's me.

489
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,580
Once I see this object,

490
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,580
I will know that Long Kang Library's Mr. Huan is going down the mountain.

491
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,780
Would that be cool?

492
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,180
I've never seen these in Xizhou.

493
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
I've never been to Xizhou.

494
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
You're not a local?

495
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,180
You don't go to your own place?

496
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,180
It's not my master's fault.

497
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,180
I used to have a lot of inconveniences.

498
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,180
If he takes me out,

499
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,180
he'll offend my uncle and the people in the palace.

500
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Now it's okay.

501
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
I can go anywhere.

502
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
What's the matter?

503
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,180
What's not convenient?

504
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,180
Can't go out.

505
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
I had an appointment with him.

506
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Now?

507
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Now it's gone.

508
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,180
For you?

509
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,180
Not for me.

510
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,180
On the surface, it's not.

511
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
In my heart, it's also me.

512
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
Miss Qiu.

513
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,180
Let's listen to the music first.

514
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
Then we go to the city to sing.

515
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,180
This is our current location.

516
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
Once there is a situation,

517
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,180
we go in from the north.

518
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,180
Remember.

519
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
And here.

520
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Monk.

521
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,180
What are you thinking?

522
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Actually, I'm a little afraid.

523
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Afraid of what?

524
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
I'm afraid that the emperor of Nanxiao will not keep his faith.

525
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
After all, detaining a little boy,

526
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,180
it means detaining our half of the country.

527
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
He won't.

528
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,180
Why?

529
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,180
Although he is suspicious of the people around him,

530
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
he is an emperor who loves the people like his own son.

531
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,180
He doesn't want the people to be caught in the war.

532
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
Detaining Zhou Shengchen is easy.

533
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,180
But the anger of the 700,000 kings.

534
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,180
Who will wipe it out?

535
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,180
So he won't.

536
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
You want to say

537
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
I know him.

538
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Dare not say.

539
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Afraid of you being sad.

540
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Actually, I thought a lot of words to comfort you.

541
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
But I think it's useless.

542
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,180
Or I'll tell you about my father.

543
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
My father

544
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,180
is not much better than your emperor of Nanxiao.

545
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,180
He took away all the medical money of my mother

546
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,180
for the sake of the poison.

547
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
No relative is willing to care about us.

548
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,180
I just watched my mother

549
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,180
die in front of me.

550
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Later,

551
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
I hid a wine jar on the door of my house.

552
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
When he came back,

553
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,180
I smashed him to death.

554
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,180
But I'm afraid

555
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,180
I'm afraid he'll beat me to death after he's recovered.

556
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,180
I'll run away first.

557
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,180
I ran for a long time.

558
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,180
I'm tired and hungry.

559
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
I fell asleep on the roadside.

560
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
After I woke up,

561
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,180
I saw my master and senior sister.

562
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,180
So I followed them.

563
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,180
I followed them to the army.

564
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
I killed the enemy.

565
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
I'm not happy.

566
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,180
Do you still hate him now?

567
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Who?

568
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Your father.

569
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Who still remembers him?

570
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
He doesn't deserve to be hated by me.

571
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
I am now

572
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
General Feng who is a disgrace to the civilization.

573
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
I'm pretending to be the people of Xizhou.

574
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,180
It seems that General Feng

575
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,180
is more open-minded than I am.

576
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
Aren't you monastics

577
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,180
particular about the common people?

578
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Everyone is in their hearts.

579
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,180
What is a southern emperor?

580
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
Yes.

581
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,180
General Feng is right.

582
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Here.

583
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,180
Greetings, Mr. Huan.

584
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
This is Mr. Huan's friend.

585
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Don't be stubborn.

586
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
Are you a couple?

587
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
No.

588
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
Is that girl

589
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,180
married?

590
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
No.

591
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,180
I'm Hou Mochen.

592
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,180
I've been single for a month.

593
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Mr. Hou Mochen, nice to meet you.

594
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
My name is

595
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
Shuoxin Cui.

596
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Will you reveal your identity?

597
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
This girl

598
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,180
comes from the mansion of the southern emperor of Xizhou.

599
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
Is it the mansion of the little southern emperor?

600
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,180
Yes.

601
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
Nice to meet you.

602
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,180
Nice to meet you, too.

603
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
I have plum wine.

604
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
It's a rare one.

605
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
I wonder if you are lucky

606
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
to have a drink with me.

607
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Since you have plum wine,

608
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
why don't you share it

609
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,180
with everyone here?

610
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,180
Yes, Mr. Hou Mochen.

611
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
Plum wine is poisonous and wasteful.

612
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
It's more important to drink it.

613
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,180
Yes, Mr. Hou Mochen.

614
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Don't hide it.

615
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
Share it with us.

616
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,180
Yes.

617
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,180
Okay.

618
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,180
I'll share it with you.

619
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,180
You guys are so greedy.

620
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Thank you.

621
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Aren't you afraid of revealing your identity?

622
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
I'll leave tomorrow.

623
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
It's okay.

624
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
I wonder if your disciples

625
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,180
are all so cautious.

626
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,180
Yes.

627
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Today is the first day of the lunar calendar.

628
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,180
The year is the ninth spring.

629
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
Since we parted,

630
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,180
when did we not miss each other?

631
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
Since we parted,

632
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,180
when did we not miss each other?

633
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,180
This is the southern name.

634
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,180
Qin Shi likes it.

635
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
He often comes here.

636
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,180
But don't listen to him.

637
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
Why?

638
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,180
Ask him.

639
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
He came here before

640
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
and asked me the same question.

641
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,180
The song of the purple moon is called

642
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,180
the purple moon is called the purple moon.

643
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
The woman who wrote the poem is called the purple moon.

644
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Huan Yue,

645
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,180
let Qin Shi change a elegant song.

646
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
The purple moon is called the purple moon.

647
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,180
Is there anything wrong?

648
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,180
The business is good.

649
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,180
The weather has changed.

650
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
There are many guests.

651
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,180
Mr. Huan.

652
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
Mr. Huan.

653
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
Mr. Huan.

654
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
Go ahead.

655
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,180
I called a carriage.

656
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,180
I'll wait for you in front.

657
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
Mr. Huan,

658
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
aren't you coming with us?

659
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,180
Me?

660
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,180
I'm afraid of water.

661
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,180
Afraid of water?

662
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,180
Sit.

663
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,180
I'll wait for you at the gate.

664
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
Come on.

665
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Slow down.

666
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,180
Mr. Huan.

667
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,180
You like to eat porridge the most.

668
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,180
Why don't you go today?

669
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,180
Today,

670
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,180
I don't want to kill the scenery.

671
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
Today is the ninth day of September.

672
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Yes.

673
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,180
The ninth day of September should be high.

674
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,180
Why are we back to the ship?

675
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
When we return to the mountain at night,

676
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,180
we will be high.

677
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,180
That's right.

678
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Sorry.

679
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
I was out of line.

680
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Sit tight.

681
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Why don't you like Wu Ge?

682
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,180
You are not allowed to sing and dance.

683
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
Why?

684
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
I'll go see the scenery.

685
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
If you are stubborn,

686
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,180
you can't be hurt.

687
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,180
I'm trying to protect you.

688
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Mr. Huan,

689
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,180
the ship in front of us

690
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
is quite famous.

691
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
It often stops here.

692
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Usually,

693
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
the ladies in the city

694
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
all come here to have fun.

695
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
May I ask,

696
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,180
is the man on the ship

697
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,180
a foreigner?

698
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
Yes.

699
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
He is a distinguished guest of Longkang Academy.

700
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
Please come up.

701
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
My lady said

702
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,180
the distinguished guest of Longkang Academy

703
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,180
is a distinguished guest of Jiangling.

704
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
If you don't mind,

705
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
please come to the ship.

706
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,180
Today is the ninth day of September.

707
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
Let's have a good wine together.

708
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Thank you for your kindness.

709
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
No need.

710
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
Aren't we going to see the scenery?

711
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,180
Let's go together.

712
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
Little lady,

713
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,180
if you go for a walk at night,

714
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,180
your young master

715
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
will be dragged on the boat to drink.

716
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,180
What is a Juxiang wine?

717
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,180
The southern saying is

718
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
Juhua wine.

719
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
Chunfu.

720
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,180
Sir.

721
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Where can I buy

722
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,180
authentic Juhua wine?

723
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,180
Not far from here.

724
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,180
I'll just give you

725
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
a bottle of wine.

726
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Two bottles of Juhua wine.

727
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,180
Here, your wine.

728
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,180
OK.

729
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
One more.

730
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
Thank you.

731
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,180
Take care.

732
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Have a taste.

733
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,180
Miss.

734
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,180
Buy a fish tank.

735
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
Choose one.

736
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
The one with the secret shoes.

737
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,180
Yes, the secret shoes.

738
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
Look.

739
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
You pick one too.

740
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
This is worn by the girl's family.

741
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
She can't wear it.

742
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
What secret shoes does she use?

743
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,180
Drink Juhua wine.

744
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
We want this.

745
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
No, no, no.

746
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
Three coins.

747
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Only three coins.

748
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,180
We came from the north.

749
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
There is no money here.

750
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,180
Only this.

751
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,180
No.

752
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,180
Too much.

753
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Too much.

754
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
Just take it.

755
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
After taking it,

756
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,180
you can go back to celebrate the festival.

757
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,180
Thank you.

758
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,180
Thank you.

759
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Master, drink more.

760
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,180
Grandma said

761
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,180
the shoes with the secret shoes.

762
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
Do you want more?

763
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
Yes.

764
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Drink mine first.

765
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
What about you?

766
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
I'll buy it now.

767
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
OK.

768
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
It's a good wine.

769
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,180
No matter how much you drink,

770
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,180
it's not too much.

771
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,180
I'll go to the garden.

772
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,180
OK.

773
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,180
The girl drank Jixiang wine.

774
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
Can you smell it?

775
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,180
Is it bad?

776
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
No.

777
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
Juhua wine smells good.

778
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
His Royal Highness said

779
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
he would come back later.

780
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
I made this tea for you.

781
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
You can have it.

782
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
Thank you.

783
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
You're welcome.

784
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
Wait.

785
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
Have you heard the song of the purple leaf?

786
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
The song of the purple leaf?

787
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
Yes.

788
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,180
How can I take you to listen to that?

789
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
Is there anything wrong?

790
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
It's OK.

791
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,180
But there is something wrong.

792
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,180
There is something like

793
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,180
a couple of people

794
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
who are together in the house,

795
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,180
and they are in the same room.

796
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,180
It's not suitable for you to listen to that.

797
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,180
I'll go to work now.

798
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,180
Take your time.

799
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
A couple of people

800
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,180
are in the same room.

801
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,180
How can it be?

802
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
Miss, there is an outsider asking to see you.

803
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
He wants to see you.

804
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
I'm Chen Yue.

805
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,180
I don't know your identity.

806
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,180
I'm sorry for the trouble.

807
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
I'm here to apologize.

808
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,180
You didn't do anything wrong.

809
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Why do you apologize?

810
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
I don't know your background.

811
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
I was having dinner just now.

812
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,180
The elders in the family talked about it.

813
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Cui Shrek gave Nan Xiao eight hundred books.

814
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,180
I just found out who you are.

815
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,180
Who are you?

816
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,180
It doesn't matter who I am.

817
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,180
You don't have to apologize for this.

818
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
Hou Mo Chen Yue,

819
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,180
of course you have to apologize.

820
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
You don't just have to apologize.

821
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
You should thank me for stopping you.

822
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,180
Otherwise, you will be punished

823
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
for harassing this girl.

824
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
Not only Nan Xiao, he will find you trouble.

825
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,180
Even his master,

826
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,180
King Nan Chen,

827
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
can't spare you.

828
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Thank you for your previous point.

829
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
All right.

830
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Cui is not a person who can be bothered.

831
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
You can go down the mountain without worry.

832
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
What?

833
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,180
You still have something to say?

834
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
Hou Mo Chen Yue knows that

835
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,180
he can't win over you.

836
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,180
But he still wants to ask you.

837
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
Do you have a match?

838
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,180
You still don't give up?

839
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,180
You ask this question

840
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
because my surname is Cui.

841
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
You want me to tell the truth,

842
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
but you also want to give me the truth.

843
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,180
Yes.

844
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,180
Hou Mo Chen also has a family with a reputation.

845
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
If you want to marry Cui,

846
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,180
Hou Mo Chen Yue,

847
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,180
I advise you to wake up.

848
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,180
Miss Cui is the daughter of the owner of the house.

849
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,180
The Yao family is also the first choice of the six houses.

850
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,180
The royal family of Liu Xin and the Beichen family are the second.

851
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,180
This matter is still a mystery.

852
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,180
This matter is not your turn.

853
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,180
I asked Miss Cui.

854
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,180
Whether or not,

855
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,180
please let me give up.

856
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,180
I don't have a marriage contract.

857
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,180
But I...

858
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,180
I have one heart.

859
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,180
I have one heart for her.

860
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,180
I have one heart for her.

861
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,180

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
I have one heart for her.

00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,180
I have one heart for her.

864
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,180
I have one heart for her.

00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,180
I have one heart for her.

866
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,180
I have one heart for her.

867
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,180
I have one heart for her.

868
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,180
I have one heart for her.

869
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,180
I have one heart for her.

870
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,180
I have one heart for her.

871
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,180
I have one heart for her.

872
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,180
I have one heart for her.

873
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,180
I have one heart for her.

874
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,180
I have one heart for her.

875
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,180
I have one heart for her.

876
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,180
I have one heart for her.

877
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,180
I have one heart for her.

878
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,180
I have one heart for her.

879
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,180
I have one heart for her.

880
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,180
I have one heart for her.

881
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,180
I have one heart for her.

882
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
I have one heart for her.

883
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,180
I have one heart for her.

884
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,180
I have one heart for her.

885
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,180
I have one heart for her.

886
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,180
I have one heart for her.

887
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,180
I have one heart for her.

888
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,180
I have one heart for her.

889
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
