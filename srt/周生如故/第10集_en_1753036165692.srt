1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The End

60
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's so pitiful

61
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to let your father go on his own.

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If it's for me,

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
it's going to snow.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The End

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And these.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you going to empty the academy?

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Brother Qi and Brother Jiu said

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
no one reads these books.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't take them away.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't think these are enough.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The End

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Why are you

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
in such a good mood today?

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My junior sister is praying.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She's about to leave for Xizhou.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Master just got a letter.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It turns out that the beloved disciple is back.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you going to take all the books

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
my father hid away?

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Brother Qi.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Brother Qi.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There's a move in Nanxiao.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have to go back to Shouyang in advance.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can't send you back to Xizhou.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
General Cui will send me.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll be fine.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Tell His Highness that

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll be waiting for him in Shouyang.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Take care.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He seems to have lost a lot of weight.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He looks

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
in a bad mood.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The servants in their yard said

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the princess is always making trouble

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
forcing the prince to marry

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the two sisters from the seven cities.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why do you

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
force your brother to take the money?

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Empress Dowager has ordered

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the princess to give birth to

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the descendants of the seven cities and the Cui family as soon as possible.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The princess doesn't seem to want to

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
give birth to the descendants of the seven cities and the Cui family.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She's afraid that

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the prince will be too old

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to take care of her.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The princess doesn't seem to want to give birth to the descendants of the seven cities and the Cui family.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So she came up with this

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
way to give birth to the descendants of the seven cities and the Cui family.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How many cars are you going to load?

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're going to drive all the way out.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You don't know?

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You think I'm going to send a leave?

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Load the car.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm afraid it's too late tomorrow.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can't be late for a while.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You'll be back to the temple.

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Shiyi left.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This yard is empty.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why didn't you leave her?

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
At her age,

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
something should have happened.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Where is the way back to Xizhou?

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If possible,

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I hope she doesn't look like me.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Or like Feng'er.

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Since her engagement with the royal family was canceled,

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the wedding in the dance house has not stopped.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How can I avoid going back to Xizhou?

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Master.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Liu Changshan.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Liu Changshan.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The last time we met,

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
we met at Taiji Hall.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm not willing to give it to you.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll give it to you.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I won't kill you.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Only His Majesty can kill you.

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What are you looking for?

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm thinking

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the ancestors have spirits in heaven.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Seeing the descendants killing each other,

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
what would it be like?

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's tiring to be a judge and a soldier.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Your Highness, you'd better think about

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
whether it will rain these days.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What if it rains?

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What if it doesn't rain?

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If it rains,

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
the march will be slow.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Your Highness will see the Cui family's mistress later.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If it doesn't rain,

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
you'll see her earlier.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I had a house before I married.

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I had a wife and a daughter.

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Although you can hide it from me,

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you can't hide it from me.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What are you talking about?

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's so mysterious.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Lord Fengyang is recalling

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
his past.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Miss.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Give them some food.

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I've prepared it.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Get in the carriage first.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll leave some food.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We must get to Qianlong Temple before dark.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Otherwise, it's dangerous.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Thank you.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Thank you.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's Wang Qi.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Miss Cui.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Miss Cui.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
General Gan,

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
how's my master's battle with the judges?

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's going well.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's going well.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's going well.

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's going well.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Look.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
These are the treasures

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that the thief hid.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll move them back.

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Our army has already driven back.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
All the generals are in a hurry to see you.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Bring water to the soldiers.

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes.

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, no.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I have to go back to Xizhou.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
General, you've worked hard.

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hurry up.

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Miss, stop looking.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The day after tomorrow, when we arrive in Xizhou,

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the city will be full of Wang Qi.

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Last time I came here,

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
it was still a waste of time.

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's go.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Everyone,

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
we are from the Prince of Nanchen's mansion.

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We passed by this place today.

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We want to stay here for a night.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Miss,

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
this place

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
was originally built by the Prince of Nanchen.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can live here if you want.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not going to stay here.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm going to stay here.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm going to stay here.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm going to stay here.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But this place is much simpler than the one in Xizhou.

213
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It doesn't matter.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Go and give them some of our food.

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yes.

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Come with me.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I wonder if Master has ever been here.

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm asking the Buddha to bless Master with a good luck.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I hope to see him soon.

221
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Qiu Jianquan!

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Qiu Jianquan!

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Qiu Jianquan!

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Qiu Jianquan!

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Qiu Jianquan!

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Qiu Jianquan!

227
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Qiu Jianquan!

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Qiu Jianquan!

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Qiu Jianquan!

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Qiu Jianquan!

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Qiu Jianquan!

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm here to see Miss Cui!

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Stop!

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Miss Cui!

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm here to see Miss Cui!

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Take her down!

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Wait!

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm here to see Miss Cui!

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Who are you?

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why do you want to see me?

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're Miss Cui from the Prince of Nanchen?

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The city of Yong is being attacked.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm here to see Miss Cui!

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why didn't you send the letter of the imperial edict to the Prince of Nanchen?

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I did.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I did everything.

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The governor of Yong wrote nine high-level letters last night.

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He ordered me to wait for nine people to be sent to all places.

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I went to see the Prince of North Sea.

251
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What did the Prince of North Sea say?

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He asked me to have tea, but he didn't dare to send troops.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He also said that it wasn't that he didn't want to save them,

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but that he was in such a mess.

255
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's the most dangerous thing to keep his own land.

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Other than the Prince of North Sea,

257
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
won't he save the other prince?

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The nine people I went to see,

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
only the Prince of Nanchen and the Prince of Pingqin were not in the land.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The other prince was not saved.

261
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I saw thousands of soldiers under the mountain.

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It was Cui's carriage.

263
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I guessed that the girl was here, so I broke in.

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Miss Jiu, save the city of Yong!

265
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Cui Sheng.

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Miss, we only have three thousand miles.

267
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The army of Yong is less than two thousand.

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We can't go back.

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Miss Jiu,

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the army of Yong is less than two thousand.

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There are tens of thousands of people in the city.

272
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Even if there are only three hundred soldiers,

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
we can't abandon the people and our comrades.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Go to Yong immediately.

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes, Miss.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll go and get you a horse.

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, you don't go.

278
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How can I not follow you?

279
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You keep the book in the temple,

280
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and pick a horse to go back to Xizhou by yourself.

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Wait for my master to come back.

282
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Tell him that I'll wait for him in Yong.

283
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's go.

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Go.

285
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The army of Yong has retreated.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Miss, why are you here?

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Go to the city quickly.

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Miss, why are you here?

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You don't know how to fight.

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I met General Yang and came to support.

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Look, I can't even stretch my arms and legs.

292
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The enemy's reinforcements are already five miles away.

293
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Do you want to hurt our girl?

294
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I've never fought,

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
but the soldiers who escorted me are all in good spirits.

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's not talk about this first.

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
General Gan, how did you come?

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why did the enemy retreat?

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That must be me who retreated.

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I got the news and dared to come.

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The South City Imperial Army is defeated.

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Who is such a stupid scholar?

303
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You train soldiers on a regular basis.

304
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
How come you fall down as soon as you fight?

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
General, why don't you ask?

306
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
How many soldiers did we take down

307
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
when we were imprisoned?

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You are the people.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We are not white rice.

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't be busy fighting.

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Where is the commander of Yongzhou?

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Li Zixun has succeeded.

313
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's look at the city defense first.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is not Xizhou.

315
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We are not familiar with it.

316
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's go to the city wall first.

317
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Miss, do you know the city defense in Xizhou?

318
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Xizhou is my home. Of course I know.

319
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This city defense is too long.

320
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Call all the archers.

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes.

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Prepare the scout car.

323
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What do you mean?

324
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Head to the top.

325
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I dare not.

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
They are coming.

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Archers, prepare.

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Go.

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Miss, you should go to the city wall.

330
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's too dangerous here.

331
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Miss, please go to the city wall to hide.

332
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Light the fire.

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Fire.

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Come on.

335
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Go.

336
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Master, Senior Brother.

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
No need.

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't need it either.

339
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm going to the city wall.

340
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm going to the city wall.

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm going to the city wall.

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You can't drink too much.

343
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Here, have some.

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Have you ever tried to marry?

345
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You mean the princess?

346
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Beauty.

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There are many princesses in the past.

348
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There are many princesses in the past.

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There are some.

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What will they do after you get married?

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They will disband.

352
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Emotionless.

353
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Master.

354
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Master, the city wall is surrounded.

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
General Yi He and General Gan took the reinforcements.

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Who did you say?

357
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's Junior Sister, Master.

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Master, I'm taking the reinforcements.

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Get yourself ready.

360
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm taking the reinforcements.

362
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll go to the city wall to cut the enemy's rear.

363
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Feng Qia, take the reinforcements.

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yes, sir.

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,980
Lord Liu,

366
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,020
we had to pull the trigger這一切.

367
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,860
Lord Zhu was given the chance

368
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,020
to stay alive for a few years,

369
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,700
this is the only time

370
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,000
we can expect our necessary force

371
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,740
to attack the guard,

372
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,100
let's have a try with late Little Zhu.

373
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,060
Yes.

374
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,440
Let's see.

375
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,220
Sorry, Lord Zhu.

376
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,880
Lord Zhu

377
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,620
is gonna stay alive.

378
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,300
With Lord Liu after his death.

379
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,100
Lord Zhu

380
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
No

381
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,540
ît must always be safety

382
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,500
Yes

383
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,260
In my opinion

384
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,700
Even if it was kind,

385
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:15,940
Please don't quero

386
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,140
alongside ten- tasked soldiers as a team.

387
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:35,100
At least Nua

388
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,420
is a good player.

389
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Master Ifum!

390
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,020
General, the enemy is coming.

391
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,740
Who dares to attack the Imperial College?

392
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
Let's retreat first.

393
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Third Senior Brother!

394
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
General Yang, open the gate quickly!

395
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
Open the gate!

396
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,820
The enemy is charging!

397
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,020
We can't hold them back!

398
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
Open the gate!

399
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
Open the gate!

400
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Open the gate!

401
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
Open the gate!

402
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
Open the gate!

403
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
Open the gate!

404
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
Open the gate!

405
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
Open the gate!

406
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,020
We can't hold them back!

407
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,020
Miss, there are no soldiers and horses in the city.

408
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,020
We can't open the gate.

409
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Do you want me to watch my senior brother die?

410
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,020
General, the enemy is coming!

411
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
My legs are broken.

412
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
Hurry and leave!

413
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,020
Leave!

414
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,020
If you want to die, you have to die together!

415
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
You...

416
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
General Gan!

417
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
General Gan!

418
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
It's Xifeng!

419
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
General Gan!

420
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
General Gan!

421
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,020
General Gan!

422
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Go kill the enemy!

423
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
Retreat!

424
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Retreat!

425
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
Xie Yun.

426
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:18,020
I've been waiting for this life for a lifetime to go to the bottom alone.

427
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Finally, you have seen the scenery and the scenery.

428
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:34,020
I will stay here and watch you from afar.

429
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,020
I'm sorry, General Gan.

430
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
You've done very well.

431
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
I was late.

432
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,020
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Thank you, Brother Gan.

434
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,020
For saving my life.

435
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
Old Brother.

436
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
I'm sorry.

437
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
I'm sorry.

438
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
I'm sorry.

439
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
I'm sorry.

440
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
I'm sorry.

441
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Thank you for saving Yong City.

442
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
How long have we not seen each other?

443
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020
A year and seven months.

444
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,020
This year and a half, the King's army has captured 13 cities in the north.

445
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,020
According to the old habits, the seal of the general's seal was given to you.

446
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
I haven't experienced the capture of the city in the past.

447
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,020
I took the collection of general's seal as a death.

448
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
I've been waiting for this day.

449
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Today, I know how my master has been these years.

450
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
Master.

451
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
This general wants to see you.

452
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
I pay my respects to the king.

453
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Have the people in the city settled?

454
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
All settled.

455
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,020
I will return to Xizhou tomorrow.

456
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,020
I will leave 20,000 soldiers to help you defend the city.

457
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,020
I will leave tomorrow.

458
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,020
You are a general who guards the city.

459
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,020
Why do you have to go?

460
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,020
Are you worried about the city or about my departure?

461
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Both.

462
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,020
The city has the king's army.

463
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,020
There will be no difference.

464
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
And I...

465
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
I don't want to guard the city for Beichen anymore.

467
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
Miss Cui.

468
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,020
In the future, Yang Shao owes you one life.

469
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
I hope you will take care of yourself.

470
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
What does he mean?

471
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
The governor's order was successful.

472
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,020
He is the only one who survived the nine people who went to save the people.

473
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
Why did he survive alone?

474
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Because our junior sister helped him and saved him.

475
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,020
Since ancient times, heroes save beautiful women.

476
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,020
Beautiful women make promises with their bodies.

477
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,020
Now, I'm afraid that people like our junior sister.

478
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
Don't talk nonsense.

479
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
I'll go see Xie.

480
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
Send someone to watch this Yang Shao.

481
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
Follow this Yang Shao.

482
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,020
See who he will rely on after he passes.

483
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,020
Yes, master.

484
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Why is the master so defensive?

485
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
Master has his own reason.

486
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,020
You asked me to explain the military strategy of Jiangshui and Yinan.

487
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,020
But I said for a long time, you didn't listen to a word.

488
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
How do you know I didn't listen to it?

489
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,020
I haven't seen anything in Hong Chen.

490
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
No need to guess.

491
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,020
Although the crown prince is looking at this sand plate,

492
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,020
what he is thinking is...

493
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
Your Royal Highness.

494
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,020
How is Xie Yun?

495
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,020
General Xie...

496
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,020
General Xie...

497
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Say it.

498
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,020
I'm afraid I can never ride the horse again.

499
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
I can escape from death every time.

500
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
I'm lucky.

501
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Junior sister.

502
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
Are you praising me or hurting me?

503
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,020
I'm a real knife and real gun.

504
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,020
I've never been a deserter.

505
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,020
When you say that,

506
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,020
it's like I'm only good at escaping.

507
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Let me see your wound.

508
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,020
Are you crazy?

509
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,020
Am I your senior or your enemy?

510
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
I'm not worried.

511
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
I'm just worried about you.

512
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
I'm worried about you.

513
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
I'm worried about you.

514
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
I'm worried about you.

515
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
I'm worried about you.

516
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
I'm worried about you.

517
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
It's so painful.

518
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,020
Junior sister.

519
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Junior sister, quickly.

520
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
Get your senior sister out of here.

521
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Have you eaten noodles?

522
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Look.

523
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
This is the real junior sister.

524
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
I'll ask the monk

525
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
if there's any good medicine for you.

526
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,020
He is a prince.

527
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
Maybe there's some medicine

528
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
that we don't have here.

529
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
No need.

530
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
We have good medicine here.

531
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
Don't bother him.

532
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
Here.

533
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,020
Why do you all believe

534
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,020
in this monk?

535
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,020
I think he's a poor man

536
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,020
who is a spy in the army.

537
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
Even master believes in him.

538
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
I believe in him too.

539
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,020
Why do you all believe in

540
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,020
a southern enemy?

541
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
Does it hurt?

542
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,020
I can't bear this kind of pain.

543
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
How can I be your senior brother?

544
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Senior brother.

545
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,020
Do you blame me?

546
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Blame for what?

547
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,020
I didn't open the gate for you.

548
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
Fortunately, you didn't open it.

549
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
You're so kind.

550
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
I'm so sorry.

551
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Fortunately, you didn't open it.

552
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,020
Although you're a military man,

553
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
you don't know how to take the city.

554
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,020
The city gate is the door of life and death.

555
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Once the enemy re-opens it,

556
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
the city

557
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
will be completely blocked.

558
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,020
Xie Yun is right.

559
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
You go out first.

560
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
I'll talk to him.

561
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,020
Why are you standing here?

562
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
Master and senior brother talked to me.

563
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,020
Let me out.

564
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
What do they have to avoid you?

565
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
I don't know.

566
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
Master.

567
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,020
You go in.

568
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
I don't know.

569
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
I don't know.

570
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
I don't know.

571
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
I don't know.

572
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
I don't know.

573
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,020
Let's go.

574
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
Senior sister.

575
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
Senior sister, you go in first.

576
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
I'll go see master.

577
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
You offended master.

578
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
I brought the wound back.

579
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
The monk said it was of little use.

580
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,020
You hurt the bone.

581
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,020
This is more effective on the skin.

582
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,020
Senior brother.

583
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,020
You don't like the monk.

584
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,020
I don't mention it.

585
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,020
You like him.

586
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
I...

587
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,020
I'm just kidding.

588
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
Don't mind.

589
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,020
Senior brother.

590
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,020
When I encounter something,

591
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
I feel sad.

592
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,020
You...

593
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,020
You...

594
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
What's wrong with master?

595
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Nothing.

596
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
I just want to come and see.

597
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,020
I just suddenly thought that

598
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,020
everyone has been following me to the east and west for so many years.

599
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,020
It's been hard on you.

600
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
Teacher didn't tell the truth.

601
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,020
I let the military down.

602
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,020
I let him down.

603
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,020
I didn't take good care of you.

604
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,020
I'll be the guard tonight.

605
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
You go back to the Prefectural Office first.

606
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,020
Yes.

607
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
You're not much older than your teacher.

608
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
But as long as you're called a teacher,

609
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,020
you have to take the responsibility of being a father.

610
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,020
General Xie is like this.

611
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,020
He is self-contained.

612
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
General Xie.

613
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,020
General Xie.

614
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
General Xie.

615
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,020
General Xie.

616
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,020
General Xie.

617
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,020
General Xie.

618
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
General Xie.

619
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
General Xie.

620
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
General Xie.

621
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,020
General Xie.

622
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,020
General Xie.

623
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
General Xie.

624
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,020
General Xie.

625
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
General Xie.

626
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
General Xie.

627
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
My teacher is still half of the night off.

628
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Maybe he has used breakfast.

629
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
General Hong.

630
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,020
Teacher.

631
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
What's the matter?

632
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,520
This is the shop where the footbox was discovered by others.

633
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,180
Do you think in this live,

634
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,520
what will happen to Tianci clicker,

635
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,020
will it be damaged?

636
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,520
I just wish this gentle feel

637
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,740
could be decreased.

638
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,060
The food that has appeared

639
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,480
Candy Convention

640
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,880
Thanks.

641
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
You should cook something she likes.

642
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
Yes, Teacher.

643
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Teacher has been looking for three days.

644
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Senior Brother hasn't seen anyone for three days.

645
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Yang Shao, what are you doing?

646
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Don't move!

647
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Yang Shao, let go of my senior sister.

648
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Shui Ban, don't come over.

649
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,880
I only have one request.

650
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Give me Liu Changshan.

651
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,880
What do you want him for?

652
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
No need to ask. Bring him to me.

653
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Go and bring him here.

654
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Yes.

655
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Don't come over.

656
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Yang Shao, if I knew you were so heartless,

657
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
I would never help you.

658
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Miss Cui,

659
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
I have my reasons to stop him.

660
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
Don't move!

661
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
You don't have to force him.

662
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,880
He won't hurt you.

663
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
General Yang, you came to save me?

664
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Stop talking nonsense. Come with me.

665
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
Prepare a carriage outside the city.

666
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Prepare the carriage.

667
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Miss, please forgive me.

668
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
You didn't do anything wrong. You should be more careful.

669
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Let's go.

670
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,880
General Yang.

671
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,880
The shadow is wandering, the boat is floating

672
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,880
It's waiting

673
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Who is the dream for?

674
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,880
The heart is a stage

675
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,880
I can't love, my heart is burning

676
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Reliable

677
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,880
The pain is burning outside

678
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,880
The bitter sea is in my hands

679
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,880
I can't help but think of you

680
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,880
The love that makes me feel painful

681
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
The rivers and rivers are flowing

682
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
The sword is like a horse

683
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,880
The snake is like a snake

684
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,720
The story is like a

685
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Snow is falling

686
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:24,720
The love is floating with the wind

687
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,720
I can't help but think of you

688
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,720
The love that makes me feel painful

689
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,720
The rivers and rivers are flowing

690
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,720
The sword is like a horse

691
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,720
The snake is like a snake

692
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,720
The story is like a

693
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,720
Snow is falling

694
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,720
The story is like a

695
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,720
Snow is falling

696
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,720
The snow is falling

697
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,720
The story is like a

698
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,720
Snow is falling
