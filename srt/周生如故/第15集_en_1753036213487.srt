1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Love by Hypnotic

60
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 38

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm here to say goodbye to you, your highness.

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I've ordered people to prepare you a carriage.

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
General Zhou and General Feng will send you to Yong City in person.

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't rush.

65
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,600
This time, Lord Fengyang...

66
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll go out first.

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Your Highness,

68
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
I want to see the child of Gao family.

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Who told you?

70
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
It's Lord Pingqing.

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There's a child

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
who comforted me one day

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and told me about this.

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I never told anyone about this.

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I just want to see the child.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He's the smartest one in the mansion.

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Once you go,

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
he'll find out something strange.

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I've seen all of your disciples

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
in Zhongzhou.

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Can you tell me which one?

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm entrusted by my friend.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I won't tell anyone about his identity.

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm grateful for your help.

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Your Highness,

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you've been avoiding me for two days.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Is it for him?

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's for him.

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's also for Yi.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why are you outside the building?

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm saying goodbye.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Goodbye.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
After this farewell,

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Huaiyang will let go of his obsession

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and be the princess consort of Lord Pingqing.

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Your Highness,

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
take care.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're going to guard the Court of Lu?

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
For the past few months,

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
my master has been thinking about how to settle me.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I might as well choose by myself.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Where is the Court of Lu?

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Court of Lu is in the northern city.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's where the King's army guards the border.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Third Brother.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You've come to see me?

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why didn't you stay in Xizhou?

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Everyone has their own reasons.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But it's not like Xizhou.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There are often foreign enemies.

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's too dangerous there.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm a general.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I was born to fight against the enemy.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's the past.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm a general.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm a general.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm a general.

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm a general.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Third Brother, can you not force yourself?

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can't.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Give me a fair face.

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not your future husband.

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A fair face is useless.

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're talking about him.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You know I can't persuade you.

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a waste of time to waste time here.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why don't you pack up and send me off?

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There are many more places here than Xizhou.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You've been out of the mountain.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can you handle it?

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't worry, Master.

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can handle it.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll go.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Your Highness.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't stand on ceremony.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
General Xie, this is...

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I've lost one leg.

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There's one more leg I can use.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you afraid that a general with only one leg

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
can't defend the border?

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And me.

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll stay by your side.

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, Zhao Qianjie.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why do I remember that you were brought out by me?

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
When did you come with my junior?

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Today.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
After I saw this Great Wall,

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I decided to stay here.

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is not Xizhou.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Are you sure you won't regret it?

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I won't regret it.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
General Xie is much more interesting than you.

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I won't regret staying here today.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Look.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What is this?

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is called celebrating the old.

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,780
You really want to stay in the

160
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,000
Luyuan and follow General Xie?

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have no lie.

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Then I'll entrust General Xie to you.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll obey your command.

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Master, you say it the other way around.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He follows me.

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I should take care of him.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why did you entrust me to him?

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a bow for cavalry.

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
There is no such thing in the palace.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The bow and arrow of cavalry and infantry are different.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Usually, the bow and arrow of infantry is more powerful.

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The bow and arrow of cavalry is lighter.

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The feather on the sword is not carved, but is made of eagle.

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Master got every one since childhood.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is eagle's.

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Is there any eagle's?

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Of course.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No one dares to touch it.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Give it to me.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Master got a eagle ten years ago.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's very rare.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
There is no dust on the feather.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Master has been kept by someone since he got it.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's not easy to make a sword.

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Three white fish can make a sword.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This box can be used as a stone.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You don't have to kill the enemy.

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Give it to me.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's useless to put it in vain.

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's better to make a sword for you.

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Just take it as your birthday gift next year.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Master finally doesn't deny it.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
When did I deny it?

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Every year, I give you a neck?

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not more lazy than you.

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That is the proof of the blood battle of the king for many years.

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Every year, my favorite is this gift.

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't say that you don't feel sorry for me.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is made by General Feng.

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's far away from here.

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Your leg is injured.

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you wear it in winter, you can prevent injury.

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
My leg is worth it.

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You are so considerate.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't talk nonsense.

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Although the doctor said you can't ride the horse,

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I believe you will come back to us one day.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You will come back to the army.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I will take this time as your business.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You, don't be lazy.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, I will remember your teaching.

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When I'm not here, you should be more careful.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't make trouble again.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I...

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If someone goes to your master to report, no one will help you.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Is that my fault?

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That lady is not good.

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I helped her, but she complained to my master.

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's common to quarrel between husband and wife.

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can't cut her three fingers because of the man pointing at the woman's nose.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You hit her without knowing the truth.

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Who is the one who is injured?

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Master also said I was a seven-day-old.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sick.

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You just don't have memory.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think you should be punished more severely.

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I won't make any mistake next time.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If I make any mistake, I will be punished.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't lead the army and guard the border with you.

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I hope you make mistakes earlier.

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What did you say?

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I said I would be a talent.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Of course.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Master doesn't want to punish me severely.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you want to see? I'll get you a glass of water.

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Brother.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Brother.

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Brother.

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Your Majesty.

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Lie down.

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why are you so cold?

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm cold.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
My father is sick.

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You are sick too.

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There's nothing that can make me happy.

250
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're pregnant.

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Aren't you happy?

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Once I give birth,

253
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I will be urged by my mother to give birth to a prince.

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I should consider for my children.

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Your Majesty has your own bloodline.

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You should give birth to your own children.

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's reasonable.

258
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But the position of the crown prince

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
should be yours.

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I've been asking and not being asked.

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If one day,

262
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Your Majesty has to kill me,

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
will you let me go?

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Why should I kill you?

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If the court officials think

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that only by killing me

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
can the crown prince of Your Majesty

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
succeed in the throne,

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
will you take action?

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No.

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I definitely won't.

272
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I hope that Concubine Jiang

274
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
can bring a prince for Your Majesty.

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I will do the same.

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I will never hurt you.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Brother.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Your Majesty.

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Prince Guang Ling.

280
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let's go and see the Grand Tutor.

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You haven't seen Prince Guang Ling for years.

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's have a good talk.

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm going to be the father.

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're going to be a father, too.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's a good thing to think about.

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Your Highness.

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The Royal Mother didn't let me in the palace.

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If the Emperor didn't

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
summon General Cui for an emergency,

291
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know when I'd want to see you.

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You're going to be a mother?

293
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's fake.

294
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
For the sake of Tyrant Shuang's excuse.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
You're the princess.

296
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,440
You dare to lie about your pregnancy?

297
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
If I don't lie, how can I get back?

298
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,800
What's the reason for your illness?

299
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,200
Did I force you to leave the palace?

300
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Life is a good excuse,

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
but it won't last long.

302
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,520
It's true.

303
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,400
The doctor said...

304
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,400
It's worth three years.

305
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,000
What three years?

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
Three more years.

307
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Impossible!

308
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
But there are a few doctors. We don't need to trust them.

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Let's find another doctor to check on them.

310
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
It's enough.

311
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
It's enough.

312
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
The medicine is enough.

313
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,600
It should belong to me.

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
Come back this time.

315
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,400
Don't go back to Shouyang.

316
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Why?

317
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm going to order you to be the governor of Taiyuan County.

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,200
How can I be the governor of Taiyuan County?

319
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
Don't!

320
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
I'm not a bandit.

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,400
I'm a fire pit.

322
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
In the past two years,

323
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:07,720
Jingyong has been collecting the gifts of the

324
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
royal court and selling horses everywhere.

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,400
After this incident,

326
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,600
the throne has been in fear.

327
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,200
Those who are capable are not loyal enough.

328
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Those who are loyal are not capable of suppressing Jingyong.

329
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,800
Did the Grand Tutor tell you about this?

330
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,600
I...

331
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,600
The crown prince has already transferred 200,000 troops

332
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,800
to guard him in the Taiyuan County.

333
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,000
But the Taiyuan County is too close to Zhongzhou.

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If I'm wrong,

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
I'll send you the news in time.

336
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,800
It's too late to demand the Western Zhou.

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I couldn't find a suitable candidate

338
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
until you came back.

339
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
Cui Feng,

340
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,200
only your ability and loyalty

341
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,800
can make Your Majesty feel at ease.

342
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm willing to accept the crown prince

343
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,600
and help Your Majesty get into Taiyuan Lake.

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
General, you're so generous.

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,200
Is the crown prince of Taiyuan County finally decided?

346
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm afraid that General Cui will not be able to

347
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
get the throne.

348
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
My son even guards his own mother.

349
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,200
He only trusts the people from the Western Zhou.

350
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,800
But he has a unique taste in people.

351
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
The world is in chaos.

352
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Only Zhou Shengchen guards the country for him.

353
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
It's a pity that

354
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
you're the only traitor in the imperial army.

355
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Xie Chong is not dead.

356
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,200
I'm the only one who can help him.

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I beg Your Majesty to spare his life.

358
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
If he knew that you're in my palace,

361
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,800
he would have already left you.

362
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
You're begging for his life.

363
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
You're begging for your death.

364
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Do you understand?

365
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Grand Tutor taught Qin Yan

366
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
a good lesson in the imperial army.

367
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Please forgive him.

368
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
When he can get out of the palace,

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
I'll find an excuse to send him out.

370
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
I won't put you in danger.

371
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I can't wait.

372
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
My grandson will be born soon.

373
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I can't wait any longer.

374
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
You're...

375
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,600
I'm Yang Shao.

376
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
I'm here to welcome you.

377
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
What did you call yourself just now?

378
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,200
I am the Yang Shao who once guarded Yong City.

379
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,200
You are the one who kidnapped my sister.

380
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,440
It's me.

381
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,560
I have already surrendered to General Jin.

382
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,160
I will work with you in Taiyuan in the future.

383
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,400
Let's not talk about the future.

384
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,040
Let's just forget about today.

385
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,600
Wait.

386
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,520
Last month,

387
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,560
I met Prince of Nanchen and Miss Cui.

388
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,000
His Highness has given me a name.

389
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,280
The account is cleared.

390
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,960
If you don't believe me,

391
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,440
you can go to Xizhou and ask for permission.

392
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,040
If I tell you the truth,

393
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,640
you can kill me anytime.

394
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,240
But I guess that

395
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,360
it's more important for you to come here.

396
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,120
You don't have to waste your time on me.

397
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,280
Although I have surrendered to General Jin,

398
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
I still remember the case of saving me.

399
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,320
If you are in trouble in Taiyuan,

400
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,280
Yang Shao is your only help.

401
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Since it's all settled,

402
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,880
we will be friends in the future.

403
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,080
Taiyuan is ahead.

404
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,880
We have been waiting for you for a long time.

405
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,600
Let's go.

406
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,560
Your Majesty.

407
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,440
I beg Your Majesty

408
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
to help me.

409
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,040
Your Majesty.

410
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,800
Concubine Jiang gave birth to Huang Siqin.

411
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,520
Please find a chance

412
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,680
to save the Empress Dowager.

413
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,560
How can I do this again?

414
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,120
If you don't save her,

415
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,800
she will kill you sooner or later.

416
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,840
She has colluded with Liu Wei.

417
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,240
Once the little prince is born,

418
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,600
they will definitely act.

419
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,040
What your mother needs

420
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,880
is just a puppet.

421
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,800
Once the little prince is born,

422
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,000
what's the use

423
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,680
of your mother?

424
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,200
But...

425
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,000
I once failed her.

426
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,040
I can't...

427
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,840
As an outsider,

428
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,600
you are ignoring the etiquette of a military official

429
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,320
and taking care of His Majesty's health.

430
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,520
Xie Chong, do you admit your crime?

431
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,960
Of course I admit my crime.

432
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,080
Take him down.

433
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,800
Stop.

434
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,120
Mother, if you have a grudge against me,

435
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,960
why did you

436
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,920
involve the Grand Tutor?

437
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,480
His Majesty is the emperor.

438
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,720
No one can punish you.

439
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,960
He is not only a loser

440
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,320
but also a deceiver.

441
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,200
When did he deceive me?

442
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,800
Which clan does your wife come from?

443
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,800
Her wife

444
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,560
is a member of Gao clan.

445
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,360
His Majesty just died.

446
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,280
Gao clan tried to poison you several times.

447
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
If I hadn't been there,

448
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,200
His Majesty would have died.

449
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

450
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,840
Gao clan even tried to rebel.

451
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,200
I was the one who told them to protect His Majesty.

452
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,680
Now Xie Chong has hidden everything

453
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
and came to assist you.

454
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,720
He is doing this for the sake of the four seasons

455
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,200
and revenge for the Gao clan.

456
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,880
Is what you said true?

457
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,200
Your Majesty,

458
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,440
I...

459
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,480
I have to take the punishment.

460
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Take him away.

461
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Please,

462
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,460
for the sake of his

463
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,200
mercy, let him go.

464
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,320
Why don't you move, Qin Yan?

465
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,880
Do you want to disobey the order?

466
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,720
Close the inner and outer palace gates.

467
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,400
From today on,

468
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,720
no foreign ministers are allowed to enter the palace.

469
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,280
Except for the concubines.

470
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,840
The concubines of all the palaces

471
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,920
are not allowed to see His Majesty.

472
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,040
I will obey your order.

473
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,360
Qin Yan,

474
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,960
I was wrong about you.

475
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,760
His Majesty was wrong about you.

476
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,920
Your Majesty.

477
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,860
You are a belated harlot who doesn't deserve to be�

478
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,840
If you could ask him to move faster,

479
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,240
he willимости to himself with no fault.

480
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
His Majesty was wrong about you.

481
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Your Majesty.

482
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,120
Your Majesty,

483
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,560
what should we do?

484
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Report!

485
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

486
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Imperial Concubine Dowager, Concubine Dowager

487
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Imperial Concubine Dowager is seriously ill.

488
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Because of this, His Majesty is also very sad.

489
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,280
I will be the one to bring His Majesty to the main hall

490
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,280
until His Majesty is healthy and well.

491
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,280
There is also a good news in the palace.

492
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
I dreamt of a good news.

493
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,280
This time, His Majesty will definitely bring the prince back.

494
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
I am preparing to stay in the palace for half a month

495
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,280
until my grandson is born.

496
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Prime Minister.

497
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty. Congratulations, Empress Dowager.

498
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty. Congratulations, Empress Dowager.

499
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Thank you.

500
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Report to Empress Dowager. I have something to report.

501
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Prince Guang Ling often visits the Eastern Palace.

502
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,280
If you have something to report, you don't need to come to Taiji Hall.

503
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Replying to Empress Dowager,

504
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,280
it's good to have a witness in front of the ministers.

505
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Then say it.

506
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
I request Empress Dowager to issue an order

507
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
to let the ministers stay in the palace

508
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
and let the ministers stay in the palace for a long time.

509
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,280
So that the court and palace will not have any doubts.

510
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
In the future, the prince will be conferred with the Crown Prince.

511
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
It will be more just and fair.

512
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
I will think about it.

513
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Once I find a proper place to stay, I will issue an order.

514
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

515
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Where is Empress Dowager planning to give him the place to stay?

516
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I don't think she is sincere.

517
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Let her stay in the palace first.

518
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Wait until the matter is settled, then let her go.

519
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
His Majesty didn't attend the court today.

520
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Instead, Empress Dowager is taking the position of Li Zheng.

521
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,280
It seems that Empress Dowager has already decided to let him stay.

522
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,280
It seems that Empress Dowager has already decided to let him stay.

523
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Don't worry.

524
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,280
I have a way to make you and me meet very soon.

525
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Empress Dowager, please.

526
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Thank you.

527
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
Thank you.

528
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,280
Zi Xing, I respect you.

529
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,280
I am a drunkard. I am not good at drinking.

530
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Back then, I was imprisoned.

531
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,280
You traveled thousands of miles to seek help in Xizhou.

532
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Now, I am making you suffer.

533
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,280
If you have any requests, just tell me.

534
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,280
I request to give you a marriage.

535
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,280
Which girl?

536
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Cui Shi Yi.

537
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
It's still her?

538
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Yes.

539
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Before Cui Guang died, this marriage was a beautiful event.

540
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
But now, Cui Shi...

541
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Because Cui Guang has passed away,

542
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,280
Cui San Niang's inner room is much worse than before.

543
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Cui Zheng's group is very powerful in the court.

544
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
If you insist on Cui Shi,

545
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,280
why don't you let Cui Zheng choose a good girl for you?

546
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Empress Dowager, you are so wise.

547
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,280
I don't want Cui Shi Ni.

548
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
I want Cui Shi Yi.

549
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Cui San Niang may not agree.

550
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,280
But Cui Shi Yi is a good girl.

551
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,280
He is very kind.

552
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
No matter how strong the imperial decree is,

553
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
he dares not to disobey.

554
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
That's right.

555
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,280
It depends on the Empress Dowager's opinion.

556
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Don't you regret it?

557
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,280
I request to give you another marriage.

558
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Good.

559
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
You are so wise.

560
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

561
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
If you do this, then I won't test myars.

562
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
I was using poison.

563
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:18,280
He has been cancer and heart disease since he rose from six years.

564
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
He was executed.

565
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,280
His個網都沒銀出cleser

566
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,280
Almost terminated the ancestral lineage.

567
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
But I haven't killed him.

568
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,680
I regret that I didn't listen to you.

569
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
I made a big mistake.

570
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
I didn't kill him.

571
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,680
Now I have no way out.

572
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,280
I have nothing.

573
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,280
No, your majesty.

574
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
You still have me.

575
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,080
And our soon-to-be-born son.

576
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,480
Your majesty.

577
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,640
홍隆奉剑

578
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,800
Imperial uncle

579
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,400
Fairy

580
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,200
I can't go back to Xizhou.

581
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,080
What are you here for?

582
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,640
I'm dead.

583
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,920
How can I go back to Xizhou?

584
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,480
Your...

585
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,520
Where can you go back to?

586
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,520
I was forced to.

587
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,120
Empress Dowager set me up.

588
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,280
I shouldn't have stayed.

589
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
I should have left with General Hong.

590
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Military counselor.

591
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Go.

593
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Go.

594
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
Go.

595
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Military counselor has something to tell you.

596
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,280
I'll think of a way to tell him.

597
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,280
I'm the late emperor of the Chang's.

598
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,280
I'm waiting in the imperial prison.

599
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,280
I'll be good to you.

600
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,280
I'll be good to you.

601
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,280
What did you see?

602
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Nothing.

603
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,280
I think I saw something.

604
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
The Buddha has been reincarnated many times.

605
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,280
They are the most spiritual animals.

606
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,280
I'll go.

607
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
Master.

608
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Grand Tutor...

609
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,280
has left.

610
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,280
I'll go.

611
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,280
He left in Zhongzhou Palace ten days ago.

612
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,280
After he left, His Majesty ordered to send an order to Yongzhou.

613
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,280
I'll go.

614
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,280
I'm not an ordinary person.

615
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
I'll be more relaxed after I leave.

616
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,280
When I came, His Majesty was very angry.

617
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Now, there are fewer and fewer people around him.

618
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
You stay with him.

619
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,280
I'll deal with Grand Tutor's business.

620
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,280
I'll go.

621
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Master, where are you going?

622
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
To feed the horses.

623
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
I'll go too.

624
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Don't follow me.

625
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,280
I'll go.

626
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,280
I'll go.

627
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,280
I came to worry about you.

628
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
The military counselor left.

629
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I know you're upset.

630
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
You asked me that night.

631
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
My brother...

632
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,280
was very angry.

633
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,280
He said that he was worried about you.

634
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,280
He said that he was worried about you.

635
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,280
He said that he was worried about you.

636
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
You asked me that night.

637
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Did my brother doubt me?

638
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Actually, he asked Xie Chong to follow me.

639
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Just to keep it.

640
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,280
After the military counselor left, he was so angry.

641
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,280
He made me choose to kill or keep it.

642
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,280
You not only keep it, but also still believe him.

643
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Yes.

644
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,280
He's the brother who chose me.

645
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,280
He's also my military counselor.

646
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,280
There's one thing.

647
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,280
The military counselor told me

648
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,280
to tell you after he died.

649
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,280
His wife is Gao.

650
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
He's from the previous Empress Dowager.

651
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,280
Gao clan.

652
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,280
The military counselor is afraid that I hate him?

653
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,280
Yes.

654
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,280
I don't have that much hatred.

655
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
There are thousands of Gao clan.

656
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Do I have to hate them one by one?

657
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
He's different.

658
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,280
He thinks he's the one who watched you grow up.

659
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,280
He's more guilty.

660
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
What about his wife?

661
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Do you need the Prince's mansion to take care of her?

662
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,280
She's gone.

663
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,280
Do you have children?

664
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,280
I have one.

665
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,280
He was known to be the descendant of Gao clan.

666
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
He was revenge by his wife.

667
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
So when he was young,

668
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,280
he was given the treatment of the treatment of the disease.

669
00:41:47,280 --> 00:42:13,140
The

670
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,440
It's not good to say that.

671
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,880
What if my mother finds out?

672
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,240
But it doesn't matter.

673
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,760
A general's life is not a general's life.

674
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,240
A son's life is not a son's life.
