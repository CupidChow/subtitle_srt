1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,580
Allison, you gonna cook?

2
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,560
I know you're gonna cook, Allison!

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,480
Allison!

4
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,360
Allison, I gotta go!

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,060
Allison, Allison!

6
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,100
Allison!

7
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,580
Allison!

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,200
《怕这糖》 《喝简纯》 《俊乐宝简纯酸奶》提醒您,精彩即将开始。

9
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,080
《多吃一点》

10
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,080
Your Highness...

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Yang Shao!

12
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,080
The King of the World

15
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
Zhou Shengchen committed treason and treason.

16
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
He deserves to die.

17
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Prime Minister Liu Wei and all the kings of the Liu family were killed by him.

18
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
The treacherous minister is a traitor.

19
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
The loyal minister is in danger.

20
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,080
You will be punished by heaven for treason!

21
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
You don't want to live anymore?

22
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Your Highness!

23
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,080
I'm not capable!

24
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Your Highness!

25
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Lord Wen!

26
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Lord Wen!

27
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Lord Wen!

28
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Lord Wen!

29
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Lord Wen!

30
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Who else wants to die?

31
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Stand up!

32
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
I'll let you govern the country!

33
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
We are incompetent!

34
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,080
You have wronged us!

35
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Your Highness!

36
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
I'm willing to go with you!

37
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,080
Lord Wang!

38
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Lord Wang!

39
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Lord Wang!

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Lord Wang!

41
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,080
My lords, why do you have to die for me?

42
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Your Highness!

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm willing to go with you!

44
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Your Highness!

45
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
I'm willing to go with you!

46
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Your Highness!

47
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Your Highness!

48
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Jinrong, you deserve to die!

49
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Your Highness!

50
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Your Highness!

51
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Your Highness!

52
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Your Highness!

53
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Your Highness!

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
The whole county is crazy!

55
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Execute him now!

56
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Yes!

57
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Your Highness!

58
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Your Highness!

59
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Your Highness!

60
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Your Highness!

61
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Your Highness!

62
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Your Highness!

63
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
What's wrong?

64
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Did you have a nightmare?

65
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
I'll call the doctor!

66
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Your Highness!

67
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Your Highness!

68
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Your Highness!

69
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Your Highness!

70
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Your Highness!

71
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Your Highness!

72
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Your Highness...

73
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Kill them!

74
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Kill them all!

75
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Kill them!

76
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Kill them!

77
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Kill them!

78
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
The End

79
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
General, please wait.

80
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
The news of Liu Zixing's arrival

81
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
The King of Nanchen's army is rebelling

82
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
The rebelling and rebelling officials who were defeated by you

83
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
will be sealed off as long as they come to Pingning

84
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Now all the enemies are here

85
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,080
General, retreating is the best way

86
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Only by retreating, can we have a day of revenge

87
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Master is still in the palace

88
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
How can we retreat?

89
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
If we can't get back the Crown Prince

90
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
the soldiers will never leave

91
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
The King of Nanchen

92
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
I will go and bring him back

93
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,080
I came to collect the corpse of King Wu

94
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Why would you collect the corpse of a rebel?

95
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Besides, he is a criminal

96
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,080
I can't let you take him away

97
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
You know very well

98
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
my identity as a monk

99
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
If you don't let me enter the palace today

100
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
to collect the corpse of King Wu

101
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
I will go back to Nanxiao

102
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
and wear a armor and a sword

103
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
to gather millions of soldiers to take your country

104
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I will go back to Nanxiao

105
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
I will go back to Nanxiao

106
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Master

107
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Master

108
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Don't come over

109
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Master

110
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
I can't stand it

111
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
This is the execution of the Empire

112
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Put it down

113
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Master

114
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Miss

115
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Miss

116
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Miss

117
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Which palace are you from?

118
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
When did you come?

119
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
Why is the palace maid in a coma?

120
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Why is the palace maid in a coma?

121
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Why is the palace maid in a coma?

122
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Why is the palace maid in a coma?

123
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Uncle

124
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Uncle

125
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Miss

126
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Where is Uncle?

127
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
I don't know

128
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Miss

129
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
You can't go out

130
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
There is a fight outside

131
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
What happened?

132
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
I don't know

133
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Miss

134
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
You really can't go out

135
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Miss

136
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Where is this?

137
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
This is the Eastern Palace

138
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Why am I in the Eastern Palace?

139
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
The Emperor ordered the Imperial Physician to send you to the Eastern Palace

140
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
This is the place where the Emperor is located

141
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
The guards are very strict

142
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Why did you send me to the Eastern Palace?

143
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
What happened?

144
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
I don't know

145
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
I just followed my fate

146
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Miss

147
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Please go back to the bedroom

148
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Don't make it difficult for me

149
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Please go back to the bedroom

150
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,080
The heart is in the sword

151
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
The blade is in the sword

152
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
The blade is in the sword

153
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
The heart is in the sword

154
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
I wish to guard

155
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
I wish to guard

156
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
I wish to guard

157
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
On the country

158
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
No more lily

159
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
May the people of the north live happily

160
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
The smoke will not stop in the world

161
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Thousands of miles of cotton

162
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
May the people of the north live happily

163
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,520
And, may we pray for a profit in this world!

164
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
I

165
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,040
The king of the city has ordered that before he comes back, no one is allowed to approach the east palace. It is even more impossible to see Miss Cui

166
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,440
Why can't I see her? She's my sister. Move

167
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Don't want to die

168
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,840
Just a few of you can stop me

169
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,760
Let you in, I also have a hard time

170
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,640
I am the city

171
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,000
The brothers inside are ready to go with this east palace

172
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:28,880
What are you doing

173
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,800
The king and I are one

174
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,840
The resistance is dead and you are dead, too

175
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,480
So we'll burn this east palace and let him die for us

176
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,880
If my sister gets hurt, I'll break you into pieces

177
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I'm going to kill you

178
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,640
The king of the east palace is surrounded by water and we can't get in

179
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,560
I knew it

180
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,480
I can't wait to tear down this palace

181
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,360
King of Pingjing

182
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm going to kill you

183
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,880
Yang Shao Yang Shao

184
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,160
Jinrong's dog

185
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,360
Yang Shao is not here today to fight

186
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,880
I just want to advise the general that even if the general stays, he can't help the girl

187
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,920
It's just a way to increase the death of the king. I don't need you to teach me how to do things

188
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't want to talk to a blind man either

189
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,800
I just want to try to keep the king's anger for the king

190
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,960
It's been a night

191
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,920
Which side are you on?

192
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,520
Which side is not important

193
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
I owe the girl two lives

194
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,920
I owe the king who didn't kill

195
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,840
If you believe me, you can go out for a while and wait for my news

196
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,160
If you don't believe me, I'll save Miss Cui myself

197
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,200
It's okay

198
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,560
It's okay

199
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,280
Good wine

200
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,520
I told you that the carriage was definitely wrong

201
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,160
There is a problem

202
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,680
Tomorrow I will go to the general

203
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,400
It's really you

204
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,960
What did you say

205
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,600
He released Zhou Tianxiang

206
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,320
I chased out the city and was ambushed by Yuan Wuchuo

207
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
The people who brought it are dead

208
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,440
Please punish the king of Taiyuan

209
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,320
This is your bride

210
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,160
You useless

211
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,740
Your friend can't let you go

212
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,560
You are fond of her

213
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,360
He invoked me

214
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,280
And I'm going to make him his daughter as the queen

215
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,200
The world is yours

216
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,040
and get rid of them one by one.

217
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Your Majesty, the auspicious time has come.

218
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Kneel!

219
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Long live the Emperor!

220
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Long live the Emperor!

221
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Long live the Emperor!

222
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Come on!

223
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Long live the Emperor!

224
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I am Yang Shao.

225
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Greetings, Third Madam Cui.

226
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I have never had any relationship with Jin Rong.

227
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I wonder why you came here.

228
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
I was entrusted by the Western State's Prince

229
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
to ask for your help.

230
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
I am sorry.

231
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I have made my decision.

232
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
From now on,

233
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,200
you will be in charge of the Wushui House.

234
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
When you return to Qinghe,

235
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
you must not delay for a moment.

236
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
You must move to the south immediately.

237
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
The most important thing is the people and books.

238
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Everything else is dangerous.

239
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
What about yourself?

240
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Shiyi is still trapped in the palace.

241
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Back then,

242
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
I gave up her father for Cui.

243
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Now,

244
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I can no longer give up my daughter for Cui.

245
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
Go.

246
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Go.

247
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Xinhua.

248
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Thank you for taking care of me.

249
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I am going back to the palace.

250
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I came to say goodbye.

251
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Xinhua,

252
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
since you married into the Cui family,

253
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,200
I have never treated you badly.

254
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Now that you are leaving,

255
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I have a request.

256
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
As long as you can do it,

257
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
you must do it.

258
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,200
I want to see my daughter.

259
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
It's very difficult.

260
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Brother Ziqin is very strict with him.

261
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I have been in the palace several times

262
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
but I have never seen him.

263
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
I will think of a way

264
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,200
to persuade him to let you two meet.

265
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Aunt, be patient.

266
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
There will be a chance.

267
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Thank you.

268
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Go.

269
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Go.

270
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Your Highness.

271
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
His Majesty has ordered

272
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
that you will be the concubine.

273
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
You will be the guest of honor.

274
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
This is the concubine.

275
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Please accept this.

276
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
This is the concubine of His Majesty.

277
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
She has been following His Majesty for many years.

278
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
She will serve you later.

279
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
I am leaving.

280
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Your Highness.

281
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
You want to confer the title of queen to her?

282
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,200
I gave you the post and you were defeated by thousands of people.

283
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,200
You even have to take into consideration a gift from the concubine.

284
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I don't take into consideration. I pity him.

285
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Liu Zixing, you killed his teacher, sister and even surrounded his brother.

286
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,200
But you only use these to cover up.

287
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:35,200
If I were him, I would not want to be a piece of flesh.

288
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Get out. Get out!

289
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Meng Luan.

290
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Yes.

291
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Before the last day of the festival, you must keep Shiyi safe.

292
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Without my permission, no one is allowed to see her.

293
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Yes.

294
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Your majesty.

295
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
How is Guiping?

296
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,200
He has been talking too much these days. I'm afraid...

297
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,200
You are my mother. You should be the one who is honest with me.

298
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm afraid that his childhood anxiety will be affected.

299
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I'm sorry.

300
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I was busy with the battle and neglected you.

301
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,200
I owe you a favor.

302
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,200
I remember that you have always wanted to see me.

303
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,200
I have invited all the people in the Wang family to come here.

304
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Tell me what you want.

305
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm afraid that you can't come back.

306
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
I have to see the court officials.

307
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
You should rest.

308
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I will.

309
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I will.

310
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
I will.

311
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
I will.

312
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I will.

313
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I will.

314
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
I will.

315
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I will.

316
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I will.

317
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
I will.

318
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
I will.

319
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I will.

320
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
In the south,

321
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,200
the governor of Beichang, Liu Jun,

322
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,200
the governor of Yiyang County, Liu Shida,

323
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,200
and all the people in Nanjing,

324
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
all think about Nanxiao.

325
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,200
The border between Nanxiao and us is broken.

326
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
We have to deal with things one by one.

327
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Drink some tea first.

328
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
It's good for you.

329
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Where is Shou Yang?

330
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Shou Yang...

331
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
The first few years,

332
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
it was always Cui San Lang who was in charge.

333
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
Now...

334
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
I told you to invite the Shi family to come here.

335
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Who will reply to you?

336
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
I am incompetent.

337
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Brother Zi Xing,

338
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Cui San Lang's death

339
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
in the water house,

340
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
it wasn't a small thing.

341
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
You want to bring down the Wang family,

342
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
you have to be like Cui San Lang.

343
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
This person is unreliable.

344
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Tomorrow,

345
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
you go and invite Cui San Lang into the palace.

346
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Tell her that I have a request.

347
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
I will obey.

348
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
The Hongnong family,

349
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
loyal and loyal.

350
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
The people are everywhere.

351
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Ji Yang, Zhang Sun family,

352
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
they are the only ones

353
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
who can control the army.

354
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Yu Wen family,

355
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
they live in the northwest.

356
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
They have a deeper foundation than the Jin family.

357
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
These Shi family,

358
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
they are the Wang family

359
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
that you have to lead.

360
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Can you invite them to come here

361
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
to invite them to come here?

362
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
The court will give the order

363
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
to the prime minister

364
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
and the guards.

365
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
You can recommend them.

366
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
As long as you help me,

367
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
the power of Cui family

368
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
will only be used in the previous dynasty.

369
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
About the new Empress,

370
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
I have to ask you to understand.

371
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
In my heart,

372
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Shi Yi is my wife.

373
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
The only Empress.

374
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Then may I ask Your Majesty,

375
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
when can I see Shi Yi?

376
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Your Majesty doesn't allow anyone to approach her.

377
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
I can understand.

378
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
But I am her mother.

379
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Are you worried

380
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
that I will hurt my own daughter?

381
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I'm afraid that she will know about the Ping Yi.

382
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Now everyone knows

383
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
that the Prince of Nanchen

384
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
was executed for a plot.

385
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
If that's the case,

386
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Shi Yi is a child

387
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
who understands the world.

388
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Or are you worried

389
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
that he doesn't know the truth?

390
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Shi Yi is very affectionate.

391
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I'm afraid he can't stand it.

392
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
He is very affectionate,

393
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
but he knows the meaning.

394
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
If you can help me

395
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
persuade him to accept this,

396
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I will be very grateful.

397
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Mulan.

398
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Yes.

399
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Take her to the Eastern Palace.

400
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Yes.

401
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Third Miss.

402
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,200
I treat her with all my heart.

403
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,200
I hope that you can think for your daughter.

404
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Don't let her suffer too much.

405
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
If you should be prepared,

406
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
you should be prepared.

407
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Yan Longjiao is now in the middle of preparation.

408
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
The empress was ordered to go to the palace.

409
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
They had to prepare a few pairs of his majesty.

410
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
The same is true for Xia Ta.

411
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
He should face his majesty

412
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
and slowly bow to him from the bedside.

413
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
I followed you inside

414
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
because of his majesty's order.

415
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Don't I want my daughter

416
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
to live happily?

417
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
His highness has already left.

418
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,200
What's the use of telling him the truth?

419
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I have already given my life to the country.

420
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I have already underestimated these things.

421
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,200
I just want Shi Yi to live well.

422
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,200
It's best if you think like this.

423
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Shi Yi.

424
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
You don't want to talk?

425
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Let me take a good look at you.

426
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
You really look like you were in Xizhou.

427
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Zhou Shenchen

428
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
has rebelled.

429
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Impossible.

430
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Impossible, mother.

431
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
You have to calm down.

432
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
You have to calm down

433
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
if you want to hear me finish.

434
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
In the palace,

435
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
his highness has a rebellion.

436
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
He was found out by Cui Shi Zhong.

437
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
He is now in the palace.

438
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
He is now in the palace.

439
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
He is now in the palace.

440
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Shi Yi.

441
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Zhou Shenchen has been captured.

442
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
His majesty

443
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,200
has given him the heart to die for.

444
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
He has been awake for three hours.

445
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,200
He has never loved a queen.

446
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
He will never return.

447
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
The heart to die for.

448
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Shi Yi.

449
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
The heart to die for.

450
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Shi Yi.

451
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Shi Yi.

452
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Shi Yi.

453
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Cry it out.

454
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
I know you can't stand it.

455
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
I'm here.

456
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Cry it out.

457
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Shi Yi.

458
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Shi Yi.

459
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
Shi Yi.

460
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Shi Yi.

461
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Shi Yi.

462
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
There are many rules in the palace.

463
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,200
It's not easy for me to see you.

464
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Take care of yourself.

465
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Mother.

466
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
He will not rebel.

467
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
He will not rebel.

468
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Shi Yi.

469
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Third Miss.

470
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
It's almost time.

471
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Shi Yi.

472
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Shi Yi.

473
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Shi Yi.

474
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Shi Yi.

475
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
Shi Yi.

476
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Shi Yi.

477
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Shi Yi.

478
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Shi Yi.

479
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Shi Yi.

480
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Shi Yi.

481
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Shi Yi.

482
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Shi Yi.

483
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
Shi Yi.

484
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Shi Yi.

485
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Shi Yi.

486
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Shi Yi.

487
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Shi Yi.

488
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Shi Yi.

489
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Shi Yi.

490
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Shi Yi.

491
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Shi Yi.

492
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Shi Yi.

493
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Shi Yi.

494
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Shi Yi.

495
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200
Shi Yi.

496
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Shi Yi.

497
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Shi Yi.

498
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
Shi Yi.

499
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Shi Yi.

500
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Shi Yi.

501
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
Shi Yi.

502
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
Shi Yi.

503
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
Shi Yi.

504
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Shi Yi.

505
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,200
Shi Yi.

506
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Shi Yi.

507
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,200
Shi Yi.

508
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,200
Shi Yi.

509
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Shi Yi.

510
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Shi Yi.

511
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
Shi Yi.

512
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
Shi Yi.

513
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Shi Yi.

514
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
Shi Yi.

515
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
Shi Yi.

516
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
Shi Yi.

517
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Shi Yi.

518
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Shi Yi.

519
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
