Stop!

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,320
General,

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,400
where did you come from?

8
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,840
That's not a question

9
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,289
You're entitled to ask.

10
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,000
We are escorting a major criminal to the capital city

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
according to His Majesty's decree!

12
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,800
Forgive me, General!

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
General, please.

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,800
Feng Qiao is so bold.

15
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,720
She's holding a fake decree

16
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,960

Is the Chief of State Finance in there?

19

Yes.

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
I've brought some desserts from Jiangnan.

21
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,650
Your Highness, please.

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,040
You actually don't trust me

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,440
though we meet every day?

24
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
I can take the box in myself.

25
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
Does that works for you?

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
The Chief of State Finance already had dinner.

27
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,210
You wait outside for me.

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,200
Yes.

29
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,090
Chief of State Finance.

30
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,480
I wanted to bring you

31
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,079
some desserts from Jiangnan

32
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,420
but was unfortunately stopped outside.

33
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,760
Thanks for Your Highness' kind offer.

34
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Don't mind.

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,170
I'll punish them

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
for you later.

37
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,490
Thanks for taking the trouble.

Chief of State Finance.

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,890
His Majesty is still worshipping the Buddha.

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
His Majesty likes to chant scriptures,

41
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,880
which is just like the Empress Dowager.

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,960
I think I'm enjoying the honor

43
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,520
that no other eunuchs

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,240
have ever enjoyed.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,640
I have my own living palace

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,440
with palace maids.

47
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,480
And the imperial family members like you

48
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
chat with me.

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,920
We discuss political affairs

50
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,399
around the state.

51
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,680
I'm sure that

52
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,920
you can't keep the title of Crown Prince.

53
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,040
Look.

54
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,280
His Majesty is in the prime of his life,

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,520
and he will have his own sons.

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,880
So how could he possibly

57
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
make you the Crown Prince?

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,720
But don't worry.

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,680
I will surely help you to

60
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,040
marry the lady from the Cui family.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,280
Just count on me.

Don't take the trouble.

65
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,840

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,920
He's dead,

73
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,120
so who are you serving?

74
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,159
Just admit your guilty now.

or you will be dead.

Find an adopted son of Zhao Teng.

84
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,480
Tell him that

85

to watch Empress Dowager and comfort His Majesty.

89
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,240
Yes.

What's going on?

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Why is this happening?

113
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
Why was His Majesty absent from the court session?

114
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,420
There they are.

115
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
The court is in bad order now.

116

Who are you?

119
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,800
You're Cui Wenjun from the Cui family.

120
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,200
You're right.

121
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
You rarely left Qinghe County before,

122
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,400
why are you in the capital today?

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,720
My elder brother is severely ill

124

and dying.

125
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,800
However, he didn't want to part with

126

His Majesty, his peer ministers

127
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,160
and Counselor-in-chief.

128
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,080
He decided to come back to the Residence of Cui in the Central State,

129
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,200
and I came back with him.

130
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,120
So why are you here now?

131
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,720
I'd like to invite all of you

132
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,980

Everybody, please be seated.

137
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,460
I've heard that

138
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,680
Zhao Teng is badly ill

139
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,720
and is dying.

140
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,250
I've also heard that

141
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,640
General-in-chief Liu Yuan went to see Empress Dowager.

142
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,200
He admitted that he had arrogated power in court

143
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,560
and killed loyal ministers.

144
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
At the time you arrived here,

145
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,120
the guilty minister Liu Yuan handed over his military power

146
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,000
and gave himself in.

147
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,680
Refreshments are ready.

148
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,120
Have a taste, everyone.

149
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,120
These are specialties of Qinghe County.

150
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,260
Counselor-in-chief,

151
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,800
didn't you hear of this?

152
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,640
You go in and out of the imperial palace every day.

153
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,800
You should have known it earlier than me.

154
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,130
I heard of it before.

155
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Liu Yuan kept maids and whores,

156
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,180
killed ministers indiscriminately

157
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,730
and turned common people into slaves.

158
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,640
I guess you've been tolerating that

159
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,000
and have waited for this result for a long time.

160
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
You're absolutely right.

161
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm badly ill now,

162
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,190
I'm powerless though I hope to do something.

163
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,040
At such a time of turbulence,

164
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,160
please help His Majesty.

165
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,520
It's my duty.

166
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
I knew that

167
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,360
you would ground me

168
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
sooner or later.

169
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,350
Your Majesty.

170
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,320
The outcome is certain now.

171
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,600
You should be happy.

172
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,180
Why are you still praying?

173
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,060
From beginning to end,

174
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,610
I've always thought that we would win.

175
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
What worries me most is that

176
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,570
His Majesty doesn't trust him.

177
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,760
I worry that His Majesty thinks he has other purposes.

178
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,440
If that's true,

179
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,370
everything he does for His Majesty

180
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
will be a joke.

181
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,960
Why are you crying?

182
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Did you kill Zhao Teng?

183
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,240
Zhao Teng

184
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,770
died of illness.

185
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,570
What about Liu Yuan?

186
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,970
He confessed his guilty

187
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,260
and has been deprived of military power.

188
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,480
What I say

189
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,080
will be announced to the state

190
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,480
and recorded in history.

191
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,880
Well...

192
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
Will I be recorded

193
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
as dead today in history?

194
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm afraid not.

195
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,560
You need to have several sons.

196
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,760
Otherwise, there will be more rebellions

197
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,490
if you don't have descendants.

198
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,700
I haven't brought weapons into the palace today,

199
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,820
just the wooden sword granted by Your Majesty.

200
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm your uncle,

201
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,780
and you are more important

202
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,440
than the throne to me.

203
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,440
Uncle.

204
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,080
Thanks for saving me.

205
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,560
I once said that

206
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,490
you never need to kneel down in front of me.

207
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,120
After being grounded by my disobedient son and eunuch

208
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,600
for three years,

209
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,930
I've long lost my dignity as the Empress Dowager.

210
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,880
Without you,

211
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I wouldn't have been set free.

212
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,920
I was wrong.

213
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,000
I will not see you as my son anymore.

214
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,130
I believed in slanderous talks

215
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,720
and wanted to come into throne as soon as possible,

216
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,640
But then…

217
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,440
But then

218
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,890
I just couldn't break away from Zhao Teng.

219
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,680
I knew I was wrong earlier

220
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,760
and couldn't eat or sleep well every day.

221
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,020
However, I didn't dare to go against them

222
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,380
because I was afraid they would kill you.

223
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,560
I was wrong.

224
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,720
I really was wrong.

225
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,920
I was wrong.

226
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,800
I was wrong.

227
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,880
Mother.

228
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,460
[Shiqian Palace]

229
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,860
Your Highness.

230
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,840
Have you thought of many things in the past?

231
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,320
The late emperor was just in his thirties

232
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
when he passed away,

233
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,880
but he died as an emperor anyway.

234
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,080
It's hard to come by that

235
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
we've made it without much trouble.

236
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,960
Exactly.

237
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,810
It's really hard to come by.

238
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,000
Then why is Shiyi going to cry?

239
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
Your Highness.

240
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,400
No one likes to joke about his disciple

241
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,520
as you do.

242
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,420
I can't stand seeing this.

243
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,000
I thought that

244
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,650
you must have been imprisoned by His Majesty.

245
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,120
His Majesty did order to

246
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
imprison me.

247
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,560
He ordered to

248
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,640
imprison me in the palace

249
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,840
for a period of time.

250
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
What will happen after this?

251
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,820
I'll go back to the Western State.

252
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
The Shiqian Palace is an emperor's living palace,

253
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
but why is it vacant?

254
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,440
The late emperor passed away here,

255
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,060
and His Majesty had his bedchamber moved to the Xianyang Palace

256
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,390
for fear of feeling sad.

257
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,620
[Shiqian Palace]

258
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,300
I was brought up by the late emperor here

259
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,230
when I was young,

260
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,320
so I lived here too.

261
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,330
What are you looking at?

262
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,200
I'm looking at the place

263
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,860
where you lived in childhood.

264
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,280
They don't know us.

265
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,630
That sounds right.

266
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,420
During this rescue,

267
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,520
except a few people,

268
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,200
no one else knows that

269
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,800
the junior Prince of Nanchen is back.

270
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,680
Therefore,

271
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
we need to hide our real names in the palace.

272
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,360
That sounds right.

273
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,640
So I can't call you “Master”, right?

274
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
We would be exposed in that case.

275
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,960
That makes sense.

276
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,480
Zhou…

277
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,020
Your Highness.

278
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,520
The Empress Dowager asks Your Highness to her living palace.

279
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
Go to the military advisor.

280
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,620
After all, it's not my mansion.

281
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,600
Don't go around.

282
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,920
The lady is in the palace.

283
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,720
If Your Highness wants to meet her,

284
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,980
I will invite her here.

285
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm feeling pitiful.

286
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
Pitiful?

287
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
For what?

288
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,840
If we want to eliminate uncle,

289
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,960
tonight will be the best time.

290
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,520
That he came to the capital to save the emperor

291
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,920
has been known by no one else

292
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,780
except several close ministers.

293
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Therefore, Royal Army of Nanchen would not complain

294
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,280
even if he died here.

295
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,760
If we kill Liu Yuan and him tonight,

296
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,040
it will be a double kill.

297
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,720
Pitifully, His Majesty values kinship

298
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,850
more than the throne

299
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,620
and doesn't have the heart to kill uncle.

300
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,860
Change clothes for me.

301
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,800
Yes.

No.

Actually, I'm going to thank uncle for

306
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
saving His Majesty.

307
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,040

Congratulations for getting the power back.

to kill you?

who is back in the palace?

I haven't been concerned about worldly affairs for long.

we're family

rather than an emperor and his ministers.

Yes, Your Majesty.

You can.

332
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,320
Get up.

333

Your Majesty.

334
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,130
You taught the late emperor

335
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,680
and support my uncle,

336
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,320
so I should bow to you.

337
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,090
I need to bow twice more.

338
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,520
You were engaged with the late emperor

339
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,520
but you didn't marry him at last,

340
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,040
so why did you do this?

341
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,240
After the late emperor died,

342
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,000
Empress Gao forced me to be a nun.

343
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,930
When she died later,

344
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,220
I wanted to leave the palace at first.

345
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Then I heard that you made a severe promise

346
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,530
at the Taiji Palace that

347
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,440
you would never get married,

348
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,800
so I stayed here.

349
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
After all,

350
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,320
this was the place where we met.

351
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,280
Your Majesty don't come here

352
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,680
just to bow to me, right?

353
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,600
I'd like to ask about a person.

354
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,080
Have you ever heard of

355
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,760
a lady named Huaiyang?

356
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
Gao Huaiyang?

357
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,760
Yes. Her surname is Gao.

358
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,960
Your Majesty,

359
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,900
what do you want to know about her?

360
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,040
What's her relationship with uncle?

361
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,400
Your Majesty,

362
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,040
why do you think

363
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,080
she has anything to do with your uncle.

364
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,280
I asked you first.

365
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,000
I will tell you

366
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,820
after you answer my question.

367
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,480
Your Majesty,

368
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,960
she's a cousin of Empress Gao

369
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,080
and has lots of chances to come into the palace.

370
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,320
The late emperor saw her

371
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,080
and took a fancy to her soon.

372
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,280
However,

373
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,140
the one she wanted to marry

374
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,000
was your uncle.

375
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,400
Did my uncle like her?

376
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,480
I didn't dare to ask.

377
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
So she must be very sad

378
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,240
when uncle left after that.

379
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,640
Maybe.

380
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,040
All I've heard is that

381
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,480
Gao's clan forced her into the palace

382
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,440
so that she could serve the late emperor.

383
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,360
After all, it was always

384
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,540
to Gao's advantage

385
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,440
if they had

386
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,840
an adored concubine.

387
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,840
However, Empress Gao didn't want her to share the late emperor's love

388
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,400
and tried all means to stop that.

389
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
Finally, she couldn't marry the late emperor.

390
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,680
After the late emperor passed away,

391
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,280
I've never heard about her.

392
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,200
She has been in the palace as a nun with hair

393
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,440
until today.

394
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,760
She's still alive?

395
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,320
I thought that

396
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,180
I would see you sooner or later

397
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,880
if I stayed in the palace.

398
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,440
Did it have anything to do with me

399
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,650
when you left the palace back then?

400
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,720
No.

401
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,540
[Chonghua Palace]

402
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,450
You like this place?

403
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Master, you must have been tired

404
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
after seeing an old acquaintance.

405
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,490
Get in the palace and sleep.

406
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,930
Where are you going?

407
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,370
I'm going out of the palace.

408
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,560
The gate was closed earlier.

409
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,360
A powerful minister can go out

410
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,960
if he has important affairs.

411
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,960
Like you said,

412
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,560
a powerful minister can go out only if he has important affairs.

413
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,920
Do you think this place is like the Western State

414
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,980
where you can go anywhere arbitrary?

415
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,770
I've sent someone to

416
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,400
inform the Residence of Cui,

417
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,480
so you may stay here tonight.

418
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,440
Your Majesty is here too.

419
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,120
Yes.

420
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,420
I almost fainted after crying today.

421
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,280
I just chatted with your military advisor

422
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,740
and I'm back to myself now.

423
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,680
Why don't you

424
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,330
pay respect to His Majesty?

425
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,400
As a noble lady from the Cui family,

426
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,200
where are all your good manners?

427
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,720
He has been here for two hours.

428
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,160
He?

429
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,520
His Majesty.

430
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,920
I told her that

431
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,280
she didn't need to treat me as an emperor

432
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,540
in this living palace.

433
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,010
Please don't blame her.

434
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,640
Uncle, please be seated.

435
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,720
Sit down.

436
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,590
You eat.

437
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,480
Uncle.

438
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,600
You've done a deed of merit this time,

439
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,060
so what reward do you want?

440
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,130
I don't need that.

441
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,360
Jewelries?

442
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,040
A rank?

443
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,000
Or a land?

444
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
Or is it marriage?

445
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,520
I can't get married.

446
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,440
Even though you can't actually get married,

447
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
you can be with a lady

448
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,200
if you love each other.

449
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,080
His Majesty is wise.

450
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,360
A wedding is useless.

451
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,300
That you truly love each other

452
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,320
is the thing that matters.

453
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,480
I don't want you to be childless.

454
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,760
If you have a child,

455
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
you can bring him into the palace.

456
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,320
I'll personally bring him up.

457
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,380
No one would dare to say anything bad.

458
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,320
Your Majesty,

459
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
I'm not childless.

460
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,520
So,

461
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,280
I have cousins?

462
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,080
When did that happen?

463
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,930
There are ten orphans

464
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,520
and one disciple

465
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,280
in my mansion.

466
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,510
I'm contented.

467
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,140
My military advisor is old.

468
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,920
I hope Your Majesty won't blame him.

469
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,640
It's OK.

470
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,520
Your Majesty!

471
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,090
How dare you!

472
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,200
I told you that

473
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,480
no one should come in.

474
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,360
Please don't be angry.

475
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,320
I heard a noise

476
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,600
and was afraid that Your Majesty was in danger.

477
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,720
They are my honored guests

478
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,920
in the living palace,

479
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,120
so how could I be in danger?

480
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,840
Get out!

481
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,680
Yes.

482
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,960
I have nobody to trust

483
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,960
except you.

484
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,240
Your military advisor just told me that

485
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,970
Liu Yuan and you were close when you were younger.

486
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,240
Would you like to ask for leniency for him?

487
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
I can give him a way out.

488
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,360
Your Majesty,

489
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,220
please be fair and just.

490
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,150
I have only one request.

491
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,640
Go ahead.

492
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Don't get my descendants involved.

493
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
If you're hungry,

494
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,050
you may ask someone outside the palace.

495
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
I'm not hungry.

496
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,840
I'm just not used to it

497
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,730
since this is my first time to sleep in the palace.

498
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,969
Master, are you worried about something?

499
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,560
Well.

500
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,920
You seem to be worried about something too tonight.

501
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm young

502
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,730
without many past stories,

503
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,360
so I don't have the chance to be worried.

504
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,159
I found that you were not in the mood

505
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,639
as soon as you came back.

506
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,710
What's actually going on?

507
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,580
The wine I'm drinking

508
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,760
is called Sangluo.

509
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,080
It's usually granted to

510
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,600
meritorious officials.

511
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,050
My father once granted it to

512
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,010
a general who claimed to

513
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,610
drink lots of wine without getting drunk.

514
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,080
However, he was drunk for half a month

515
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,140
after drinking several liters of it.

516
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,340
The wine is strong

517
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,910
and I've drunk much tonight.

518
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,240
So if you have any worries,

519
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,750
just tell me.

520
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,130
I won't remember anything tomorrow.

521
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,460
Did His Majesty bring it here?

522
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,890
We buried it here before.

523
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,250
We buried it in many places in the palace.

524
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,560
Who buried it with you?

525
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,340
Several friends.

526
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,660
In childhood.

527
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,800
Was the person with you?

528
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,520
Yes.

529
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,080
He's really drunk

530
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,600
and tells me everything.

531
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,960
So will you take the person out of the palace this time?

532
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,040
The person has committed a severe crime,

533
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,770
and I have no reason to save him.

534
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,320
Your eyes are red.

535
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,800
I haven't slept well,

536
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,920
so my eyes are red.

537
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,840
Shiyi.

538
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,020
We've known each other for such a long time that

539
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,080
you can't cheat me.

540
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,090
The person knows you for a longer time.

541
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,330
Did my military advisor tell you this?

542
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,960
When His Majesty was here,

543
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,290
they chatted about this

544
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,080
and I heard that.

545
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,400
His Majesty just asked me

546
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,690
whether I would ask for leniency for the person just now.

547
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,560
Why would you ask for leniency?

548
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,880
Because of the surname Gao?

549
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
Liu Yuan's surname is not Gao.

550
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,550
You...you've been talking about Liu Yuan?

551
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,170
Who else should I be talking about?

552
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,680
Let this go.

553
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,040
Go to bed early.

554
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
Master, where are you going?

555
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,680
There's curfew in the palace.

556
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,540
You could be taken as an assassin.

557
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,640
Why are you following me?

558
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,720
I'm afraid you would be in danger.

559
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,080
Why?

560
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,360
You've drunk a lot tonight.

561
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,320
Actually, I can drink a lot.

562
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,080
That's right.

563
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,240
What's right?

564
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,280
Mom once read me several lines

565
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,240
about you.

566
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,320
“Lying on the beach with numerous corpses after getting drunk

567
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
indulges in singing”

568
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,080
I should have realized that

569
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,240
you can drink a lot.

570
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,740
The crazy things I did at a young age

571
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,270
was actually written down.

572
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,690
There were not enough soldiers back then

573
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,010
and we didn't know if we would survive,

574
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,470
so I could indulge myself.

575
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,960
Just put this on.

576
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,340
You put it on.

577
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,170
I'm not cold.

578
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,370
Come here.

579
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,220
Master, what are you digging for?

580
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,840
Wine.

581
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,000
I'll see an old friend in a while.

582
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,520
He buried the wine with me.

583
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,900
We promised to

584
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,520
get it out

585
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,480
and celebrate my victorious comeback.

586
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,800
Who are you?

587
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,440
Let me go!

588
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,560
Do you still want to be alive?

589
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,320
Do you hear me?

590
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,000
Let me go!

591
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,300
Aren't you afraid of getting your families and relatives killed?

592
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,280
Hurry up and let me go!

593
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,400
Who are you?

594
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,520
Tell me!

595
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,120
Who are you?

596
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,800
Who...who are you?

597
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,920
Who actually are you?

598
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,600
You!

599
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
That makes sense.

600
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,010
Only you will come to see me.

601
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,750
I've dug this jar of wine out

602
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,350
to meet you for the last time.

603
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,760
I should have

604
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,080
asked Empress Gao to

605
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,760
kill you back then.

606
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,480
Thanks for caring about me when we were young.

607
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,170
I cared about one who wants my life now.

608
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,160
Give me some wine.

609
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,560
My throat is sore.

610
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,560
Well.

611
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,400
You're the only one

612
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,940
that makes me concede defeat.

613
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,460
Do you have any unfulfilled wish?

614
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,570
I've been arrogating power in court for years

615
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,360
and I've enjoyed the dignity as an emperor.

616
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,320
I have no pities.

617
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,690
Is there any family member

618
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,150
you need me to take care of?

619
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,360
I have a son.

620
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,280
I'll have him escorted back to Pingcheng

621
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,940
so that he can escape this misfortune.
