1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The End

60
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 18

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Last time I came,

62
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
this hall has been built.

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The first one to find this place

64
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is Second Brother.

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Last time I left you

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and left the camp,

67
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
it was here.

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Good name.

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's Master's name.

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's Shiyi's idea.

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I just said it

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
by myself.

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No wonder you

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
hid the dowry here.

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You guys go up the mountain.

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll wait for you down the mountain.

77
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll carry you.

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But you can't.

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Senior,

80
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
let's fight.

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's go.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
After everything is done,

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
this place is a place

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
for the cultivation of the family.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why do you insist on being a monk?

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Can't you stay in the Wang Mansion?

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I asked for Master.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He treats you as a military counselor,

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
but you only want to cultivate.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm also too hurt by his heart.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ooh.

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Welcome.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You must be so excited to have woken up.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You didn't expect me to be in the classroom already.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,920
Did you meet any problems in Nanxiao?

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,360
Or are you unhappy with His Highness?

97
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,120
What does it have to do with my master?

98
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,440
His Highness wasn't in the palace in the past.

99
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,120
You waited for the news of the King's victory and His Highness's victory.

100
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,720
Now His Highness is in the palace.

101
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,400
But you're hiding here and not seeing him.

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
It's because you have some free time between your master and disciple.

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,120
I'm not at ease if I don't have half of the books.

104
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,300
The Dazhou Festival.

105
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,500
Distinguish it to the best of the best.

106
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:21,120
Madam, the

107
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
I don't know if my original plan is suitable.

108
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I should send it to the Taiyuan County near here.

109
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,920
Because I'm blind, I was taken in by you.

110
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
I'm more fortunate to be taken in by the military counselor.

111
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,320
I know.

112
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
So you were given the name Xie Chen by the military counselor.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,320
To threaten me to take you in.

114
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Aren't you curious about this?

115
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
I'm not.

116
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
I'm just a little bit worried.

117
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm afraid that I'll be in danger.

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,520
Aren't you curious about

119
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
why you took me in alone?

120
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Is there a special reason?

121
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
You told me that

122
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
there was a girl in the mansion who had amnesia.

123
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
When she saw me, she remembered that girl.

124
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,520
What do you want to ask?

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Ask...

126
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,320
A marriage.

127
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,920
If you don't answer, you just want to ask.

128
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,720
Then let's have a marriage.

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,920
Miss.

130
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,920
His Highness asked you to come over.

131
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,320
Okay.

132
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,320
You stay here and take care of Xie Chen.

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,320
Are you making up for it?

134
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,520
I'm not.

135
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,520
I'm just a little bit worried.

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

137
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,720
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm worried that you'll be in danger.

139
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,520
No.

140
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
No.

141
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Go get ready.

142
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
Yes.

143
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,720
There are two guests in the mansion.

144
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,320
Both of them are related to you.

145
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,520
Both of them are related to you.

146
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Back then,

147
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I mistook you for a concubine.

148
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,520
Do you remember?

149
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,520
Yes.

150
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,320
You...

151
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
You can talk?

152
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,720
Well...

153
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,320
I can speak a few years ago.

154
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,120
That's great.

155
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,920
Well...

156
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,320
Your disciple can't speak.

157
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,920
Your master is the one who's worried.

158
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
You don't know.

159
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
The two years you just became his disciple,

160
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,520
he's a famous doctor in the country.

161
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
And he also said that

162
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
you're sick.

163
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,920
He's afraid that you'll be afraid

164
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,120
when you see those doctors.

165
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,520
So he went to see those doctors himself.

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,120
He's so good at medicine.

167
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,720
He learned from those doctors secretly.

168
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,520
You...

169
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
What brings you here this time?

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm here for something important.

171
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,720
The court gave me Yongcheng.

172
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,320
You protected Yongcheng.

173
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,320
I want to thank you

174
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
for the people of Yongcheng.

175
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
You're welcome.

176
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,120
This is the first.

177
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
The second.

178
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,720
I brought Huaiyang here.

179
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm here to see Xiguo off.

180
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,720
You're right.

181
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,120
I didn't want him to see me off.

182
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,920
But he heard that he was passing by Xizhou

183
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,920
and wanted to see his old friend.

184
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,720
He has no family here.

185
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,720
He said you're his family.

186
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,120
He's going to pass by next month.

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Congratulations.

188
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,720
Congratulations.

189
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,520
Thank you.

190
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,320
I'll be back in three days.

191
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
I'll leave Huaiyang to you.

192
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
Goodbye.

193
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
The life is full of changes.

194
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,520
Who would have thought

195
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
that the one trapped in the palace by the Empress Dowager

196
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,520
became the Princess Consort after escaping?

197
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,920
Master.

198
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,520
Your Highness.

199
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,120
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,320
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,520
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,120
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,520
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,120
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,720
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,520
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,920
Master, you can go in by yourself.

215
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,320
I have Gao's and Cui's old houses with him.

216
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,720
It's not convenient to meet.

217
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,120
You can go with me.

218
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,120
Me?

219
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
He's a practitioner with a hair.

220
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,520
You're a practitioner.

221
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
Maybe you have something to say.

222
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,520
What are you afraid of?

223
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,920
What can I be afraid of?

224
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,520
Are you afraid of being alone with your family

225
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,920
or afraid of misunderstanding by another family?

226
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,720
You really know how to laugh at people.

227
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,320
After all, you have been practicing for ten years in the red dust.

228
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Your Highness.

229
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,720
Lord Fengyang.

230
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Princess Consort.

231
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,520
I don't know if Lord Fengyang

232
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,320
can let me and Your Highness

233
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,720
talk to each other alone.

234
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,320
I...

235
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,720
You and I are different.

236
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
It's more appropriate to have an outsider.

237
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,720
Zhou Shengchen, who hates the law of etiquette the most,

238
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,120
is now tied up by him.

239
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,520
The etiquette is sometimes a burden.

240
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,320
Sometimes it's a shortcut to avoid the gossip.

241
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Is Princess Consort the first time to come to Xizhou?

242
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,520
Yes.

243
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,120
Then you should walk around.

244
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,520
This is the ancient capital of the Shu Dynasty.

245
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
The scenery is different from other places.

246
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
I also want to see

247
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,720
the places Your Highness has been guarding for years.

248
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,520
Princess Consort wants to travel Xizhou at night.

249
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,120
His Highness asked you to prepare for it.

250
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Master also goes?

251
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,920
Your Highness.

252
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,520
There are hidden books to be sent out of Xizhou tomorrow.

253
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
I'll go and check them.

254
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,920
You've given thousands of books.

255
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Why are you sending them again?

256
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,920
I've read all these books.

257
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,920
It can only be a hidden item if you stay here.

258
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,520
There are many Han-style disciples in the Academy.

259
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
They love books as if they were their own.

260
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,120
It's more useful to give them.

261
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,720
All the generals are accompanying the guests.

262
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
You're hiding here.

263
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,320
Those who don't know will think you're having a fight with His Highness.

264
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Your Highness.

265
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,320
I think the carriage is still outside.

266
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,720
It's not too late to go now.

267
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I don't want to go.

268
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,920
Love is like fate.

269
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Meeting you really makes me feel fortunate.

270
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Master, why didn't you go?

271
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,920
I'm going to follow My Lord's order to tourism bureau.

272
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,520
Your Lordship wants to know about our future.

273
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
If you're curious,

274
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,120
we can cover for you and He Yuxi.

275
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,720
Your Lordship.

276
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,520
It's not easy for me to confess

277
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
to His Lordship.

278
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,520
I'm going.

279
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,920
I'm going with Your Lordship.

280
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,120
Your Lordship's majesty,

281
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm not going.

282
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,160
You can play it more.

283
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,320
They have already left.

284
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,500
I'm waiting for you.

285
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,880
I saw you didn't come down, so I came up to rush you.

286
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,920
Wait for me to do what?

287
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,720
Traveling Xizhou City at night.

288
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,720
Where to travel?

289
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,720
It's the famous Wei Yang Palace, Chang Le Palace and Ming Guang Palace in Xizhou City.

290
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
There's no one. What's there to travel?

291
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
It's because there's no one.

292
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Go out from Wei Yang Palace and go to Xi'an Gate.

293
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
See the famous E Pang Palace.

294
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
It's all burned. What's so good about it?

295
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Burned, it was also the world's first palace.

296
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,720
It's a special mood to enjoy the moon.

297
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Let's go.

298
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Then we won't wait for Master.

299
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Is he going?

300
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
He...

301
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Not going?

302
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
He's not going. He has his own arrangements.

303
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Tonight, only we accompany the guest.

304
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Your Highness.

305
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
You are...

306
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Open the door.

307
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Yes.

308
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Open the door.

309
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Why don't you accompany him?

310
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Who said I would accompany him?

311
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Lord Feng Yang said.

312
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
He said he would accompany me.

313
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
The people of the South Kingdom's palace, that's General Zhou.

314
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
General Zhou!

315
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Where are they going?

316
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Xi'an Gate.

317
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
What about us?

318
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Go out of the city.

319
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Zheng Xiao Fan.

320
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Go.

321
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Go.

322
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
What are you doing?

323
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Nothing.

324
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Tonight's West Zhou is as lively as Yuan Xiao Jie.

325
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
There must be a secret.

326
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Go.

327
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
In the past, West Zhou was a capital.

328
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
The royal cooks lived here.

329
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Later, the customs were formed and this street was built.

330
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
It's a four-sea town.

331
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
You come here often?

332
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
I come here often when I first arrived in West Zhou.

333
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Do you want to eat?

334
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Let's go.

335
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
I'll take you to eat something better.

336
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Come and have a look.

337
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
There are many dishes.

338
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
This is it.

339
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
The chief's fried meat.

340
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
There are many dishes.

341
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Come and have a look.

342
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Fresh lamb skin, lamb head, lamb.

343
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
There are many dishes.

344
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Come and have a look.

345
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Come and have a look.

346
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
May I ask if this gentleman can let us share a table?

347
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
We brought weapons.

348
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
We just found a lot of seats.

349
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
They dare not share the table.

350
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Please.

351
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Thank you.

352
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
You also came from outside the city.

353
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Eat this fresh lamb.

354
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Yes, how about you?

355
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Search for a famous person to build a palace and make a name.

356
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Did you find it?

357
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Our brothers came to West Zhou to run for the king of Nanchen.

358
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
It's a pity that...

359
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
The soup is coming.

360
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Your soup.

361
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Thank you.

362
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Brother, come.

363
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Thank you.

364
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Please enjoy.

365
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
What is a pity?

366
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Follow this man in West Zhou.

367
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,720
I can only fight for a good reputation.

368
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
We want to get what we can't get.

369
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
We sell our lives not for fame.

370
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
It's for wealth and future.

371
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Yes.

372
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
This little boy doesn't like gold and silver.

373
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Doesn't like the country.

374
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Even women don't like it.

375
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
I heard everyone here said that.

376
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Follow his general.

377
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
It's all like this.

378
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Don't ask for rewards, just ask for revenge.

379
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
We can't do this kind of person.

380
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
So?

381
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Who do you want to steal?

382
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Who do you want to steal?

383
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
The financial of the Taiyuan Army.

384
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Follow him.

385
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
At least he will have no worries and no worries about wealth.

386
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Come.

387
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Don't put it in the soup.

388
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
It's delicious.

389
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
To say that the 13th Army of Northern Chen

390
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
only the King of Southern Chen

391
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
can be called as the 13th Army of Northern Chen.

392
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
It's the best of the best.

393
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Because the leader is good.

394
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
He doesn't want the emperor's surname.

395
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
He doesn't like the country and the beauty.

396
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
In the world, he is the only one

397
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
who can be the reputation of the Beauty Valley.

398
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Good.

399
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Good.

400
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Your Highness.

401
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,720
I was thinking that you are...

402
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Miss Cui.

403
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Don't talk nonsense.

404
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Be careful to change the names of the King and the King's army.

405
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Yes.

406
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Your Highness is going to Wei River again.

407
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Open the gate and bring the horse here.

408
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Yes.

409
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
The King's King's Palace

410
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Does my master come here often?

411
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
The first time I was seriously injured

412
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
was here.

413
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
When I was a teenager,

414
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,720
that battle was a first.

415
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Half of the King's injury

416
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
left a blood stain on the stone mountain.

417
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
That time I was not happy.

418
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
I was drunk here.

419
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Actually, there is no benefit to follow me.

420
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
There is no benefit.

421
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
For many years,

422
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
the King's army has made countless contributions.

423
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
But I was guarded by the court.

424
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
I was only able to give the following subordinates

425
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
what they deserve.

426
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
I am sorry for them.

427
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,720
We never asked for these.

428
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
The people who understand you

429
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,720
are not only in the King's Army and the King's Mansion.

430
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
When I was guarding the Emperor's Mansion,

431
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
my mother and I often talked about you.

432
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
I told my mother that

433
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
in the eyes of outsiders,

434
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
the King's Army of South City has 700,000 soldiers.

435
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
It is indispensable.

436
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
But the more soldiers we have, the less soldiers we have.

437
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
There are not many people who are in the army.

438
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
If we keep fighting like this,

439
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
the stronger the King's Army is,

440
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
the more people we have.

441
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
My mother said that

442
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
the soldiers who fight against the enemy

443
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
are not important.

444
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
The people of Xizhou

445
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,720
have guarded Xizhou for half a lifetime.

446
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
If one day we are defeated,

447
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,720
we will leave with a wish.

448
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
My mother also said that

449
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
the country is full of heroes,

450
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
but heroes are in the past.

451
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
I am not a hero.

452
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
I have my own thoughts.

453
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I also have things that I want to do,

454
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
but I can't do.

455
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
It's going to rain.

456
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
I'm going to the front.

457
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
I don't want to go back to the city.

458
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
The disciple said that the city gate is too far away.

459
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Find a place to shelter first.

460
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Wait for the rain to stop before going back.

461
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
No matter where you go,

462
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
you have to go to the front.

463
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Are you going to the back first?

464
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
The rain goes well.

465
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
How can I let youOkay Alas

466
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
have You never understand

467
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
When did you build this palace?

468
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Master is famous for his skills.

469
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
He has been to all the palaces.

470
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
You believe it? He has never been here.

471
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
The things he did were all done by the Grand Master.

472
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
He didn't come because he was afraid that someone would say that he had an emperor?

473
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Master doesn't care about others' words.

474
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
He said that if a general lost his reputation,

475
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
the army would be disbanded.

476
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
The three provinces in the north are only Xizhou.

477
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
No one dares to come here.

478
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Only because there is Zhou Shengchen here.

479
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
I...

480
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,720
How dare you!

481
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
No one has ever said that to me.

482
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
You said you wanted to become a monk.

483
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
But you didn't.

484
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I didn't.

485
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
I didn't.

486
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I didn't.

487
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
I didn't.

488
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
You said you wanted to become a monk.

489
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
But you still want to be a second prince.

490
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Where are you going?

491
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
I'm going to a different place to avoid the rain.

492
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Go inside.

493
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Come.

494
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Let's go.

495
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
How did you know that there is a abandoned house here?

496
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
I ordered the villagers to move away.

497
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
In the past, the soldiers of the local army

498
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
were mostly killed by the south.

499
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Only a dozen of families were left.

500
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
The old and the young were all left.

501
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Xiao Yu moved them away a few years ago.

502
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
They were settled in Xizhou.

503
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Thank you.

504
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I told you to wipe your hair first.

505
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Why do you keep wiping your face?

506
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
You'll get sick if you keep washing your hair for a whole night.

507
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
No habits.

508
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Get out, you bitch!

509
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
I'll get out too.

510
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
My bro.

511
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
You bitch.

512
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Get in.

513
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Sit down.

514
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Do you still want to be on the train?

515
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
I'll hit you if it's raining too hard.

516
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
This is my place.

517
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
I'll explain everything to you.

518
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
idet my money so that you don't have to glue it up.

519
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,780
Let's forget about your auxiliaries forever.

520
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,720
It's all in the past.

521
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Why do you say so?

522
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:20,400
The

523
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:27,400
child is on the right line.

524
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,600
What should we do?

525
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,260
We should go to the institute to arrive

526
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,740
and find Outer Plains.

527
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,760
What about the route?

528
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,340
We will meet outside the seine

529
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,220
and make a decision premier.

530
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,420
Are we leaving?

531
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,600
I don't know the外面的情况

532
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,780
Lets wait for a moment first

533
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,180
Friends outside

534
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,780
It's too close to the west.

535
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,380
We should be safe.

536
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,580
I understand.

537
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,180
What are you afraid of?

538
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,580
We're defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

539
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,580
No one knows which army is fighting around here.

540
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

541
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,780
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

542
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

543
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

544
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

545
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

546
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

547
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

548
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

549
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

550
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

551
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

552
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

553
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

554
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

555
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

556
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,380
I'm afraid that we'll be defeated when we meet the King of Southern Chen.

557
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,140
Myiciónenairi

558
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
I had no idea what went on in my house.

559
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,420
I was afraid that Miss Shang Dao would break into my house and want to see Your Highness.

560
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
Who are all these people you got in knowing this person?

561
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,160
My

562
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,560
witness said

563
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,560
there was a DCX from inside your house.

564
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,060
Read from people in my house. Don't hurt them by mistake.

565
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,480
Alright.

566
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,380
Your Highness.

567
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,180
Greetings, Your Highness.

568
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,780
I'm sorry to have misjudged you.

569
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,580
It's okay.

570
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,580
Zhang Sunjie,

571
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,780
boil a pot of hot water for them next door.

572
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,580
And the wine and meat.

573
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,580
Treat them well.

574
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
I'll do as you say.

575
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,980
Thank you, Your Highness.

576
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

577
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,580
I'll go get some water.

578
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,580
Why did you save Liu Changshan?

579
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,180
He recommended me

580
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,980
to Dr. Zui Luo.

581
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,580
Then why did you kill him?

582
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,980
Yongcheng was surrounded.

583
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,380
He colluded with foreign enemies,

584
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,780
betrayed the governor and his accomplices.

585
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,780
So,

586
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,780
you knew you would offend me.

587
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,980
You even went back to the government before you died

588
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,580
just to kill him.

589
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,580
That's right.

590
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,380
You may leave now.

591
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,380
I threatened you.

592
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
You didn't want to kill me?

593
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,380
Tonight, you killed for loyalty.

594
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
If I take this opportunity to take you back to Xizhou,

595
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,180
I'm afraid I can't tell the dead governor

596
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,980
and the soldiers who died in Yongcheng.

597
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:14,980
Come.

598
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,580
I'll go get some water.

599
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,580
I'll go get some water.

600
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
Thank you, Your Highness.

601
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Thank you for not killing me.

602
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,580
But I still hope that

603
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,780
you won't let the enemy go easily in the future.

604
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,580
Don't do anything bad again.

605
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,580
Let him go.

606
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,980
Let's go back to Xizhou before dawn.

607
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,780
Yes.

608
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,180
You go have a rest.

609
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,580
I'll guard the fire.

610
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,180
Aren't you tired?

611
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,580
I'm not at ease to let him go.

612
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,380
I'll teach you a lesson.

613
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,380
Everything that has happened

614
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,580
is inevitable.

615
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,380
It's no use talking too much.

616
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Since you don't want to sleep,

617
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,980
why don't we draw a chessboard?

618
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,980
Let's play together.

619
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,780
I often talk to you.

620
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,780
Really?

621
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,580
What do we talk about?

622
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
There are many things.

623
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,380
There are big and small things.

624
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
For example,

625
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:38,100
the title of your uncle's

626
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:43,780
and the word you added in front of it.

627
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,580
Because of this word,

628
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,580
you were taught by the late emperor

629
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,580
to be the emperor.

630
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
That was what my brother

631
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,980
scolded others.

632
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,180
Just because you made a contribution?

633
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,980
Didn't the late emperor

634
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,180
really suspect you?

635
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
That's not important.

636
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Why is it not important?

637
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,780
You have been leading the army for many years.

638
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,980
You have no family or children.

639
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,380
If you still suspect me,

640
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,980
I'll feel wronged for you.

641
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
I'm leading the army

642
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,580
not to protect the country,

643
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,980
but to prevent the fire in the capital from burning.

644
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,780
I just hope

645
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,980
that the people can keep their word.

646
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,980
General, the rain has stopped.

647
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,380
Your Highness and Miss are so close.

648
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,380
I thought they were a couple.

649
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,980
It's been an hour since the rain stopped.

650
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,780
You're still not tired?

651
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,180
I'm afraid you'll say that.

652
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,380
Your Highness opened this half-shan door.

653
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
This half-shan door

654
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,780
protects Miss Cui's

655
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,780
reputation and reputation.

656
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,580
You won again.

657
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,580
You're so good.

658
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
How can I be your master if I don't win you?

659
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,380
You must have something to keep

660
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,180
so that you can pass on all your skills to me.

661
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,980
You admit it?

662
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,780
I admit it.

663
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
Still not resting?

664
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,580
Again.

665
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,180
Again?

666
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,580
Then I'll win the next round

667
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,180
This chessboard is much more troublesome than chess.

668
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,980
Zhao Sunjie.

669
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,380
What can I do for you, Your Highness?

670
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
Can you play chess?

671
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
Well...

672
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,180
Forget it.

673
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,380
Get some food.

674
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,580
Yes, Your Highness.

675
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,380
Call back when you're ready.

676
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,080
Let's go.

677
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,680
Wait.

678
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,680
When master comes back,

679
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,280
he will meet many people.

680
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,080
Your highness, we can set off now.

681
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:07,880
Okay.

682
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,780
Which one is��들이l Hai wants to choose?

683
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
I really don't know.

684
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,300
Not even a Sara tint.

685
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,560
Xiao Feng,

686
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,620
don't call me farther!

687
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,820
Please take my hand for me.

688
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,300
Me?

689
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,180
Yes.

690
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,340
I don't know

691
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,520
Can you hear the sound?

692
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,080
Come here first.

693
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,860
Be careful.

694
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,840
Yes, the direction is right. Be careful of your feet.

695
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,920
What are you doing?

696
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,340
What can I do?

697
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,300
Touch the wooden chair.

698
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,620
You will feel the bamboo stick.

699
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,380
Come on.

700
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,380
Harder.

701
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,020
Thanks.

702
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
You're welcome.

703
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,020
You can't see it.

704
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,020
I can't leave.

705
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,860
But I can be your partner.

706
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,740
I don't want to be your partner.

707
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,780
You don't like me?

708
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,100
You talk too much.

709
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,420
Zhao...

710
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,420
You...

711
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,780
Be careful.

712
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,980
It's rare to hear Xie Shen talk to someone so much.

713
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,180
It's rare that you have time to talk to me.

714
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,420
You've been here for so long.

715
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,420
It's time to go out.

716
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
I'm not going out.

717
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,540
I'll consume the energy to protect myself.

718
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,100
I'd rather stay here and sunbathe.

719
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,900
I don't want to cause you trouble.

720
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,500
Master asked me several times.

721
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,620
What suitable place to let you go.

722
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,900
I want to ask your opinion.

723
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,980
I have my own idea.

724
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,340
I don't need to trouble you.

725
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Where do you want to go?

726
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,020
I thought you'd be upset.

727
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,380
You wouldn't let me go.

728
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,860
Qingyan sent a letter.

729
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,820
The military is afraid of not being able to survive the winter.

730
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,660
I want to send someone to pick him up.

731
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,380
It's good to pick him up.

732
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,100
You're upset, so you want to change the topic?

733
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,740
Do you want to prove it to me or to yourself?

734
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,780
You're still the Zhou Shengchen who's as stubborn as a fish.

735
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
You're wrong.

736
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,060
I'm never a person who's as stubborn as a fish.

737
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,500
Huayang Lian asked for your permission.

738
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,620
I've already asked someone to prepare a carriage for you.

739
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,540
General Zhou and General Feng will send you to Yongcheng.

740
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,940
Goodbye.

741
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,900
This time, Lord Fengyang...

742
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,300
I'll go first.

743
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Your Highness, I want to see the child of Gao family.

744
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
Who told you?

745
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
It's King of Pingqing.

746
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,700
One day, he comforted me and told me about this.

747
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,660
I never told anyone else.

748
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,540
I just wanted to see that child.

749
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,580
He's the smartest person in the manor.

750
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,260
Once you go there,

751
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
he'll definitely find something strange.

752
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,580
I've seen all of your disciples in Zhongzhou.

753
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,660
Can you tell me who it is?

754
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,580
Your Highness.
