Welcome shadows to the chalice To listen to our answers

8
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You have to think about it.

9
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
The situation is critical.

10
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
We must be careful.

11
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I believe my parents will understand.

12
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Let's go.

13
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Heaven is above.

14
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
The Three Kings are below.

15
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
I, Cui Fang, hereby declare

16
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
that I, Cui, the King of Nanchen,

17
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
will die for the people,

18
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
for the people of the world,

19
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
and for the innocent soldiers.

20
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Today, I will start the battle with Shouyang.

21
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Start the battle!

22
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Start the battle!

23
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Start the battle!

24
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Start the battle!

25
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Start the battle!

26
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Start the battle!

27
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Start the battle!

28
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Start the battle!

29
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Start the battle!

30
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
The night King Qi left,

31
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
King Qinghe also snowed like this.

32
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
It was snowing heavily.

33
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
It was like today.

34
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Third Madam,

35
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
did you hear about it?

36
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Prince Qi has abandoned Cui Xing

37
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
and is going to fight with Shouyang.

38
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
His Majesty has ordered

39
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
to take revenge on Prince Qi.

40
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
He must not hurt his life.

41
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Now,

42
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Prince Qi has abandoned Cui Xing.

43
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Will he anger His Majesty?

44
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
With the character of the Third Prince,

45
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
he will never accept the invitation.

46
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Since he has decided to do so,

47
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
let him go.

48
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
But,

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
he really went along with the King of Nanchen.

50
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
He is a man of the family.

51
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
He doesn't want it.

52
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
What a cool guy.

53
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
He is a man of the family.

54
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Yes, he is not like us.

55
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
He is very worried.

56
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Has Mr. Huan sent you a message?

57
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Not yet.

58
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Wait a little longer.

59
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Yes.

60
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
I haven't slept all night.

61
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Tea.

62
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Yes.

63
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Tea.

64
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
You six

65
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
are the only family of the Water Room.

66
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
There are hundreds of people in the court

67
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
who are in the military.

68
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
You are the only family of the Water Room.

69
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
You are the only family of the Water Room.

70
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
How many people will die

71
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
if you go against the wind?

72
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
How many people will die if you go against the wind?

73
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Have you ever thought about it?

74
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Gao Shi died because of one person.

75
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Qi Shi died because of one person.

76
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Qi Shi died because of one person.

77
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Do you want to

78
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
make them suffer?

79
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Here, have some water.

80
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Have some breakfast.

81
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Yes.

82
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I heard from them

83
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
that you were good at playing the zither since I was a child.

84
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I heard from them that you were good at playing the zither since I was a child.

85
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
I wanted to play a zither

86
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
in front of you on the day of the wind.

87
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
I'm afraid

88
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
it won't work.

89
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
I'll go call the doctor.

90
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I'll go call the doctor.

91
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
He didn't tell me anything.

92
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
He didn't tell me anything.

93
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Why can't he think for me?

94
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Why can't he think for me?

95
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Your Majesty,

96
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
a man who has been in Xi State for more than 20 years,

97
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
how dare he leave the emperor?

98
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Your Majesty.

99
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Zhou Shenchen

100
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
I will

101
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
make him pay

102
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
in front of all the people.

103
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
in front of all the people.

104
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Your Majesty.

105
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
He is the Crown Prince's son.

106
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
But I

107
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
am just a fake Crown Prince.

108
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
But I

109
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
am just a fake Crown Prince.

110
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Will the rain

111
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
also bloom?

112
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
I saw the wound on Shiyi's hand.

113
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
I saw the wound on Shiyi's hand.

114
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
If Your Majesty wants to see

115
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Yang Shi and Zhang Sun Shi,

116
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
you can't hurt him

117
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
before the ceremony.

118
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I only have one daughter.

119
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Everything is for her.

120
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Third Madam.

121
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Third Madam.

122
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
She doesn't believe me.

123
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
She has been in the mansion for many years.

124
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
She has been in the mansion for many years.

125
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
It's impossible

126
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
to make her believe the rebellion.

127
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
If Your Majesty is impatient,

128
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Why do you keep her in the palace?

129
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Why do you keep her in the palace?

130
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I know my daughter

131
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
best.

132
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
If I let her stay calm for a few days,

133
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
she will understand.

134
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
I understand.

135
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,960
I understand.

136
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
I ate a lot this morning.

137
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
I spent half an hour

138
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
in the yard.

139
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I was asked to find a ladder.

140
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I wanted to go to the roof of the palace.

141
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
But

142
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I was stopped by Li Xianren.

143
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
As Third Madam said,

144
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
she will understand.

145
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
She is her mother.

146
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
She knows her daughter.

147
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Clean the roof of the palace.

148
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Let the guards guard it.

149
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
She can see it if she wants.

150
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
As long as she doesn't go out of the palace,

151
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
she can do anything she wants.

152
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Yes.

153
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Wang Jun is back.

154
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Wang Jun is back.

155
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Why did you stay in Pianying?

156
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Jiangzhou, Shuozhou, Ao Zhan,

157
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
and Dazhou

158
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
were forgotten.

159
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
They were forgotten.

160
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
I remember you were

161
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
a beauty.

162
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
People were talking about you.

163
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
They threatened you.

164
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
I came to send a message.

165
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
I heard that you didn't sleep

166
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
for more than ten days

167
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
just to wait for him.

168
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Congratulations, Master.

169
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
You won the whole thing.

170
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
You won the whole thing.

171
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
You have no wife or children.

172
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
What is the purpose of this?

173
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
You have no wife or children.

174
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
What is the purpose of this?

175
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
You have no wife or children.

176
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
What is the purpose of this?

177
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
You have no wife or children.

178
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
What is the purpose of this?

179
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
You have no wife or children.

180
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
What is the purpose of this?

181
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
You have no wife or children.

182
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
What is the purpose of this?

183
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
You have no wife or children.

184
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
What is the purpose of this?

185
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
You have no wife or children.

186
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
What is the purpose of this?

187
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
You have no wife or children.

188
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
What is the purpose of this?

189
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
You have no wife or children.

190
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
What is the purpose of this?

191
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
G 다른 internationally

192
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,500
She doesn't use selector in beauty

193
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Stop giving her such a personality.

194
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,220
Are you going to

195
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,220
change her dress?

196
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Come on.

197
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,220
Close the door.

198
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:57,220
Jiangxi

199
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,220
East

200
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
YourWu Shui cave is flooded

201
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,960
My father sent liking

202
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,160
they are trapped in a game

203
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,620
they are trapped in一個

204
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:18,620
I don't know anything about this except me and His Majesty.

205
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,620
Your family is too high in the hearts of your students.

206
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,620
If you move to the south, I will really go to the kingdom.

207
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
I want to ask you why I want to tell you.

208
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,620
Maybe it's to threaten you with the lives of the Cui family.

209
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,620
I'm afraid that you will kill Liu Zixin on the night of the wedding.

210
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
I can't be the queen.

211
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Or maybe...

212
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Maybe...

213
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
Because we were friends for a night.

214
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:18,620
If I were you, no matter how painful it is, I must know the whole truth.

215
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,620
Thank you.

216
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,620
In the past, there has never been a noble consort who has such a strong side.

217
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,620
Your Majesty's thoughts about the noble consort are not understood by others.

218
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,620
I am a very clear person.

219
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,620
Tomorrow, I will have to work hard to get a good side.

220
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Noble consort, rest early.

221
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
Please.

222
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Everyone.

223
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
Third Miss.

224
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Third Miss.

225
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,620
Long time no see.

226
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,620
General Yang is still the same.

227
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
Today, Cui Guiping was conferred as the crown prince.

228
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
It's really a big event.

229
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,620
General Zhangsun is serious.

230
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,620
It's not conferring the queen.

231
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,620
Even if he conferred the queen, it's only temporary.

232
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,620
In our eyes, only Cui Guiping deserves to be the queen.

233
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
Yes.

234
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,620
Everyone, please come with me to the palace.

235
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Please.

236
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,620
Please.

237
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,620
Until today, I feel like I'm going to marry you.

238
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
Third Miss.

239
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,620
I want to talk to Cui Guiping alone.

240
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
Yes.

241
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,620
Last night, I dreamed of your father.

242
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:57,620
He married me, gave birth to you, and left the palace.

243
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,620
He never told me anything important.

244
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,620
But last night, he blamed me.

245
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,620
He blamed me for not bringing you to the palace.

246
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:17,620
He said that if you still stay in the palace, you will live a comfortable life.

247
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,620
Shiyi.

248
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,620
I know I was wrong.

249
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,620
I admit my mistake.

250
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,620
Mr. Huan is waiting for you in Nanxiao.

252
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,620
When you reach the south, you don't have to look back.

253
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
I'm sorry.

254
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,620
Mother.

255
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Forgive me for being unfilial.

256
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,620
There are over 2,000 scholars from the outside of the Grand Xia's gate,

257
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,620
waiting to worship Cui Guiping.

258
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,620
I'm sorry.

259
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
Greetings, Cui Guiping.

260
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,620
King Ping of Qin is waiting for you behind the scholars.

261
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,620
When Shaohuixing was defeated, you only had to run to the outside of the gate.

262
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
The scholars don't know the truth and dare not stop you.

263
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
The soldiers here are all my confidants.

264
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,620
Today, I will kill a living creature for you.

265
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,620
Your Majesty.

266
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:58,620
His Majesty has ordered that Cui Guiping is of a noble family.

267
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
He is the most respected scholar in the world.

268
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620
I'm happy to be here.

269
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,620
I'm here to give you a visit.

270
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,620
Greetings, Cui Guiping.

271
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
You can go out later.

272
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
We'll rush in immediately.

273
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,620
Yes.

274
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,620
Go.

275
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
Miss.

276
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,620
Why did you go back?

277
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
She didn't want to drag us down.

278
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
Why did Guiping have to enter the palace?

279
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,620
She wanted to see the people of Zhongzhou.

280
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Women can enter the palace for the rest of their lives.

281
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,620
It's not too late to be worshiped by the people.

282
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,620
Guiping.

283
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,620
I know that you want to exchange your life for mine.

284
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,620
I can't escape.

285
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,620
I can't let my mother die for me.

286
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,620
I can't drag Qinghe Army into the family.

287
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
Yang Shou.

288
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Miss Song.

289
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,620
I've been to the palace since I was a child.

290
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,620
I learned from my master.

291
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,620
I learned from my classmate.

292
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,620
I never had a way to repay him.

293
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,620
Now my master is dead.

294
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,620
My classmate is walking the wrong path.

295
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,620
The enemy is in the middle of the road.

296
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,620
I can't let him go.

297
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
I can't let him go.

298
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
I can't let him go.

299
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,620
I can't let him go.

300
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,620
I can't let him go.

301
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,620
The enemy is in the middle of the road, but I can't kill him.

302
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,620
It's a painful moment.

303
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,620
I can't marry him.

304
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,620
Today I'm unfilial.

305
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,620
Thank you for raising me.

306
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Please allow me to give up my life.

307
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,620
I'm not worthy of the name.

308
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Since then, Cui's family has been unfilial.

309
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Shiyi is just a Shiyi of the Nancheng family.

310
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,620
I haven't figured out how to call you.

311
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,620
Because you are my first student.

312
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,620
When I was a teacher, I couldn't change my name to Shiyi.

313
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Today I'll call you Shiyi.

314
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,620
Shiyi.

315
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
When I come back next time,

316
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,620
I'll call you Shiyi.

317
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,620
Or you can call me Zhou Shengchen.

318
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,620
I have a favorite person since I was a kid.

319
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,620
I've never told anyone.

320
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,620
Except my mother, no one knows.

321
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,620
I dare not tell anyone.

322
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,620
The Nancheng king

323
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,620
has been loyal to every soldier in the army.

324
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,620
He has served the country and the people.

325
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,620
The sun is shining.

326
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,620
There will be a day when the king will be clear.

327
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Zhou Shengchen.

328
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,620
I'm here to marry you.

329
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,620
If in the next life,

330
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,620
you marry me first,

331
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,620
will that be okay?

332
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
I'll marry you.

333
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,620
I'll marry you.

334
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
If you don't say anything,

335
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,620
I'll be your wife.

336
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Shiyi.

337
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,620
Shiyi.

338
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,620
The heart is a stage.

339
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,620
If love is a stage,

340
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,620
it will be a year of regret.

341
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,620
The pain is deep.

342
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:14,620
The hands are in the sea of pain.

343
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,620
But for you,

344
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,620
I'm willing to give up.

345
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
The river is like a flower.

346
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,620
The sword is like a horse.

347
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,620
The snake is like a snake.

348
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,620
The story is like a flower.

349
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,620
The world is full of sorrow.

350
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
One stroke is enough.

351
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,620
It's hard to stop.

352
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,620
I'm sorry.

353
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Shiyi.

354
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,620
Shiyi.

355
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,620
Shiyi.

356
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,620
Shiyi.

357
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,620
What's wrong?

358
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
What's wrong?

359
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
Miss...

360
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
Say it!

361
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Miss, you left the city

362
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
in a month.

363
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,620
General!

364
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
General!

365
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,620
General!

366
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,620
General!

367
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
General!

368
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
General!

369
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
General!

370
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,620
General!

371
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,620
Long live...

372
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,620
General!

373
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,620
Long live...

374
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,620
General!

375
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,620
Long live...

376
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,620
Bow!

377
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,620
You don't want to revenge?

378
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,620
You're right.

379
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,620
I have to go to the city

380
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,620
because I can't let go.

381
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,620
I've let go.

382
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,620
Fengqiao,

383
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,620
farewell.

384
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,620
I'm farewell.

385
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,620
I'm farewell.

386
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,620
General, I'll push.

387
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Push.

388
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
Yes.

389
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,620
The generals have left.

390
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,620
General Xie,

391
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,620
you won't stay either?

392
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,620
Xizhou has no one.

393
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
Why should I stay?

394
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,620
General,

395
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,620
I'm leaving.

396
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,620
This person is...

397
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,620
Don't say it.

398
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
Yes.

399
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
This person is my old friend.

400
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
He's going to leave.

401
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
He came to this place to stay.

402
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,620
It seems that the master and I

403
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,620
are fated to meet.

404
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
Yes.

405
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
Before I left,

406
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,620
I didn't come here.

407
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,620
I'm worried.

408
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,620
This place has been abandoned for a long time.

409
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,620
If it is rebuilt,

410
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,620
it is a merit.

411
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,620
We just checked it.

412
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,620
This place is the central axis.

413
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,620
There you can see the mountain gate, the demon hall.

414
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,620
The front yard, the back yard.

415
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,620
You can also see the four great palace halls,

416
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,620
the stone palace hall and the Luhan palace hall.

417
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
Third Brother.

418
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,620
Master, let's go in.

419
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,620
Let's go.

420
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,620
The End

421
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
The End

422
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,620
The End

423
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,620
The End

424
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,620
The End

425
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,620
The End
