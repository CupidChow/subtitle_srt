00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000

I'm sorry.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 14

60
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The moment of chasing a giant,

61
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
is there a white lion?

62
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
White Lion Coke reminds you that

63
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
the fun is about to begin.

64
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The First Episode

65
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The Hong Mo Chen clan

66
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
is also a family with high hopes.

67
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If they can marry Cui clan...

68
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hong Mo Chen Yue,

69
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I advise you to stop.

70
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Cui girl is the daughter

71
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
of the head of the Wushui Clan.

72
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yao clan is also the first choice of the six houses.

73
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A popular royal clan.

74
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,660
to ask for the royal family's approval and the Beichen family's approval

75
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,420
This matter is not your turn

76
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,660
I'm asking Miss Cui

77
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Whether or not

78
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,040
Miss, please let me give up

79
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't have the engagement

80
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,260
But I

81
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,820
HEAM

82
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,820
If I already choose the one

83
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
I'll be

84
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,220
my heart is determined

85
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Please return

86
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,660
So cute

87
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,140
If you are going to punish me,

88
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,860
you must tell him first.

89
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,740
Your Majesty,

90
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,740
I will stand here and stand guard the border for my whole life.

91
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,740
I will not marry my wife and leave any child.

92
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,740
Your Highness, are you serious?

93
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,740
If I don't have any child, there will be no reason to fight against the rebellion.

94
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,740
In this way, His Majesty will be at ease.

95
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,740
All the officials will be at ease.

96
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,740
I don't need to be troubled by rumors.

97
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,740
Get on it!

98
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,940
I dare you!

99
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,160
Attitude is not everything.

100
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,400
You can collision with the rebellion to eliminate the rebellion abuse.

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,580
Song of those ups and downs

102
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,880
will never end.

103
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,900
Di Ren Chief Eunuch,

104
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,140
Song of S passive strength

105
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,540
Emperor,

106
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,340
you must be There Hmph!

107
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,340
I'm really angry.

108
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
I'll just keep quiet.

109
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,340
The hardest thing to say in this world

110
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,340
is to cherish me.

111
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
I don't want you to leave.

112
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,340
I don't want you to leave.

113
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
His Highness is back.

114
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
I've cleaned up the room.

115
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
Your Highness, go and rest.

116
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,980
We're brothers.

117
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,340
I didn't go to sleep.

118
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,100
Every drop of it is like you

119
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Even if we have met before

120
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,580
Why didn't you sleep?

121
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,620
I was afraid that the mountain road would slip and I would be in danger

122
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,620
So I kept waiting in the house

123
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
You've been to the army in the desert

124
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,620
What's so hard about walking on the mountain road in the rain?

125
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
Oh

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,020
When are you going to start tomorrow?

127
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,200
I will start when the rain stops

128
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Then go home early

129
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,340
I can only see you for the rest of my life

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,340
It turns out that my life is useless

131
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,340
Only because you can't be left behind

132
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,340
When everything is back to normal

133
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,340
I can see clearly

134
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,340
Who's voice is ringing under the moon

135
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:42,340
It turns out that you are destined

136
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,340
Who's voice is ringing under the moon

137
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,340
Did you wake up too early

138
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,340
Or didn't sleep all night

139
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,560
Next time, I want to see your

140
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,340
I'm afraid I'm going to wait for you again

141
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,340
Your Highness, the teacher said he used to be like you

142
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,340
I watched the rain outside the bride's door for a night

143
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
I'm sorry

144
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
I'm sorry

145
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
I'm sorry

146
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
I'm sorry

147
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
I'm sorry

148
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
I'm sorry

149
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,340
I'm sorry

150
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
I'm sorry

151
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,340
What else did your teacher say

152
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,340
Your Highness, you actually guessed that the teacher has something to say

153
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
I understand his temperament the most

154
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,340
The teacher also said that they got married later

155
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,340
Longkang Academy is back

156
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,340
Thank you for the book

157
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,340
Mr. Huan, see you later

158
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,340
We will definitely meet again

159
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,340
We will definitely meet again

160
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
We don't have lotus pond here

161
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,340
Where is the lotus flower that the girl drew

162
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,340
In her heart

163
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Keep it

164
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,340
If she and her husband grow up in the future

165
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,340
Then this painting will be worth it

166
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
I'm with your couple

167
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
It's really fun

168
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
I sent it when I went

169
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Now I'm back and I picked it up

170
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
Chen family, you misunderstood

171
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
We are not like you

172
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Chen family

173
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
You walk here every day

174
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Have you heard or seen any interesting stories

175
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,340
This river is very beautiful

176
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,340
I've been here for a long time

177
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,340
I've been here for a long time

178
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
I've been here for a long time

179
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,340
I've been here for a long time

180
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
Have you seen any interesting stories

181
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,340
There are many stories about this river

182
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
The river that flows upstream of the Yangtze River

183
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
There is a river that is separated from the river

184
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
And after the West River was saved

185
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,340
It was cut down

186
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,340
Someone also said that he was with his loved one

187
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
He went to the five lakes

188
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,340
The girl likes happy ending

189
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,340
Better than Chen River

190
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
No need to talk about the ending

191
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Then talk about heroes

192
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
Zhou Lang Chi Bi

193
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,340
It seems that you have heard about the little lady

194
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Then talk about the recent

195
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,340
Four years ago

196
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
The little boy king of the north

197
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,340
The south of the army

198
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Built this river bank

199
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Just live in the army

200
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
He and a king of the south

201
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
Together

202
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,340
Built a small building

203
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
After that

204
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
The rest of the western and southern tribes

205
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,340
The head of the west and the north

206
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Come to this small building to make peace

207
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Dingjiang Tower

208
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
Where is the girl

209
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
A little bit dark

210
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,340
I heard that they were trying to Dingjiang

211
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Five people went back to the building one day

212
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Left ten years

213
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,340
The ten years of mutual support

214
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
Yes, yes, that's it

215
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,340
That building is right there

216
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,340
This time I let someone build a Dingjiang Tower

217
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,340
It's a pity that they have already demolished

218
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,340
Should be destroyed

219
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,340
They have already demolished

220
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Should take you to see

221
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,340
Dingjiang Tower

222
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,340
Dingjiang Ten Years of Mutual Support

223
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,340
That is a great achievement for the people

224
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,340
This year

225
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
I prepared for you

226
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,340
Birthday gift for years

227
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
You never gave me a back

228
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,340
Next time you come back

229
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Try to call me a teacher, okay?

230
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Or call a

231
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
Zhou Shengchen

232
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
That is the flag of the king of the south

233
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Welcome to the king

234
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
King

235
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,340
King

236
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,340
You can get off the boat

237
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
Come

238
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
King

239
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Teacher

240
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,340
Teacher

241
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,340
I heard that you crossed the river for me

242
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,340
I heard that the king almost offended the emperor of Nanxiao for me

243
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
Third Brother

244
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,340
If my brother's legs are not broken

245
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,340
Will definitely lead you to the country

246
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,340
Third Brother

247
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
I'm sorry

248
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
I'm going to your country

249
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,340
I'm late

250
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Please forgive me

251
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340
Third Brother

252
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
Fortunately you came back safely

253
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm already raising some soldiers

254
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,340
Ready to cross the river and rob people

255
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,440
Don't run, drink the tea

256
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,440
What're you doing?

257
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,440
What's up?

258
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,400
Jidgui

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,760
Jidgui

260
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,040
Jidgui

261
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,240
Jidgui

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Pocky

263
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,600
Pocky

264
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,020
Pocky

265
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,540
I'm going back to the city.

266
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,340
Okay.

267
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,540
I haven't been there.

268
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,860
Okay.

269
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,140
I'll go back and arrange it.

270
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,340
It's also Shiyi's wish to go to Shouyang.

271
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,780
I've always wanted to go.

272
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,220
I told you.

273
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,220
Master loves Shiyi the most.

274
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,260
Your Highness.

275
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm half a village.

276
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,180
I was sent by the king.

277
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,180
Nan Qian survived the disaster.

278
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,740
Now I can see you.

279
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,420
I have no regrets.

280
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,620
Get up.

281
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,580
Thank you for your help.

282
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,020
Your Highness.

283
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,100
Miss Huaiyang made this.

284
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,220
She said

285
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,060
you have to eat noodles on your birthday.

286
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,260
To keep you safe.

287
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,380
Listen to her.

288
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,740
To keep you safe.

289
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,460
Eat noodles.

290
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,460
It's delicious.

291
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,220
It's delicious.

292
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,860
Much better than what you made.

293
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,860
Listen to me.

294
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,180
There must be a lady master in this mansion.

295
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,100
The noodles are different.

296
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,620
Your Highness.

297
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,620
You're talking nonsense again.

298
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,220
She's just a maid.

299
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,620
How did she become the lady master of this mansion?

300
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,020
Did you hear what she said?

301
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,300
She doesn't like me, does she?

302
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,540
Your Highness.

303
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,340
Although she's a lowly lady.

304
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,460
But she's been

305
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,460
well-mannered and beautiful since she was a child.

306
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,980
She's not an ordinary person.

307
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,380
Your Highness.

308
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,300
You'd better look in the mirror.

309
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,340
You brat.

310
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,940
I'm used to you.

311
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,340
You're not a brat at all.

312
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,060
Look in the mirror?

313
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,780
Am I bad?

314
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,140
Not bad.

315
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,940
But the mirror is too small.

316
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,620
I can't see it all.

317
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,980
Your Highness.

318
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,300
Miss.

319
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:22,940
Your Highness.

320
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,100
Miss.

321
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,380
Miss.

322
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,900
Well...

323
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,100
I want to ask you.

324
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,780
Have you found the Anshan Courtyard

325
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,460
that His Highness asked you to look for?

326
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,940
No.

327
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,460
In my mansion,

328
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,820
there's no empty room

329
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,340
except for my mansion.

330
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,940
No.

331
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,100
Am I that bad?

332
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,940
You don't want to live here?

333
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,100
Huaiyang didn't mean that.

334
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,660
I'm just afraid that you'll be disturbed.

335
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,860
I'm not afraid of being disturbed.

336
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,260
I'm an old man who hasn't bloomed for a thousand years.

337
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,860
I wish I could see you every day.

338
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,660
Every day...

339
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,180
I've said

340
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,540
all the nonsense.

341
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,980
I won't take it back.

342
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,660
You have no place to live now.

343
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,980
You can live in my mansion.

344
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,180
What if you see me

345
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,540
and you like me?

346
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,540
Who's that?

347
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,580
Well...

348
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,700
Somebody!

349
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,500
Somebody!

350
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,780
Somebody!

351
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,220
Shouyang is small.

352
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,740
My mansion is smaller.

353
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,780
Please forgive me.

354
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,940
We have a guest.

355
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,700
Why didn't you ask me to come?

356
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,260
Uncle.

357
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,500
I'm afraid that I'll disturb you.

358
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,180
Are you afraid that you'll disturb me to have a rest?

359
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,580
Or are you afraid that I'll disturb you?

360
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,620
We haven't decided

361
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,740
on our own.

362
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,180
You don't have to tell me now.

363
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,140
What are you afraid of?

364
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,100
Uncle is an elder.

365
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,620
He can help you and me.

366
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,140
You should make a decision.

367
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,140
Otherwise, you and I

368
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,340
won't have a result

369
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,460
until next year.

370
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,580
Your Highness.

371
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,060
His Highness just came back from the south.

372
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,860
General Cui.

373
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,340
Take me to the imperial court.

374
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,700
Your Highness, please.

375
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,180
Your Highness, please come with me.

376
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,100
They don't look like a couple.

377
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,860
Did they get along well

378
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,140
in Cui's mansion?

379
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
I live in the academy alone in my house.

380
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,460
I don't live with them.

381
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,700
It's hard to be a husband and wife.

382
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,220
Don't be so suspicious of

383
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,260
the relationship between husband and wife.

384
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,460
Maybe

385
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,740
they are having a conflict.

386
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,500
I don't know.

387
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,540
I just want to know.

388
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,500
I just want to know.

389
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,380
I just want to know.

390
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,340
I just want to know.

391
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,300
I just want to know.

392
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,500
They are having a conflict.

393
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,540
We bumped into them.

394
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,660
Let's go in first.

395
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,340
Let's go.

396
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,780
I'll live with you tonight.

397
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,220
Are you worried about me?

398
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,380
You are his sister

399
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,740
and also his master's apprentice.

400
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,220
It's okay if you go in and listen to him.

401
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,140
I guess you mean

402
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,740
the official affairs,

403
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,020
not private affairs.

404
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,100
You can listen to him

405
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,060
for me and the military counselor.

406
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,740
We can handle

407
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,180
any situation.

408
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,620
Give it to me.

409
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,620
How can I let you sing?

410
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,140
You don't have experience

411
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,100
in how to entertain His Highness.

412
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,900
Give it to me.

413
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,420
In case you do something wrong.

414
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,260
Where are the maids?

415
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,460
They are in the mansion.

416
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,380
I brought tea and water for Master.

417
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,580
I'm afraid that the maids can't do it well.

418
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,020
What you just said

419
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,380
is your own opinion

420
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,580
or Cui Feng's?

421
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,580
It's not what I meant.

422
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,580
I just want to know.

423
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,700
I just want to know.

424
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,820
I just want to know.

425
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,860
I just want to know.

426
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,820
I just want to know.

427
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,860
I just want to know.

428
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,900
I just want to know.

429
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,980
I don't want to go to Chongzhou.

430
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,620
You've guarded Shouyang for so long.

431
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,140
You've guarded it in the capital.

432
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,740
Do you want to guard it forever?

433
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,220
Yes.

434
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,300
I want to guard it forever.

435
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,060
My feelings for Shouyang

436
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,820
are much deeper than that of Cui Jiang

437
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,180
and Xizhou.

438
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,260
I've guarded Zicheng

439
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,700
since I joined the army.

440
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,060
I made a vow

441
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,420
when I didn't marry the princess.

442
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,860
I'll guard Zicheng

443
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,180
until I can't pull the sword

444
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,660
and I can't get on the horse.

445
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,900
Is Shouyang more important

446
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
or your future child?

447
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,140
What did you say?

448
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,180
I grew up in Chongzhou.

449
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,700
I can't stand the water and soil here.

450
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,420
I have to go back no matter what.

451
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,820
I'll leave now.

452
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,140
I'll go.

453
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
How can you say that?

454
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,820
You'll know if you're pregnant

455
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,020
after the doctor's examination.

456
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,580
I have to go back to Chongzhou.

457
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,220
I've been following you since childhood.

458
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,820
I know what you're thinking.

459
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,060
But now you're married.

460
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,260
Why are you so obsessed

461
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,620
with the man in Chongzhou?

462
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,660
As long as I can go back,

463
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,620
I can get rid of

464
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,140
this famous marriage.

465
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,940
So you must help me.

466
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,740
No matter what,

467
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,420
you have to let the doctor say I have a child.

468
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,020
Prince Consort has no affection for the princess.

469
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,780
But he's always polite.

470
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,580
Why can't the princess

471
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,020
treat Prince Consort with care?

472
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,220
With your intelligence,

473
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,140
it's not difficult to make my husband happy.

474
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,860
He's a good man.

475
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,620
But I...

476
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:31,820
But...

477
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,180
Prince Consort.

478
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,260
You're with the princess every day.

479
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,780
You should know

480
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,700
she can't have my child.

481
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,060
I...

482
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,180
This child...

483
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,620
I was cold after I got married.

484
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,300
That's why so many bad things happened.

485
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,540
I'll write a letter

486
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,740
to the Empress Dowager and her aunt.

487
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,740
For the sake of the reputation of our two tribes,

488
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,060
this child can only be called Cui.

489
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,420
I won't ask who the father of the child is.

490
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,500
After you're born,

491
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,580
you want to divorce.

492
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,100
Or you can continue to live in Zhongzhou Cui's mansion.

493
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,220
General.

494
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,300
We both accept fate's wrath.

495
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,980
We have a wrong marriage.

496
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,300
In the future,

497
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,020
I'll take care of you.

498
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,140
You're in Zhongzhou.

499
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,380
We don't have to see each other in this life.

500
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,740
General.

501
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,460
I'm sorry.

502
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,140
Brother San.

503
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,060
Have you decided?

504
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,340
Yes.

505
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,220
I'll send the princess back to Zhongzhou.

506
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,580
I'll come back after settling down.

507
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,660
Go in.

508
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,340
Don't keep the princess waiting.

509
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,060
Go.

510
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,460
Since you're here,

511
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,380
it's better for you to say it yourself.

512
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,700
The princess is pregnant.

513
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,420
I decided to send the princess back to Zhongzhou.

514
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,980
Congratulations, General Cui.

515
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,780
Congratulations.

516
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,140
Thank you, everyone.

517
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,980
In that case,

518
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,420
the chief of Shouyang will be replaced.

519
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,140
No need.

520
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,780
I'll send the princess back to Zhongzhou first.

521
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,220
Then I'll come back.

522
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,260
General Cui, you're thinking too simply.

523
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
If you let the princess stay in Jing'an,

524
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,820
even if the princess doesn't say anything,

525
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,900
the Empress Dowager and the Seventh Prince

526
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,180
will be in a very difficult situation.

527
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,780
But I can't stay here for too long.

528
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,380
Only I know this place.

529
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,140
The military counselor is right.

530
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,980
You go back to the capital first.

531
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,660
The future of the city will be uncertain.

532
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,420
Xiao Yue.

533
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,860
You used to live here with General Cui.

534
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,620
You know better.

535
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,660
You stay here first.

536
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,300
I'm sorry, General Cui.

537
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,820
I'm sorry.

538
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,020
I'm sorry.

539
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,660
I'm sorry.

540
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,300
I'm sorry.

541
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,580
I'll take your order.

542
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,580
General Hong.

543
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,580
I'll leave Shouyang to you.

544
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,340
Don't worry, General Cui.

545
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,780
I'm here.

546
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,540
Shouyang is here.

547
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,180
Brother San package your Chop niveau噸 fiame and go to Jingyuan.

548
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,340
Yes.

549
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,700
But I don't live in Xizhou for long.

550
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,900
Instead, Shouyang is like my second hometown.

551
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,820
I know.

552
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,460
You put a lot of effort into Shouyang.

553
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,700
It's okay.

554
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,260
After the princess gives birth,

555
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,900
we can come back.

556
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,460
The first time I came to Shouyang,

557
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,100
you just recovered from the injury.

558
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,660
I came here with Xiaoyu.

559
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,180
I lived here for three years.

560
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,580
She left.

561
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,900
I'm sorry.

562
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,900
I made you sad with me.

563
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,980
You can't say these words.

564
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,380
No one can say it.

565
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,500
You can only say it to me.

566
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,460
I'm here today.

567
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,660
You can say more.

568
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,740
There are some words that are more meaningful.

569
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,380
Tell General Hong that

570
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,020
if there is a good news,

571
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,980
send it to Zhongzhou Cui's mansion.

572
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,900
If we get the good news,

573
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,820
I'll be at ease.

574
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,340
Master.

575
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,980
Your Highness.

576
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,940
You have to hand over the military power.

577
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,820
You have a lot to do.

578
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,300
You don't have to treat us as guests.

579
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,980
Go.

580
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,180
Yes.

581
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,780
I'll go for a walk.

582
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
I'll go with you.

583
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
I'll go with you.

584
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,180
Wu Xie teas Кest of fluffy

585
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,100
Shouyang appears

586
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,100
I meant

587
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,460
to explain you weak he- posible

588
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,300
I wanted to ease yourself a little

589
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,300
I didn't expect

590
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,460
the sadness of your situation make you sad.

591
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,220
I want to know.

592
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,460
Go ahead.

593
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
I'm sorry.

594
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,700
If they really love each other,

595
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,500
but for various reasons,

596
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
they can't be together,

597
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,300
though they should let go,

598
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
but they can't.

599
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
What should they do?

600
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
You don't know

601
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,100
what to do, right?

602
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,100
In the academy,

603
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,900
Huan Yu also asked me the same question.

604
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,500
He asked me

605
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,100
if I regret

606
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,100
being young and having no wife and no children.

607
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,100
I don't know how to answer that.

608
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,900
But by the river,

609
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,100
the boatman told me

610
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,100
whether I regret it or not,

611
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
all the choices

612
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,900
are worth it.

613
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,300
Okay.

614
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Right.

615
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,700
Come on.

616
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,100
Speaking of water.

617
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,300
It has fruit?

618
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,400
I present it.

619
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,440
If you want it, go come here,

620
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,480
You won't be allowed to be alone.

621
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,900
Calm down, likelin.

622
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,900
General, you can't stop us from making money.

623
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,900
General, we are all for your good.

624
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,900
How can you help us if you don't feed us?

625
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,900
What great thing can a general who can't help us do?

626
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,900
Yes, yes, general.

627
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,900
You can all leave.

628
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
Yes, yes, Empress Dowager.

629
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,900
General Qin, come.

630
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
I salute you.

631
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Come.

632
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

633
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Good wine, come again.

634
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,900
Come.

635
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Empress Dowager.

636
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,900
These jewels on the ground are for you.

637
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

638
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Empress Dowager, you can't be so tolerant of them.

639
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
You stop the servants from receiving rewards.

640
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Aren't you afraid that they will hate you?

641
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
I...

642
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
Come.

643
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,900
They used to be compared by the Liu Yuan.

644
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,900
They are used to the secret of the palace.

645
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,900
They can't compare with your Nancheng's blind army.

646
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Under General,

647
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,900
you still need to follow the rules.

648
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
Yes.

649
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,900
General.

650
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,900
Empress Dowager said that you can leave when you wake up.

651
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,900
What happened?

652
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,900
You were drunk last night and you were awake here.

653
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,900
I was drunk last night.

654
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
I was drunk last night.

655
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,900
I was drunk last night.

656
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,900
I was drunk last night.

657
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
I was drunk last night.

658
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
I was drunk last night.

659
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
I was drunk last night.

660
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
I was drunk last night.

661
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,900
My그� laughter and went into your eyes and heart.

662
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,900
I began to輪 turn it away.

663
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,900
I began to take offense and began to hate you.

664
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
Because I knew

665
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,900
that the most hateful person in this world

666
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,900
was someone who destroyed your beauty.

667
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,700
Qin Yan, look at His Majesty.

668
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,340
Qin Yan.

669
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,420
Why are you so upset?

670
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,420
I...

671
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,220
I'm fine.

672
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,220
I told you to watch the Empress Dowager's bed.

673
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,860
You must have seen

674
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,180
many things that you shouldn't have.

675
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,540
Please hold your head up tight.

676
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:47,780
I almost died in

677
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,620
the palace empty.

678
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,220
I had an idea

679
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,840
I just want to live happily for a eat in Jiuyue ​​

680
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Farewell

681
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,380
Phlaing.

682
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,260
How do you dare mean extomo...

683
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,360
C欲求你吃

684
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,700
You still dare to eat there.

685
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,140
You can't eat alone any more

686
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,380
As for  sulphuric acid

687
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,440
It's Director's order

688
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,200
So please write it on the disturb button

689
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,480
Secretary

690
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:38,080
revolving roasted caroms wild

691
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,600
In the future, when my son is born,

692
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,240
Grand Tutor will teach him with this.

693
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,160
I dare not.

694
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
Besides, I can't bear to leave him.

695
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,360
His parents are willing to leave him.

696
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,040
But Grand Tutor doesn't.

697
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,520
It's clear.

698
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,240
Yes.

699
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,520
It's different.

700
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,720
It's different.

701
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,680
It's different.

702
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,720
It's different.

703
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,680
Sit down.

704
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,840
Congratulations, General.

705
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,040
In the future, we will be together.

706
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,400
Don't forget us.

707
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,280
Be careful.

708
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,040
Stay here.

709
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,800
General is making it difficult for us.

710
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,960
When there is a bedding in the Empress Dowager's palace,

711
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,200
she never leaves us to serve her.

712
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,440
General Qin.

713
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,800
Please spare my life, Empress Dowager.

714
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,360
You are young and powerful.

715
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,600
You are in charge of the military affairs.

716
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,600
You are the guardian of the palace.

717
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,440
Why should I spare your life?

718
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,520
I should thank you for your protection day and night.

719
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,280
I should thank you for your protection day and night.

720
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,080
I should thank you for your protection day and night.

721
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,240
What can you do to let me go?

722
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,800
I want the soldiers in your hands.

723
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,480
What about me?

724
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,640
General Qin.

725
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,640
I don't want to do anything against my conscience.

726
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,640
Do you want to die?

727
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,240
Outside the gate of the town,

728
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,560
there are witnesses of your actions.

729
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,520
General, you don't know it.

730
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:57,240
Now

731
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
I have built the main hall,

732
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,520
The second hall has been built

733
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,020
The first one to find this place is the second brother

734
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,800
The last time I left you and left the camp

735
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Is here

736
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Good name

737
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,720
It's my master's

738
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,080
It's Shiyi's idea

739
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,680
Just say it out of my mouth

740
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,280
No wonder you hid the dowry here

741
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,520
You guys go up the mountain

742
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,920
I'll wait for you down the mountain

743
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,440
I'll carry you

744
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
But I can't

745
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
Brother, give me a hand

746
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,480
Let's go

747
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,880
I love you more

748
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,680
Let's be together

749
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,400
The world is full of ups and downs

750
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,240
The sword is as sharp as a horse

751
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,480
The world is full of love

752
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,360
The story is like a firefly

753
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,880
Flying in the cold snow
