[Episode 5]

4
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,530
Why did you pour the tea?

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,600
Follow me.

6
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,200
Master.

7
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Why don't you allow Eleven to go enjoy the music?

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,360
It's rare to hear the music played by musicians from Nanxiao.

9
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,540
She poured a pot of tea.

10
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,650
I'm punishing her by asking her to copy tea names.

11
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,360
Master.

12
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,079
Are you teasing her

13
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,760
because she can't speak?

14
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
Famous tea is expensive.

15
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,720
But she wasted it at will.

16
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,410
Shouldn't she be punished?

17
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,930
Do you feel grieved?

18
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,360
You should know the value of a cup of tea

19
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,840
worth days of,

20
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,250
even a month of food for common people.

21
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,800
You like to drink tea.

22
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,980
So I bought you tea.

23
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,260
But I don't want you to be arrogant

24
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,180
and unaware of how hard common people's life is.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
You should cultivate virtue by staying thrift.

26
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,000
You are the future Crown Princess.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,460
You should set an example.

28
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,280
What's wrong?

29
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,600
As the Junior Prince of Nanchen's disciple,

30
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,860
I should remember it, but it has nothing to do with the name of Crown Princess.

31
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,920
I'm willing to be punished.

32
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,460
Most of the tea comes from Nanxiao

33
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,020
and the Jiduo Kingdom.

34
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,920
I handled that from Jiduo.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,330
Wait. Let me find it out.

36
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,250
This one.

37
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,920
Yes, that's it.

38
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,880
Look, there're words on it.

39
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,120
Abstruse writing.

40
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,120
But it says cinnamon.

41
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
Cinnamon is not tea?

42
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
Then where's the tea?

43
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,780
When did you learn Jiduo's language?

44
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,320
When I went to the temple

45
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,960
to pray for you these two years,

46
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,080
I met monks from

47
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,720
the Jiduo Kingdom

48
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
and I learned it from them.

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,760
Since you can learn their language,

50
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,090
you must go to the temple very frequently.

51
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,450
I would go there when I miss you all.

52
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
No wonder Xie Yun always became wordy

53
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
when he went to the battlefield.

54
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
He said there was a little sister

55
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,840
waiting for us at home

56
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,640
and we should not lose our lives.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
He knows you best.

[Nanchen Royal Mansion]

59
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,440
The four of them are guards from the imperial palace.

60
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,900
They follow to protect me.

Greetings, Your Highness.

64
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,080
I know you.

65
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,960
You are a meritorious general following the Junior Prince of Nanchen

66
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,290
to suppress the Six-garrison Rebellion.

67
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,800
Where is my uncle?

68
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
Master is in the camp.

69
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,850
He left us to entertain Your Highness.

70
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
Uncle really loves soldiers as if they were his children.

71
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,000
It seems he is going to spend

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,600
the New Year's Eve with generals and soldiers.

73
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,120
Is there any scenic place

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
in his mansion?

75
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,800
I don't want her

76
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,480
to feel chained when we meet for the first time.

77
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,720
There is a garden

78
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,320
with pavilion, pond and beautiful scenery.

79
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,650
Shiyi often practices instrument there.

80
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,900
Then I'll go there.

81
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,560
People in the mansion

82
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
are talking about the Prince of Guangling.

83
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,400
They said he has been good-looking since he was a child

84
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,600
and he is famous outside the palace.

85
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,880
What they said is true.

86
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
He is a quite handsome man.

87
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,810
Why should we judge people by appearance?

88
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,360
Well, being good-looking is definitely not a disadvantage.

89
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,160
A hundred years ago, the emperor of Xiyan Kingdom,

90
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
Murong Chong,

91
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,400
was imprisoned as a toy-boy and suffered humiliation

92
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,000
when he was young

93
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,080
because he looked even better than women.

94
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,280
Isn't it all because of his appearance?

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,360
It was really a pity for you

96
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,420
to lose ability to speak these years.

97
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,520
No matter if he is your future husband

98
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
or just a guest from afar,

99
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
you should show hospitality.

100
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,640
You are more like the descendant from the Cui family than I am.

101
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,520
How I wish

102
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,840
you were me.

103
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

104
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,660
Your Highness.

105
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,360
We're not in the Central State.

106
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,520
No need to be too polite.

107
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,240
Get up.

108
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

109
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,280
I finally don't need to

110
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,740
see you through portrait.

111
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,960
In the Central State, I often heard that

112
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,880
Nanchen Royal Mansion is magnificent.

113
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,540
But I didn't take it seriouly.

114
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,920
Now that I'm here,

115
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,360
I realize it is true.

116
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,070
Your Highness, don't be misled by the public.

117
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,020
For what?

118
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,500
My master is not extravagant.

119
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,220
But as the prince guarding the borders,

120
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,100
his residence must be magnificent

121
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,830
to win the hearts of the people.

122
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,860
You are afraid that I will think

123
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,790
he is disloyal like other princes?

124
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,300
I dare not think so.

125
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,540
I'm not that blind and stupid.

126
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,660
Other royal families and fierce generals

127
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,740
might be rebellious

128
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,020
or wait for an opportunity

129
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,380
to rebel

130
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,580
when they take control of

131
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,380
thousands of military soldiers.

132
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,220
But he won't.

133
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,980
Beichen is so lucky to have him.

134
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,650
It's against the rules.

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Are you all right?

136
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:34,970
I'm fine.

137
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,340
I'm just caring about you.

138
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Show me your hand.

139
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,920
There are doctors in the mansion.

140
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,250
I'll see them by myself.

141
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Send an imperial doctor to check her hand.

142
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,480
Now!

143
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,360
Yes.

144
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,540
Why did you get hurt for the first time you met him?

145
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,340
Is it an arrangement of the fate?

146
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,700
He was closely surrounded by

147
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,020
four guards with knives.

148
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,820
Even after the maids and chamberlains had left,

149
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,080
they guarded him also.

150
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,780
Is he afraid there would be

151
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,110
assassins even in Nanchen Royal Mansion?

152
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,000
That's the strange point.

153
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,860
Your Highness.

154
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,580
How is she?

155
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,150
Miss Cui is all right. Don't worry.

156
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,780
As soon as I saw her...

157
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,220
I had a mood

158
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,780
that I won't understand.

159
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,780
Although I have been castrated,

160
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,140
I'm still a human.

161
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,460
Since I'm human, I have emotions.

162
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,980
She is different from that on the portrait.

163
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,470
She won't stand still to let me gaze at her.

164
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
She will be afraid

165
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,020
and then get away from me.

166
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,830
Uncle is not in the mansion.

167
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,420
I have to find a good reason to see him.

168
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,030
Today is your birthday.

169
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,140
What's your wish?

170
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,020
Let me tell you what gifts I've prepared for you.

171
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,300
Your Highness is a guest.

172
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,830
No need to spend money on me.

173
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,140
Greetings, Your Highness.

174
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,870
You two generals finally came.

175
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,240
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,000
Your Highness, what can we do for you?

177
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,820
I've prepared good wine and food.

178
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,700
I want to go to the army barracks with you

179
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,500
to celebrate Shiyi's birthday.

180
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,500
It feels like home in the royal mansion.

181
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
I think

182
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,500
Shiyi must want to celebrate her birthday

183
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,580
with her family.

184
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,500
But the Royal Army has strict rules.

185
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,180
Outsiders are not allowed to enter the camp without permission.

186
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,300
Am I an outsider?

187
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,630
I mean those without military status.

188
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,700
What if I have an imperial edict

189
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,100
to reward the army on behalf of His Majesty?

190
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,620
In this case,

191
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,940
I'll make an arrangement right now.

192
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,520
I just wanted to give you a birthday present.

193
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,500
I didn't know you have an edict.

194
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,740
I'm sorry for embarrassing you.

195
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,800
Never mind.

196
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,870
It's okay because it is you.

197
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,120
Your Highness.

198
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,680
The poison has been completely cleared.

199
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,340
Master.

200
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Eleven came.

201
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,020
Isn't she in the mansion?

202
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,540
The Prince of Guangling brought her here.

203
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,500
He said he wanted to hold a birthday party for her

204
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,420
and took this opportunity

205
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,820
to reward the army on behalf of His Majesty.

206
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,400
Let's go and welcome them.

207
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,060
Uncle.

208
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,980
Zixing.

209
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,990
Are you injured?

210
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,640
Xie Yun, take Eleven to see the military doctor.

211
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,220
Yes.

212
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,540
Zixing.

213
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,110
Take a break in the tent.

214
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,860
No hurry.

215
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,060
It's a rare opportunity for me to enter the army barracks.

216
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,580
I wonder if you are free

217
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,860
to show me around.

218
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,780
All right.

219
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,110
Come with me.

220
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,740
Show me your hand.

221
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,680
Master would be worried

222
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,100
if the military doctor didn't check your hand.

223
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,940
Although imperial doctors

224
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,060
have high official titles and read a lot,

225
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,790
they have less experience than

226
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,220
our military doctors.

227
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,420
I'm flattered.

228
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,580
They have already used

229
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,060
good medicine for treating wound.

230
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,620
But I have

231
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,740
folk prescription

232
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
which is better than this medicine.

233
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,920
I'll get it right away.

234
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,300
How did he treat you?

235
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,600
With courtesy and integrity.

236
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,140
You are shy.

237
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,350
I've brought Tusu Wine.

238
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,420
Okay.

239
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,550
Since you don't want to say,

240
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,950
forget my question.

241
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,860
Be careful.

242
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,740
Place everything well.

243
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,100
Yes.

244
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,540
Yes.

245
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,360
It smells good.

246
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,430
It's all your favorite dishes.

247
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,260
Master, I've brought Tusu.

248
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,220
Tusu?

249
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
Dinner prepared tonight

250
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,310
looks a little shabbier

251
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,260
compared with Tusu, Xie Yun.

252
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,940
I'll kill some fat sheep.

253
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,760
Give me a knife.

254
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,020
Here.

255
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,859
This cup of Tusu

256
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,880
is for our guest from afar,

257
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,540
Zixing.

258
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,380
Thank you, Uncle.

259
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,000
I also take this cup of wine

260
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,780
as a toast to all of you on behalf of His Majesty.

261
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,980
With a general who can win every battle,

262
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,710
the emperor doesn't have to build the Great Wall.

263
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

264
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

265
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,380
This toast is for

266
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,660
the generals and soldiers

267
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,260
who sacrificed in the rebellion suppression.

268
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,620
Let's celebrate the New Year.

269
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,750
I hope there would be

270
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,670
no flames of war in our country.

271
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,460
May the people of Beichen live and work in peace and contentment.

272
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,020
May the wide territory of our country

273
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,080
enjoy prosperity.

274
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,060
May the people of Beichen live and work in peace and contentment

275
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,820
May the wide territory of our country

276
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,260
enjoy prosperity.

277
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,180
[Tusu Wine]

278
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,340
Finally, I want to say that

279
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,540
today's Eleven's birthday.

280
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,300
I hope

281
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,160
she could be happy every day here.

282
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:18,960
Eleven.

283
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,850
Happy birthday.

284
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,220
Thank you, Master.

285
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,640
Okay.

286
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,770
Everybody, have a seat.

287
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,220
Here, Chen.

288
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,520
Sit here.

289
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:00,850
Okay.

290
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Thank you, adoptive father.

291
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,850
Eleven, who is that?

292
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,190
It's the military advisor, Xie Chong.

293
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,980
Your Highness.

294
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,260
The climate of the Western State is different from that of the Central State.

295
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,940
Please drink this bowl of medicine while it is warm

296
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,900
and rest early.

297
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,660
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

298
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,620
Shiyi.

299
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,780
Feng.

300
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,100
You…

301
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,620
I can speak.

302
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,360
Great, great!

303
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,840
If your mother knows

304
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,840
you can speak again,

305
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,640
she would be quite happy.

306
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,120
All right, don't stand there all the time.

307
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,880
Have a seat.

308
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,080
Here...

309
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,120
Hey,

310
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,290
make room for me.

311
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:46,940
Come on.

312
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,340
Xiaoyu.

313
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,220
Everybody.

314
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,920
Today is my little sister's  birthday.

315
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,560
And she finally

316
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,600
can speak.

317
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,570
I take this opportunity

318
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,400
to propose a toast to you all!

319
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,380
Cheers.

320
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,120
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

321
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,240
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

322
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,440
All the way here,

323
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,900
I often hear a passage.

324
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,660
I specially recited it

325
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,650
and want to read it for you, Master.

326
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,760
What is it?

327
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,460
In this world, very few people have got great bone structure.

328
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,420
Some may have good bone structure, but not beautiful facial features;

329
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,580
many have beautiful facial features, but not good bone structure.

330
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,820
But the Prince of Nanchen

331
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,340
is the only one

332
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,510
who has got perfect facial features and bone structure.

333
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,780
It is said that

334
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,660
his bone structure is even more dignified than an emperor.

335
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,820
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,020
Xiaoyu,

337
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,060
there are outsiders in the army.

338
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,220
Don't talk nonsense.

339
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,550
How could there are outsiders in the camp?

340
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,870
The Prince of Guangling is right here.

341
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,750
Cui Feng, how's everything going on in Shouyang?

342
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,790
It's all right in Shouyang.

343
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,420
But soldiers are missing you

344
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,580
and looking forward to your coming.

345
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,700
Why are you hiding there?

346
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,820
I come to apologize.

347
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,960
Come and have a seat first.

348
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,700
What did you do wrong?

349
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,680
I know the military rules are strict.

350
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,150
But I didn't stop the Prince of Guangling.

351
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,900
He is a prince.

352
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,380
You are just a minister's niece.

353
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,640
How could you stop him?

354
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,020
But we are all happy that

355
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,280
we can celebrate your birthday together

356
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,780
in the army barracks.

357
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,940
Here you are, Pepper Wine.

358
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,500
I'll drink alone?

359
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,380
OK, I'll accompany you.

360
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,140
Tusu bids farewell to the old and Pepper Wine welcomes the new.

361
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Let's take it for celebrating the New Year in advance.

362
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,540
Are you afraid of getting drunk?

363
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,380
God.

364
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,220
This cup of Pepper Wine

365
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,780
is not for my future

366
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,020
or wealth.

367
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,860
I wish only for my master,

368
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,140
my senior brothers

369
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,860
and my senior sisters

370
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,420
to be safe.

371
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,750
News of victory.

372
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,510
Where is Master's news of victory?

373
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,760
It has been two months.

374
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,620
Why hasn't there been news of victory yet?

375
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,740
It's never been that long.

376
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,380
Where are the six garrisons?

377
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,860
I don't even know that.

378
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,100
Where can I find Master

379
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,240
♫The snow before the pavilion softly kisses the lattice♫

380
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,700
if he dies?

381
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,980
♫Lovesickness does not go deep into the eyebrows♫

382
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,820
The six garrisons are in the north,

383
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,080
♫Sing the private talks while I'm slightly drunk♫

384
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,320
north of the Central State

385
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,980
and northeast of the Western State.

386
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,490
♫Listening carefully, do you know I'm missing you♫

387
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:35,960
♫The snow does not stop, and I still feel blue♫

388
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,740
If he dies,

389
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,070
he wouldn't want you to go find him.

390
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,300
He will be buried

391
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,700
where he dies.

392
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:44,460
♫The snow is falling in front of the yard♫

393
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:50,200
♫Thinking of your every twinkle and smile, I don't want to wake up♫

394
00:27:50,600 --> 00:28:01,540
♫How can the four seasons greet you riding horse♫

395
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,150
You didn't fall asleep?

396
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,260
You will be buried

397
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,180
where you die.

398
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:08,250
♫I will never change my love for you♫

399
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,660
Why won’t you let me find you?

400
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:14,160
♫I expect to admire the scenery with you every day♫

401
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,540
Once I die,

402
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,540
everything I leave will be empty.

403
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:23,990
♫No matter how far it is, I will run to you♫

404
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,200
Even if you find and see me,

405
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,180
you would feel nothing

406
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,240
but sadness.

407
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,250
Sleep tight.

408
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,360
Master.

409
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,810
Have you seen Shiyi?

410
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,880
She is in my tent.

411
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,760
It's late. She still stays in your tent?

412
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,650
Making you stand outside here.

413
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,010
Why don't you stay with her?

414
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,460
What about you?

415
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,580
I'll just walk around.

416
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,440
Never mind.

417
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,680
Do you…

418
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,760
You used to sleep in Master's study

419
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,800
when you felt tired after practicing instrument in the past.

420
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,680
Only you

421
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,620
dare to do this.

422
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,320
Xiaoyu.

423
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,680
What's wrong?

424
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Where have you been these two years?

425
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,920
Master, Tianxing

426
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,040
and I went to the North.

427
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,160
After pacifying rebellions in the six garrisons,

428
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
we went to Pingzhou and Shanggu.

429
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,440
Xie Yun

430
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,040
and Feng Qiao are in the West.

431
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,520
Your brother is in Shouyang.

432
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,280
We seldom meet.

433
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,680
My brother

434
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,440
is going home, too.

435
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,360
Then we won't talk about him.

436
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,320
It reminds me that

437
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,720
I have something for you.

438
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,560
This is a soft armor

439
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,960
a princess wore before.

440
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,880
I was afraid I would lose it,

441
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,210
so I wore it all the time.

442
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,570
It's for you.

443
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,800
I'm not going to the battlefield.

444
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
I don't need this.

445
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,840
Take it.

446
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,090
Don't refuse me.

447
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,880
Everything on me

448
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,940
is all from Master.

449
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,400
I have nothing myself.

450
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,360
It's not easy for me

451
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,620
to get such a treasure.

452
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,650
You must take it.

453
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,800
In my heart,

454
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,760
you are the princess

455
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,360
of our Nanchen Royal Mansion.

456
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,280
This suits you.

457
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,880
What's good to be a princess?

458
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,320
Princesses are royal and noble.

459
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,580
Everyone envies them.

460
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,680
But I don't.

461
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,840
I envy you.

462
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,400
Envy me?

463
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,880
You joined the army with Tianxing in early youth

464
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,610
and suffered a lot with Master.

465
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,600
But I just came to enjoy the fruit

466
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,000
and contribute nothing.

467
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,280
Actually, we're all late.

468
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,090
In Master's most difficult times,

469
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,200
he got it through by himself.

470
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,960
You know how many

471
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,360
troops the late emperor gave him back then?

472
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,580
In those years,

473
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,560
the imperial clan took control of the army to protect their own interests

474
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,800
and refused to give up the leadership of any troops.

475
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,340
[Taiji Palace]

476
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,200
When Master left the Central State,

477
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,640
he had cavalry of only 20,000 people

478
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,920
and infantry of 10,000 people.

479
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,120
How could he win with such few soldiers?

480
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,880
He brought a box of official seals

481
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
and an edict with him

482
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,340
when leaving the capital.

483
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,480
He could be able to appoint

484
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,160
any official below the sixth grade along the way.

485
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
Master went all the way south

486
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,760
and used these official seals to recruit soldiers and horses

487
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,320
and formed a hasty army.

488
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,480
He made his name

489
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,240
resounded all over the world

490
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,800
by successively winning battles

491
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,460
and recovering territories.

492
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,360
Tianxing and I

493
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,320
were orphans escaping

494
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,360
to the temple.

495
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,330
After Master recovered the lost land,

496
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,840
we decided to join the army together.

497
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,320
The Junior Prince of Nanchen you want to see

498
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,120
is him.

499
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,220
Your Highness.

500
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,120
These two children had been yelling to

501
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,050
see you outside the military camp.

502
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,840
What's up?

503
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,160
We want to join the army.

504
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
You look young.

505
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,840
Why do you want to join the army?

506
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,880
You're not old.

507
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,040
I'm not young.

508
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,200
I just look young.

509
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,000
You know what?

510
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,320
Your Highness looks

511
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,000
similar to your age,

512
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,640
but he's been through many battles.

513
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,810
I never refuse a volunteer.

514
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,280
I'm only afraid that no one will join the army.

515
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,240
The Royal Army will return to the Western State tomorrow.

516
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,370
I'll give you a night to think about it.

517
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,380
If you are not afraid of death,

518
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
then follow me.

519
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,080
Since then,

520
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,560
many years have passed.

521
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,640
I think

522
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,580
we would be killed on the battlefield

523
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,240
or die of old age in the barracks.

524
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,889
What can you do when you are old?

525
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,400
Feed and wash horses.

526
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,280
Or clean the barracks.

527
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,199
As long as I can stay in the army,

528
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,730
I'm willing to do anything.

529
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,520
Yeah.

530
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,460
As long as you are here.

531
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,320
Let's find something to eat.

532
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,060
Over there.

533
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Let the cook

534
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,840
make something warm for General Hong.

535
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,320
Yes.

536
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,600
Wait.

537
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,160
General Hong

538
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,080
is a bit shy.

539
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,400
Tell the cook that

540
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,800
it's because I'm hungry.

541
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,930
Yes, Your Highness.

542
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,770
Do you all have wives and children?

543
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,040
Will anyone bury you if you are dead?

544
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,760
I dare not to get married.

545
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,090
I could die on the battlefield at anytime.

546
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,160
Even if you want to get married,

547
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,620
they dare not marry to you.

548
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,320
Xie Yun

549
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,130
always looks for food at night.

550
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
He told me

551
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,240
the cook always secretly

552
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,900
leaves some pancakes for him.

553
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,520
Why is there nothing left today?

554
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,960
General Hong.

555
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,160
General Hong.

556
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,400
I patrol with Eleven tonight

557
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,520
and heard some noise here.

558
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,780
So I came to have a look.

559
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,320
His Highness is hungry.

560
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,920
He asked me to cook some food.

561
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,360
If you like,

562
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,100
I can cook some for you as well.

563
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm okay.

564
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,220
But I'm afraid Eleven will be hungry.

565
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,000
So you can cook some as well for her.

566
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,280
Send it to my…

567
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,780
no, to the main tent later.

568
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,840
OK.

569
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,250
General Cui.

570
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,320
Who's inside?

571
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,860
It's His Highness.

572
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,960
He used to come to light a fire

573
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
before a war.

574
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,840
But I've never

575
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,220
heard of an expedition this time.

576
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,240
Go get my reed flute.

577
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,240
Yes.

578
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
I aroused your interest?

579
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,840
No one in Shouyang understands me.

580
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,760
It's a rare opportunity to come back.

581
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,360
I want to play a song with you.

582
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,080
Okay.

583
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,850
Our first Confucian general in Shouyang.

584
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,960
Who said this?

585
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,490
Who do you think would say this?

586
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,210
It must be General Hong.

587
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,760
You are awake.

588
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,920
Xiaoyu.

589
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,680
Who plays the music?

590
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,050
Master likes to play music before war.

591
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,000
It's rare that he plays music not for war

592
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,220
but for pleasing himself.

593
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,600
Master.

594
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,720
General Hong.

595
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,040
You got up late today.

596
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,240
It's Eleven's fault.

597
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,680
Then I'll leave her to you.

598
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,940
In this camp,

599
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,340
only you two are idle.

600
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,840
Then I'll train the soldiers.

601
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,380
I'm idle?

602
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,720
Scouting camp.

603
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,140
Military training.

604
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,700
Yes.

605
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,540
How did you two take the swords?

606
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,420
Take them well.

607
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,420
Line up.

608
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,100
Yes.

609
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,660
They seem to be afraid of Xiaoyu.

610
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,740
In the barracks,

611
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
it's much harder for a female general

612
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,300
to convince soldiers

613
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,470
than the male generals.

614
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,820
I'm sorry for

615
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,430
losing my courtesy last night.

616
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,200
Never mind.

617
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,820
Let me show you around

618
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,980
the barracks.

619
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,780
Pay attention to the action.

620
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,440
When the army comes to a place,

621
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,140
Xiaoyu's scouting camp

622
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
will choose a place for the army to be stationed.

623
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,400
The infantry will cut down trees and build wooden walls

624
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,870
to form a military camp.

625
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,960
Tighten your thighs and clamp the horse's back.

626
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,620
Stop shivering.

627
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,740
Look at you.

628
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,340
Get up.

629
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,140
Yes.

630
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,390
Why are there wooden horses in the stable?

631
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,260
It's much more expensive to raise a war horse

632
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,820
than raising a soldier.

633
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,620
So when they train at ordinary times,

634
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,020
they all use fake horses.

635
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,020
Xiaoyu said

636
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,220
our country conquers land with cavalry.

637
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,080
War horses are the most precious.

638
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,940
Continue.

639
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,300
I'll eat if you don't eat.

640
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,900
Master.

641
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,300
What is it?

642
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,990
You don't like the food?

643
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,300
I…

644
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,820
He's still that ungrateful, just like how he was

645
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,880
in the Buddhist Tower of the Mansion.

646
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,620
Don't you

647
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,780
underestimate him.

648
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,300
Back to the days in Nanxiao,

649
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,180
he was well-versed in both literature and martial arts.

650
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,340
He once tamed

651
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,420
a running battle steed with just one hand.

652
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,060
His martial arts skills are much better than yours.

653
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,780
It's already in the past, not worth mentioning.

654
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,960
In that case, I wanna compete with you again.

655
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,580
I surrender.

656
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,740
Surrender or not, you can't say that

657
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,340
until we have a competition.

658
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,180
This disciple of mine

659
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,580
once stayed half a month

660
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,120
along the riverside to learn how to swim.

661
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,100
You don't have much going on right now anyway.

662
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,140
It's not a bad idea

663
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,700
to practice a little after chanting sutras.
