1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The End

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ba Lan, only you

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm convinced.

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you have any wishes?

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In these years of Ba Lan's government

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I also want to be the only emperor.

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No regrets.

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Your Majesty

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Does anyone need my care?

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have one more son.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will send someone

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to send him back to Ping City.

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let him avoid this fire.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Before the birth of the emperor

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The late emperor had a son.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I was born by the queen.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I was three years old.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was angry at the queen

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
for investigating this matter.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Liu Yuan begged me for money

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and helped me.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When I was young

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Liu Yuan and I had a good relationship.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's why you buried the wine together.

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Did you bury the wine with a woman?

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What do you want to say?

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Nothing.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Every inch of this place

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you walked by when you were a child.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I was a little girl.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You walked by when you were a child.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Kind of.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Zhou Shan Chen

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's okay.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's just that it's the first time

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I heard you call me Zhou Shan Chen.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm really not used to it.

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Your home is in Xizhou.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Your future days are also in Xizhou.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You just said

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
there are ten orphans in the royal family

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and one disciple.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's enough.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Enough.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Miss Cui

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Prince Guang Ling is outside the hall

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to see you.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll ask him to go back.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Even if it's my bedroom,

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
it's also in the palace.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
How can we stop Prince Guang Ling?

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please let him in.

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wait.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm not feeling well.

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm afraid he can't handle it when he comes in.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In this case,

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
please go back to the palace first.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I understand.

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What's wrong?

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll just take a rest.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Your Highness,

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
he is...

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Military counselor,

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
call the imperial physician here.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Your Highness,

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
don't you know how to sell it?

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I haven't seen the doctor for a long time.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm already familiar with it.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then let me do it.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's better to call the imperial physician.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's more stable.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Your Highness,

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
you don't know my medical skills.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I...

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay.

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll go to call the imperial physician.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Military counselor,

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you should show me.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let me do it.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you feel the pain in your chest?

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sometimes,

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you'll feel bored.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You'll also feel sleepy.

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
A little.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's okay.

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Just take a rest for two days.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then I'll take a rest immediately.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I won't see any foreign guests.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
As you wish.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The maid said

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
that the Empress Dowager wants to send that Nigu to Xizhou.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
First, to show her gratitude to Prince of Nanchen.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Second, she wants to have a daughter

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and bring her back to the palace.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
She can be treated as a hostage.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you sad that I forced you to stay here?

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm just tired.

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I know.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You feel so uneasy because she's in the palace.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've been with you since you came here.

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Right?

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is it just a helplessness?

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She's my fiancee.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm worried about her.

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Is there anything wrong?

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
When she gets married,

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
she'll be your sister-in-law.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can't have such a big enemy

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to your sister-in-law.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If she's good to you,

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I won't have any enemy.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't worry about it.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Your Highness.

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Princess.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What's up?

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Someone from the Cui family

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
has received the Empress Dowager's order.

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The carriage is at the gate of the Yecun Palace.

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's at the Empress Dowager's palace.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Can you see who's coming down from the carriage?

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Many people.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They're from the Cui family.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll go with you.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If you want to see me,

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you can go to my mansion.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Why do you insist on coming to the palace?

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm afraid I can't wait.

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Did you come here

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
for the Crown Princess Consort's engagement?

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now that you have a concubine,

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you'll have children soon.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The Empress Dowager won't pass the Crown Princess Consort

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to Prince Guangling, right?

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Am I right?

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

209
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not right to say it.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You've really become a concubine.

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry, Grand Tutor.

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But...

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The engagement of Shi Yi

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
is cancelled.

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wu Er.

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I also want to ask for another concubine

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
for Cui.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Which concubine did you like?

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Tell me.

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Princess Xinhua.

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I've been suffering from the illness for many years.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I've done a lot of work.

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I can't be like the Princess.

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
In this palace,

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
there's only one princess

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
who's just right for her age.

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This...

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Her son, Cui Shi,

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
married the Empress Dowager.

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He's only good to the Empress Dowager.

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He's not a bad person.

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Empress Dowager.

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Good.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll fulfill this marriage.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll make up for the loss of Cui's family.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Shi Yi.

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Shi Yi.

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Please be careful.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I will never let the lake be destroyed.

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Your Highness.

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Your Highness is Prince Guang Ling.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He's highly favored.

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He wants a better marriage, not a man's.

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Since the engagement has been cancelled,

246
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
don't put the money on Shi Yi.

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Shut up!

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're calling him in person.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Where is Cui's family and Prince Nan Chen's?

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Your Highness is a royal family,

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
but Cui's daughter has never been inferior to you.

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Your Highness, Third Miss, please calm down.

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
His Highness loves Cui.

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He won't hurt her.

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Please forgive me.

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm leaving the palace today.

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Go back to Cui's house with your mother.

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Your uncle,

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
stay with him for a few more days.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Auntie, I don't want to marry.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Auntie, I don't want to marry.

264
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Auntie, I don't want to marry.

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We've arranged for the marriage between Cui's family and us.

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Now it's just a matter of time.

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You must marry.

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But I don't like him.

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Then who do you like?

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I...

271
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I gave you the dignity of a princess.

272
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I didn't want you to be happy and carefree.

273
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
One is Cui's young master.

274
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The other is a foreign marriage.

275
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You choose.

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Cui Xiu is dead.

277
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm leaving again.

278
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Cui's family is gone.

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm leaving.

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm leaving.

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm leaving.

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm leaving.

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm leaving.

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm leaving.

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm leaving.

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Auntie,

287
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Auntie,

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
remember,

289
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
don't blame me for being petty.

290
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Princess,

291
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
you must give me your blessing.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't want to marry.

293
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I beg you to cancel the marriage.

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You...

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You...

296
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Dad.

297
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Dad.

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
San Lang,

299
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm so ashamed to beg you to cancel the marriage.

300
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Do you really want to be blamed for being so angry?

301
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Dad,

302
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I've always listened to you.

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I've never been rebellious.

304
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Only this time,

305
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I beg you to cancel the marriage.

306
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'd rather not marry

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
than to marry you.

308
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Dad,

309
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
fight until the end.

310
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Mother,

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
let them stop.

312
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Your dad is the chief.

313
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Who dares to disobey him?

314
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Chief.

315
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Chief.

316
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Chief.

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Dad.

318
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Uncle.

319
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Dad.

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Dad.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I...

322
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and the late emperor's kindness

323
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
are not enough.

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I should have died without regret.

325
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But I can't bear to leave.

326
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Without water,

327
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm a hundred times better.

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Dad.

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Do you still have a father in your eyes?

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hurry up and agree.

331
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're a rebellious son.

332
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Whose marriage is this time?

333
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Isn't it for the family?

334
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Hurry up and agree.

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Aunt.

336
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Dad.

337
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I know you're not willing to do it.

338
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But, Sanfang,

339
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
every one of us

340
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
is doing it for the family.

341
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
When your sister was ten years old,

342
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
her father offended the late emperor.

343
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
In order not to get Cui into trouble

344
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and not to get my daughter into trouble,

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I wrote a divorce letter to divorce her.

346
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm more heartless than you.

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Sanlang, I beg you.

348
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let your father

349
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
leave in peace.

350
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I...

351
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I will obey your order.

352
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Dad.

353
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Dad.

354
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Dad.

355
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Dad.

356
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
A'Xiu.

357
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A'Xiu.

358
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
A'Xiu.

359
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
A'Xiu.

360
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
A'Xiu.

361
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
A'Xiu.

362
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
A'Xiu.

363
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
A'Xiu.

364
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
When did you destroy it?

365
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Master.

366
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I want to go back to Xizhou.

367
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I want to go back to Xizhou.

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I want to go back to Xizhou.

369
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
A'Xiu.

370
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Your Highness.

371
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Cui Sanliang is here.

372
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Your Highness.

373
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,400
I don't want you to worry about me right now.

374
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,200
My Lord.

375
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is Shi Yi here?

376
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's hard to video it.

377
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Give me some meantime.

378
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
See if she's here.

379
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This is?

380
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,960
Cui Wenji.

381
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,680
Since you're from the Cui family,

382
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
you should know

383
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,800
that Shiyi has been living in the mansion for a short time.

384
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,880
During this time,

385
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,200
all she heard, heard, saw and learned

386
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,640
are from the mansion.

387
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,040
So I know her better than you.

388
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,920
Brother just left.

389
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,560
Me and Fourth Madam

390
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,080
are busy with the internal and external affairs of Cui Mansion.

391
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,880
We can't talk to Shiyi.

392
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,760
Why don't you interview the local police?

393
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,120
She'll perspective your life

394
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,040
as the care of the She Bo'sWHIS?

395
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,960
But she isuzwn what she think his've been through.

396
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,000
That year,

397
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,440
please explain to Shiyi and I.

398
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,980
He squeezing 抱在这里

399
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,080
décidé

400
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,960
to push Ri 1930

401
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,080
traversed the heart

402
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Why do you have to leave your hatred on the prince?

403
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
I've thought about it.

404
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,200
Uncle has left for many years.

405
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,020
I didn't expect that the other person

406
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
is still alive.

407
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,160
If fate is not on your side,

408
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,540
you will surely remember your past life.

409
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,620
That day in the hall,

410
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,060
Cui Gong moved out the matter of uncle and Cui Wen Ji.

411
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,100
He persuaded me to accept Cui's daughter as my disciple

412
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,020
to resolve the grudges between the two families.

413
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,780
If it wasn't for this,

414
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,060
how could I have agreed so easily?

415
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm unfilial.

416
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,220
I've made you embarrassed.

417
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
Shiyi.

418
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
If I knew

419
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,060
you didn't want to accept me as your disciple,

420
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
I would never stay in Xizhou.

421
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
Yes.

422
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,020
If you don't stay in Xizhou, where will you go?

423
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,340
Come with me.

424
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
That is...

425
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,020
Cui Shi. Cui Shiyi.

426
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,220
She is the daughter of Li Shiqui.

427
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Yes.

428
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,820
She is the daughter of Li Shiqui.

429
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,140
It's another blood battle of Gao's family.

430
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,660
In the Taiji Hall,

431
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,380
I was only thinking about the relationship between the court and the court.

432
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,660
I couldn't have anything to do with any Shi family.

433
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,140
So at that time,

434
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,940
whether you were Cui Shiyi,

435
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,260
Cui Er Shiyi, or Cui San Shiyi,

436
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,980
I wouldn't have made the order.

437
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,180
I'm being too narrow-minded.

438
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,820
I tried my best to be late.

439
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,460
I was not in your age of ten.

440
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,940
How can I be late?

441
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,700
But you are the yellow text guy.

442
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,620
With kole here,

443
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,060
Your Highness.

444
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,380
Wait for me here.

445
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,380
I'm here to see you.

446
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
It's so late.

447
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,060
Why is he looking for you?

448
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
I'm here to see you.

449
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,260
What brings you here this time?

450
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,020
May I have a word with Your Highness?

451
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,420
Just say it.

452
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,940
Please save me.

453
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,660
Empress Dowager released me out of Ni Gu An this time.

454
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,700
She ordered me to die.

455
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,300
What does she want you to do?

456
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,460
Let me be your sidekick.

457
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,460
If I can't accept this,

458
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,140
Even if you enter the mansion,

459
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,660
you'll be my maid.

460
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,060
There's only one maid in my mansion.

461
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,540
Shiyi brought her here.

462
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,940
The rest are guards.

463
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,140
Besides,

464
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,500
I don't need maids either.

465
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
I'm sorry.

466
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
I'm sorry.

467
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
I'm sorry.

469
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
I'm sorry.

470
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
I'm sorry.

471
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,420
Empress Dowager is very wise.

472
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,420
She tolerates my life

473
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,620
because of the conflict between us.

474
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,020
She made me misunderstand the past.

475
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,820
If you don't accept me this time,

476
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,820
she thinks I'm useless.

477
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,020
She won't let me live.

478
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
You may rise.

479
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,220
Your Highness.

480
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,420
I really can't accept you this time.

481
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,620
Even though I can't marry you,

482
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,020
I can take you away.

483
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,540
I have an idiot brother in fatherland.

484
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,540
I can ask you out,

485
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,620
and send you to his side for champions in secret.

486
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,580
But if the Empress Dowager finds meleh being a centuries mischief,

487
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,060
If someone comes to kill me, what should I do?

488
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,180
My brother is a king of the same surname.

489
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,860
He is under the control of the court.

490
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,180
The平秦 army is the farthest from Zhongzhou.

491
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,140
The people and soldiers over there only recognize him.

492
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,300
Even if he is an assassin from the court,

493
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,740
if he doesn't die halfway,

494
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,860
it will be boring.

495
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,220
Okay. I'll go.

496
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,580
The King of Nancheng will leave soon.

497
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,900
The King of Nancheng will leave soon.

498
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,060
You should go back and prepare.

499
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,460
Do you know if the young lady of the Cui family is willing to come out to see me?

500
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,700
Her uncle just left. He is in a sad mood and has fallen asleep.

501
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,980
Then I'll talk here.

502
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,780
Gao Shi Huai Yang,

503
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,780
for the blood debt of my family's daughter-in-law,

504
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,180
I thank you for your forgiveness.

505
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,580
I've lost weight for her. Leave.

506
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Your Majesty, His Majesty has gone missing.

507
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,500
I'll get back to you now.

508
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,140
My father...

509
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,700
He was once a disciples at his family who MJG.

510
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
He loved your mother.

511
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,980
He went to the door to propose.

512
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
He was beaten by Cui family.

513
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
He was killed.

514
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980
He was killed.

515
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
He was killed.

516
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
He was killed.

517
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,980
He was killed.

518
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
How did my father get into the prison?

519
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
Why did you break in?

520
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,980
It was you who lost your master.

521
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
Master, why did you leave?

522
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
Did he hide something from me?

523
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,980
No.

524
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,980
Maybe he didn't want me to tell you in front of him.

525
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
The day you lost your master,

526
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
your mother told his highness

527
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,980
that you got the amnesia because of your father's death.

528
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
So his highness

529
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
took the Li family,

530
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,980
Cui family,

531
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
and your father's death

532
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
and thoroughly and thoroughly

533
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
understood the amnesia.

534
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Your father's death

535
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,980
was thoroughly and thoroughly understood.

536
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,980
His highness really

537
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,980
put a lot of effort into you.

538
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
Master,

539
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,980
what kind of family was Gao family?

540
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,980
I know that Gao family is a secret topic.

541
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
If you want to make it difficult for him,

542
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
Gao family

543
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,980
had two empresses.

544
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,980
Shengji had a great power in the court.

545
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,980
He had the power to suppress the royal family and Cui family.

546
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
But the marriage was too big.

547
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,980
Now no one is in Gao family.

548
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Third sister-in-law wants to go back to the capital as soon as possible.

549
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
Send the chief suzerain back to Qinghe County.

550
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,980
The court officials' memorial service is going to end today.

551
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
I see.

552
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,980
So be careful at night.

553
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,980
General Hong.

554
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,980
What's your order, young master?

555
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,980
General Hong and I are generals in the royal army.

556
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
We have the same position.

557
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Why do you want to be ordered?

558
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,980
I'm ordered

559
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,980
to guard the safety of Cui family.

560
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
I'm the general here.

561
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
I'm the general.

562
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
You're the master.

563
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,980
Of course you can order me.

564
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,980
I remember you've always been good friends.

565
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
Why do you have a conflict after father's death?

566
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
It's not a conflict.

567
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
It's a public affair.

568
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Well.

569
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
I've been in pain these two days.

570
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
I might have hit General Hong in the face.

571
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,980
I'm sorry.

572
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
I don't know if you can

573
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,980
ask me to apologize in person tonight.

574
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Tonight.

575
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
Of course.

576
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
I'll guard the night.

577
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,980
The reason why our men can't win,

578
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,980
depends on the morale of the army.

579
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
How can there be any discontent among the generals?

580
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
You have to have a good talk with me today.

581
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
General Hong.

582
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,980
General Hong.

583
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
General Hong.

584
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
General Hong.

585
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,980
General Hong.

586
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
General Hong.

587
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,980
General Hong.

588
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
General Hong.

589
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
General Hong.

590
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
General Hong.

591
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
General Hong.

592
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
General Hong.

593
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,980
General Hong.

594
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,980
General Hong.

595
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
General Hong.

596
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
General Hong.

597
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
General Hong.

598
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
General Hong.

599
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
General Hong.

600
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
General Hong.

601
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
General Hong.

602
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,980
General Hong.

603
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,980
General Hong.

604
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,980
General Hong.

605
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
General Hong.

606
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
General Hong.

607
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
General Hong.

608
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,980
General Hong.

609
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
General Hong.

610
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
General Hong.

611
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
General Hong.

612
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
General Hong.

613
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
General Hong.

614
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,980
General Hong.

615
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,980
General Hong.

616
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,980
I've been keeping something for years in my mind.

617
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
You have one minute.

618
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,080
Please do appreciate everything I say,

619
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,980
good timing and funnyxes.

620
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
I'm an orphan.

621
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
I don't have any family background.

622
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,980
Let me talk about it first.

623
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
That day,

624
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Cui Jia, the third son,

625
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
took his sister

626
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
to Xizhou.

627
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
I stopped them

628
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
from going down the city.

629
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
I'm so embarrassed

630
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
to see him.

631
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
I'm sorry.

632
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
I'm so embarrassed.

633
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
I thought the young master

634
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
couldn't stand the tears of the army.

635
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
Who would have thought

636
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
he had suffered for many years,

637
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
fought against the enemy in the city,

638
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
and was defeated many times.

639
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
He survived,

640
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
but never retreated.

641
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,980
He guarded the gate

642
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
of the south for the people.

643
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
General Hong,

644
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
you're here.

645
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,980
I respect him

646
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,980
for this young master.

647
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
I...

648
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Xiao Yue,

649
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
let me talk.

650
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
No.

651
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
I'll talk first.

652
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
What I want to say

653
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
may be more than what the young master said.

654
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,980
This is the report about you.

655
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
I've collected it for many years.

656
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
General Hong's military achievements

657
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,980
are far better than mine.

658
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,980
It's already far away from here.

659
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
Cui Feng loves General,

660
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
but he doesn't dare to say it.

661
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,980
I've always loved you

662
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
since the beginning of my life.

663
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,980
I can't ask for more.

664
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
I can only ask for

665
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,980
a lifetime of love.

666
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,980
I don't want anyone to be in the same boat

667
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
but only me.

668
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,980
I don't want to forget.

669
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980
I don't want to forget.

670
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,980
I've heard of you.

671
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
Xiao Wen.

672
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
Xiao Wen is dead.

673
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,980
I'm Xiao Yan.

674
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
You changed your name for yourself?

675
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
I believe you.

676
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,980
I believe you.

677
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
I, Ni Chi,

678
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
confer you as Lord Fengyang.

679
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,980
Stay in Zhongzhou from now on.

680
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,980
I'll protect you in this life.

681
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

682
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
I don't want to stay in Zhongzhou.

683
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,980
Where do you want to go?

684
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,980
You're a man.

685
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,980
You're more willing to follow your uncle.

686
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,980
Your Majesty.

687
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Xiao Yan wants to join the King of Nanchan.

688
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,980
He just wants to have a chance

689
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,980
to avenge his parents in the future.

690
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
There's no need to explain.

691
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,980
I don't need to do this.

692
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
I promise you.

693
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,980
I'll give you the title of Lord Fengyang.

694
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,980
I'm a monk.

695
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Lord Fengyang.

696
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
You're a man.

697
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
But you still have the heart of a man.

698
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,980
When will you avenge your parents in the future?

699
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,980
And tell me

700
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,980
if you want this title.

701
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,980
I'll take your order.

702
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,980
I won't disobey you.

703
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,980
I'll take your order.

704
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
That's right.

705
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,980
When will you leave the city?

706
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,980
Tomorrow.

707
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,980
When will you see me next time?

708
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,980
It's best that we don't meet again in this life.

709
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,980
Is there anything that makes you unhappy?

710
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,980
When I come back,

711
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,980
something big must have happened in the court.

712
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,980
So I'd rather not meet again in this life

713
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,980
and stay in Zhongzhou.

714
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
I hope you can be a great king.

715
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,980
I envy you.

716
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
You have a capable general.

717
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,980
I want to ask you for someone.

718
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
Who?

719
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,980
Please teach the late emperor like you used to.

720
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Stay in Zhongzhou and help me.

The love of the past is like a

The love of the past is like a

00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,940
