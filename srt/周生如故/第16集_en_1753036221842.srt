1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The End

60
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Has Master been to the outside of the Pass?

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

62
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The scenery is very beautiful.

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to the outside of the Pass.

64
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go.

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's go.

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll take you to the Pass next spring.

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Can I go?

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why not?

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Maybe I'll be told off.

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But it doesn't matter.

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
A general is outside.

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A soldier is not allowed to go outside.

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A son is outside.

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
A mother is not allowed to go outside.

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Master, what's wrong with your sister?

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She incidentally stepped into the mud and Zach.

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will go to Zhongzhou to welcome the Grand Tutor back.

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will take my leave.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wait.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
After you enter the capital, think of a way

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
to meet with Qin Yan.

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ask him about the Grand Tutor's illness.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I understand.

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You are afraid that Grand Tutor's death will be suspicious.

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You should know more about everything.

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There is no bad news.

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I will carry you.

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I will go to talk with Lu.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Waiting for the rain to fall

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hoping for a bright future in my heart

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There is a corner to tell

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's for you

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Light up the night

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The old star

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There are too many old

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
wishes to tell you

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There are old thoughts

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have to break through all the thoughts

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think of the snow and the moon

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I miss you

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I miss the sun and the moon

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The flowers are blooming

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I am only obsessed with you

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If I can't forget

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will be alone

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will be alone

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I will be alone

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Didn't you say you were going to find Senior Xie?

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Senior Xie?

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then can you wash it yourself?

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Of course.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let the stars fill the sky

115
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
What's wrong?

116
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,640
How come you drink so well?

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Senior Xie, how about you?

118
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,320
Something is wrong, you should get some water

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,800
I need my own hands

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
Sorry, Senior Xie

121
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,660
Itu, please

122
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,640
Ginger.

123
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Go get the ginger

124
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,840
You said you wanted the ginger

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,700
So Coconut

126
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,300
Your Highness

127
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
I can get the ginger

128
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,000
Go, let Sanlin Taizh undertale it

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your Highness.

130
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,260
You may leave.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

132
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Back then,

133
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,740
I took you to the palace.

134
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Who sent you here?

135
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
Do you remember?

136
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
My foster mother.

137
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Grand Tutor Xie

138
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,640
is your biological father.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Your mother

140
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
was a member of the Gao clan of the former Empress Dowager.

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Teacher.

142
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,600
I also thought about it for a long time.

143
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,000
That's why I decided to tell you the truth.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,560
You are the most intelligent among the disciples.

145
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,000
I think you can guess

146
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
why I hid it from you.

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm afraid of taking revenge.

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm afraid of taking revenge.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
I'm afraid of killing myself.

150
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Grand Tutor

151
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,480
wants to hide it from you for the rest of your life.

152
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,080
But I don't want him to die

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,160
without his own child.

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm even more afraid.

155
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
One day,

156
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,080
if I'm not able to tell you the truth,

157
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,760
no one can tell you the truth.

158
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I bow to you and your father.

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,200
General Hong is in Shouyang.

160
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,160
The young master went to Taiyuan to be the governor.

161
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,920
General Xie stayed in Luyue.

162
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,920
General Zhou went to Zhongzhou again.

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,200
The rest of the generals are all in other places.

164
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,720
You and General Feng are the only ones left in the palace.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
The girl has passed the age of being a teacher.

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,000
Sooner or later, she will be a teacher.

167
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
I'm afraid that

168
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
she will be a teacher.

169
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm afraid that

170
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
she will be a teacher.

171
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm afraid that

172
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
she will be a teacher.

173
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
The girl has passed the age of being a teacher.

174
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
Sooner or later, she will be a teacher.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If it weren't for the late emperor's marriage,

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
you would have been married long ago.

177
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Where are you going to wait until now?

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I want to stay

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
and spend more time with you.

180
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Mother, I respect you.

181
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't come to me for good wine.

182
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm already in your arms.

183
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
After I left with Grand Tutor,

184
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I've been thinking about you.

185
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm always thinking about you.

186
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
What did Shi Yi say in the letter?

187
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
He said that

188
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,600
he would be back in the palace.

189
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
He said that

190
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
he would be back in the palace.

191
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
He said that

192
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
he would be back in the palace.

193
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
He said that

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
he would be back in the palace.

195
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
I said some silly words.

196
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
Third Miss.

197
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,000
Fourth Miss.

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
Cui Shizhong is here.

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
The one who came in the same time

200
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,400
is also a eunuch

201
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
beside Prince Guangling.

202
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Who is this girl?

203
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Third Miss Cui.

204
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Eunuch Meng.

205
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Cui Shizhong.

206
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Third Miss.

207
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,800
You two came together.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,800
I wonder what you need to discuss.

209
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
I happen to run into you.

210
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
I was entrusted by the Empress Dowager

211
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,200
to accompany Eunuch Meng to deliver the edict.

212
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Deliver the edict?

213
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,400
Did Cui Feng cause trouble?

214
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
General Cui is the governor of Taiyuan County.

215
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,000
He is in the same position as General Jin.

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
He is the representative of Chaoshan.

217
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Third Miss, don't worry.

218
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
I will do my best to help you.

219
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Then

220
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
why did you deliver the edict?

221
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
This is the letter from the Empress Dowager

222
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
to Third Miss.

223
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
And the edict of the Empress Dowager's marriage

224
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
is in the hands of Prince Guangling.

225
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
I will give it to him.

226
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Prince Guangling asked to be the emperor.

227
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Before the marriage,

228
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,400
the Empress Dowager accepted his wish.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Third Miss.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Your current power

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,800
to marry Prince Guangling

232
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
is a big deal.

233
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
I think you should be prepared

234
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
to let Shiyi come back from Xizhou

235
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
and marry him.

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Prince Guangling is ill.

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He couldn't come

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
to see you personally.

239
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,200
So I ordered

240
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
to deliver the edict.

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is the gift.

242
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,000
What are you hesitating about?

243
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Are you trying to resist the edict?

244
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
I can't.

245
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
I can't.

246
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,000
This is the clothes of the Emperor.

247
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This time,

248
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
we will stay outside for a while.

249
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Miss.

250
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,200
Wait till I finish this one.

251
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
The prince is here.

252
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,600
Mother Wu must have seen my letter.

253
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Here.

254
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,400
Mother Wu is here.

255
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
She's inside.

256
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Mother Wu.

257
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Mother Wu.

258
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Mother Wu.

259
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Mother Wu.

260
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Mother Wu.

261
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Mother Wu.

262
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Mother Wu.

263
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Mother Wu.

264
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Mother Wu.

265
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Mother, Aunt.

266
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Your Highness.

267
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,000
You don't have to stand on ceremony.

268
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Have a seat.

269
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,600
I've been here for years.

270
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,680
I've been in your mansion for years.

271
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,280
Thank you for taking care of me.

272
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,040
She's far away from her homeland.

273
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,160
She came to Xizhou.

274
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,760
I should take good care of her.

275
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,520
You must be guessing

276
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,080
why I came here this time.

277
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,200
The Empress Dowager made a marriage arrangement for her.

278
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,960
We're here to take her back to Qinghe

279
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
to get married.

280
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,240
What marriage arrangement?

281
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,880
Your mother and your master are discussing.

282
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,760
Sit down.

283
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,720
What marriage arrangement?

284
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,480
When did you make the decision?

285
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,200
It's still an old marriage arrangement.

286
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,200
It's still Prince Guangling.

287
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
How did you get hurt?

288
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,040
Third Young Madam.

289
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,800
I'm here to see you.

290
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm here to see you.

291
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
I'm here to see you.

292
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm here to see you.

293
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,040
Third Young Madam.

294
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,600
You may leave.

295
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,960
Yes.

296
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,600
So long.

297
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Our secret is close.

298
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,200
It's much more important now.

299
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Completely。

300
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,120
If you know the truth,

301
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,880
I will come to Anjiazhuang to find .

302
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,080
a cure for against the

303
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,520
ique.

304
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,200
This is yourhait write gift .

305
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,240
frail soil

306
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,240
You want to marry someone who doesn't want to marry?

307
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Or someone who wants to marry but you can't?

308
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Do you want to hear the truth?

309
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
I don't want to hear the truth.

310
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,240
You don't have to say anything.

311
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,240
I saw it with my own eyes just now.

312
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
I never had any past memories.

313
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,240
I just want to stay in Xi State and be with him.

314
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
You are so smart.

315
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
You should know that this is a different path.

316
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Since you came back to Xi State, there have been rumors in the room

317
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,240
that the daughter of Cui family and the king of Nanchen are having an affair.

318
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,240
They are trying to get a name.

319
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
They are trying to get a name.

320
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Who is the one who said that?

321
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
I and my master never did.

322
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
We will never...

323
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
There are rumors that

324
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
the king of Nanchen is holding an army

325
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
and will change the world.

326
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Cui family and the king of Nanchen will work together.

327
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
The beauty and the world will work together.

328
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
They will split the land.

329
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
The Wang family will become the king.

330
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,240
The famous Wang family and the political enemy of the king family

331
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
are watching you.

332
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,240
They won't give up the chance to destroy and hurt the king and Cui family.

333
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
How can someone believe this?

334
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
People like to see their heroes off.

335
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,240
But they also like to see their heroes fall to the ground.

336
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
From ancient times,

337
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
it has never been like this.

338
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
There is no place for you to turn back?

339
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
There is no place for you to turn back?

340
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
For him,

341
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
not for us.

342
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
You must leave.

343
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Before I married you,

344
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
I thought about countless words.

345
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Countless words to persuade you.

346
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,240
But it's useless.

347
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
I can't even persuade myself.

348
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,240
I have experienced this.

349
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Your brother has experienced it more.

350
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I have thought about it.

351
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
No matter what,

352
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I won't let you experience this kind of pain.

353
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
I even thought about it.

354
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
If you and your brother are in love,

355
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
I will put down the sword of the family.

356
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,240
To help you and follow your heart.

357
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
But only the person in your heart

358
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
can do this.

359
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
I understand.

360
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,240
I have never thought about it.

361
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
I really

362
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,240
want to be with him.

363
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,240
I just want to be with him.

364
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
That's enough.

365
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
I will never forget you.

366
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
I will never forget you.

367
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I will never forget you.

368
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
I will never forget you.

369
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
I will never forget you.

370
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
I will never forget you.

371
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
I will never forget you.

372
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
I will never forget you.

373
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
I will never forget you.

374
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I will never forget you.

375
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
I will never forget you.

376
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
I will never forget you.

377
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
I will never forget you.

378
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
I will never forget you.

379
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
I'm begging you.

380
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,240
I want to give you more days.

381
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,240
I want to stay in Xi State for a few more days.

382
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,240
In the end, I'll wait in the inn.

383
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,240
The last night, tomorrow.

384
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Okay.

385
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Okay.

386
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
This is the Prince of Nanchen's residence.

387
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
It's not convenient for us to live here.

388
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
We'll stay in the inn tonight.

389
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Let Shiyi say goodbye to her siblings.

390
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,240
We'll leave tomorrow.

391
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,240
I'll go.

392
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
The dress that the Prince of Nanchen made for you last year,

393
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
you haven't worn it yet.

394
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Do you want to take it out?

395
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Take it out.

396
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Yes.

397
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
I'll take it out.

398
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,240
I'll take it out.

399
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Who is it?

400
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Master, it's me.

401
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,240
It's dinner time.

402
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,240
The military counselor said you're not allowed to come here.

403
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,240
I have something important to do.

404
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Can you light the lamp first?

405
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Okay.

406
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,240
I'll go.

407
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,240
I'll go.

408
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I'll go.

409
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,240
I'll go.

410
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I'll go.

411
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Ordinary people don't dare to break in.

412
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,240
It's safest to sleep here.

413
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,240
You've never been married before.

414
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
It's rare for you to come back.

415
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm not even happy.

416
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:29,240
I can't remember telling you these little things.

417
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
I made all of these.

418
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Let's see if it suits your taste.

419
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Try it.

420
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Is it okay?

421
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Then you eat slowly.

422
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Where are you going?

423
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,240
I forgot to bring wine.

424
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,240
So much wine.

425
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,240
You're too impatient.

426
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,240
It's not fun to have such a good wine.

427
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,240
I'm sorry.

428
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,240
I'm sorry.

429
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm sorry.

430
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Do you have any other business?

431
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,240
I have some business.

432
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I'm sorry.

433
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I'm sorry.

434
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,240
I'm sorry.

435
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,560
willing to wait for time?

436
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,760
I remember

437
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,960
master will be looking for your drink

438
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,120
in the palace.

439
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,560
The clouds are bright and the fire 이제馬上熬焰

440
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,800
That night 그 나�只看見你哭

441
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,960
I was the one who fell in love with her.

442
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,000
Qingming.

443
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,560
Where is this outfit to wear?

444
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,280
It's for you.

445
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,560
Where is this otherwise smooth suit being?

446
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,520
I have to take you home.

447
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,680
I am back...

448
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,000
yet to keep you.

449
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,960
This place will always be my home.

450
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,960
I'm sorry. Please wait.

451
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,960
I'm eating with you.

452
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
What?

453
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,960
General Feng, the Empress Dowager ordered to send you and Prince Guangming.

454
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
The queen has given the order.

455
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,960
She will take you to Zhongzhou tomorrow.

456
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
General Feng.

457
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Give them some time.

458
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Burn the reliance of the past.

459
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,960
The pain and suffering are deep and deep.

460
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,960
I'm in the sea of pain.

461
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,960
But for you, I'm willing to go down.

462
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Let the fire and the cold be together.

463
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Don't go.

464
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,960
The world is in a mess.

465
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,960
The sword is like a horse.

466
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,960
The love is like a poem.

467
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,960
The story is like a play.

468
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,960
The world is in a mess.

469
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I miss you.

470
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
I want to tell you.

471
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I'm not leaving.

472
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
There's still one hour.

473
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
The sun will rise.

474
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
I'll let Cheng Xi come and give you a bath.

475
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,960
I still remember what you wore on the day you came.

476
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
What?

477
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Do you remember what color dress I wore?

478
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
I remember.

479
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
The world is in a mess.

480
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,960
The love is like a poem.

481
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,960
The story is like a play.

482
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,960
The sword is like a play.

483
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,960
I miss you.

484
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I miss you.

485
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,960
The love is like a play.

486
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:16,960
The story is like a play.

487
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Where are you going?

488
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
I'm going to find a doctor.

489
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Someone is waiting for you in the clinic.

490
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Who?

491
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Cui Shizhong.

492
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
He brought the Empress Dowager's oral decree.

493
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,960
I, Cui Zheng, greet Your Highness.

494
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Cui Shizhong.

495
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Your Highness, I'm here to see you.

496
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
I'm here to see you.

497
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Your Highness.

498
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Cui Shizhong.

499
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Your Highness, I'm here to take Shiyi to Zhongzhou.

500
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,960
And to deliver an oral decree to you for the Empress Dowager.

501
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
Please.

502
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,960
The Empress Dowager said that although the rumors are not credible,

503
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,960
the Nancheng Mansion and Cui family are the famous family of the scholars.

504
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,960
In order to stop the rumors,

505
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Your Majesty, please accept Cui Shiyi as your adopted daughter.

506
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Maybe it's the sound of the flute.

507
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Maybe it's the endless love.

508
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,960
I've seen the scenes of time.

509
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
I have ten disciples.

510
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
I'll call you Shiyi.

511
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Okay?

512
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,960
I'm a man of no beauty.

513
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,960
I'm like a wind without a love.

514
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,960
The sound of the flute is endless.

515
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
I, Cui Shiyi,

516
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
bid you farewell.

517
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Let me spend my life to pursue you.

518
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Don't blame the love for the soul.

519
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Write a dream, wake up and break the spell.

520
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,960
I can't stand this love.

521
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,960
The Empress Dowager has a will.

522
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Let me take you as my adopted daughter.

523
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Shiyi, are you willing?

524
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Every piece is like you.

525
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Even if the road is lonely from now on.

526
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Okay.

527
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Then I'll resist.

528
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I'll be your wife.

529
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
I'll be your wife.

530
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
I'll be your wife.

531
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I'll be your wife.

532
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
I'll be your wife.

533
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I'll be your wife.

534
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
I'll be your wife.

535
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I'll be your wife.

536
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
I'll be your wife.

537
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
I'll be your wife.

538
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I'll be your wife.

539
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
I'll be your wife.

540
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
I'll be your wife.

541
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
I'll be your wife.

542
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,960
After the dream is over, it's still clear.

543
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
If this life is hard,

544
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
I won't leave.

545
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,960
The past can be heard.

546
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,960
How angry is your beauty?

547
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Let me spend my life to pursue you.

548
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Don't blame the love for the soul.

549
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,960
After the dream is over, it's still clear.

550
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,960
My heart is hard to endure.

551
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,960
The heart is the most insatiable.

552
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,960
The time I look for at the bottom is clear at the end.

553
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Every piece is like you.

554
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Even if the road is lonely from now on.

555
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,960
What's so special about this bone?

556
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,960
It can even remember the past.

557
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,960
It can let the world know.

558
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,960
I still remember the next week.

559
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,960
I can ask you every shadow.

560
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
You've been in Xizhou for ten years.

561
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,960
Have you never seen the complete Xizhou?

562
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Let me show you.

563
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Mother said the rumors in the room...

564
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Don't bother about this.

565
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,960
When everything is quiet and quiet,

566
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,960
I can see who the moon is.

567
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,960
I can see you are already here.

568
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,960
There are 11 gates in Xizhou.

569
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,960
You've only been to Xi'an Gate and Chu Gate.

570
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Today, I'll take you to visit them.

571
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
I want to see Wei Young Palace.

572
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Okay.

573
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,960
I'll let them open all the gates.

574
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Wei Young, Chang Le, Ming Guang Palace,

575
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Beigong and Gui Palace.

576
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
You can see them all.

577
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Okay.

578
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Senior Sister said you've never been here since you came to Xizhou.

579
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Thank you for your guidance and support.

580
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Do you have the key?

581
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,960
I think I can see the scene when they escaped.

582
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
What are you doing?

583
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
I want to write on it.

584
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,960
When we leave, no one can enter.

585
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,960
I want to write a secret here.

586
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,960
What do you want to write? I'll help you.

587
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Chen.

588
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,960
