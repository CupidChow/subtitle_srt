00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Legend of Qing

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The zither here is a piece of legend.

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There is one that you used when you were young.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It was sent to Xizhou after the late emperor died.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
His Highness said that you should choose it yourself.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Which one was used by your master?

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're asking me which one was used by His Highness, right?

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This one.

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's called Changfeng.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Changfeng

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Changfeng's zither plays a tune.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's like the bow of a mountain.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I want this.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Zh Tribute.

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You've lost your candor.

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You must have left a beauty in your mansion.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Friends of your master?

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You are...

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Never mind. Let's talk about it after we get our luggage.

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are Zhou Shengchen's little princess?

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, no. She's my apprentice.

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I understand. I understand. I understand what you mean.

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I know it with your bare hands.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
She can't understand the whole situation.

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That kid, he's the one who made a bad mistake.

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You two.

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What you saw today, don't say it out.

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Do you understand?

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I should call you sister.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I should call you sister.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's the name of your mansion?

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No, no. You misunderstood.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If I don't call you sister, then...

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You... You go out and ask the people in the mansion.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You'll know who I am.

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Me? Go out?

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, brother, why did you scold me?

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Did I say something wrong?

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't take it to heart.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm a king, but I'm a...

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm a rebel.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm not a royal. I haven't read a few books.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I said something wrong. Don't mind.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll apologize to you.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm a rough guy. I really don't...

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You scared my apprentice.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You scared...

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Apprentice?

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The apprentice sent him here?

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't know.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry, sister.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, you can go.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I said something wrong again.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Come on.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The people of Pingqing and King of Pingqing came together.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They brought a lot of harvest this year.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
To thank you for sending troops to save the city last year.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
May I ask if this is the Princess Consort?

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is the Prince's apprentice.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I heard that the Prince's apprentice is a general.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll take it first.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You take it first.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The people under you are just like you.

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
They like to be a wife for others.

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't talk nonsense.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is not the Princess Consort.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I just got the wrong person.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You...

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You guys hurry up.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Give a gift to the prince and Miss Cui.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's okay.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's your fault.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The Prince took an apprentice.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You have to let the people of Xizhou and the King of Pingqing recognize him.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll take you to see the King of Pingqing tomorrow.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's go.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We bow to the King of Pingqing.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We bow to the King of Pingqing.

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We bow to their King of Pingqing.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They have a free man with a longιο

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They bow to their King of Pingqing.

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We bow to their King of Pingqing.

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We bow to their King of Pingqing.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They accept both the throne and the Vishnu Rose

91
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,000
in the name of their king.

92
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,220
Me, too.

93
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,700
Listen.

94
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:55,780
He's also in Prophecy Classroom.

95
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,560
I knew you wouldn't leave my team.

96
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:38,640
说大不大,说小不小的年岁。

97
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,560
I don't see why we couldn't just take him home.

98
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:19,240
Huh?

99
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:28,760
Eh?

100
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Is it a man and a woman?

101
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,260
How did you do that? Let me do it.

102
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
You can't hold it. Open the door.

103
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
This fox fur...

104
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
It's from my room.

105
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Leave it here.

106
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Isn't this from my master's study?

107
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Miss, you're awake.

108
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Do you know that last night, His Highness brought you back?

109
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,760
You actually fell asleep in my master's study.

110
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
I didn't mean to wake you up.

112
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I was just...

113
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
I was just...

114
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Even though His Highness is not a person who can be bothered,

115
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
you can't forget the etiquette of a student.

116
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Especially, His Highness is still the Royal Uncle.

117
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,760
He's the person His Majesty will be taking care of in the future.

118
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
I know.

119
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
But I fell asleep by accident.

120
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,760
I know that you're just tired.

121
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
But this is the Prince's residence, not the Cui's residence.

122
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
You have to be careful.

123
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Master!

124
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
You're finally back!

125
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
I don't know what happened to you.

126
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
You locked yourself in the courtyard.

127
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
You didn't eat or go out.

128
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
You were still reading.

129
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Cheng Qi said that he was thinking about it.

130
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Master, did you do something wrong?

131
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
I'll go check on him later.

132
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
Master, why don't you go over now?

133
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm afraid that you're hungry.

134
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I think Junior is starving.

135
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
You think everyone is like you?

136
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
You won't eat a meal and you'll starve to death?

137
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
I...

138
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Master, you shouldn't be joking around at this time.

139
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Hurry and go over.

140
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Okay. I'll go over now.

141
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I'll go over now.

142
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I heard from your Senior Sister that you were in the closed door.

143
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
But it was because last night,

144
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,760
you slept in the study.

145
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Master, I was wrong.

146
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I forgive you.

147
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Although you forgive me,

148
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
I can't relax and be careful.

149
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I need to study more.

150
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I'm worried.

151
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
I think that instead of wasting your time

152
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
doing one thing over and over again,

153
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
it's better to open your eyes and look at the things around you.

154
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Your Senior Sister is very anxious because you're not going out.

155
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
If she can't see you later,

156
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm afraid she'll tear down the whole palace.

157
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
You need to think clearly.

158
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
I understand.

159
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
I'll go first.

160
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Men's Group

161
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Master,

162
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,760
do you have any understanding of the wet language?

163
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
According to what I know,

164
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,760
the most common method of the usual wet language

165
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,760
is to stimulate your acupuncture points

166
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
and add medical aid.

167
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,760
The more you do it, the more effective it is.

168
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,760
But I think Miss Cui is very smart,

169
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,200
But he didn't listen.

170
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,920
I think

171
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
he is sick.

172
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,360
His mother said that he got sick because his father died.

173
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,200
Have you heard about this old story?

174
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,560
I only heard that the Cui family had a maid.

175
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,080
She was a famous doctor.

176
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,160
No one dared to mention the rest.

177
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Tianxia

178
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,640
If you really can't bear to see her lose her voice

179
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,920
I will find a famous doctor in Xizhou

180
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,840
to treat her.

181
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
But

182
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,160
if I follow Cui's mother's words

183
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,080
I think

184
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,280
Cui is sick.

185
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,880
She needs a new doctor.

186
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
You should tell me

187
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,680
You should tear it off right now.

188
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,840
Why are you hiding it?

189
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,560
Mother, you misunderstood.

190
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
I...

191
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,880
Your Majesty

192
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,480
His Majesty didn't read this letter.

193
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,840
I opened it.

194
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Really?

195
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
What does it say?

196
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,520
Recite it to me.

197
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,160
You dare not say it, but read it.

198
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Zhao Teng

199
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Take it out.

200
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,080
30 for the account.

201
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

202
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,080
Prince Guangling is weak since childhood.

203
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,400
30

204
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,720
I'm afraid he can't stand it.

205
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,400
Then 20.

206
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes.

207
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Your Highness

208
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Please.

209
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Please.

210
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
Mother

211
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,800
Why do you always scold your brother

212
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,280
when I'm wrong?

213
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Kneel.

214
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Kneel.

215
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Kneel.

216
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Your Highness

217
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
Take the medicine.

218
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Take the medicine.

219
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Your Highness

220
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Your Highness

221
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,040
Brother

222
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Your Majesty

223
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Don't move, Your Majesty.

224
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Does it hurt?

225
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,840
I'm sorry to trouble you again.

226
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I'm the emperor's partner.

227
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,760
I should be punished for you.

228
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Your Majesty,

230
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,360
don't you have a gift for Prince Guang Ling?

231
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,760
Yes, bring it here.

232
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
This is...

233
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,160
Your Crown Princess Consort?

234
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,160
His Majesty has ordered

235
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,160
to record the arrival of Miss Cui at the Prince's residence.

236
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,560
After she has completed her task,

237
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
she will be sent to the Eastern Palace every year.

238
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,160
Cui Shi Yi.

239
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Your Highness.

240
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
What are these?

241
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
It's almost my daughter's birthday.

242
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,960
These are all gifts from the palace.

243
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,560
There are gifts from the Empress Dowager, His Majesty, and Prince Guang Ling.

244
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,760
These are birthday gifts from the Northern Chen Cui clan.

245
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
That many?

246
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,160
There are many people in the family.

247
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,760
There are six rooms in the Cui clan.

248
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,960
But the most important is that

249
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,160
the most important is that

250
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,560
the most important is that

251
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
the most important is that

252
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,960
the most important is that

253
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,360
the most important is that

254
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,360
So this is your daughter's room.

255
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
This is my daughter's room.

256
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,760
Please won't forget about it.

257
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,960
There are six rooms there.

258
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,360
But there are three rooms in this room.

259
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
Miss's room is called the Foggy- season's room.

260
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,160
The house is built because of the chief.

261
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,560
Miss is the only girl in the family

262
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,160
and the future Crown Princess Consort.

263
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,560
That must be extra thin.

264
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,360
I forgot what I said.

265
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,360
In the palace, there is no ceremony.

266
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
I forgot.

267
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Chengxu said your birthday is coming.

268
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,360
I never prepared a birthday gift for anyone.

269
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
I thought about it.

270
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,360
I think this might be more suitable.

271
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Let's open it first.

272
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Then we decide if it's suitable.

273
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
This is the reason why I gave you this gift

274
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,360
after I left Zhongzhou.

275
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,360
I wanted to give it to my brother,

276
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
but it's also good to give it to you.

277
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
From now on, I don't have to think about your birthday every year.

278
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
It's like this every year.

279
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Such an important thing.

280
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Teacher really wants to give it to me?

281
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,360
As long as you don't like it.

282
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,360
This is the proof that the teacher fights for the people.

283
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,360
I will keep it well and give it to you with my life.

284
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,360
I will keep it well and give it to you with my life.

285
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm going to send the troops.

286
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Prepare yourself.

287
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
This trip will probably take a few months.

288
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
The military provision and the defense of Xizhou City

289
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
must be considered.

290
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Yes, teacher.

291
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Your Highness.

292
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,360
There is one more person you need to consider.

293
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
Oh, right.

294
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I have to go to the capital.

295
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Oh, right.

296
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
There is Shiyi.

297
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,360
In the past, we went out of the battle as soon as we said we would.

298
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
The royal family was also in a hurry.

299
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
This time,

300
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,360
with your little disciple,

301
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
we can't go so casually.

302
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Then just wear it.

303
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
So that everyone can rest assured.

304
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
How can that work?

305
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
If Cui knows that we took Junior Sister to the battlefield,

306
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,360
then we must fight with the teacher.

307
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,360
Yes, teacher.

308
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,360
You don't need to touch�

309
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
You forgot about the second half?

310
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
I don't know how I forgot the pen.

311
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Let me do it.

312
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
What are you thinking?

313
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Mom said that

314
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
this sentence means

315
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,360
a woman is a beast, a man is a soul

316
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,360
love is a harmony, a heart is a stone

317
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,360
When you are done with your studies, you can make up for the rest.

318
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,360
I'm leaving. I came to tell you something.

319
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Where are you going?

320
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
I don't usually live in the palace.

321
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,360
For a year, I have to stay out for eight or nine months.

322
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,360
It's the same in the future. You have to get used to it.

323
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,360
After I leave, besides the guards,

324
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,360
there are only you and Cheng Xi. Take care of yourself.

325
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Okay, there's nothing else to explain.

326
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
I'm leaving.

327
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
The report.

328
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Okay, wait for my report.

329
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,360
From now on, Wang Jun only has reports.

330
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
I'm leaving.

331
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,360
Waiting for the rain

332
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,360
The star in my heart is white as a fire

333
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,360
There is a glimmer of light

334
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,360
It's because of you that the night is bright

335
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
There are too many wishes to meet

336
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Master, Senior Sister, Senior Brother

337
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
Take care.

338
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,360
The three branches of the snow are scattered

339
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Who is the one who missed the first time?

340
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,360
The flowers are blooming, the heart is only for you

341
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,360
As the master said, he is always out for a year.

342
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,360
And the manor of the South City always seems to have only me.

343
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,360
I don't ask, I hope to spend my life with you

344
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,360
If this life is only for you

345
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Waiting for the years to open up

346
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Let's meet again, let the night stars

347
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
The night stars

348
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,360
The master is used to saying that the son has no heart

349
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
The promised wife

350
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Ten times nine times not to do

351
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Only one thing he did

352
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Wang Jun never lost

353
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Only report

354
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,360
If this life is only for you

355
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Waiting for the years to open up

356
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Let's meet again, let the night stars

357
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
The night stars

358
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
The night stars

359
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
The night stars

360
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
The night stars

361
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,360
The night stars

362
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
The night stars

363
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
The night stars

364
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
The night stars

365
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,360
At the end of the night

366
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
The sound of the bell

367
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
The night stars

368
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
The night stars

369
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
The night stars

370
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,360
What's wrong? You think I'm your master?

371
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
My master is at the military camp.

372
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Why didn't you go back to the manor?

373
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
He was injured, afraid of leaking information.

374
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
So he is at the military camp to recuperate.

375
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Where to?

376
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
Military camp

377
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
You forgot, master doesn't let you go to the military camp.

378
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,360
That's the order before leaving.

379
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
Now I'm back and I don't count.

380
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
OK, I'll take you to the military camp.

381
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
I just made a sound.

382
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Master shouldn't blame you.

383
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
I'll take the first sword, you take the tree.

384
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,360
The Cui family is good at military camp.

385
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
You have a lot of courage.

386
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Sister

387
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Come on, come in with me.

388
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Take the punishment.

389
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,360
Be careful.

390
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Come in.

391
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Have you come in?

392
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
Shiyi

393
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
What's wrong?

394
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
I recognize you.

395
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
It's been a year, right?

396
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
How long have we been away?

397
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,360
It's been 19 months since we left Xi Zhou.

398
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Your wound

399
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
It's okay, don't worry about this.

400
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Master, I have prepared the food as you ordered.

401
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,360
OK, then tonight you take the food to the kitchen.

402
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
Go to the camp.

403
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
I'll go, master.

404
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,360
I'm a little more familiar with him.

405
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
OK

406
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Then you send the report back to Zhongzhou.

407
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
Yes

408
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Fortunately, the little sister came today.

409
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,360
Even if we are not here, someone will take care of the master.

410
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
I'll tell you something.

411
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Master was hit by a poisonous arrow and fell down.

412
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
It hurt his arm.

413
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Although the poison has been reduced, the wound will always repeat.

414
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
There will be a broken bone.

415
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Master doesn't let it go.

416
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
It will get worse every night.

417
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
So you have to be careful.

418
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Then I'll leave it to you.

419
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
My brother entrusted it to you.

420
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,360
Don't worry, I'm here, he's here.

421
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,360
I'm here, master is here.

422
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,360
Have a good rest, your highness.

423
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Why are you here?

424
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
I'm worried about you.

425
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Go to the sister's tent and rest.

426
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Miss can't help you.

427
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
Leave it to me.

428
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Go.

429
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Go.

430
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
What's the matter, Miss?

431
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
This

432
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,360
I'm afraid that His Highness will blame me.

433
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I'm begging you.

434
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Okay, okay.

435
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,360
I'm sorry.

436
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm sorry.

437
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,360
If I don't drink it, the medicine will get cold.

438
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
I'm sorry.

439
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
I'm sorry.

440
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Why are you here?

441
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
I'm sorry.

442
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Miss, why are you here?

443
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
You drank it all?

444
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
No, no.

445
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
The medicine spilled.

446
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
You're too kind.

447
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
I'll go get the medicine.

448
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
No, no.

449
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
It spilled.

450
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,360
It spilled.

451
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Miss, what's going on?

452
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
Doctor.

453
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Your Highness.

454
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I accidentally spilled the medicine.

455
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Please give me another bowl.

456
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
I'll go get it right away.

457
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
But I have to wait another hour.

458
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
It's okay.

459
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,360
I'll go get it right away.

460
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
It's just a bowl of medicine.

461
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
It won't kill me in an hour.

462
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Why are you in such a hurry?

463
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
I'll go get it right away.

464
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
What are you doing?

465
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Whatever Teacher says,

466
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
I won't leave.

467
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
You decided?

468
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,920
These days, I'm afraid that the poison will spread out.

469
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,920
So I only let Xiaoyu and Tianxing stay here with me.

470
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,920
What they can do, I can do too.

471
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Fine. If you're tired, you can sleep over there.

472
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,360
I'll sleep here.

473
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,360
Today, Senior and Senior both said it was wrong.

474
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,360
The day after tomorrow, it will be the whole 19 months.

475
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,360
The 19 months you left the Wang family.

476
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,360
I'm looking for a love

477
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,360
I know it's because I'm thinking of you

478
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:04,360
But I can't stop myself from falling in love

479
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
The color of the flowers is so beautiful

480
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,360
I'll greet you after I get used to it

481
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,360
How can I write a name for my pen?

482
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,360
How can I be with you when we are apart?

483
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,360
The moon is full of flowers under the bridge

484
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:40,360
How can I write a name for my pen?

485
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:47,360
I hear the snow fall one by one

486
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,360
I'm thinking of you, but I can't stop myself from smiling

487
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:03,360
How can I write a name for my pen?

488
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:10,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

489
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

490
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:27,360
I'll run to you from far away

491
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

492
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:48,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

493
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:56,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

494
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:03,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

495
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:33,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

496
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:40,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

497
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:48,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

498
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:56,360
I'll spend my whole life with you

499
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Who is this dream for?

500
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,360
My heart is a stage

501
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,360
I can't love, my heart is burning

502
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,360
The reliance I yearn for

503
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,360
The pain is burning outside, the pain is burning inside

504
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,360
I'm in pain

505
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,360
I'm in pain

506
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,360
I'm in pain

507
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,360
I'm in pain

508
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
The world is full of flowers

509
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
The sword is like a horse

510
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,360
The snake is like a snake

511
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,360
The story is like a flash of light

512
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,360
The city is cold and the snow is cold

513
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:53,360
The love is floating away

514
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,360
I can't love, my heart is burning

515
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,360
The pain is burning outside, the pain is burning inside

516
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
The world is full of flowers

517
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
The sword is like a horse

518
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,360
The snake is like a snake

519
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,360
The story is like a flash of light

520
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,360
The city is cold and the snow is cold

521
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:36,360
The love is floating away

522
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,360
The end
