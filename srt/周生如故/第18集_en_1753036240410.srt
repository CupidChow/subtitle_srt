1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,420
.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to stay in Xizhou.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Like you, Senior Brother.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like you, Senior Sister.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just one more step.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can stay in Wangfu.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll take the next step.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Don't come.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Episode 16

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mother, are you still blaming me for what happened back then?

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I just don't understand you.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You and I are biological mother and son.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why do you always believe in what others say and not me?

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Your grandfather was not even a year old.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The Empress Dowager was a court lady.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They were very close.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why can they do that?

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You and I are biological mother and son.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why can't you do that?

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
These years,

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mother used all kinds of means in the palace.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She has been hard to convince.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I didn't see her.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But after Zhao Teng's death,

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I didn't want to be involved in Mother's bedding.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But Mother,

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
she took over the treasury and used it to make a living.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And the money is more important than the money.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's also very important.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't leave it alone.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hui'er,

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
if it wasn't for me,

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you would have died.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Without the money,

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
there would be no me.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What can you do if you let your uncles be so arrogant?

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't want to let the people down.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What do you mean by that?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why are you not drinking?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Are you afraid that I will poison you?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Drink it.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Drink it.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I didn't poison you.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I can't bear to leave you.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are my biological son.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I am the most

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
in the position of your father.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You'd better stop drinking.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The doctor said that you shouldn't drink these days.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I am willing to leave.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I will take my leave.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will take my leave.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hui'er,

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
since you are filial,

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
why don't you drink this for me?

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Have you ever tried this wine?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Give this wine to His Majesty.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Empress Dowager.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Your Majesty.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Leave us.

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You are so clever.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You poisoned the wine.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Drink it.

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Your Majesty.

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Your Beilun

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
has decided to rest

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
in the ancient palace.

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Your Majesty.

73
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Your Majesty.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Mother.

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mother.

76
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I beg you.

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let His Majesty see his child.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Mother.

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Empress Dowager.

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The child is not alive.

81
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mother.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Take the child away first.

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mother.

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mother.

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Please.

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Give my child back to me.

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Mother.

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
My child.

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Empress Dowager.

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Is that the grandson?

92
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I am happy to have a grandson.

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Send out the news.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
His Majesty is happy to have a prince.

96
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Zhongzhou City is now free from the Xiaojin.

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The palace is on fire.

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It will be closed for 15 days.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

100
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Empress Dowager.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Please.

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Please.

103
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Empress Dowager.

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Please.

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Please.

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Please.

107
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Please.

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Please.

109
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Please.

110
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Empress Dowager.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
General Qin has gone out of the city.

112
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He went south.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He is lonely.

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He ran away.

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He is short-lived.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He is not worth it.

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Where is Concubine Jiang?

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She died.

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What is your name?

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Empress Dowager.

121
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I am Yuan Wuchu.

122
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I am the vice commander of the imperial guards.

123
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
From now on,

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you will be in charge of the imperial guards.

125
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Thank you Empress Dowager.

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Kill the palace guards,

127
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
eunuchs,

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and the imperial doctors

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
who gave birth to Concubine Jiang.

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you leave

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
one alive,

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you will not live either.

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Empress Dowager.

135
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Qin Yan is a member of the King of Nancheng.

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If he tells the emperor that he died...

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He wouldn't dare.

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He is not afraid of me.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He is afraid of his old master, King of Nancheng.

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
he went south

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
to learn from Liu Changshan

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and run southward.

144
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I congratulate you.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In 15 days,

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the crown prince will be conferred.

147
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

148
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is the divorce letter I wrote.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Keep it.

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Once the aunt

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
gets the Empress Dowager's approval,

152
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
she will give it to the princess.

153
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If she does so, she can leave the mansion

154
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and not be comforted.

155
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay.

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You must protect yourself in the palace.

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Who just left the city?

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
General, it was the imperial governor.

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He...

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Miss, go back to the mansion first.

161
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You guard the door. Yes.

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Come with me.

165
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Look.

166
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is the gift of Grand Tutor Xie.

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's from Grand Tutor.

168
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why do you have it?

169
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Someone wrapped this in a jimpa

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and threw it into the Cui mansion.

171
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He said it was his personal gift.

172
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
As long as you see it, you will recognize it.

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The letter says

174
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
there is a change in the palace.

175
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay.

176
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I felt strange

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
at the gate.

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The people were celebrating.

179
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The general was waiting for me.

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I didn't want to be in the way.

181
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Third Miss, a eunuch

182
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
came to the mansion.

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He said he would take the princess and the girl to the palace to congratulate the prince.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The princess came to the palace.

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why did she let Shiyi go with her?

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The eunuch said

187
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Prince Guangling grew up in the palace.

188
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He has a deep relationship with the emperor and the empress dowager.

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The empress dowager has always

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
treated Prince Guangling as her own son.

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The prince was born.

192
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He will let the future princess

193
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
come to the palace to congratulate him.

194
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Please take my greetings

195
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
to the palace.

196
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is the imperial edict

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
from the empress dowager.

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't worry, I will do it.

199
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Sister,

200
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
why don't you come with me?

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I will go with you.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I will go with you.

203
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Bravo!

204
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The people are celebrating the birth of the new prince.

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I have long forgotten

206
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that Brother Ziqian is the new prince.

207
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Life is full of ups and downs.

208
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Shiyi, he has suffered a lot in the palace.

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He has not won the throne

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and he has not married you.

211
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Be good to him.

212
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As long as you are good to him,

213
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I will do my best to take care of you.

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I have never heard of these words.

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You are not allowed to say it again.

216
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Even if you are the princess,

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
you can't say it.

218
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The palace

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Prince Guangling, Your Highness.

220
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Princess, Shiyi

221
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I will take you to the palace.

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The empress dowager is having a banquet with the concubines.

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I will not be able to attend the banquet.

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I will send you in and then I will leave.

225
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

226
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Have you ever seen the new prince?

227
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The empress dowager is very nervous

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
about the birth of the new prince.

229
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
She personally reported to the palace to take care of him.

230
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
She has never seen the new prince's birth mother.

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I will go with you.

232
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Every palace has died before.

233
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The luck is hard to disperse.

234
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It is much colder than outside the palace.

235
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I am the one who took care of Li's family.

236
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It is just that Li's family

237
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
is only born for me.

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And will always be like this to everyone.

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's go.

240
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do not let the empress dowager wait.

241
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

242
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

243
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

244
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

245
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

246
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

247
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

248
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,600
If the relationship between people

249
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,400
is really unpredictable,

250
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,800
your brother is the governor of Taiyuan County

251
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
and you are watching my father.

252
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,120
But you and I are drinking in the palace

253
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,520
at the banquet.

254
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
It's you, Imperial Concubine Jing.

255
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

256
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,680
I have a question in my heart.

257
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,640
I want you to answer it.

258
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,840
Imperial Concubine, please ask.

259
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,680
His Majesty sent Cui Feng to the Taiyuan County

260
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,800
to be the governor.

261
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,280
Is there a saying that

262
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,880
I can kill my father at any time?

263
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,520
Governor Zhou has the duty of monitoring

264
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,720
and also the duty of transporting troops

265
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
to suppress local feudal lords.

266
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,880
Not only my brother,

267
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,560
but all the 13 governors of our country

268
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,320
are the same.

269
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,920
I think as long as General Jing

270
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,720
is loyal to His Majesty,

271
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,920
my brother will never use military power.

272
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,400
Thank you for your understanding.

273
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Episode 11

274
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Have an early rest.

275
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,320
Imperial Concubine has drunk a lot tonight.

276
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
How can she see His Majesty?

277
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,680
His Majesty adores Imperial Concubine Jiang.

278
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,400
He rarely calls other concubines,

279
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,720
especially Imperial Concubine.

280
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
Everyone in the palace knows

281
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,320
that he and His Majesty are not compatible.

282
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,920
Since Imperial Concubine Jiang gave birth to a son,

283
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
there has been no concubine who can see His Majesty.

284
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,920
facing the battlefields personally.

285
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,640
What are you looking at,

286
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,040
not afraid of being seen.

287
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
What happened?

288
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
A big thing.

289
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Your Majesty,

290
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
the family is dead.

291
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
My son

292
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
is dead.

293
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Your Majesty.

294
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
We shaved our hair.

295
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Let's go to the palace

296
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,040
and pray for His Majesty.

297
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I don't want to shave my hair.

298
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I guessed that

299
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
only you would disobey me

300
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
in the palace.

301
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
I also guessed that

302
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
the Empress Dowager

303
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
would not dare to touch me.

304
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
The 13th Army of the court

305
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
is the most powerful in Xizhou.

306
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Taiyuan Army is the most powerful.

307
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
My father never let anyone do anything.

308
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
You want me to shave my hair

309
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
is to make me

310
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
locked in the palace and threaten my father.

311
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
You are the most intelligent

312
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
in the palace.

313
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
It's a pity

314
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
that your man, my son

315
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
is already dead.

316
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Send the Empress Dowager and the concubines

317
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
to the palace.

318
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
I will go to the palace.

319
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
I will go to the palace.

320
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
I will go to the palace.

321
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I will go to the palace.

322
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Let's go to the palace.

323
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
I will go to the palace.

324
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Your marriage with Zixing

325
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
will be delayed.

326
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
His Majesty is the Emperor,

327
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
and the people are all his.

328
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
How can Shiyi talk about marriage?

329
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Then, let's stay in the palace

330
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
and accompany me for a while.

331
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
I will obey your order.

332
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
You are not a concubine.

333
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
You are the only daughter of Cui Sanniang.

334
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Prince Guanglin's wife is not married yet.

335
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Brother is the heir of Taiyun County.

336
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Master is the king of Xiao Nan.

337
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
This is the reason

338
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
why I want you to stay in the palace.

339
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Shiyi guessed it right.

340
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Your Majesty is six years old.

341
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I held his hand

342
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,040
and walked into the Taiji Palace.

343
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Now, I am lost.

344
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
He has left,

345
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
but I am still here.

346
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
If you are sad,

347
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
you should go back to the palace and rest.

348
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
The Emperor died

349
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
because of your uncle and three royal relatives.

350
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
They worked together

351
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
to make you wait for him all night.

352
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
I am so worried.

353
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,040
I have told you

354
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
that it is dangerous at night.

355
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
If you are not careful,

356
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
the game will be over.

357
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Tonight, there are people

358
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
who are with Cui.

359
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
I am sure of it.

360
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
I will go to the palace.

361
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
This is the place

362
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
where the previous emperors

363
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
used to deal with political affairs.

364
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Your Majesty.

365
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Write three letters for me.

366
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Yes.

367
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
This letter

368
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
tells him

369
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
that the Emperor died

370
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
and his grandson is going to be crowned.

371
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
The situation in the court is complicated.

372
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
He asked if he could

373
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
enter the capital alone

374
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
as he did before

375
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
and confess his feelings

376
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
in front of the officials.

377
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Why didn't you write it down?

378
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
I can't write it down.

379
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Why?

380
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
Please find someone else.

381
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
I can't write this letter down.

382
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Tell me what you are afraid of.

383
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Just one letter

384
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
makes you afraid of what?

385
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
You are afraid that

386
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Zhou Shengchen will see

387
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
your handwriting,

388
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
worry about you and risk your life to enter the capital.

389
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Are you two

390
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
really like the rumors

391
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
and have a secret relationship?

392
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Master treats all his disciples like family.

393
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
If today,

394
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
my senior or senior wrote this letter,

395
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
he would come to save me.

396
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
But if today,

397
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
my senior or senior were here,

398
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
no one would do this

399
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
and put the master in danger.

400
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
You are not afraid of death?

401
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
I will let the Empress Dowager decide.

402
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
You

403
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
are a man of love.

404
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
You are a man of love.

405
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
But you are very secretive.

406
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
This Prince of Nanchen

407
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
is really crazy.

408
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Shiyi,

409
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
your uncle saved me twice.

410
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
I won't kill you.

411
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Guards.

412
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Guards.

413
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
If my father knew you treated me like this,

414
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
he would have killed you.

415
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Concubine Gu,

416
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
the rest of the concubines have been sent to Ni Guan.

417
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Only Concubine Gu is left here.

418
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
This is enough to show the Empress Dowager

419
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
how she takes care of you.

420
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
How she takes care of me?

421
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
She is afraid of my father.

422
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Father.

423
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
I'm afraid you don't know how old Concubine Gu was.

424
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
She was older than your father.

425
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
She was older than your father.

426
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
What happened in the end?

427
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
She didn't die in the palace.

428
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
She died in the palace.

429
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
It's the same path you just walked.

430
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
You are all noble people.

431
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
As long as you don't hurt each other,

432
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
no one can hurt you.

433
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Close the door.

434
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Close the door.

435
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
How did the older brother

436
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
of Empress Dowager Gao die?

437
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

438
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Gao Guo was tricked into the palace

439
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
by Empress Dowager's edict.

440
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Xiao Lu was surrounded by soldiers in the palace.

441
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,500
She was killed by the

442
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
fire of the fire.

443
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Did Empress Dowager want to

444
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
kill her father

445
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
or your master

446
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
for the sake of the common good?

447
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Empress Dowager.

448
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
How is the outside of the palace?

449
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
The ceremony is still going on.

450
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
It's very lively.

451
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Prime Minister hasn't arrived yet?

452
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
He is on his way.

453
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Close the gate.

454
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Without my order,

455
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
no one is allowed to enter Zhongzhou City.

456
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Yes.

457
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We are sorry.

458
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Bye.

459
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,980
Stop.

460
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Push it! This is the carriage from the city!

461
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
This is our people.

462
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
You are?

463
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
The King of Nancheng.

464
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
So boring.

465
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Imperial Concubine is not like a person who has no husband.

466
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,040
She doesn't like me. Why should I be sad for her?

467
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,040
But you have been to heaven and earth, and had a couple's ceremony.

468
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Won't you have a different feeling from others?

469
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,040
I have been to heaven and earth because I value him as the King.

470
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,040
I have been to heaven and earth because I want a prince and want to be the Empress Dowager.

471
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,040
I have feelings between Liu Hui and Concubine Jiang.

472
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
I don't have feelings between her and me.

473
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Sooner or later, the East Capital, the Central Capital, the West Capital, and the West State will belong to my father.

474
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,040
By then, your father will die soon.

475
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,040
It seems that we can only have the friendship of tonight.

476
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Yes. We are destined to be enemies in the future.

477
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,040
But before we become enemies, we have to get out alive.

478
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Your Highness.

479
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Your Highness.

480
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Why did you come back?

481
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
I...

482
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,040
I finally got you back.

483
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
I have a friend to save me.

484
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,040
I was so angry that I tried to kill the prince.

485
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
No.

486
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Actually, the child is fake.

487
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,040
He is not a prince.

488
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Concubine Jiang didn't have a prince.

489
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
She did.

490
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
But the child was gone that night.

491
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
The Empress Dowager was afraid that this would be exposed.

492
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,040
She killed 29 people in the Imperial Palace, including the imperial physician, maid and maid maid.

493
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
And Concubine Jiang.

494
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
I was threatened.

495
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I shouldn't have said anything.

496
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Prime Minister's family is in the mansion.

497
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
How can you threaten them?

498
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
No. She...

499
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,040
My master didn't mean to investigate this matter.

500
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,040
If you do as he said,

501
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,040
you will have the chance to atone for your crime.

502
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,040
I am willing to listen to your order.

503
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
From tonight,

504
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,040
they will follow you step by step.

505
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Okay.

506
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
What's next?

507
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
What is he going to do?

508
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
The new emperor will ascend the throne.

509
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
He will listen to the government.

510
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Since he wants the new emperor to ascend the throne,

511
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
you help him to accomplish this.

512
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Let an unborn prince ascend the throne?

513
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Yes.

514
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Do you remember how Liu Yuan was punished?

515
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
Of course.

516
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Of course.

517
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Do as I said.

518
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Don't think about anything else.

519
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Otherwise, you will be the first one to be buried for the emperor.

520
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,040
I will definitely make up for my mistake.

521
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I will listen to your order.

522
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Liu Yuan

523
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:28,400
So

524
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
I am your uncle.

525
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
From now on, you don't need to be a servant.

526
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
You don't need to be a servant.

527
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
You are worthy of being a servant.

528
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Today, I only brought

529
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
the wooden sword from the imperial palace.

530
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
I am your uncle.

531
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
To me, you are more important than the imperial palace.

532
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Uncle.

533
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
It's all my fault.

534
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
I didn't protect you well.

535
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
Your Majesty.

536
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,040
Your Majesty!

537
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,040
your Majesty

538
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Your Majesty

539
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
Your Majesty.

540
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
Your Majesty.

541
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Your Majesty.

542
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Your Majesty.

543
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,040
The country cannot be without a king.

544
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,040
Although Your Majesty has returned to heaven,

545
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,640
you left us a prince.

546
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
I think

547
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,840
the prince should ascend the throne immediately

548
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,840
to stabilize the court and the people.

549
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Your Majesty.

550
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Your Majesty.

551
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,540
This concerns the safety of the country.

552
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
The prince has just been born

553
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,340
and he has already ascended the throne.

554
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,840
He is afraid that the people will not obey him

555
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
and the country will be in chaos.

556
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,340
Your Majesty, please be careful.

557
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,840
It is a custom for our young children to ascend the throne.

558
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,340
The five-year-old Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne

559
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,040
and the six-year-old Emperor Xianli ascended the throne.

560
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,840
It is all decided by Your Majesty.

561
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,340
Why can't we do it today?

562
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
You are wrong.

563
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Your Majesty.

564
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,240
The six-year-old Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne

565
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,040
is a wise decision.

566
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,040
Back then, the Gao family was in control of the country.

567
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,840
If the Emperor does not ascend the throne,

568
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,740
Zhongzhou will be in the hands of the Gao family.

569
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,040
Now, there is no danger of that time.

570
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,040
Why don't we choose a man

571
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
who is just the right age

572
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,240
to take over the throne?

573
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,240
The Emperor's bones are not yet cold.

574
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,540
The young son is still crying in the palace.

575
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,940
Cui Shizhong can't wait to take over the new crown.

576
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
I am not thinking about it.

577
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
I have no selfish motives.

578
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
You don't have to explain to me.

579
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,840
Explain to the Empress Dowager.

580
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Empress Dowager.

581
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,040
Prepare to ascend the throne.

582
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

583
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,840
The Cui family's objection

584
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
makes me very uneasy.

585
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,040
After ascending the throne, everything will be settled.

586
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,040
Even if Cui family

587
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,040
opposes with the Yizhong Wang family,

588
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,840
it is useless.

589
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,840
But this child can hide for a while.

590
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,840
He can't hide for a lifetime.

591
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
The late King of the Lingtao

592
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,840
has a five-year-old son

593
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
named Liu Zichen.

594
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Do you remember him?

595
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,240
Except for Zhou Shengchen,

596
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,840
this is the closest

597
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
to the blood of the previous emperor.

598
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,240
Tomorrow, I will take him to the palace.

599
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
After this,

600
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,240
Empress Dowager will order the world

601
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,640
to say that she was deceived by Concubine Jiang.

602
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840
It turns out that the prince is a fake.

603
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Push all this on Concubine Jiang.

604
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
But Concubine Jiang died early.

605
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,840
The outside world doesn't know.

606
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
After that, the Empress Dowager ordered

607
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,440
Concubine Jiang to die four times.

608
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,240
Liu Zichen will be the emperor.

609
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,640
Then you can explain to the officials

610
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,640
and the kings.

611
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,440
A five-year-old child

612
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,040
is not up to the Empress Dowager.

613
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
It's so absurd.

614
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,440
I'm afraid the officials in the court won't believe it.

615
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
I'm here.

616
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,040
Zhao, Liu Zichen enters the palace.

617
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,040
I obey the decree.

618
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Master is worried about Junior Sister.

619
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Junior Sister is in the palace.

620
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
The Empress Dowager knows

621
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,640
she can control many people.

622
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,240
She doesn't dare to do anything.

623
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,240
Since Master is so determined,

624
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,240
why are you still worried?

625
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,040
Go to Cui's Mansion.

626
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,240
The Empress Dowager is worried about Junior Sister.

627
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
