1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

4
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,840
The princess you slow down the princess you slow down

5
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

6
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Brother Zi Xing Xinhua

7
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Brother Zi Xing

8
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,160
These are all the desserts that came in from the south yesterday

9
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,880
It's made of earth honey wild mountain tangerine and wolf milk

10
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,640
It's very good for your health

11
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,960
I asked the emperor to come over and try some for you

12
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
You put it here first. I'll eat it when I'm done

13
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,240
What are you busy with? It won't taste good later

14
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Come and try one

15
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Is it good

16
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Eat more

17
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
You

18
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Master

19
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
You have three hours in advance

20
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Those soldiers are not easy to kill

21
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Me and the four sisters are still slow

22
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Say something serious

23
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Okay, serious

24
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,240
Master, we met a group of monks from the west this time

25
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
They came from Zhongli

26
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
Monks

27
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
The army of the South Dynasty still besieged the temple

28
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
It's not because the temple was besieged

29
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Monks saw the refugees from the south

30
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
They took over hundreds of people in the temple

31
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Later, the more refugees there were, the more they were

32
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
The temple could not support them

33
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
So the abbot in the temple decided to escort the refugees to a safe place

34
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Everyone knows that there is a master in the west city

35
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
He won't be attacked

36
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
So naturally came here

37
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Where are the monks and refugees now?

38
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
The refugees are being settled

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Monks are outside the city

40
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Qian Lan Temple

41
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Shiyi

42
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Did you grow taller again?

43
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
You look more and more like a big girl

44
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Didn't I tell you not to come to the army?

45
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
What are you doing here?

46
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
You haven't practiced martial arts

47
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
What?

48
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Do you want me to explain it to you?

49
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Okay, okay

50
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
You're still teaching your sister when master is here

51
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Master, you're right

52
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
You always want to make a joke

53
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
when you don't respect your elders

54
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
You're a good person

55
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Do you want to go to Qian Lan Temple together?

56
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
When did you get hurt?

57
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Why no one gave us news?

58
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
It doesn't matter, it's just a small injury

59
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Master, the monks are inside

60
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
There are still dozens of refugees who have not been settled yet

61
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Leave the weapons outside the temple

62
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Yes

63
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
You wait outside to guard the horses

64
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Yes

65
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Amitabha

66
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Amitabha

67
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Your Highness

68
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
This is the host from the south

69
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Your Highness

70
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Why are they all sitting here?

71
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
I originally arranged a monk room for them

72
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
But there are still some refugees waiting to settle

73
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
I gave it to the refugees first

74
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Amitabha

75
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Amitabha

76
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Your Highness

77
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
You can take in these refugees and us

78
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
They are innocent

79
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
And the masters are from outside the temple

80
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
They can't be taken in

81
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Qian Yun

82
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Take the refugees to Xizhou

83
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
And settle them

84
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Yes

85
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Master, I'll help

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Please take us to the monk room

87
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Please follow me

88
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Master, it's time to change the place

89
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Okay, you go first

90
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
I'll come later

91
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Yes

92
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Who is the one who needs you to change the place?

93
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
It's a monk from the refugees

94
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
He was touched by my Buddha during the escape

95
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
He wants to become a monk

96
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
But our temple is already abandoned

97
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Today, we can only change the place

98
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
And make arrangements

99
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
If you don't mind

100
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm willing to help you

101
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Really?

102
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Amitabha

103
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Your Highness, I'm very grateful

104
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Go change the place for the disciples

105
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Don't let them wait

106
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Please, Your Highness

107
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I'll leave

108
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Shiyi

109
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Think about

110
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
The names of the new disciples

111
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Me?

112
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
You can think about it

113
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Do you want to see

114
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
How they are going to change the place?

115
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Let's go

116
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Let's go

117
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Let's go

118
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Let's go to the Cangjing Building

119
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Master

120
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Master

121
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
I want to talk to this master

122
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
How?

123
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Okay

124
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Leave the knife

125
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Master

126
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
You're so stubborn

127
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Who are you?

128
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Get up

129
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Go

130
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Go back

131
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
I've made up my mind

132
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
We won't leave you

133
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
You're from Nanxiao

134
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Go with me

135
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Go

136
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Leave

137
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
General, did you catch the wrong person?

138
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
He came with us

139
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
The guards are very strong

140
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
If you want to live, leave

141
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Go

142
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Go

143
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Go

144
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Master

145
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Master

146
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Sword

147
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Sword

148
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
You speak well

149
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
I

150
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
It's okay

151
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Take your time

152
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Long time no see, Second Prince

153
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Your Highness

154
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I missed such a party

155
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Be serious

156
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
Be serious

157
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
Master

158
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Change me and Fourth Sister

159
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Let her be the senior

160
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
She will be so embarrassed

161
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I think it's okay

162
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Master

163
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Is Si Miao your old friend?

164
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Yes

165
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
He is the second prince of Nanxiao

166
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
I had a few relationships with him

167
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
A few years ago

168
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
He brought the emperor of Nanxiao

169
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
To have a meeting with me

170
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
He is a highly favored prince

171
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
His position is only for the crown prince

172
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
After that, I don't know what happened

173
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
He started to live in seclusion

174
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
Without seeing outsiders

175
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Even the officials he appointed

176
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Want to see him

177
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
So in recent years

178
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Very few people have seen him

179
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
I thought I was an assassin

180
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Let's report this to the capital first

181
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Let the emperor decide

182
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Fengqiao

183
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Take her to the Buddha's house later

184
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Yes

185
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
When I was a teacher

186
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
I couldn't change a teacher

187
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Today I will make up for it

188
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Master

189
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
You can talk

190
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Master is happier than anyone

191
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Why bother?

192
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
You can tell me if you need anything

193
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
I will be here

194
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
I will be here

195
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
I will be here

196
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
I will be here

197
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I will be here

198
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
You can tell me if you need anything

199
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
A bowl of rice

200
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
A fish

201
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Even if you help me today

202
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
I won't be selfish

203
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
I am not helping you

204
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
I am just helping myself to escape from Nanxiao

205
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Stop

206
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Go in and report to General Cui

207
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Yes

208
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
General Tong

209
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
General Cui

210
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
General Tong

211
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
General Cui, how long have you been waiting?

212
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Not long, four hours

213
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
I woke up in the morning and waited on the wall

214
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
I didn't even have lunch

215
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
I came back to have dinner

216
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
When I heard that General Peng was back

217
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
I immediately let go

218
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
How dare you

219
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
Go in and talk

220
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Ok

221
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
General Hong

222
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Thank you General Cui

223
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
General Hong, eat while it's hot

224
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
You eat

225
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I... General Cui

226
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
This thing

227
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
How does he eat it?

228
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Yes, yes, yes

229
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Come, come, come

230
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
I'll make it for you

231
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
You eat first

232
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I'll do it myself

233
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
It's ok, you can't eat this in the northwest all year round

234
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
I just want you to taste it

235
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Come, eat it first

236
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
This is nutritious

237
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Is it delicious?

238
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Yes, it's delicious

239
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
You eat too

240
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Ok

241
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
You eat this

242
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Ok, ok, you eat first

243
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Come

244
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Thank you

245
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Take him out

246
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Find a place to make trouble

247
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Kill him

248
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Zhao Teng

249
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
You bastard

250
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Even if I die

251
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
I want you to die

252
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Take him out

253
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Bastard

254
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Take him out

255
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Take him out

256
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Who else?

257
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Who else wants to report?

258
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Prime Minister

259
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
I have nothing to report

260
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Good, no matter what, leave

261
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
I

262
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
want to report

263
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I ask

264
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Your Majesty

265
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Let me

266
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Go back to Qinghe

267
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
What for?

268
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
I

269
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
This hand

270
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Do you still remember

271
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Of course I remember

272
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
This is the master of Taifu Qishi

273
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
He was the master of Taifu Qishi

274
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,040
This stone Websis bribes you

275
00:20:50,040 --> 00:21:15,420
to gather the Xun's

276
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,860
After the year of Gu Xi,

277
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,340
please allow me to leave the court

278
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,540
and only stay in the court for ten days until I die.

279
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,780
Your Majesty, why don't you let me go?

280
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,980
I...

281
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,540
your ruinło

282
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,940
This is...

283
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,900
Here's some Indiana corn and bubble tea primarily

284
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,440
added with Germany and talking of the

285
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:31,700
These

286
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Please speak.

287
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
If you want to live,

288
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,700
please leave Zhongzhou

289
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
and leave the place you are now.

290
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,700
Have you forgotten

291
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
that I have a engagement with Cui?

292
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,700
Forget it.

293
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
I am sorry.

294
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Have you ever been surprised at midnight?

295
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Mother.

296
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,700
You have been in office for 15 years.

297
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Do you feel guilty?

298
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Your Majesty, we should leave here.

299
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
Zhong Qing is waiting for you.

300
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Are you going to lock me up here forever?

301
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Mother,

302
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
you can rest in the harem for a few days.

303
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Don't interfere with the court affairs.

304
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
You are in danger.

305
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
Zhao Teng, you traitor!

306
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,700
You kidnapped His Majesty and imprisoned the Empress Dowager.

307
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I trusted you wrongly!

308
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
You!

309
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

310
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,700
I almost thought there was no one in the harem.

311
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Zhang Quan has left.

312
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,700
The only ones left are the imprisoned Empress Dowager

313
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,700
and the crown prince who never gets a chance to be crowned.

314
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
If you want to get out of this cage,

315
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
please listen to me.

316
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,700
We can't escape from each other's grudges.

317
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Helping each other is the only way out.

318
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I'm sorry.

319
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,700
My trusted men were all killed by Zhao Teng

320
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,700
in order to save me.

321
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,700
What else can I do now?

322
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
I will save you

323
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,700
and then give you what you want.

324
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
What do you want?

325
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I want to be crowned as the crown prince.

326
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
I want...

327
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
The throne?

328
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
The world is unfair.

329
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,700
A person's feelings are too vague.

330
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,700
Only then can you make a good son.

331
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:17,700
I never thought that you would be the last person standing by me.

332
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
You are too kind, Your Majesty.

333
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Save me first.

334
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
I will help you.

335
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Your Highness.

336
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Is Shiyi inside?

337
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
Yes, her grandfather is here.

338
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,700
She has read all the books in this library.

339
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
I'm going to go.

340
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Don't people usually clean up?

341
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
I'm afraid that they are not careful enough

342
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,700
so I clean it up by myself.

343
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,700
In the palace, only here can't be lit.

344
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Isn't it cold?

345
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
It's not cold.

346
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
It's not cold when it's cold.

347
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Next time, let's discuss it in a warmer place.

348
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,700
The books are always here and won't get cold.

349
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,700
A letter from Qinghe County wants you to go back.

350
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Why do I have to go back all of a sudden?

351
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Duke Cui has given his official title to return to his hometown.

352
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,700
He called on the Crown Prince of Cui to return to Qinghe County

353
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,700
and we will go back to the capital together.

354
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Including me and my brother?

355
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Yes.

356
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
When?

357
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
Next month.

358
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Can we come back after the war?

359
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,700
I can't decide your stay.

360
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,700
After all, Qinghe County is your hometown.

361
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,700
The favorite disciple of King Nanchen

362
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,700
wants to see the Western State under the system

363
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
and he has to sneak up on the roof.

364
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
If he says it, no one will believe it.

365
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
I'm afraid I'll go back to Qinghe County.

366
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
The chief has been in the old west for a year.

367
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
He should have returned to his hometown.

368
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,700
He called on the Crown Prince of Cui to return to his hometown.

369
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,700
Including me.

370
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,700
When?

371
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,700
Mother said it would be better if it was soon.

372
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
I have a marriage contract.

373
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,700
I may enter the palace at any time.

374
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,700
I will return to Qinghe County earlier.

375
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,700
I can spend more time with my mother.

376
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,700
I should be happy to go home early.

377
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Right?

378
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
You don't want to leave here.

379
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
It's understandable.

380
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Don't blame yourself.

381
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
I'm sorry.

382
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
Greetings, Your Majesty.

383
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
You came just in time.

384
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,700
There is a secret letter from the Western State.

385
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Chatao.

386
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,700
Chatao.

387
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,700
A prince fled to the Western State in the south.

388
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
He was locked up in the palace.

389
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,700
If you want me to deal with him,

390
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
I can't decide.

391
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,700
Should I kill him or persuade him?

392
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Or find a trustworthy minister

393
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
to go to the Western State to investigate?

394
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
Your Majesty.

395
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,700
I will deal with him.

396
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,700
I'm willing to go to the Western State to investigate him.

397
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
I have the same idea.

398
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
Your Majesty.

399
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
My fiancee is there.

400
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Even if it's not true,

401
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
I would have asked for permission to see him.

402
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
I know you want to see him.

403
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
You always want to see him.

404
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Your Majesty.

405
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
I will issue an edict now.

406
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,700
I will leave tomorrow.

407
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

408
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
I'm glad to see you.

409
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
And

410
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,700
tell my uncle and I

411
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,700
that I'm still in Zhongzhou.

412
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
I want to go to the Western State.

413
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,700
I hope my uncle can come back.

414
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Your Highness.

415
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
You are so noble.

416
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
You should take care of your business

417
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
in the Western State.

418
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,700
I'm not noble.

419
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,700
I'm just a royal.

420
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,700
I will issue an edict now

421
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
and ask my mother to come to the capital.

422
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
I have to trouble you, Mr. Zhao.

423
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
Thank you for your care.

424
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,700
I will take care of my fiancee.

425
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,700
Don't worry.

426
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
I can't do it.

427
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
How about

428
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,700
I send someone to pick up my fiancee?

429
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
That's good.

430
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,700
If you still don't believe

431
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,700
my sincerity,

432
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,700
I can ask my brother-in-law to follow me

433
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
and protect my state.

434
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,700
I will follow you

435
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,700
in this matter.

436
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
But I can't do it at all.

437
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,700
I just think that

438
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
you are too far away

439
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,700
from me.

440
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
I feel relieved

441
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,700
to have them by my side.

442
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Then please arrange it, Mr. Zhao.

443
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
They have been my

444
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,700
trusted family for many years.

445
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
You must stay together

446
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
and take care of Prince Guangling.

447
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Yes.

448
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
I will go.

449
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Take the jade pendant

450
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
that His Majesty gave you last year.

451
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Yes.

452
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Wait.

453
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
Take the porcelain and paper brush

454
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
that father gave you.

455
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
He will like it.

456
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
Yes.

457
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Who do you think will like it?

458
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
Your Highness.

459
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,700
You may leave.

460
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,700
You are going to see him?

461
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
His Majesty said

462
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
you went to Xizhou

463
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,700
to see Cui Shiyi,

464
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,700
right?

465
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
His surname is Hua.

466
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,700
I know

467
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,700
you are going to be the Crown Prince

468
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,700
and go to Cui's Mansion.

469
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
You must marry him.

470
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
The most important thing is

471
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
that you really like him.

472
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
I just envy that

473
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
you have never seen him

474
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
and you still care about him.

475
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
If you marry him,

476
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,700
he will no longer have

477
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
the status of my sister.

478
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
We grew up together.

479
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
We are no match for each other.

480
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,700
Master.

481
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
What is it?

482
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
His Majesty has already allowed Prince Guangling

483
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
to leave the palace

484
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
and let him come to Xizhou

485
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
to see his fiancee.

486
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
What?

487
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,700
He is not going to see her?

488
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
No.

489
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Arrange two things.

490
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,700
Yes.

491
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Although Prince Guangling has not been conferred,

492
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,700
he is still the Crown Prince.

493
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
You must accompany him

494
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
throughout the city.

495
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Yes.

496
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
He came from Zhongzhou.

497
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
I'm afraid that

498
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
this trip is related to Prince Nanxiao.

499
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
If he needs anything,

500
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,700
you arrange it.

501
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Yes.

502
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,700
Master,

503
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
you don't want to see him?

504
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
I don't like to fight

505
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
with noble families.

506
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
I'd rather go back to the camp

507
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
with the military.

508
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Yes.

509
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Are you leaving again?

510
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Aren't you going to stay in the palace for the New Year?

511
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Miss Sui,

512
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
we don't know about this.

513
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
You'd better ask His Highness directly.

514
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Prince Guangling came here this time

515
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
to see Prince Nanxiao,

516
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
the first one.

517
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Secondly,

518
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,700
to see his fiancee.

519
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
What do you think

520
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
the third purpose

521
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,700
is?

522
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
The guest is meant to be.

523
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,700
Master,

524
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
Military Advisor.

525
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
Master,

526
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
I'm sorry.

527
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
I'm sorry.

528
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
I'm sorry.

529
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
Why don't you stay in the palace for the New Year?

530
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
The war is urgent these two years.

531
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,700
We can't rest until the war is over.

532
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
It's better to stay in the camp.

533
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,700
But it's New Year,

534
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
and we don't fight.

535
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
It's rare that we don't fight.

536
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Actually,

537
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
I gave up the palace

538
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
because His Highness didn't want you

539
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,700
and Prince Guangling to be disturbed.

540
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
If so,

541
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,700
I have nothing to ask.

542
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
I'll leave now.

543
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,700
Sui,

544
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,700
your birthday is in seven days.

545
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,700
Even if His Highness wants to leave,

546
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
you should come to the party in advance.

547
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
I'll be there.

548
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Every time we leave,

549
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Sister Sui is in the library.

550
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,700
When she comes back to the Cui family,

551
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
no one will send us to the Li family.

552
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Master is cruel.

553
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
He never turns back.

554
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
When I left the capital,

555
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
His Highness didn't turn back either.

556
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,700
He has his reasons.

557
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
What reasons?

558
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,700
Master,

559
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
can you tell me in secret?

560
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,700
If you don't turn back,

561
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,700
you're a traitor.

562
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,700
You don't care about anything.

563
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
Only in this way

564
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,700
can you risk your life

565
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,700
and kill yourself.

566
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
I'll be there.

567
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,700
I've prepared a birthday gift for you.

568
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Sui,

569
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
I'm sorry.

570
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
I'm sorry.

571
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
I'm sorry.

572
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
I'm sorry.

573
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
I'm sorry.

574
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
I'm sorry.

575
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
I'm sorry.

576
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,700
I'm sorry.

577
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,700
I'm sorry.

578
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
I'm sorry.

579
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700

00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
I'm sorry.

583
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,700
The taste is not right.

584
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
Is it because the water is frozen?

585
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
Why did you pour the tea?

586
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,700
Come with me.

587
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
Master,

588
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
why didn't you let Shiyi listen to the music?

589
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
It's rare for a musician to invite a musician.

590
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
She poured a pot of tea.

591
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
I'm punishing her for over-exaggerating.

592
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Master,

593
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700

I'm sorry.

622
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
I'm sorry.

623
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,700
