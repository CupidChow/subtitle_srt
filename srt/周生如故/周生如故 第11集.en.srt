00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,140
Stay where you are!

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,120
Yang Shao, let go of Feng Qiao.

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,520
Don't come close, Shiyi.

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,160
I have but one request.

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,820
Give me Liu Changshan.

9
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
What do you want him for?

10
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,160
That's none of your business.

11
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,289
Just bring him here.

12
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,479
Go get him.

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Yes.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Don't come close.

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,840
Yang Shao,

16
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,010
if I had known

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,410
you were so ungrateful,

18
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,970
I wouldn't have helped you.

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Miss Cui,

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,289
I have my reason to save him.

21
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,620
Stay where you are!

22
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,160
Don't push him.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,600
He won't hurt Shiyi.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
General Yang.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,720
You are finally here to save me.

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,320
Cut the crap and come with me.

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,200
Prepare a carriage for me

28
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
outside the city.

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,720
Prepare a carriage.

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,200
Yes.

31
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
Please excuse me, Miss Cui.

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,760
You don't know Kung Fu,

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,840
which makes you a better choice as a hostage.

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,320
Come.

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,740
[Yongcheng]

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,610
You drive the carriage!

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,540
Your Highness,

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,610
I won't hurt her.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can follow me.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,760
Once I make it to Nanxiao in one piece,

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,960
I will let her go.

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,080
Yang Shao,

43
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,330
if you so much as harm a hair on her head,

44
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,720
whether you go beyond south of the river,

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,960
the Gobi Desert in the west,

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,420
or even to the underworld,

47
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,680
I will personally

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
take your life.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
I have no other choice.

50
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,510
Your Highness, I am sorry for doing this.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
Get me a horse!

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,810
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,680
Xiao Yan, do something.

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,160
Nanxiao is your homeland.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,280
The transportation between the South and the North is smooth.

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,270
It won't be a problem for them to go there.

57
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,410
However, since it is His Highness,

58
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,210
it would definitely cause a stir

59
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,600
if people found out he was in Nanxiao.

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Isn't that obvious?

61
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,660
Scouting Camp,

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,940
get on your horses.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
We'll follow them in secret to protect His Highness and Shiyi.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Yes!

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,700
I have been holding the sword

66
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,980
all this way.

67
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,780
My arm is about to come off.

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,000
You are being followed by Zhousheng Chen.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You dare to lower that sword

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,200
but have not fear of being decapitated?

71
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,240
General Yang,

72
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,040
the best thing I ever did in my life

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,180
was putting in a good word for you.

74
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,960
There's not much to eat around here,

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,090
so have some of this.

76
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,040
Master hasn't eaten anything

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,200
for a day.

78
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,190
He cares a lot about you.

79
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,190
Otherwise, why would a noble prince

80
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,150
be willing to risk his life coming here alone

81
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,610
and follow you to Nanxiao?

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,240
He is my master.

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,400
Whatever it is,

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,580
he cares about you.

85
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,560
My oh my.

86
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,360
It turns out

87
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,320
your affair

88
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,240
is no less serious than

89
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,960
my treason.

90
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,240
Aren't you marrying the Prince of Guangling?

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,900
The engagement was canceled.

92
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,320
He is just my master.

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,040
When we make it to Nanxiao tomorrow,

94
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,280
remember you mustn't say anything about who you are.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,760
If someone found out and came after you,

96
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,690
I couldn't guarantee your safety.

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Have some of this.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,130
Give it to my master.

99
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,140
This is the only chicken I got.

100
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,890
Even I feel reluctant to eat it.

101
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,360
He hasn't eaten anything

102
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,490
for a day and a night.

103
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
There's two of you

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,280
so you two can take turns to hunt for food.

105
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,540
But he can only starve.

106
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,080
If you don't give him food,

107
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,610
I am not going to eat either.

108
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,040
I'll have it.

109
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,020
The master-disciple relationship you have sure is touching.

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,640
Here's some food your disciple got for you!

111
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,120
I will charter the two boats.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,760
This one,

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,840
is for him.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
My mother said

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,220
you had to come back to Jingling with me this time

116
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
and you had to explain to them

117
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,040
in person,

118
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,160
about why you married my sister without their consent.

119
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
If you can't give an explanation,

120
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
she will not be coming back with you.

121
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,500
Get on the boat.

122
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,940
The bastard's full of tricks.

123
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,850
General,

124
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,920
what do we do now?

125
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,760
Get our men to the bank of the river

126
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,360
and wait for furthur orders.

127
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,240
If their identity is exposed,

128
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,300
we need to be ready to cross the river.

129
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,840
Set sail, follow him.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Go to Shouyang immediately

131
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
and tell General Cui

132
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,650
to get ready to send out troops.

133
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,480
Yes.

134
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,640
You northerners

135
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,000
love to elope, huh?

136
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,400
Not really.

137
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,240
I won't blame your brother-in-law

138
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,170
for being so mad.

139
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,970
You have to go back with him,

140
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,560
prepare a bride-price, perform a formal wedding ceremony,

141
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,520
and bow before your parents to express your gratitude for their upbringing.

142
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,240
After that,

143
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,880
you bring your bride home.

144
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,640
All right.

145
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
However,

146
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
the lady over there is constantly looking back.

147
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,800
I guess it won't be hard for you

148
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,080
this time.

149
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
You know how parents are.

150
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,560
As long as their daughter shows affection,

151
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,290
they won't give you a hard time.

152
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,960
You can see

153
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,400
that she's into me?

154
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,880
The moment you stepped on the boat,

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,520
her gaze

156
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,760
was fixed on you.

157
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,280
Who do you think is in her heart

158
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,440
other than you?

159
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,610
This is your first time to Nanxiao?

160
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
You saved me twice, I owe you.

161
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
This is a military stronghold of the South.

162
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Be careful of what you say.

163
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,130
Let's go.

164
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,960
Give me the Tiger Tally.

165
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,800
Yang Shao,

166
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,360
did you bring me to Nanxiao

167
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,080
just for the tally?

168
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,720
The favor of your recommendation

169
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,650
is now returned.

170
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,720
I will give you a hint to save yourself.

171
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,000
Bring the news of the second Prince, Xiaoyan

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,460
to the Emperor of Nanxiao.

173
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,720
He loves his son very much,

174
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,200
thus he will for sure accommodate you.

175
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,800
Now hand out the Tiger Tally.

176
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,290
The rest of your stragglers

177
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,480
are now mine.

178
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,020
What are you doing?

179
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,000
I hate a ruthless traitor like you

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,520
the most.

181
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,960
The next time I see you,

182
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,400
I will kill you myself.

183
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,300
It's all my fault that I got you involved.

184
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,610
It's nothing like that.

185
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,990
If it weren't for this occasion,

186
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,590
I am afraid

187
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,070
you would never get the chance to come here.

188
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,920
You said it as if you set this up

189
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,960
on purpose.

190
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,600
But seriously,

191
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,220
I had given some thoughts that

192
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
one day when the Central Plains are united,

193
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
I'll take you here.

194
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,800
It's true.

195
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Move aside!

196
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,440
Out of the way!

197
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,620
Why did you let out a sigh, Master?

198
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
It just occurred to me

199
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,120
that you had never

200
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,320
fought alongside me.

201
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,640
What a pity.

202
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,850
We can do that in the future.

203
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah, we can.

204
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,480
Guards, hurry!

205
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,760
I need to see your prefectural governor.

206
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,120
Now!

207
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,320
Who are you?

208
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,720
I am a member of the royal family of Beichen.

209
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,580
Liu Changshan.

210
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,320
Bring me to your prefectural governor, now.

211
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,880
General.

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,260
What's the fuss about?

213
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,120
The Junior Prince of Nanchen is in the city.

214
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,360
Bring me to see your prefectural governor, now!

215
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,400
Who did you say it was?

216
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,720
The Junior Prince of Nanchen.

217
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,880
Zhousheng Chen!

218
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,050
Close the city gate.

219
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
There is a carriage pulled by goats.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,130
People in Jiangling

221
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,940
are pretty unconstrained.

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,440
Not only do they use goats to pull carts.

223
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,600
There was even a General Shen in the Former Song Dynasty,

224
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,640
who would ride a bizarre carriage

225
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,300
every time he met the emperor.

226
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,970
It was called the pig-nose valance-less car.

227
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
All the officials didn't think it was strange.

228
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,330
On the contrary, they loved it.

229
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,680
Pig-nose valance-less car?

230
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

231
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,480
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

232
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

233
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Get out of the way!

234
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,650
What do you think happened?

235
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Why are there so many troops?

236
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,700
I'll tell you what,

237
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,120
the Junior Prince of Nanchen is right here in the city.

238
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,650
No one knows what happened.

239
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,290
Isn't...

240
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
Isn't there a peace treaty between the South and the North?

241
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,280
Exactly! Why did the prince come here

242
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,680
when everything is okay?

243
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
The city gates are now closed

244
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,170
and no one is allowed to go in or out.

245
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,480
Let' get out of here.

246
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,720
Let's go home, go home now.

247
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,520
Let's go.

248
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,160
It looks like we are going to stay here a few more days.

249
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,680
Are we not figuring out a way to send information out of the city?

250
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,760
There is no hurry.

251
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,720
So where are we going now?

252
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,190
Let's go to someone I know here.

253
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,280
You know someone in the South?

254
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,880
An old friend of mine who happens to be around here.

255
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,080
It's so beautiful here.

256
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,630
Adjacent to the river and the mountain.

257
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,030
It would be great if we could unite the Central Plains sooner.

258
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,350
So that people from the south could see

259
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,950
our lofty ancient cities and vast deserts

260
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,670
and we could enjoy the mountains and rivers here.

261
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,930
How nice that would be.

262
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,030
There's still an hour's walk,

263
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,070
can you take it?

264
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,390
When Master was away,

265
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,590
I used to go around

266
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,470
all the temples in the Western State

267
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,430
to lit up incense and pray for the Royal Army.

268
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,030
That's why I got strong legs.

269
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,550
You can't call me "Master" here.

270
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,220
It will reveal our identity.

271
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,570
Yes, Master.

272
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,960
I understood.

273
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,480
Are you going up the mountain?

274
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,060
Yes.

275
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,560
Then you need to hurry.

276
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,580
The teacher of this academy

277
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,420
is grumpy

278
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,300
and won't receive visitors

279
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,540
after sunset.

280
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,260
It doesn't matter if you have to spend the night in the mountains,

281
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,140
it's just that

282
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,100
your wife would have a hard time.

283
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,740
What?

284
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,400
This is a land full of great people and natural wonders.

285
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,420
Oh yeah?

286
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,100
I like this place.

287
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,900
I  like the mountains,

288
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,060
the water,

289
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,100
and even what the people say.

That's our teacher.

Miss, you do not need to ponder.

You will see him in a bit.

Sir.

298
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,589
I can't believe it.

299
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,730
This is the famous

00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,310
young master from Zhou family in the Western State.

301

All of you are dismissed.

302
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,730
I need to catch up with my old friend.

303
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,770
Yes, Sir.

304
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,500
I thought we would never

305
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,010
see each other again.

306
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,450
You must be

307
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,210
the Princess of Nanchen.

308
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,410
I...

309
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,170
She is the daughter of one of my acquaintances.

310
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,600
Of the Cui family in Beichen.

311

Cui Shiyi.

312
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,780
Oh, so you are the daughter of his acquaintance.

313
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,640
The Cui family.

314
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,080
A family of top-notch advisors to Beichen.

315
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,280
It is my pleasure to meet you.

316
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,610
This is Mr. Huan from Longkang.

317
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,200
Huan Yu.

318
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,540
My family used to say that the Huan family in Longkang

319
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,940
is home to three generations of royal mentors

320
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,860
who educated five emperors in total.

321
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,060
I never thought...

322
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,340
You never thought

323
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,500
you would be able see

324
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,660
the descendant of the Huan family in Longkang.

325
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,340
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,820
The entire Huan family in Longkang

327
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,020
was executed.

328
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,120
Those who made a narrow escape

329
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,820
have mostly changed their names

330
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,220
and left their hometown.

331
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,560
What a disaster it was.

332
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,660
But those things happened to my ancestors,

333
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,420
let's talk about what's happening at present.

334
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,260
Do you know

335
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,540
that my life

336
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,420
was saved

337
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,820
by your fiancé?

338
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,380
She's not my fiancé.

339
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,860
Did I just make another mistake?

340
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
My guesses are usually pretty good.

341
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,940
We have been travelling for days

342
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,660
and haven't had

343
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,860
a proper meal.

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,480
Let's talk after the meal.

345
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,590
Yes, let's talk after the meal.

346
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,740
He didn't mention anything

347
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,220
about how you saved him.

348
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,940
Do you want him

349
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,020
to continue?

350
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,060
If he continues,

351
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,260
things won't be as simple

352
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,460
as being your fiancé.

353
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,180
He is a great man,

354
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,780
except that tongue of his.

355
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,910
Weren't you complimenting

356
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,380
that his family is home to three generations of royal mentors

357
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,440
who educated five emperors in total.

358
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
He's your friend.

359
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
I can't go wrong complimenting him.

360
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,140
Master, you haven't taken a proper meal

361
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,380
for the past few days.

362
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,980
You must have more today.

363
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,420
Here.

364
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
I can help myself.

365
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,020
It seems she really is hungry.

366
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,850
Here, this is your favorite.

367
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,380
Master, try this.

368
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,360
I have never seen this in Beichen.

369
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,560
It is called bamboo mushrooms.

370
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,230
It seems I am the unlearned person.

371
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,540
Is it good?

372
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,900
Sir, your two friends.

373
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,700
What's their relationship?

374
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,340
Do you see anything

375
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,750
between their eyes?

376
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,980
Between their eyes?

377
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,620
There's nothing there.

378
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,750
Is there something?

379
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,980
Affection.

380
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,980
So, are we preparing a single room tonight?

381
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,180
Naturally.

382
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,180
Do we prepare it as a bridal chamber?

383
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,100
As someone educated,

384
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,660
we must have some self-restraint.

385
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,820
If they didn't say anything,

386
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,380
we should not point it out for them.

387
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,860
Go on.

388
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,740
Wait.

389
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,540
But it should also be graceful.

390
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
I understood.

391
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,100
Grand Mentor.

392
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,580
What you said is true?

393
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,740
What do you think, Your Majesty?

394
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,660
In my opinion,

395
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,840
the Nanxiao's troops have been quite

396
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,980
because of my uncle

397
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,420
and his hundreds of thousands of troops

398
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,100
who are defending our borders.

399
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,700
Now that my uncle is trapped.

400
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,220
If something happens to him,

401
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,280
then Nanxiao would

402
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,240
take the chance

403
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,780
to harass our borders at Beichen.

404
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,780
On the contrary, in my humble opinion,

405
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,860
not only will Nanxiao not give His Highness a hard time,

406
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,550
they would even send him

407
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,540
back to Beichen safe and sound.

408
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,180
Your Majesty,

409
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,420
the peace negotiation we had with the South

410
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,740
on the Frontier Settlement Tower

411
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,860
has made it possible that there would be no more conflict in Nanxiao.

412
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,780
The people are now living and working in a peaceful environment.

413
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,660
If His Highness was found dead in Nanxiao,

414
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,980
it will undoubtably cause a dispute between the two countries

415
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,300
and ignite the flames of war once more.

416
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,660
And the people in Nanxiao

417
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,900
would be thrown back to agony again.

418
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,320
You have made a good point.

419
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,940
[Longkang Academy]

420
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,300
This is the only room left.

421
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
You two will have to make do tonight.

422
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,060
I remember last time when I was here,

423
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,190
the adjacent room is also a guest room.

424
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,660
That room

425
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,260
is filled with things right now.

426
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,820
It's true.

427
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
It smells so good.

428
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,900
There are many bugs and insects in the mountain.

429
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,980
Burning some incense at night

430
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,380
will deter the insects.

431
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,100
The curtains will also help.

432
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,640
That's very considerate.

433
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,900
One?

434
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:27,860
Mas...

435
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,140
I am sorry.

436
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,000
It doesn't matter.

437
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,820
My wife used to

438
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,240
love to pull the corner of my clothes.

439
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,980
You two must be tired

440
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,300
after a long journey.

441
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,840
You should rest early.

442
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,420
There are wild monkeys in the mountain,

443
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,820
make sure your windows are closed at night.

444
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,300
There is only one bed here,

445
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,080
how are we going to sleep here?

446
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,340
I will sleep on the floor.

447
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,700
You didn't sleep well following me all the way here.

448
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,360
I suggest you sleep on the bed.

449
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,380
Didn't you say that

450
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,180
I slept on the beach with numerous bones after getting drunk?

451
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
If I can do that,

452
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,960
why can't I sleep on the floor?

453
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,470
We have learned that

454
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,280
they are in Jiangling.

455
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,500
The military strongholds of the South,

456
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,380
one is Jiangling,

457
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,640
the other is Chaisang.

458
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,020
We are in trouble now.

459
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,140
What a piece of scum Yang Shao is

460
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,220
that he would know how to use this to hinder us.

461
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,060
Before sunset,

462
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,780
Jiangling has closed its city gates.

463
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,100
No one is allowed to go in or out.

464
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,900
They have started to search for

465
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,100
Master and Shiyi.

466
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,340
Don't worry.

467
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,620
From what I know about your master,

468
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,670
he should be at ease

469
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,260
and enjoying his trip to Nanxiao.

470
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,980
You have been saying "don't worry" the whole night,

471
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,980
can't you come up with any solution?

472
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,460
Do you think I'm your military advisor?

473
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,020
After my foster father left,

474
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,820
you are our adviser, aren't you?

475
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,700
The prefectural governor of Jiangling is someone mediocre.

476
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,940
He became intimidated by the fame of the Junior Prince of Nanchen

477
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,220
and only thought about closing the gate to search for them.

478
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,980
But so what after they found them?

479
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,040
Would he kill them?

480
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,260
If so, that would be an unwanted disaster

481
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,020
for the city of Jiangling.

482
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,900
His people are living a good life.

483
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,060
If he starts a war,

484
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,160
then he's foolish.

485
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,560
What if it were you?

486
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
What would you do?

487
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,940
If it were me,

488
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,580
I would pretend as if nothing had happened

489
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,820
and that I had never heard about it.

490
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,980
I would open the gate

491
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,980
and let His Highness go about freely.

492
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,310
But what if your father blamed this on him?

493
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,660
I am sorry.

494
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,820
There's nothing to be sorry about.

495
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,350
Everyone in the world knows

496
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,780
that he is my father.

497
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,400
The Emperor of Nanxiao

498
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,480
is definitely hoping that his officials

499
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,280
would let His Highness go in secret.

500
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,080
The South and the North has already made a peace treaty.

501
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,120
If he ever offended His Highness at this moment,

502
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,450
it won't do him any good.

503
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,160
Now that things have become like this.

504
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,690
Everyone in the city knows.

505
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
Who would let him go secretly?

506
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,130
After all, what's on the emperor's mind is the hardest to guess.

507
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,320
You guys

508
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,080
were really in sync just now.

509
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,060
General Feng.

510
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,340
Why do you always

511
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,060
look so worried, as if the sky is going to collapse?

512
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,660
My master is across the bank,

513
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,860
trapped in the city of Jiangling.

514
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,900
That, to me, is like the sky is collapsing.

515
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,380
It's them who should be terrified,

516
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
not us.

517
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,580
After all, our army is

518
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,180
approaching their borders.

519
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,980
They are now sending out troops to search for us.

520
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,020
Within ten days,

521
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,300
they will surely find us in the academy.

522
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,500
No need for ten days.

523
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,420
This is a military stronghold

524
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,780
with plenty of soldiers.

525
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,840
They will find us in about three days.

526
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,980
So, shall we leave?

527
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,150
No need for that.

528
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,820
The prefectural governor will receive a secret edict

529
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,110
telling him not to find me

530
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,460
in the city of Jiangling.

531
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,820
Because their emperor

532
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,890
doesn't want to start a war

533
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,870
because of this.

534
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,730
There are numerous relations among the world,

535
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,330
every one of them is different from each other.

536
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,140
Sir,

537
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,070
what did you hear?

538
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,540
Hush!

539
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,940
I didn't hear a thing.

540
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,740
But they would have heard everything you said.

541
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,190
Go, guard the door for Her Lady.

542
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:24,980
Okay.

543
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,220
There are so many wild monkeys tonight.

544
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,580
I am driving them away with my attendant

545
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,820
at the door.

546
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,860
It's getting late now,

547
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,620
my wife

548
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,670
is expecting me to go back to sleep.

549
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,020
I gave you

550
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,180
my best bamboo room.

551
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,620
You should feel sorry

552
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,660
if you mess this opportunity up.

553
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,340
How did you save Mr. Huan?

554
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,540
Some time ago,

555
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,900
robbers broke into the Huan family's academy.

556
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,500
He took his collections of books, ran to the wilderness,

557
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,760
and almost died there.

558
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,480
I happened to be there while with my troops,

559
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,320
so I saved him.

560
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,340
Once a family like his

561
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,780
lost their glory,

562
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,830
all the collections of ancient books,

563
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,260
and treasures handed down for generations

564
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,500
will get him killed.

565
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,100
I had met this kind of families a couple of times

566
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,230
in my earlier years.

567
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,310
As they couldn't live in the North,

568
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,050
I would send troops to escort them across the river

569
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,950
and help them escape to the South.

570
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,680
There was also a branch of the Cui family that once traveled to the South.

571
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,780
Some of the aristocratic families went to South to seek asylum,

572
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,240
while some went to the North to earn a living.

573
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,910
They are like wild geese migrating between the North and the South

574
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,040
in order to survive.

575
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,860
Yeah.

576
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,860
Like the people we met

577
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,300
who fled their hometown.

578
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,500
They were all doing this

579
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,430
just to survive.

580
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,180
I haven't lived a laid-back life like this

581
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,300
for a long time.

582
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,020
My senior brothers and senior sisters

583
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,300
must be terribly worried,

584
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,630
yet you say we're having a laid-back time.

585
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,340
In the past,

586
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,940
I have always been the one who worried about them.

587
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,410
Now it's their turn

588
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,620
to worry about me.

589
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,660
You are the master

590
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,440
but you still care about that?

591
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,130
Don't you remember?

592
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,970
Xiaoyu and Tianxing

593
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,080
are about my age.

594
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,940
While other disciples

595
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,940
are only a few years younger than me.

596
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,800
That's what the monk said as well.

597
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,060
Only he

598
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,640
knows how hard it is for me.

599
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,380
I know as well.

600
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,860
You did it on purpose.

601
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,950
Did what on purpose?

602
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,340
To air your grievances and get my empathy.

603
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,300
Why would I

604
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,080
lie to you yo get your empathy?

605
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
I give up.

606
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,140
All right, time to sleep.

607
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,830
Why are you not sleeping on the bed

608
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,860
but on the floor?

609
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,860
I have slept on the floor before.

610
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,420
The day you took me to see the retainers,

611
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,540
I slept in your study room.

612
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,380
That was on the floor as well.

613
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,220
That time,

614
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,020
you covered me with a fox fur

615
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,900
and carried me back in your arms.

616
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,940
That fox fur

617
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,620
is still kept in my room.

618
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,500
If you like it,

619
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,220
I can make a new one for you.

620
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,450
That's the only one I like.

621
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,280
Your Highness,

622
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,660
you have staring at it all night.

623
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,940
It's time for you to take your medicine.

624
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,620
Why don't you love me?

625
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,139
You would rather be a disciple

626
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:08,940
of Zhousheng Chen

627
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,670
than marry me

628
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,739
and become a prestigious princess.

629
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,020
If you want,

630
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,739
I can give up everything for you.

631
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,980
I can bring you out of the Central State,

632
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,219
this troubled land.

633
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,179
Yes.

634
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,380
I may not understand this kind of thing,

635
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,380
but Your Highness can't

636
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,020
overlook your own health.

637
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,880
Please take your medicine first.

638
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,340
Put it here

639
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
and leave.

640
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,670
Yes, Your Highness.

641
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,320
They are all students from impoverished families.

642
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,360
They heard that someone from the Cui family came to the academy,

643
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,660
and vied to get the opportunity

644
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,920
to talk about poetry and Taoism with you.

645
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,020
You've read a lot of books since you were a kid.

646
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,300
Just share your opinion with them

647
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,260
as a pastime.

648
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,580
Though I have read plenty, I may not understand everything.

649
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,700
Take me and Zhousheng Chen for example,

650
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,630
people at our age

651
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,220
won't say that we understand everything we read.

652
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,500
In terms of the amount of book collections in the North,

653
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,030
the Cui family comes first.

654
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,420
Most of what you have read,

655
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,540
I have never had the privilage

656
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,270
to read them.

657
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,900
It would be of great help

658
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,150
if you can share it with all of them.

659
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,630
After hearing what you said, I'm glad to do it.

660
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,140
I'm not skilled or very knowledgeable,

661
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,780
I merely took advantage of

662
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,440
the book collections at home.

663
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,540
Please don't take my words too seriously

664
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,180
and treat this as a casual exchange.

665
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,500
We'd be more than happy

666
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,500
to have you share your thoughts.

667
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,550
This way please.

668
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,780
This is brilliant.

669
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
How do you feel for the first time

670
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,620
that you are not surrounded

671
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,820
by everyone?

672
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,760
Great.

673
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,210
I'm sure

674
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,100
you'll be like me in the future,

675
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,700
a person that fears his wife.

676
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,060
What?

677
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,920
Brilliant!

678
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,640
Impressive, impressive!

679
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
You are watching them shoot arrows?

680
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,110
Wanna have a try?

681
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,060
Go and try it.

682
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,740
Is it allowed in the academy?

683
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,860
For an outsider to do this?

684
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,800
I am in charge here

685
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,820
while he commands the army.

686
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,900
Who dares to say no?

687
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,380
She seems to like lively places.

688
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,560
It's rare for her to be somewhere there are many people.

689
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,360
I was often away from my mansion.

690
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,340
For the past few years,

691
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,910
she was only accompanied by one of her servants

692
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,110
and the home library.

693
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,200
Having heard that,

694
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,780
she is indeed a poor girl.

695
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,100
Impressive, very impressive.

696
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,340
Look at that, that's really something.

697
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Did you teach her?

698
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,660
I have never taught her archery.

699
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,620
Mas...

700
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,100
Did you see that?

701
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,130
Who taught you that?

702
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,260
The mansion's shooting range is always empty

703
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,300
and I found myself idle most of the time.

704
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,630
So I learnt it secretly.

705
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,860
You're fairly accurate.

706
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,630
But your posture needs fixing.

707
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,160
Here.

708
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,410
Ready.

709
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,450
♫Like a gust of wind gently brushing♫

710
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,000
♫Like a cloud waiting for the rain to fall♫

711
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,830
♫There is a corner in my heart♫

712
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,030
♫Where my expectation is glowing♫

713
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,630
♫It's the shooting star lighting up the night sky for you♫

714
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,140
The bows in our academy are

715
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,540
all given by the hunters.

716
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,240
They are not

717
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,140
as light as the ones from your mansion.

718
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,400
I should've warned you

719
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,920
so that you wouldn't injure your shoulders.

720
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,800
She needs help with the injury behind her shoulder.

721
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,620
I can apply it myself.

722
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,620
This medicine

723
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,300
requires some rubbing with your palms

724
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,630
in order to take effect.

725
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,060
It's a pity

726
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,300
that my academy is full of male students.

727
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,580
So no one can help you.

728
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,460
Do you mind

729
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,380
asking your wife to help me?

730
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,710
She won't see visitors.

731
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,420
Help yourselves.

732
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,680
I will leave you two be.

733
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,580
Apply the medicine on your own first

734
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,700
and call me after you've covered your shoulder with a cloth.

735
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,260
I am ready.

736
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,060
Did I

737
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,260
say something wrong just now?

738
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,940
You mean about Mrs. Huan?

739
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,040
I'll find a time

740
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,340
and take you to see her later.
