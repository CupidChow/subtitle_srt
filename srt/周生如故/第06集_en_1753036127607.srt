1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Oh

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In the first day, in Nanxiao, he was a full-fledged martial artist.

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He used to be alone,

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
alone in the battle of the flying pheasants.

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The martial arts are far above you.

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why mention the past?

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let me try your martial arts again.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I admit defeat.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You don't say that.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You need to fight with me.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My disciple once spent half a month

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
learning feng shui

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
at the river bank.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now he is free to go around.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He can send gold fish to the river.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He can also move around the Golden Valley.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Forget it.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then I'll be a martial artist.

20
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's just a mistake.

21
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Again.

22
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Long Qiao,

23
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
people from Nan Cheng's mansion

24
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
need to be able to afford to lose.

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I lost.

26
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Fourth sister,

27
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
you have to fight again.

28
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Try it.

29
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I...

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Your Highness, we were wrong.

31
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Me?

32
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In Huai Shui,

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
we were close to each other.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We almost fought.

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you remember?

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Of course I remember.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was fighting for the emperor of Nanxiao.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What a joke.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
At that time,

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
you and I were enemies.

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If we want to fight,

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
we need to have a winner.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now there is no such relationship.

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's good to fight.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You have a point.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Please.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Go.

48
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Your Highness, you are good at fighting.

49
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't think so.

50
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Master,

51
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I found a good place.

52
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll go and find it.

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll go and find it.

54
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll go and find it.

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll go and find it.

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll go and find it.

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll go and find it.

58
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

59
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Prepare the horse.

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

61
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Go with us.

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't have a war horse.

63
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I have a war horse.

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I've been to the sea.

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you afraid?

66
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
No.

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go.

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Go.

69
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Go.

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Master, do you want to catch up with your master?

71
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go.

72
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Go.

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Your Highness, where are we going?

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
To choose a new priest.

75
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What new priest?

76
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You Wei Shi Yi.

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Shi...

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's talk when we arrive.

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Go.

80
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go.

81
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Go.

82
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go.

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Go over there.

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What's so good about it?

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Be careful.

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Have you thought of the name of the temple?

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Qing Long Temple.

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Qing Long Temple.

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The one who is the most precious in the world

90
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
is no longer the Qing Long.

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Good name.

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why do you want to take these two words?

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mother said

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Father saw through the red dust

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and left me and him.

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He also said

97
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the place he practices is called Qing Long Temple.

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
These years, I've been asking General Cui

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and my brother to help me keep an eye on it.

100
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But I never found a temple

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
called Qing Long Temple.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They're all here. Let's go.

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not bad. It's quite big.

104
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's been abandoned for a long time.

105
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If we can rebuild it,

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
it's a merit.

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We've just checked it out.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's Zhongzhou County.

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's the gate and the temple.

110
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Front and back.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There are also four great temples around.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Shi Wang Temple and Luo Han Temple.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Have you thought of the name?

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Name?

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's call it Qing Long Temple.

116
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's go.

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's go.

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Your Highness.

119
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've been waiting in the tent for a long time.

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I've brought four guards.

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We've been asking Master to take care of the tent.

122
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He dares to bring guards.

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll drive him out.

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He's Shi Yi's fiance.

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't make it too difficult for him.

126
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The rules are the rules.

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's not a big deal.

128
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll take care of it.

129
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll take care of it.

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll take care of it.

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll take care of it.

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The rules are the rules.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You don't have to break them for me.

134
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If it's not convenient for you, I'll let him drive you out.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
When did I ask you to come out?

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
When did I ask you to come out?

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Uncle.

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What did you see?

140
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I saw the emperor's country that was defeated by Beichen.

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is Shou Yang.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He's been guarding him for years.

143
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is General Cui.

144
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm Cui Feng.

145
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Your name is Cui?

146
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

147
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Could it be...

148
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm Shi Yi's cousin.

149
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Then I'll call you brother.

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Then I'll call you brother.

151
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I dare not.

152
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I want to ask you to interrogate Prince Nan Qiao.

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I want to ask you to interrogate Prince Nan Qiao.

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It was just a talk.

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Now it's official.

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
King of Nanchen's war.

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
All soldiers must be informed before entering.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you're good at fighting, you can kill me.

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Get out.

162
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes.

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Master, I'll go out and watch them.

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Master, I'll go out and watch them.

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes.

166
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Master, I'll go out and watch them.

167
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Wen Er.

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
From now on, we're even.

170
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We're even.

171
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Why are you doing this?

172
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're my son.

173
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The truth is not like what your mother said.

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You are...

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't come over.

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay.

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you go any further,

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll die here.

179
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay. I won't force you.

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll wait for you to think it through.

181
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll wait for you to come back.

182
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Protect His Highness in secret.

183
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Your Majesty,

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you must bring him back to me.

185
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes.

186
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Prince Guang Ling came from the capital.

187
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He's here to see you.

188
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Miss Feng, please lead the way.

189
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes.

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why did you come to Beichen?

191
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
To escape.

192
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is it the battle between the southern Xiaos and the Chu army?

193
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Or...

194
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
My mother was a concubine of the previous dynasty.

195
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
After the country was destroyed,

196
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
she was taken by the southern Xiaos emperor into the palace.

197
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
She gave birth to me after seven and a half months.

198
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So in the southern Xiaos,

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
there's always someone who suspects that I'm the father of the previous emperor.

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The little southern king must have heard of it.

201
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I heard about it.

202
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You want to say

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
that the rumor is true?

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes.

205
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Before my mother died,

206
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
she told me the truth.

207
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
She asked me to avenge my father.

208
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Since then,

209
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I've been in a bad mood.

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So I arranged this escape.

211
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll tell His Majesty

212
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
what you said today.

213
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
How to deal with you

214
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
is up to His Majesty.

215
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Meng Qing, take her away.

216
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes.

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
King of Wanglin,

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you just used my hand

219
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
to drive away those four people.

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Do you have anything else to say?

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I risked my life

222
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to ask my uncle to send troops to save His Majesty.

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Zhao Teng colluded with the general Lu Yuan

224
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to imprison the Empress Dowager,

225
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to disobey the emperor's order,

226
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and to kill all the powerful officials in the court.

227
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
All of them were killed

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
by Zhao Teng and Lu Yuan.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Dr. Cui

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
also killed himself.

231
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Go on.

232
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Please send troops

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
to take him to the capital.

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll leave tonight.

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll go back to the palace.

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Your Highness,

237
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
you can't go with the troops.

238
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you go with the troops,

239
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm afraid His Majesty

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
will misunderstand your intention to rebel.

241
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He won't.

242
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He said he was in Zhongzhou,

243
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
going west to west.

244
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I knew he was still the same kid.

245
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But

246
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I can't show myself in public.

247
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If I move,

248
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
everyone will know something bad happened.

249
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Some people will take this opportunity

250
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to start a war, and the Central Plains will be in chaos.

251
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Prime Minister Liu Wei

252
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
is a secret.

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
He has a close relationship with Lu Yuan.

254
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm afraid he will

255
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
do something bad,

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
even to deceive the officials,

257
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and force His Majesty to retreat.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We need someone

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
who is more powerful than Prime Minister,

260
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to suppress him.

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He's not only powerful,

262
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
but also selfless.

263
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He won't threaten His Majesty.

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Master, I have one choice.

265
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
My uncle.

266
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The Northern clan is led by Cui.

267
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
My uncle and my uncle have served the three emperors

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and have a high reputation.

269
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But Duke Cui has resigned.

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
He may not return to the court.

271
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll go and ask him.

272
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let my brother go back with me.

273
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No matter what, my brother and I

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
will go back to Qinghe County. Let's try.

275
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I think we can try.

276
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
All right. Let Xiaoyu send you.

277
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Thank you, Master.

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll go and talk to Senior.

279
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What are you worried about?

280
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This is the first time

281
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
he left Xizhou

282
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
after he came to the Nancheng Mansion.

283
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He went to Cui's house.

284
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
His own house.

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll do my best

286
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
to persuade Cui.

287
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

288
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll kneel down

289
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
to the Zhongzhou.

290
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
General, it's cold at night.

291
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Go to sleep in the tent.

292
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The army of the past

293
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
has no broken cloths.

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They still come here.

295
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There are 360 days of storage a year.

296
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
At least we have to rest for five days.

297
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Otherwise, it's too miserable.

298
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
All right, you can go.

299
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll keep an eye on him.

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

301
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
General,

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll go to sleep.

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
General,

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll keep an eye on him.

305
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

306
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can add a chain

307
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and tie me to the lawn.

308
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You don't have to suffer with me.

309
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm just curious

310
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
why you have to suffer.

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
My master didn't order me to abuse you.

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Forget it.

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I used to be a civil servant

314
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
in the mansion.

315
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I used to work hard.

316
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I was a public official.

317
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I walked on the ground

318
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
with bare feet.

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I could eat less

320
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and sleep less

321
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
on the day of my death.

322
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I didn't need to live in the winter to warm up.

323
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's my habit.

324
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Just for escaping?

325
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes.

326
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And no.

327
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I called him father

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
for more than 20 years

329
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and adored him.

330
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But in the end,

331
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I found that his father was killed by him,

332
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
the people of the country were taken away by him,

333
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
his mother

334
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
was killed by him

335
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
with the hatred of the country.

336
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If I hadn't been in such a difficult situation,

337
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
how could I have been able to face these people?

338
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I am sorry.

339
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Teacher.

340
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Order 30,000 soldiers tomorrow

341
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
to take him to the capital.

342
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Didn't you say that King Guangliang would immediately get back to the capital

343
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and decide whether he will live or die?

344
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're questioning the military orders.

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I dare not.

346
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Go.

347
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Where is LinkedIn?

348
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,760
Where is theopedia platform?

349
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,760
Hello?

350
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,960
The Performing Arts Bureau?

351
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,680
militants

352
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,500
She으

353
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,120
What!

354
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,560
Master told you to stay here.

355
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,520
Then you eavesdrop.

356
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I've been listening for more than ten years

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I can finally see it with my own eyes

358
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Who said I wanted to rebel?

359
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You don't rebel, you send troops to Zhongzhou

360
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Is it for training?

361
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Just to suppress me

362
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Even if I have martial arts

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I can't beat twenty soldiers

364
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You suppress me

365
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But you need three soldiers

366
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Because

367
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Your identity is special

368
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Left and right are your captives

369
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll let you suppress me

370
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You took the female members of the house

371
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The first three

372
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
One son and one daughter

373
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Hiding in the temple

374
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
How did you know?

375
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
They were found by Xiao Di

376
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Stabbed to death

377
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But Xiao Di regretted it very soon

378
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I stabbed him

379
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He said

380
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
As long as you go back

381
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's still his love

382
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
This is not fair

383
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Actually I suppress you

384
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
There is another purpose

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
As long as you do as I say

386
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I can protect you

387
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What do I need to do?

388
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't say a word

389
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Until this is over

390
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What is the military of Qinghe like?

391
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I haven't been home for a long time

392
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I can't remember

393
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
After my father left

394
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I didn't go out

395
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Until I went to Xizhou

396
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I heard that

397
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Qinghe's desserts are delicious

398
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Every holiday

399
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I can't help it

400
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
After this is over

401
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I will take my sister to try

402
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Also take some back for my brothers and sisters

403
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Then I will thank you for them

404
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You're welcome

405
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,440
Miss, Pan Zhenqiu got sick

406
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's like a room.

407
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Sir, Miss, please change your clothes.

408
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Everyone is waiting.

409
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Thank you.

410
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Mother.

411
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
My son is fully recovered in Xizhou.

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes.

413
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's great.

414
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Get up.

415
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
After many years of separation,

416
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
you still look the same.

417
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You still look the same.

418
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You still look the same.

419
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You look the same.

420
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You look the same.

421
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You still look the same.

422
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I forgot all the rules in Xizhou.

423
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You two are the last ones to arrive in Qinghe.

424
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The chief asked us several times.

425
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We didn't dare to answer.

426
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Don't be angry.

427
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Xizhou is the farthest.

428
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's not a big deal to come back a few days later.

429
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But the last one...

430
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Never mind.

431
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Sister, you can protect them.

432
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Your uncle is in a hurry.

433
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
He is in the academy.

434
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
When he wants to see you,

435
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
you go to greet him.

436
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'll go alone to greet my father.

437
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You too.

438
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Go to the academy.

439
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What's wrong?

440
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Mother, we came back this time

441
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
not to visit the city.

442
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We have something to see uncle.

443
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Or maybe he brought a secret letter from the king.

444
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Father.

445
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Shiyi.

446
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I didn't let you enter the palace.

447
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I don't want to enter the palace.

449
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't want to see uncle.

450
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You miss them both the most.

453
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You should rest in peace.

454
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Aunt, when did father get sick?

455
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Why didn't you mention it in the letter?

456
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Your father has been in the court for years.

457
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
He seems to be well-known.

458
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
He has been trying his best.

459
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He has been suppressing Liu Yuan and Zhao Teng.

460
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
He has saved many people.

461
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But he also offended Zhao Teng.

462
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So he is sick and afraid to say.

463
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
He is afraid that he can't protect his family.

464
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He has accumulated prestige for many years.

465
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Liu Yuan will not dare to touch him.

466
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But once he has a three-time win,

467
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan must take revenge.

468
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He has been blaming the descendants of the Cui family.

469
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So we use the excuse of turning the wheel.

470
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
To make you resign and leave the army.

471
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
To avoid danger from everywhere.

472
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Even if your uncle is gone,

473
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
we can't spread the news.

474
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It will take a day.

475
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
If he is here, the Cui family will be safe.

476
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But once he is gone,

477
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
the Cui family will have no position in the court.

478
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Your marriage with the royal family

479
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
will be more important.

480
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I understand.

481
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
What does the king of Nanchen want us to do?

482
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's not master who wants us to come.

483
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We want to come back ourselves.

484
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Master has decided to send troops to Zhongzhou.

485
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Qin Jun is on the side of Zheng Chaogang.

486
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
He wants to use the army?

487
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Master said that he would make rumors.

488
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Once the king of Nanchen will come to the east,

489
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
there will be a big mess.

490
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So he won't go in the name of the king of Nanchen.

491
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
He will find another excuse

492
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
to send troops to Zhongzhou.

493
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You are right.

494
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What about Zhao Teng?

495
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
He is the culprit.

496
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
King Guangling is in the palace as an undercover agent.

497
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
He will not be able to handle Zhao Teng.

498
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
King Guangling is in the palace as an undercover agent.

499
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
He will handle Zhao Teng.

500
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Master is outside the palace to suppress the rumors.

501
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Then what does he want us to do?

502
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Use my prestige to stabilize the court.

503
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I am here.

504
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Even if Zhao Teng dies,

505
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and Liu Yuan dies,

506
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
the court will not dare to say anything.

507
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
If you lose, you will die.

508
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
How many people are there in the Cui family?

509
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Have you thought about it?

510
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
San Niang.

511
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What did the king say?

512
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Master said that this was given to me by His Majesty.

513
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I brought it back.

514
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He will understand.

515
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
He is reminding me

516
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
to remind the Cui family

517
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
to be protected by the royal family.

518
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Don't forget.

519
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Tomorrow,

520
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I will be born.

521
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
How is your father?

522
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I will talk to you later.

523
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I will talk to you later.

524
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I will talk to you later.

525
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Two aunts.

526
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This is the eldest disciple of King Nanchen, General Hong.

527
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I am Hong Xiaoyu.

528
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Nice to meet you.

529
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Let's all live in the academy today.

530
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
If you need anything, please tell me.

531
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Thank you, Third Madam.

532
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
My uncle is very sick.

533
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
My uncle is very sick.

534
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Okay.

535
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You are

536
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
the only one in the Cui family.

537
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I didn't pass on any of my talents to you.

538
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm a father's son.

539
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:00,000
When I was a child, my family was destroyed.

540
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:10,000
When I was a child, I wrote books to take care of my family.

541
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Later, I learned to raise people.

542
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I studied Chinese, studied medicine, and studied politics.

543
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I was defeated by the Three Realms, and was sent to the family.

544
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
After that, I became a Grand Priest and became Grand Priestess.

545
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I was appointed as the King of the Three Realms,

546
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
so that the Cui family has the status we have today.

547
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:14,000
In the future, the Cui family will be handed over to you.

548
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm not good at comforting people, especially in this area.

549
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
No need to comfort.

550
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Father said that the Chao family has been in power.

551
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Tonight, we need to rebuild the 11th carriage.

552
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Father, I'm sorry.

553
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Tonight, we need to rebuild the 11th carriage.

556
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Father can't sit up.

557
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The city is going to change.

558
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That's as soon as possible.

559
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

560
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Aren't you hungry too?

561
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You're different from me.

562
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You are a guest of our Cui family.

563
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You can't be so slow.

564
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'll have someone prepare dinner for you.

565
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What's going on?

566
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Do you think I'm a guest?

567
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Cui Gong is seriously ill.

568
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I know you can't eat.

569
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Do you think I'll have an appetite if I see you like this?

570
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll go drive the carriage.

571
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Those books are more important than your life.

572
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You can't touch them.

573
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I saw you bowing in front of the hall today.

574
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You're so familiar.

575
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You're like this in the royal family.

576
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There's no need to bow in the royal family.

577
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You don't blame me?

578
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Master is going to teach me a lesson in the imperial court.

579
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
He doesn't like this.

580
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
When you were young, I often heard that you were a man of great virtue.

581
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I thought you were too arrogant.

582
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I thought you were too arrogant.

583
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Now it seems that he is indeed like that.

584
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What did you say?

585
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's just a poem written by a writer.

586
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Say it, mother.

587
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm drunk and greedy.

588
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm a crazy man.

589
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
A horse and a bottle of wine.

590
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
How many people are there in the world?

591
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Mother, if I win this time,

592
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I want to get some books from the academy and send them to Xizhou.

593
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There is a library in the royal mansion.

594
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
The second floor is empty.

595
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I want to fill it up.

596
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Okay.

597
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm drunk and greedy.

598
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm a crazy man.

599
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
A horse and a bottle of wine.

600
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
How many people are there in the world?

601
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm a crazy man.

602
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Come on, drink some water.

603
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

604
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
How are you? Are you tired?

605
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It's not so hard to be tired.

606
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You should eat more to keep your strength.

607
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Junsheng.

608
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No.

609
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What are you looking at?

610
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm looking at the sun.

611
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Then do you see that I'm still angry?

612
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The sky is clear and the wind is not blowing.

613
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You know it, right?

614
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Two old people are not serious every day.

615
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Okay.

616
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Since I'm not serious,

617
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
you can make up for it for the prince.

618
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm not the only one who can deal with a little bit of Liu Yuan.

619
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
If you don't win this battle,

620
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
you can apologize in advance.

621
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I heard that Zhang Feng is General Feng again.

622
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You're a bad boy.

623
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You're a bad boy.

624
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
General Feng.

625
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You're a bad boy.

626
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You're good at talking.

627
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Master, the Cui family's carriage has entered the city gate.

628
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The army will start in half an hour.

629
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Stop.

630
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
May I ask where this general comes from?

631
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Where do I come from?

632
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You can't ask.

633
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The prisoner of the prison is here.

634
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
General, please forgive me.

635
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
General.

636
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
What?

637
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The junior sister is so bold.

638
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
She's holding a fake sword.

639
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
The pain is unbearable

640
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The bitter sea is in my hands

641
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I can fight for you

642
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Let me be loved

643
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
The world is full of flowers

644
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The sword is like a horse

645
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The snake is the true love

646
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The story is like a black eye

647
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The city is cold and the snow is flying

648
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The love story is floating with the wind

649
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I can fight for you

650
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Let me be loved

651
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The world is full of flowers

652
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The sword is like a horse

653
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The snake is the true love

654
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The story is like a black eye

655
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The city is cold and the snow is flying

656
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The love story is floating with the wind

657
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The city is cold and the snow is flying

658
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
A glass of wine can ease my sorrow
