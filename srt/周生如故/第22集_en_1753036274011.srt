00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 3

4
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
General Feng!

5
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
What's on your mind?

6
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Say something!

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Xiao Yu!

8
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Do you still remember our battle at Shuyang?

9
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
We didn't have reinforcements this time.

10
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
It's all on ourselves.

11
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
General Cui, are you afraid?

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm afraid.

13
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
I'm afraid that because my surname is Cui,

14
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
General Feng will be unable to fight.

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
In order to protect me, he lost his chance to fight.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Even if you are captured, I won't retreat.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Everything is at the risk of the King's army,

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the war is at the risk of the people.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's exactly what I wanted to say.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
General Feng,

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
if you and I are captured by one person,

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
let's assume that the other person has been killed.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We must not be afraid of death.

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,000
I've paid the price.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
As the heir of Taiyuan County,

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you lost your right to be the heir of Taiyuan County.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You want to save a sinner like me?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you deserve to die for this battle?

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He is Cui's son.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The young master of the Wushui House.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He will be the Queen's brother in the future.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You two generals,

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
make your decision now!

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Senior Sister, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry!

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
General!

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's useless for you to kill me!

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Even if I die,

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
someone will still kill him!

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
General Cui!

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I will kill all of you in the future

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to avenge you!

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No!

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's no good for you to kill Cui Feng.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I advise you,

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to release him,

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and change a way for your men.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Bring him here!

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm Jin Zhen'er!

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to see my father!

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Stop!

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
General!

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Your Highness!

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Retreat!

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Master!

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Master!

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's okay.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I, Cui Feng,

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
bow to Your Highness.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Get up.

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Xiao Yu!

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
General Cui!

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You almost died in my hands today.

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's our duty.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
That's our promise.

75
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Isn't it?

76
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
And in this situation,

77
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,500
if you die in General Hong's hands,

78
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
it's not...

79
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Don't talk nonsense.

80
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Not next time.

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Oh, right.

82
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Princess and I...

83
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
No need to explain.

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I know.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
When we were in Zhongzhou,

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Shiyi told me.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
When we're done with this,

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
we'll go back to Shouyang together.

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is the letter of surrender.

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This letter of surrender

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
was brought back by your brother Cui Feng,

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Cui Cishi.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Cui Cishi

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Mother.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
People say

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Cui's daughter often comes to Baima Temple.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
People say that she's an elegant and filial daughter,

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
hoping she'll have half the fortune.

99
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I pray for the safety of the soldiers.

100
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
The regent decided to pray in the Pingyin Palace for a few days,

101
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
and then ascend the throne.

102
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Why do we have to pray in the palace for a few days?

103
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Jinrong killed the late emperor in Pingyin Palace.

104
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
So he had people send Jinrong to Pingyin Palace

105
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
to report the late emperor with the blood of the Jin family.

106
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

107
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

108
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

109
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

110
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

111
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

112
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

113
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

114
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
The late emperor's death was a great success.

115
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Many people from Beichen came to see you.

116
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
They wanted to ask you to meet the king.

117
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Why did you want to see me?

118
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,500
You didn't want to see me, so you said you were sick and didn't go to the palace.

119
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,500
So the king invited you to drink and you invited me to meet him.

120
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Shiliu, big and crispy Shiliu.

121
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Tulin Shiliu.

122
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
The little girl likes it the most.

123
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
It's too Shiliu.

124
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Come and see.

125
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Tired.

126
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Tulin Shiliu.

127
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Have you ever eaten Tulin Shiliu?

128
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Zhang Qian brought back Shiliu from the west.

129
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
It's the best in the city.

130
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
So it's called Tulin Shiliu.

131
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Tulin Shiliu.

132
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I don't know what happened.

133
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
I had to eat this.

134
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
I asked people to buy it from Pingyin.

135
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
But the court of Pingyin found out.

136
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
The court didn't sleep well for a few nights.

137
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm guessing you want to test Pingyin's attitude towards the Nancheng's mansion.

138
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
So you asked people to buy three thousand baskets of it.

139
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
And send them to Xizhou.

140
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Look, these are just some of them.

141
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Other than these, the rest are in the camp.

142
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
The crown prince doesn't like to have a relationship with the officers in the county.

143
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
So these are all bought.

144
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Tulin Shiliu.

145
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Try it.

146
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Try it.

147
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Hello.

148
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Have a look at Shiliu.

149
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I bought all of these.

150
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
I'll come back tomorrow.

151
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Thank you.

152
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Tomorrow, I'll buy them for you.

153
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Yes, master.

154
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Here.

155
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Thank you.

156
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Your highness.

157
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Your highness.

158
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Are you feeling better?

159
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Your highness.

160
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
This is a very serious wound.

161
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I hope you can be treated as soon as possible.

162
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
We've won.

163
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
That's good.

164
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
It's best to leave.

165
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
It's best.

166
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
It's best.

167
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Master.

168
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
It's time to leave.

169
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Let's go back tonight.

170
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
And rest for another hour.

171
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Okay.

172
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I'll go back to the west.

173
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
For me,

174
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
there's no difference between today and tomorrow.

175
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
But as the biggest judge this time,

176
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm afraid that tonight's banquet

177
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
can't escape.

178
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
The one I'm best at is Yang Zui.

179
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
The one I'm best at is Yang Zui.

180
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
The one I'm best at is Yang Zui.

181
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
They're fighting every year.

182
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Yeah, they're invincible.

183
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Yeah, they're invincible.

184
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Yeah, they're invincible.

185
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
The king will be here soon.

186
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Yeah.

187
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
King of Nanchen is here.

188
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Yan Shi Hou.

189
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
You two, doggy.

190
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Grandfather.

191
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Please go sit inside.

192
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,500
Please footage her inside.

193
00:15:42,500 --> 00:16:07,780
Meanwhile, General Hu, International

194
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,020
Everyone, please drink this cup.

195
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,620
Please.

196
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,780
Today, our Liu family's descendants are gathered together.

197
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,620
Yes.

198
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,660
Last time you came, you were still with the Grand Master.

199
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,980
That year, you were just...

200
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,100
I was just 11 years old.

201
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,980
That's right.

202
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,580
I am fortunate to have you.

203
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,100
I am fortunate to have you.

204
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
That's right.

205
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,420
Come.

206
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,820
I will give you a toast.

207
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,500
To Your Highness.

208
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,500
General, good wine.

209
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,380
General Zhu, here.

210
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,780
General Chen, cheers.

211
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,500
Junior.

212
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,780
Drink another cup.

213
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,900
How did you arrange for the banquet?

214
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,380
The King and the court officials are all in the main hall.

215
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,260
Our generals are here.

216
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,260
Come, General Feng, drink one.

217
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,260
Come.

218
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,180
I don't have much wine left, so I will leave first.

219
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,980
Your Highness, you are leaving now?

220
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,460
If I don't leave now, I'm afraid I will get drunk here

221
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,980
and delay my return to the city.

222
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,380
Why don't you stay here for a few more days?

223
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,180
Your uncles and uncles are old.

224
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,780
It will be difficult to see them again.

225
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,980
That's right.

226
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,780
The palace is ready.

227
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,780
Why don't you rest here for a night and leave tomorrow?

228
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,580
Living here,

229
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,980
I will miss my family.

230
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,380
It will hurt.

231
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,580
It's better to return to the military camp.

232
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,380
I will take my leave.

233
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,580
Your Highness, take care.

234
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,180
Return to the Central State.

235
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,980
Return to the Central State.

236
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,180
Your Highness,

237
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,180
may I leave now?

238
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,780
Yes, Your Highness.

239
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,780
No!

240
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,780
cetacean

241
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,780
What is it?

242
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,780
inclination

243
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
Zhou Shengchen assassinated King of Regent

244
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
Yeah

245
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,780
Live

246
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,780
We are machine

247
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,220
Tomorrow, the fighting may be over.

248
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,060
Do you still blame yourself for what you saw here?

249
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:45,600
I swear that I will revenge for both of you!

250
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,860
Welcome to Mount Taizhou!

251
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,860
You are the only one who can save me.

252
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
You are the only one who can save me.

253
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,860
You are the only one who can save me.

254
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
You are the only one who can save me.

255
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
You are the only one who can save me.

256
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,860
You are the only one who can save me.

257
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,860
You are the only one who can save me.

258
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,860
You are the only one who can save me.

259
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,860
You are the only one who can save me.

260
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
You are the only one who can save me.

261
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,860
You are the only one who can save me.

262
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,860
You are the only one who can save me.

263
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,860
You are the only one who can save me.

264
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,860
You are the only one who can save me.

265
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,860
I have so many soldiers.

266
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,860
How dare no one dare to kill the traitor?

267
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,860
Whoever kills Zhou Shen can be replaced by Qu.

268
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,860
Feng Die, Xi Zhou.

269
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Qin Rong, kill them!

270
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,860
Kill them!

271
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,860
Go!

272
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,860
Go!

273
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,860
Go!

274
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Go!

275
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,860

276
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,860
Go!

277
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,860
Go!

278
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,860
Go!

279
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,860
Go!

280
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,860
Go!

281
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,860
Senior!

282
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,860
Senior!

283
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Senior!

284
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
Xiao Yue!

285
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,860
Senior!

286
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,860
Senior!

287
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,860
Senior!

288
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,860
Senior!

289
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
Senior!

290
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
Senior!

291
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
Senior!

292
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Senior!

293
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
Xiao Yue!

294
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Xiao Yue!

295
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
Xiao Yue, hold on to him.

296
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
The reinforcements will arrive soon.

297
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
Xiao Yue!

298
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,860
Xiao Yue!

299
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Xiao Yue!

300
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Xiao Yue!

301
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Xiao Yue!

302
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,860
Xiao Yue...

303
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,860
Do you...

304
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,860
love her too?

305
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,860
The enemies...

306
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,860
are being billionered now.

307
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,860
Senior, you can't just私 Ireland!

308
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
Senior Sister!

309
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,860
Don't forget Xiao Yu!

310
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,860
We'll meet again in the afterlife.

311
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,860
Xiao Yu!

312
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,860
Xiao Yu!

313
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,860
Senior Sister!

314
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
Senior Sister!

315
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,860
Xiao Yu!

316
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,860
Your Highness, Liu Zi Xing is colluding with the financials.

317
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,860
There are too many ambushes here. Let's go.

318
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,860
Xiao Yu!

319
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,860
Xiao Yu!

320
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Xiao Yu!

321
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Xiao Yu!

322
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
Take Xiao Yu away.

323
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
The Imperial Household Department

324
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Uncle Wang! Uncle Wang, save me!

325
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Uncle Wang! Uncle Wang, save me!

326
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,860
Uncle Wang... Uncle Wang, save me!

327
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Zhou Sheng Chen, you took over his position.

328
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,860
Today, you won't let a child die for you, will you?

329
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Bring him here!

330
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,860
Your Highness!

331
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,860
Watch carefully!

332
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,860
I am the Prime Minister. How dare you!

333
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,860
Your Highness, please leave! Don't blame us!

334
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,860
Your Highness!

335
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,860
There are only a few dozen people from the royal family of Liu

336
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
and more than 200 officials in this palace.

337
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,860
If you don't surrender today,

338
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,860
I will let them die for you one by one.

339
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Liu Zi Xing, do you want to kill all your family members and kill all the officials?

340
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,860
I swear by my life,

341
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,860
as long as I give up my weapon, no one will die.

342
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,860
Master, I beg you to be selfish and go with us.

343
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,860
Leave them alone!

344
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Master!

345
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,860
Uncle Wang, please leave! I am not afraid anymore!

346
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,860
Okay, I will give up my weapon and let him go.

347
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
Master!

348
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,860
I don't trust you.

349
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,860
You have the lives of more than 200 officials. What are you afraid of?

350
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,860
You have been threatening me with love.

351
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,860
You should have thought that I wouldn't escape.

352
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,860
Uncle Wang!

353
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
Don't be afraid.

354
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Escort His Majesty away!

355
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
Yes!

356
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
Escort His Majesty away!

357
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
Master!

358
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Master!

359
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Master!

360
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Master!

361
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Master!

362
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
Master!

363
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,860
Master!

364
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,860
Master!

365
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,860
Master!

366
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,860
Master!

367
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
Master!

368
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,860
Do you still mind his beauty?

369
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,860
Who told you to kill them?

370
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
What else?

371
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,860
They are all my uncle and uncle.

372
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Master!

373
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,860
If you keep talking nonsense, I will kill you too.

374
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
Master!

375
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,860
Now that the King's army is being rebelled, you are a traitor.

376
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,860
You must not leave Zhongzhou.

377
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
Leave today.

378
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
Where is Junior Sister?

379
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
She left it to me.

380
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,860
She won't leave the palace for a day, so I won't leave for a day.

381
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,860
If His Majesty is taking risks for Junior Sister, how can I leave?

382
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
Look at what you said.

383
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,860
You are my brother's family.

384
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,860
That is my family.

385
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
To put it bluntly, you don't like to hear it.

386
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
You are seriously injured.

387
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
If you stay, you can only drag me to save people.

388
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,860
If you leave, that is helping me.

389
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Only by living can I take revenge.

390
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:52,800
The

391
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Back off!

392
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Back off!

393
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Back off!

394
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
The regent has ordered that

395
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
ordinary officials and civilians can survive

396
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
as long as they don't collude with the rebels.

397
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
No need to run away. Go home.

398
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
General, follow me.

399
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Back off!

400
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Back off!

401
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
General, did you find anything?

402
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Back off!

403
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
The shops in the city are so empty.

404
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
The general will be back tomorrow.

405
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
He will be unhappy.

406
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Take them away.

407
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Change into civilian clothes.

408
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Tomorrow, we will have a business meeting.

409
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Then we will have people go to the nearby county.

410
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Yes.

411
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
Close the city gates.

412
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Put them here.

413
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Be gentle.

414
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Who sent them?

415
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Your Highness, it was Mr. Huan from Longkang Academy

416
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
who asked someone to send them.

417
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
The night I left the academy,

418
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I drew a face to give to Mr. Huan.

419
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
He must have seen it.

420
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
He must have understood the painting.

421
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
So he sent me a lotus.

422
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Madam, please leave the city.

423
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Open the city gates.

424
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Open the city gates.

425
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
You let them go so quickly?

426
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
That is the carriage of the Cui family.

427
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
What official position are you and me?

428
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
How dare you offend them?

429
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
General Zhao,

430
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I will send you to the courier house 20 miles away.

431
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
There is a order from the Cui family.

432
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
When we arrive at the courier house, I will send you to the birthday party.

433
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
The third young master is there.

434
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Thank you.

435
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Do you know how is my sister?

436
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
No one can see her now.

437
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Not even my third wife.

438
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
How is my senior brother?

439
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Your Highness,

440
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
he is fine.

441
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
I will go to see him after the meal.

442
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Okay.

443
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
But General Zhou has left.

444
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
He went back to Xizhou.

445
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
When did he leave?

446
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Yesterday.

447
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
He said that there was an enemy in the south.

448
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
He was in a hurry to go back.

449
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
After the Dingjiang Tower,

450
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
the south and north have been peaceful.

451
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Why did the changes suddenly occur?

452
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
King of Pingqin also followed the same path.

453
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
He said that the Princess was pregnant.

454
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
He went back to take care of his wife.

455
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
King of Ji went out for war.

456
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Tomorrow, arrange to go to the Baima Temple to pray.

457
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Yes.

458
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
He is going to the Baima Temple to pray?

459
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes.

460
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
But...

461
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
The temple is empty.

462
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
How can we hide it?

463
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Tell the other senior men of Zhou's to come.

464
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Whoever shows his feet, you should kill him.

465
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Yes.

466
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Why did no one wipe the incense?

467
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Why did no one wipe the incense?

468
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
There is a habit of the high monks in Baima Temple.

469
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Every month,

470
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
they will let the disciple check the water.

471
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
If there is a thin layer of ice on it,

472
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
you must change the water immediately.

473
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Otherwise, the monk will not drink it.

474
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
This temple...

475
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
The monk is very spiritual.

476
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
He likes to hide in the temple in winter.

477
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
There is no one.

478
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
These monks are all fake.

479
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
I don't know.

480
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Master,

481
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
you once said

482
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
if something happens to you,

483
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
someone will tell me.

484
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
But now,

485
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
where are you?

486
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I'm here.

487
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm here.

488
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
I'm here.

489
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
I'm here.

490
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
I'm here.

491
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
I'm here.

492
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
I'm here.

493
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
I'm here.

494
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
I'm here.

495
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm here.

496
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
I'm here.

497
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
I'm here.

498
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
I'm here.

499
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm here.

500
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
I'm here.

501
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm here.

502
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm here.

503
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
I'm here.

504
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Shi Yi.

505
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
You're called Shi Yi in this family, right?

506
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
I already have ten disciples.

507
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I'll call you Shi Yi.

508
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Okay?

509
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
I don't have a meeting.

510
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,080
You belong to him.

511
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
I'm...

512
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,160
I'm in love with him.

513
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Have you seen the complete look of Xizhou?

514
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,520
I want to write on it.

515
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,560
When we leave, we'll be locked up.

516
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,760
No one can enter.

517
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,280
It's like writing a secret here.

518
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,320
What do you want to write?

519
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,320
I'll write for you.

520
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
I want to write for you.

521
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
I want to write for you.

522
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
I want to write for you.

523
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
I want to write for you.

524
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
I want to write for you.

525
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
I want to write for you.

526
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
I want to write for you.

527
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
I want to write for you.

528
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
I want to write for you.

529
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
I want to write for you.

530
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
I want to write for you.

531
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
I want to write for you.

532
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
I want to write for you.

533
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
I want to write for you.

534
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
I want to write for you.

535
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I want to write for you.

536
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
I want to write for you.

537
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I want to write for you.

538
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
I want to write for you.

539
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
I want to write for you.

540
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
I want to write for you.

541
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
I want to write for you.

542
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
I want to write for you.

543
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
I want to write for you.

544
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
I want to write for you.

545
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
I want to write for you.

546
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
I want to write for you.

547
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,880
I want to write for you.

548
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
I want to write for you.

549
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
I want to write for you.

550
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
I want to write for you.

551
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
I want to write for you.

552
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
I want to write for you.

553
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
I want to write for you.

554
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
I want to write for you.

555
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
I want to write for you.

556
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
I want to write for you.

557
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,680
I want to write for you.

558
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
I want to write for you.

559
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
I want to write for you.

560
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
I want to write for you.

561
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I want to write for you.

562
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
I want to write for you.

563
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
I want to write for you.

564
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
