[Episode 20]

4
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,930
Master, we are here.

5
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,500
Xie Yun and Cui Feng haven't arrived yet.

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,120
Xie Yun wrote several letters in a row

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,880
to let us know that he's learned how to ride a horse,

8
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,200
and can lead troops Eastward

9
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
as your vanguard at any time.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,259
Let him stay in Beichen

11
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,600
and guard the border.

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,520
I'm just worried

13
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
about Cui Feng.

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
The new emperor is about to ascend the throne.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
The regional princes and the prefectural governors

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,240
have been called back to the capital city.

17
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,240
Only Cui Feng hasn't responded yet.

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,320
Why don't we have Shiyi

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,920
write him a letter and call him back

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,480
on family matter grounds?

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,730
What family matter?

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,680
Don't keep us guessing.

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Just spit it out!

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,120
Asking her cousin to come back

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,720
for her wedding ceremony

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,360
would be the best excuse.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,440
You heard nothing.

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:34,920
No.

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,940
Advisor Xiao is right.

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
I'll go write to him right away.

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,520
There's paper and a writing brush here.

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,579
You can write here.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,520
No.

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,000
I need to think

35
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,560
carefully about how

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,890
to write such a message.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,100
[I'm getting married. Hope you return.]

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
You only came up with

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,780
six characters after all that thinking it over?

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
Least said, soonest mended.

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,880
These six characters

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,610
are convincing enough for him.

46

This is a gift

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,300
that His Highness prepared especially for you.

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
His Highness said

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
if you don't like it,

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,680
there'd still be time

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,010
to make a new one for you.

52
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,570
This one is fine.

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,760
Governor, you looked worried just a minute ago.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,480
What made you smile all of a sudden?

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,040
My cousin is getting married.

56
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,170
That's a good thing!

57
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,120
And something better

58
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
is sure to follow.

59
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,560
Now, go pack some things.

60
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,170
Wait. Forget it.

61
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,560
Just pack some food enough for 10 days.

62
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
We'll set off right away.

he will figure out

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
this is a cue that there will be an attack in Taiyuan

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,159
given that none of the generals

68
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,480
in Nanchen Royal Army

69
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,240
would leave the battlefield

70

Taiyuan is his battleground.

77

after deliberation.

83

It's the Prince of Guangling, who entered

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,520
the palace when he was little, and was like

85

and all prestigious clans care about the most.

91

95
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,640
Yeah...

96

I've been worried about you ever since.

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,080
I rushed back

103
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,280
so that I could return in time for your wedding.

104

I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

Sorry that I can't keep you company.

the generals serving Nanchen Royal Army.

116
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,640
They've fought for dozens of years

117
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,360
for the peace of the Central Plains.

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200
I heard

119
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,200
that there was a female general surnamed Feng

120
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,080
under the command of the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

121
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,240
She made great contributions in pacifying the chaos in the west

122
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,480
and saved thousands of women

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,940
and children from the foreigners' attacks.

124
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200
She is General Feng.

125
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,240
General, thank you for protecting our country

126
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,960
and saving our people's lives!

127
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,159
It's simply my job.

128
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Mother,

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,320

Okay.

131
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,300
Then I'll leave the palace first.

132
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,580
Thank you, Mother!

133
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,650
Shiyi is one of the Cuis.

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,690
She should be married off from our residence.

135
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,120
If we let her stay in the Xuanguang Palace,

according to the rules...

137
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
We've already forced her to enter the palace

138
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,220
using the so-called rules and rites.

139
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,240
Can't we just humor her once,

140
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,170
the night before she gets married?

141
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,160

Prince of Taiyuan! Prince of Taiyuan!

145
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,810
My fellow brothers.

146
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,650
The late emperor's death is a mystery.

147
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
And now, they've already

148
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,159
hastily put forward a child to be

149
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,640
the new emperor

150
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,840
so that they can shut people's mouths

151
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,860
and cover the cause of death of the late emperor.

152
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,560
The other princes may turn a blind eye on it,

153
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,840
but I,

154
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,480
as one who owes much to the late emperor,

155
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,440
can't just let it go!

156
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Today,

157
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,280
I, Jin Rong, will declare war

158
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,690
for the late emperor

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,480
and for the sake of justice!

160
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,600
For the late emperor! For the late emperor!

161
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,720
For the late emperor! For the late emperor!

For the late emperor!

164
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Come to think of it,

165
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,200
I wear armor

166
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,180
much more often

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,330
than I wear dresses.

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,340
Feng Qiao, you look good in dresses, too!

169
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,059
Is there anyone in the Taiji Palace tonight?

170
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
I think so.

171
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,280
Then forget it.

172
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,250

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
With my rank, I'm not allowed in.

174
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,360
But since

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm here already,

176
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200

177
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,250

00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,490

183
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,240
who's to say you can't go there?

184
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,760
Come on!

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,860
Your Highness,

186
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
after tonight,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,730
she'll become someone's wife.

188
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,960
If you want to see her, why don't you

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,220
go to the Xuanguang Palace and visit her?

190
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,400
What do you want me to say?

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,120
To speak your mind.

I've guarded the border of Beichen for over 10 years,

202
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,760
and this is the first time I've come

203
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,490
this close to the Taiji Palace.

204
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,520
That's the Princess of Guangling!

205
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,160
How dare you stop her? Do you have a death wish?

206
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,090
But we'll be in trouble if we don't.

guards to patrol even at midnight?

211

let's see your guts as a general!

216
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
Go ahead while there's

224
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,960
Feng Qiao said

225
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,800
she couldn't go in with her rank,

226
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,520
so I brought her here

227
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,920
since it's nighttime.

228
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Who knows when she

229
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,600
can make it here again?

230
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
Master, please don't blame Feng Qiao.

231
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,680
It was my idea.

232
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,410
I'm not blaming her.

233
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,520
General Feng, you wanted to check out the palace, right?

234
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,240
Go ahead.

235
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,060

So many people

240
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,600
dream of this place,

241
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,240
and so many people would

242
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,490
do whatever it takes

243
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,200

when you talk about it?

246
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,120
I've only heard about it before,

247
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,480
and I've never seen it in person,

248
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,010
so of course I'd be curious.

249
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,040
Now that I see it,

250
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,880
there's nothing special about it.

513
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,040
Let's share a drink.

514
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,330
I've been sitting all the way here.

515
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I'll stand.

516
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,760
Yang Shao,

517
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,610
pour some wine for Her Majesty!

518
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,600
In the future,

519
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,159
you and I

520
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,679
will stick together.

521
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,800
Then I should

522
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,719
thank you for such recognition!

523
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,770
When will we set off?

524
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,280
Set off?

525
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,080
Where to?

526
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,560
Taiyuan, of course.

527
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,480
Zhousheng Chen is in the Central State.

528
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,960
He might've already sent out army

529
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,420
and is on his way over here!

530
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,960
I know

531
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,880
that you've enlarged your army this year

532
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,739
and you've become much stronger.

533
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,719
But you still need to be careful

534
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,400
when dealing with Nanchen Royal Army.

535
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
Is this

536
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,440
the young emperor who just ascended the throne?

537
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,040
Yes.

538
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,840
It's said that there's an unwritten rule

539
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,600
in the royal family of Liu

540
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,240
that a gold figurine shall be forged

541
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,120
before selecting a future emperor.

542
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,710
If the figurine is forged successfully,

543
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,440
it means he's the chosen one.

544
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
Otherwise,

545
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,640
he should be replaced by another.

546
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,660
Your Majesty, I'd like to know

547
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,220
if a figurine was ever made

548
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
before this kid became the emperor?

549
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,280
It was an emergency...

550
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,480
An emergency?

551
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,520
It was just an excuse

552
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,360
you invented to fool people!

553
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,400
I came up with this plan

554
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,800
to keep the court in order!

555
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,890
You witch, I'm tired

556
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,600
of hearing your nonsense!

557
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,080
Get ready to forge the figurine!

558
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,120
I'll see it myself

559
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,560
whether this kid is

560
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,760
qualified to be

561
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,480
the new emperor!

562
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,640
Let's begin.

563
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,520
Yes.

564
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,080
General.

565
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,160
It failed!

566
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,840
General,

567
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,600
if you don't know how to forge the figurine,

568
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,440
you can ask the Qi clansmen to come here.

569
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,720
I'll let them forge one.

570
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,840
Qi clansmen?

571
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,920
There are no Qi clansmen!

572
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,680
You are lying!

573
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,640
It was the Qi clansmen

574
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,800
who got me out of the Baima Temple.

575
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,160
How could those cowards of your clan

576
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,800
have the guts to save you?

577
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,920
I don't mind

578
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,760
telling you the truth before killing you!

579
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
It's me

580
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,250
and the Prince of Guangling

581
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,480
who saved you!

582
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,280
Liu Zixing?

583
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,290
If it hadn't been for his Royal Guards,

584
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,640
we couldn't have been able

585
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,080
to take this kid away!

586
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,360
You...

587
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,040
Thanks to you, the Qi clan

588
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,720
has been enjoying wealth and glory.

589
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,360
And now,

590
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,920
it's time for them to go to hell along with you!

591
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,440
Guards,

592
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,120
throw her and this fake emperor

593
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,600
into the river to feed the fish!

594
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,080
How dare you, Jin Rong!

595
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,320
I'm the grand empress dowager!

596
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,880
Let me go!

597
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,560
What are you doing?

598
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,880
-Let me go!
-Let me go!

599
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,840
Prince of Taiyuan! Prince of Taiyuan!

600
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,160
Let go of me!

601
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,520
Prince of Taiyuan!

602
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,280
Prince of Taiyuan!

603
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,720
Prince of Taiyuan!

604
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,200
I don't wanna die!

605
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,640
Help!

606
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,240
Help!

607
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,960
Help!

608
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Help!

609
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,640
Help!

610
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,200
Hold on!

611
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Help!

612
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,610
Put him down.

613
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Take the dragon robe off

614
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,320
of this kid emperor

615
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,240
and send it to the Central State.

616
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,200
As for this kid,

617
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,000
he's still useful to me.

618
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,640
Take him to my mansion

619
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,300
and let my wife watch over him.

620
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,480
Yes!

621
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,640
Come on.

622
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,640
General Yuan.

623
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,840
General Jin.

624
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,360
You've been watching the whole time.

625
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,760
Is it because the regent

626
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,920
is afraid that I'd betray him?

627
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,000
General, you misunderstood.

628
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
He said Qi Zhenzhen

629
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,000
poisoned his brother to death

630
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,280
and he hated her,

631
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,480
so he asked me to confirm her death

632
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,160
to put his mind at ease.

633
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,920
I didn't expect

634
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
that the regent

635
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,920
was that close to the late emperor.

636
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,240
I didn't know either.

637
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,240
Come on, let's go have a drink.

638
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,640
General Yuan,

639
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,280
have a drink with me.

640
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,720
Cheers!

641
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,220
Cheers!

642
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,360
It feels good!

643
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,320
Qi Zhenzhen has bullied me for years.

644
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,560
Today,

645
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,900
I finally took revenge on her!

646
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,560
General!

647
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,610
We lost the battle in Henei.

648
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,280
We didn't even withstand for three days?

649
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,880
No.

650
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,800
Where's Zhousheng Chen right now?

651
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,200
300 miles away from here.

652
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,720
Withdraw!

653
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,640
Did

654
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,300
Jin Rong launch an attack?

655
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,660
Your Highness.

656
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,540
Your Highness.

657
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,280
Sorry

658
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,300
that I had you worried these days.

659
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,050
What happened exactly?

660
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,840
Jin Rong launched an offensive in Henei.

661
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,640
Uncle went to fight against him.

662
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,560
Where's my cousin?

663
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,440
How is he doing?

664
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,180
Based on my informant,

665
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,280
Cui Feng left

666
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,600
Taiyuan days ago,

667
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,160
but his whereabouts still remain unknown.

668
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,080
If he left days ago,

669
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,800
he could be hiding somewhere

670
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,620
and waiting to meet my Master.

671
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,920
When my uncle returns,

672
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,760
he may have an update for you.

673
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,600
If Jin Rong is attacking Henei,

674
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,460
why is the Eastern Palace locked?

675
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,360
The Royal Guards colluded with the Qi clan and rebelled.

676
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,920
After my uncle left for the battle,

677
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,640
they kidnapped His Majesty

678
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,290
and joined Jin Rong's army.

679
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,220
His Majesty is kidnapped?

680
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,820
When my uncle left,

681
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,200
he asked General Zhou and the Royal Guards

682
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,640
to protect the palace.

683
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,200
General Zhou...

684
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,880
What happened to him?

685
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,080
