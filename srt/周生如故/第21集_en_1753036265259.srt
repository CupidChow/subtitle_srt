Your Highness.

6
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,960
Your Highness.

7
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,360
You've been frightened these days.

8
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,760
What happened?

9
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,560
Uncle Jinrong attacked the river,

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
and the imperial army was in the way.

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,240
What about my third brother?

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,120
How is he?

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,760
According to the intelligence,

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,280
Cui Cishi has been away from Taiyuan County for a long time.

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,000
He hasn't been found yet.

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,760
If he leaves early,

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,240
he might be hiding somewhere,

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,960
waiting to meet with Master.

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,520
When Uncle Jinrong comes back,

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,360
he might have some news for you.

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
Since he attacked the river,

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,640
why is the Eastern Palace locked up?

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,920
The imperial army rebelled in a row.

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,600
After Uncle Jinrong led the troops out of the battle,

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,400
they kidnapped His Majesty

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,760
and ran to Jinrong.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,520
His Majesty was kidnapped?

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
After Uncle Jinrong left,

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,720
General Zhou and the imperial guards

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,120
guarded the city together.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,640
General Zhou...

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,440
What happened to my second brother?

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,000
He was badly injured and hasn't woken up yet.

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,720
Master.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,600
He's in Uncle Jinrong's palace.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,840
If you want to go...

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
I'll go with you.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,720
Meng Luan, call the imperial doctor.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,400
The imperial doctor has seen it.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,720
He hasn't been able to sleep for days.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,160
He insisted on seeing you today.

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
He insisted on seeing you today.

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
That's why he went to rest.

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Go back to Xianfu and rest.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,320
Close your eyes and rest for a while.

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Shiyi.

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Don't go.

48
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,720
Because I will be afraid.

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Xiao Ye,

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
I'm not really different from you.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,720
The fate between a family is very close.

52
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Tonight,

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
I'll stay here and wait for you.

54
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I'll send you to the city of Zhen Yi.

55
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Zhen Yi

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Zhen Yi

57
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Do you feel better?

58
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Is it hot?

59
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
I'll call the doctor.

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm trying to show my weakness to you.

61
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Can't you see it?

62
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
I'll call Meng Luan in.

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
I've been waiting for a long time.

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Cui Shi Zhong is waiting outside the hall to see you.

65
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Let him in.

66
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Yes.

67
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
I'll go back to Xuan Guang Hall first.

68
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Your Highness.

69
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Your Highness.

71
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
The news of His Majesty's return

72
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
will be sent to Zhongzhou in three days.

73
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Qin Rong has used their lives

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
to express his sincerity to me.

75
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Where is your loyalty to Cui Shi Zhong?

76
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
I...

77
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
I only have one word

78
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
to express my loyalty.

79
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I'm in a big trouble.

80
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
If I don't get rid of it,

81
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
it will be hard to control the country.

82
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Master.

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Master.

84
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Please lead the rear camp to the Taiyuan Army.

85
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Be careful.

86
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Yes.

87
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Cui Feng is in Jin Rong's hands now.

88
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Only a few generals know about this.

89
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Don't tell anyone.

90
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,720
When did you take me to the Eastern Palace?

91
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Bear with it.

92
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
It's not the time yet.

93
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I can bear with it.

94
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
You and him are both in the stomach.

95
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
What should we do first?

96
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
I don't know.

97
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,720
You ordered us to do it first.

98
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
He is a member of Cui Shi.

99
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
If you become a couple,

100
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
who will blame me?

101
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Anyway,

102
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
you can't be his wife

103
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,720
until you become a king.

104
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
You are Liu Hui's precious.

105
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
You need to find a suitable reason

106
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
to get rid of him.

107
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Not to mention the great cause of the empress.

108
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
You can't convince me

109
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
even if you have hundreds of reasons.

110
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Liu Zi Xing.

111
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,720
The Jin army is working for you.

112
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't let us down.

113
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Okay.

114
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I promise you.

115
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Okay.

116
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Your Highness.

117
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Sit down first. I'll get someone to prepare tea.

118
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
I'll leave after I talk to you.

119
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Sit down.

120
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
His Majesty is back.

121
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
When did you get the news?

122
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
The secret report of the King of Southern Chen.

123
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
He is still so young.

124
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Your uncle wants me to be his wife.

125
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
You don't want to?

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
We are meant to be a couple.

127
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
What else can't we talk about?

128
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Do you want to hear the truth?

129
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
The King is a man of great virtue.

130
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
He is a man of great virtue.

131
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
In a short time,

132
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
there will be two new princes.

133
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
They are all famous stars.

134
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
The next king

135
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
will have to be careful.

136
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Besides,

137
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
you are not the crown prince.

138
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,720
I was once a crown prince.

139
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
I was once a crown prince.

140
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
I was once a crown prince.

141
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
You don't remember?

142
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Except me,

143
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
no one was serious.

144
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
I was brought into the palace

145
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
because my father had no military power.

146
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
He had no power to fight for me.

147
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I can walk to this day

148
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
with my own strength.

149
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Maybe in your heart,

150
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
the Royal Uncle is the best choice.

151
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
I don't think so.

152
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
My master is better at the position.

153
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
You should follow me to change him to the Royal Uncle.

154
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Do you know why you don't let your maid enter the palace?

155
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
She has been with you in Xizhou for almost ten years.

156
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
If she is here,

157
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
you will remember Xizhou and forget about it.

158
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Who are you?

159
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I will never give up on what I said.

160
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Let's not talk about marriage again today.

161
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Our marriage is over.

162
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
I will never give up on what I said.

163
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
I will never give up on what I said.

164
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
It's just a play

165
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
to calm down the Jin family.

166
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Why are you so sad?

167
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I am sorry.

168
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Seeing how sad she is,

169
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
I feel even worse than her.

170
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Take Hongtong away!

171
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Stop!

172
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Let go of me!

173
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
They are my parents' brother and sister.

174
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Don't you know that?

175
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
The Seven Dynasties are guilty of treason,

176
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
and they are all the nine tribes.

177
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Including you, Princess.

178
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
You dare to touch me?

179
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Why not?

180
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
If it weren't for your respect,

181
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I wouldn't have come to take her personally.

182
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
How dare you! Let go of me!

183
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
General Li, General Li,

184
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
General Li,

185
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
can you let me talk?

186
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
General Li,

187
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Prince Guangling has ordered

188
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
to punish the Seven Dynasties

189
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
for treason.

190
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
The Seven Dynasties are all the nine tribes.

191
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
The Seven Dynasties are all the nine tribes.

192
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Do you want to protect her?

193
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Yes, I want to protect her.

194
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Yes, I want to protect her.

195
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
She is not only the Seven Dynasties,

196
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
but also the wife of our Cui clan.

197
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
General, can you let the Cui family go?

198
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Since the Three Dynasties have said so,

199
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
I will take this order.

200
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Take her away!

201
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Let them go!

202
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Xinhua!

203
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Mother!

204
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Xinhua!

205
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
You can't save them.

206
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
I...

207
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
I think the Crown Prince...

208
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Cui San Niang,

209
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
this Princess Xinhua...

210
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Today, the Cui family closed the door.

211
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Please leave for the guests.

212
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Yes.

213
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Please.

214
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Brother Zi Xuan!

215
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Xinhua, please!

216
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Let my parents go!

217
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Why did you rush into the palace?

218
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
They didn't want me to see you.

219
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
They said you ordered them.

220
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
I ordered them.

221
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
I don't see you,

222
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
so I don't see your reason.

223
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
All the Seven Dynasties,

224
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
are the common people, and have been decided.

225
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
You can only stay in the Cui clan

226
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
to save your life.

227
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
You want to use the blood of the Seven Dynasties

228
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
to break the road to the throne?

229
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Seven Dynasties have been doing this for more than ten years,

230
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
and they have offended everyone.

231
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
I didn't want them to die.

232
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
No one wants them to live.

233
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
You stay in the Cui clan.

234
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
After you escape for a while,

235
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
I will find a way out for you.

236
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
But they are my biological parents.

237
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
How can I escape?

238
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I can't watch them die.

239
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Brother Zi Xuan, please help me.

240
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Please think of a way, okay?

241
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Brother Zi Xuan!

242
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
I can only help you.

243
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
I will send her back to the Cui clan.

244
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Your Highness.

245
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
You woke up.

246
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I'm okay.

247
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Come and sit down.

248
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Where is Uncle?

249
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Uncle?

250
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
He is not here.

251
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
He is not here.

252
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
He is not here.

253
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
He is not here.

254
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
What are you doing here?

255
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
I woke up and found the charcoal burning.

256
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
I woke up and found the charcoal burning.

257
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Prepare breakfast.

258
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Prepare breakfast.

259
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
I have never used breakfast with you since I entered the palace.

260
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,720
I have never used breakfast with you since I entered the palace.

261
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Go.

262
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Yes.

263
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Let's go inside. It's cold outside.

264
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Let's go.

265
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
It's cold.

266
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
I was wrong, Shiyi.

267
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
I'm used to being alone in the palace.

268
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
I don't know how to get along with people.

269
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
I mean, how to get along with people.

270
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
I mean, how to get along with people.

271
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Kill them.

272
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Kill them.

273
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Kill them.

274
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Kill them.

275
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Kill them.

276
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Kill them.

277
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Kill them.

278
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Kill them.

279
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Kill them.

280
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
What happened?

281
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Did they fight back?

282
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Don't panic. This is the report from the King of Nanchen.

283
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
The report?

284
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
The King of Nanchen is attacking the army of Taiyun.

285
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
The King of Nanchen is attacking the army of Taiyun.

286
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Kill them.

287
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Kill them.

288
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Kill them.

289
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Master refused to enter the city.

290
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
He wanted to see Shiyi for no reason.

291
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
General Feng, are you worried about Miss Cui?

292
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Why do you say I'm worried?

293
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
My eyes don't see the sun and the moon.

294
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
They see people's hearts.

295
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
My eyes only see someone close to someone else.

296
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
After that night...

297
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
There is people,

298
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
people...

299
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Let's go.

300
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
My eyes can't see your heart.

301
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
I'll go and call you.

302
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Select our effects.

303
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
My eyes can only see someone close to someone else.

304
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Your eyes only see one side.

305
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Look at this person.

306
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Look at this person.

307
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Open your eyes.

308
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Open them.

309
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,000
No marriage order

310
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,160
That's not accurate

311
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,560
Actually, Liu Zixing is pretty good to her sister

312
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,240
I can tell

313
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,920
It's not a good time

314
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,360
Where is the king now?

315
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,840
Just outside the city of Zhongzhou

316
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,800
Already back

317
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,440
Yes

318
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,160
Come back to train the army for a few days before going out

319
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,080
Why don't they enter the city?

320
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,520
It's my master's habit

321
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,480
They like to live outside the city

322
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,960
It's the same in Xizhou

323
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,960
What a pity

324
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,800
The people also want to see the king

325
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,560
What else did you ask?

326
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,560
Everyone said that the king of Nanchen

327
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,320
Want to completely eradicate the Jin's rebels

328
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,160
To pass the king's order

329
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,080
All the army leaders in the city are going to be discharged

330
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,400
Then King Pingqin is coming too

331
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,280
You ask me again

332
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,840
King Pingqin can enter the capital this time

333
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,960
What are you laughing at?

334
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,760
If you want to know this

335
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,160
Ask the prince directly

336
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,880
They haven't been judged yet

337
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,760
I want to find my old friend to talk about

338
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,000
Not good

339
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,120
Forget it, I haven't asked

340
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,560
stop

341
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,000
Where are the soldiers?

342
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,160
What are you doing?

343
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,160
Go away

344
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,840
King Pingqin, calm down

345
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
He is new and does not know the rules

346
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,720
You come here

347
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,280
Yes

348
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
What are you afraid of?

349
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,920
Yes

350
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,280
Prince

351
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,760
How do you recognize me?

352
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,960
Look at the chess

353
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,960
Yes

354
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,960
Who can pull the chess piece

355
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,400
Can pretend to be me

356
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,120
What if I'm fake

357
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,040
It's fake

358
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,520
You put me in Zhongzhou

359
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,160
I cut off all those officials and nobles

360
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
What can you do?

361
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,480
I am guilty

362
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,920
Get up

363
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,760
Thank you, prince

364
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,760
Whose soldiers are you?

365
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,360
Replying to the prince

366
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,640
I belong to the imperial guards

367
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,560
Whose guard is listening?

368
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,680
Listen to the king of Guangling

369
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,320
King Guangling

370
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,280
How old is King Guangling?

371
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,920
Have you ever brought soldiers?

372
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,080
Dare to set a trap

373
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,440
Prince

374
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,640
King Guangling

375
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,720
King Guangling is a royal member of the Liu family

376
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,520
Shut up

377
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,520
Guarding the soldiers

378
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Look at you guys

379
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,800
I know he has never fought

380
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,840
go

381
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,080
Go go go

382
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,800
Go go go

383
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,800
I've been holding it all the way

384
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,160
You tell me

385
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,280
Why did you give the ground to someone else?

386
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,040
I and him

387
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,600
Not the kind of relationship you think

388
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,720
You and me still don't tell the truth

389
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,760
Monk you say

390
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,160
I don't know the common thing

391
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,480
You don't know the common thing

392
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,520
When you were in Nanxiao, you were in a group

393
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,400
There are girls in the car

394
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,720
Throw flowers on your car

395
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,240
You are a prince

396
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,760
Don't know the common things

397
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,800
It seems that the king of the Peking Qing

398
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,720
Know a lot about the monk

399
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,360
You are with my brother

400
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,480
Shouldn't check you

401
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,280
Of course

402
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,760
This

403
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
I want to say

404
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,520
You have a bad name

405
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,240
No lock on your body

406
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,160
that

407
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,240
What did you say they gave you?

408
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,040
In addition to making you a bad thing

409
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,120
What else did you give them to sell their lives?

410
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,440
Just gave you this

411
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,360
You still send the fish to me

412
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,040
This is a good thing

413
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
Of course it's good

414
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,840
With this good thing

415
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,800
The government gave me a thousand horses

416
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,240
In my north city

417
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Only with war horses can you get soldiers

418
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,920
I just did it step by step like this

419
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,160
He is my brother

420
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,240
Especially my Bole

421
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,440
Your friends

422
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,400
Most of them are also from the gang

423
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,560
You are not a pity

424
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,760
You are not a regret

425
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,560
Let's talk about business first

426
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,840
Talk talk talk talk talk

427
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,000
Business business

428
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,640
Tomorrow my king and the king's reinforcements will go first

429
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,400
Zhongzhou City is yours

430
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,120
I guard Zhongzhou

431
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,200
Correct

432
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,440
I brought all the elite soldiers

433
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,080
Those kings are all in good shape

434
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,240
It's impossible to give you an elite soldier

435
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,440
Just because of this

436
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
I need you to guard the city

437
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,800
did not understand

438
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,200
If you just go to the capital

439
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,720
I'm afraid someone will suspect

440
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,560
You and I work together to seize the country

441
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,600
So I sent reinforcements from all over the country

442
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,480
Just to make a joke with you

443
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,440
You still

444
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
Still as you want

445
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,400
you

446
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,200
When you leave tomorrow

447
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,240
The people of the capital will leave it to you

448
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,800
And him

449
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,440
That one

450
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,880
Before going out

451
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,880
Go see Shiyi

452
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,360
Not convenient

453
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,400
What's inconvenient about your apprentice

454
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,280
Joke

455
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,360
Brother takes you

456
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,600
Forget it

457
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,480
Today you are asking me

458
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,960
Not me asking you

459
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
You entrust Zhongzhou to me

460
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,960
What do I want you to do

461
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
What are you going to do

462
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,600
Fengqiao is good

463
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,320
Fengqiao

464
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Where are we going later

465
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
You go to the capital

466
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
I go to the capital

467
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,280
Where are we going later

468
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,320
You follow

469
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,320
There is a female disciple

470
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,520
Can avoid suspicion

471
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,520
Monk monk

472
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,120
You will go with us later

473
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,120
Monks are more avoiding suspicion

474
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,400
Let's go

475
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,120
Go with brother

476
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,080
Go go go

477
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,920
Go go go go

478
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,160
Let's go

479
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,760
Shiyi

480
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,520
Cui Shiyi

481
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,840
Your brother is here

482
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,760
Come out

483
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,880
Master

484
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,840
I'm still thinking

485
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,320
Who will call me Shiyi in the palace

486
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,960
You are in my eyes

487
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,760
Always the one in Nancheng Palace

488
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,400
Little girl who can't speak

489
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,640
Uncle, tea

490
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,360
Yes

491
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,880
No need, I'll do it myself

492
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,040
Come in

493
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,560
Come in

494
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,880
There are no outsiders usually

495
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,120
So it's a bit messy

496
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,400
Hot to death

497
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,960
More

498
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,160
Enough enough

499
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,960
When did you arrive

500
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,040
I've been here for an hour

501
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,880
They all say it's inconvenient to see you

502
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,720
What's inconvenient

503
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,440
You see, didn't we come in?

504
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,040
King of Pingqin is the only one

505
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,120
Who dares to offend you

506
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,080
You

507
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,960
I like to hear this

508
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,320
When is Master going out of town

509
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,640
tomorrow

510
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,960
So fast

511
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,960
Yes

512
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,000
what

513
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,160
Worry about us

514
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,360
When did we fight

515
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,960
In the eyes of outsiders, the king is invincible

516
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,160
But for me

517
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,160
Those who rush to the county are my close relatives

518
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,560
Every time you go out of town

519
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,320
I'm afraid of dying

520
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,960
Every time

521
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,320
I know

522
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,520
Take care

523
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,200
Do not be in the cloud

524
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,560
General Prince

525
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,600
Is n Naphthom

526
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Love

527
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Will go down for you

528
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,720
And protect the love of our people

529
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
The land is like a flower

530
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
The sword is like a horse

531
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,720
The sword is like a sword

532
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
If you don't turn back

533
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
If you don't turn back

534
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Don't care about the past

535
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
This way

536
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
You can live and die

537
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
And be a wolf

538
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Your Highness

539
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Your Highness

540
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Your Highness

541
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
You must come back, Your Highness

542
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
You must come back

543
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Your Highness

544
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Wolf

545
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Wolf

546
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,720
If I make a wish with you

547
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Guess

548
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Whose family will win?

549
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
Why are you here?

550
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
I am a hostage

551
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I have lived in the White Horse Temple for a long time

552
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
You haven't hit me yet

553
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Who will win?

554
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
The King of Nancheng never loses

555
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
What if you lose?

556
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
The King of Nancheng

557
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
The King of Nancheng

558
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,720
The King of Nancheng has never lost since he was 13 years old

559
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Since he was a soldier

560
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,720
The only one who sent him to Zhongzhou was Jie Bao

561
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Princess

562
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Jie Bao again

563
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
General Zhou is awake

564
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Senior

565
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
He is awake

566
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Let me do it

567
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Right

568
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
You said that their army went too far

569
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
They went

570
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
They fought and fought

571
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
How about your brother?

572
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Is he safe?

573
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
He is fine

574
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
He is fine

575
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
He is fine

576
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
He is fine

577
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
He is fine

578
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
He is fine

579
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
But he is not awake

580
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Come

581
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Your Highness

582
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
What did General Jin say?

583
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
He asked me to save him

584
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
He was trapped in the Imperial Palace for 16 days

585
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
There was no grass in the army

586
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
If it goes on, he will eat people

587
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
The King of Nancheng

588
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Your father lost the war

589
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Your Highness wants to abandon General Jie Bao

590
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
How do you think?

591
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Zhou Shengchen won the war

592
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
He can't stop you from taking the throne

593
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
You are the emperor

594
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
So you don't have to take the throne

595
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
You are the emperor

596
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
So you don't have to care about my father's life

597
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
Why don't you talk?

598
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
How do you think you can get rid of me?

599
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
You hide me secretly

600
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Or you kill me directly?

601
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
I will send you to Taiyuan County

602
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
I miss your wife

603
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Impossible

604
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
My father would rather die than think about it

605
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Only persuasion can make a living

606
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
All are useless

607
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
You can't stop Zhou Shengchen for half a month

608
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
