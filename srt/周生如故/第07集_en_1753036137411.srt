00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

Chinese TV Series Exclusive YouTube

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
May I ask where this general came from?

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
Where did I come from?

62
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,000
You can't ask me.

63
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Escort the criminal to the capital.

64
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,400
Please forgive me, General.

65
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,600
General, please.

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Go.

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
Junior Sister is so bold.

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,600
She really has the guts to take General Jia.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
General Jia.

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Is Grand Preceptor here?

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Yes.

72
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm here to deliver some Jiangnan snacks.

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Your Highness, please.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,600
You still don't trust me?

75
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,600
Then give me the food box.

76
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
It's okay.

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Grand Preceptor has already had dinner.

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
You wait outside.

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Yes.

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Grand Preceptor.

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm here to deliver some Jiangnan snacks to Grand Preceptor.

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
I didn't expect to be stopped outside.

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,000
You are a thoughtful person.

84
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
It's okay.

85
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,200
In the future, I'll punish them for you.

86
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Thank you, Grand Preceptor.

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,000
Your Majesty, Grand Preceptor is still praying.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
You like to read the scriptures.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But you've broken the Empress Dowager.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm the Empress Dowager.

91
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,600
For me, Yanren

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,800
should be the heir of the Qianwu Ancient.

93
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
You have your own harem.

94
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
And maids.

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,000
And the royal family.

96
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,400
You talk to me.

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,000
You talk about the world.

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,200
Why're you laughing?

99
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,200
You can't keep your place as the Crown Prince!

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
Think about it.

101
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,400
The emperor set a drama schedule.

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
If you have your own tolerance in the future,

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
how can you become the Crown Prince?

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,440
and the marriage between you and Cui Jia.

105
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
Leave this to me.

106
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Thank you, Magistrate Zhao.

107
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Let me.

108
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,200
You can't do that.

109
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,400
How can I not do that?

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
No.

111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Wang Junyu of Nanchen is in the middle of the city.

112
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,200
Hurry and help. Help him to survive.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,400
Go! Go!

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Your Highness.

115
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
The Yan thief Zhao Teng has confessed his crime.

116
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
The law of the talisman is to be executed.

117
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
He's dead. Who are you still fighting for?

118
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Hurry and save the law of the talisman.

119
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Kill him and run away.

120
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
I don't dare to!

121
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm here to protect the northern court.

122
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,200
You guys go and save the law of the talisman.

123
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
You can then survive.

124
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Please spare us, Your Highness.

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
Find a son of Zhao Teng and tell him

126
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,400
that Zhao Teng suddenly died of hunger.

127
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Please leave a message and hurry and enter the palace

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,800
to watch over the Empress Dowager and comfort His Majesty.

129
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,200
Yes.

130
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
Go!

131
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
Go!

132
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
Stop!

133
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Do you know who I am?

134
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,800
I am the Great General of the court.

135
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
You dare to kill me?

136
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Aren't you afraid of being executed?

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Who are you?

138
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,800
Who are you guys?

139
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Who are you guys?

140
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Who are you guys?

141
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
Speak!

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
What's going on?

143
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
What's going on?

144
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
What's going on?

145
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
What's going on?

146
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
What's going on?

147
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
What's going on?

148
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
What's going on?

149
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
What's going on?

150
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,200
Today's court is closed.

151
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Everyone, please leave.

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Court closed?

153
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,000
What's going on?

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
It's a big problem.

155
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Isn't this the body of Prince Guang Ling?

156
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
What should we do now?

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Leave the palace first.

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
What's going on?

159
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
What's going on?

160
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Here they come.

161
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
The court is closed.

162
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
It's too worrying.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Prime Minister.

164
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
You are...

165
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
You are Cui's third mother?

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Prime Minister, you have good taste.

167
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Third mother rarely leaves Qinghe.

168
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
Why did you come to the capital?

169
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,200
My brother is very ill.

170
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,800
He has no time.

171
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
He can't bear to leave His Majesty,

172
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,000
can't bear to leave his fellow ministers,

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
can't bear to leave Prime Minister.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,400
He decided to return to Zhongzhou Cui's mansion.

175
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,600
He will serve the left and right.

176
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Then, what about you, third mother?

177
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,200
After Prime Minister and all the ministers have left the court,

178
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,200
I will invite you all to Cui's mansion for a chat.

179
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Cui Palace.

180
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Everyone, please sit down.

181
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I heard that

182
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Zhao Teng has a bad disease.

183
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
He can't stand it for a few days.

184
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Zhao Teng is not well.

185
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I also heard that

186
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,400
General Liu Yuan went to see the Empress Dowager.

187
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,400
He is the son of the court official of the Baran.

188
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
He killed all the ministers.

189
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
When everyone arrived,

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
the guilty minister Liu Yuan

191
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
had already handed over the military power

192
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
and admitted to the crime.

193
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Brother, we are almost there.

194
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Let's go.

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Everyone, please have a taste.

196
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,400
This is a specialty of Qinghe County.

197
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Prime Minister, didn't you hear the sound?

198
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
You walk in the palace every day.

199
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,400
You should know it earlier than me.

200
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I heard it.

201
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Liu Yuan raised the Bixu's wife.

202
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,400
He killed the court officials and forced the people to be slaves.

203
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Prime Minister, have you been waiting for this day

204
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,400
for a long time?

205
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I can't hide it from Cui Palace.

206
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
I have been busy for a long time.

207
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm a little weak.

208
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
At such a turbulent time,

209
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Prime Minister, please help His Majesty.

210
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
I will do my best.

211
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I knew you would lock me up sooner or later.

212
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Your Majesty.

213
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
The game is set. You should be happy.

214
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Why are you still here?

215
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I always thought we would win.

216
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I was most worried that His Majesty didn't believe him.

217
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I was afraid that His Majesty thought he had a plan.

218
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,400
As long as he arranged everything for His Majesty,

219
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,400
I will be happy.

220
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
I will be happy.

221
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I will be happy.

222
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
As long as he arranged everything for His Majesty,

223
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
it will be a joke.

224
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Why are you crying?

225
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Zhao Teng was killed by Royal Uncle.

226
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Zhao Teng is a sick person.

227
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Then Liu Yuan...

228
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,400
He committed suicide and has been discharged from the military.

229
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
I said that I need to tell the world about this.

230
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I need to tell the world about this.

231
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I need to tell the world about this.

232
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Then...

233
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Am I a part of the history?

234
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Am I a part of the history?

235
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm afraid you can't.

236
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
You need to have more princes.

237
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Otherwise, there will be no one left.

238
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
It will be more chaotic.

239
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I didn't bring any weapons into the palace today.

240
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I only brought a jade sword.

241
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
I'm your Royal Uncle.

242
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm your Royal Uncle.

243
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,400
To me, you're more important than the throne.

244
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Royal Uncle.

245
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Thank you, Your Highness, for saving my life.

246
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I said that you can't kneel.

247
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I was imprisoned for three years by Ni Zi and Yan Chen.

248
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
I was imprisoned for three years by Ni Zi and Yan Chen.

249
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
I lost the dignity of the Empress Dowager.

250
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
If it wasn't for you,

251
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
I wouldn't have seen the sun.

252
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I was wrong.

253
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Mother.

254
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Mother.

255
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Just pretend that you're not born.

256
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
I listened to Xie Chanyan.

257
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
I just wanted to get rid of Ling Chao.

258
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Later, I couldn't get rid of Zhao Teng.

259
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I knew I was wrong.

260
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
I was unable to sleep and sleep.

261
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
But I was afraid that they would kill you.

262
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
I didn't dare to disobey them.

263
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
I was wrong.

264
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I really knew I was wrong.

265
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
I was wrong.

266
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,400
I was wrong.

267
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Mother.

268
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Mother.

269
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,900
Your Highness,

270
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,400
do you remember a lot of the past?

271
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Emperor Qian was only 31 when he died.

272
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
But he has been doing things that Place Emperor once did before.

273
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,900
I would like to Russia

274
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,080
Prince

275
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,120
Max

276
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,660
want to binary

277
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,380
I can't forego it

278
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
I thought your masters were under egg resilient

279
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
Youraux supply you with orders

280
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,460
that she might have some let down when she gets busy.

281
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,480
She ARRYED

282
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,360
to put me in the palace

283
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,020
after?

284
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,420
Go back to Xi Zhou.

285
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,900
This before rehearsal hall was the king room clinician hall

286
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,020
why is this hall empty?

287
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,260
I was moved to Xianyang Hall.

288
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,160
I was raised by the late emperor since I was a child.

289
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
I also live here.

290
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What are you looking at?

291
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm looking at the place where Master lived when he was a child.

292
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,400
They don't know us?

293
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
I think so.

294
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,480
This time, except for a few people,

295
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
no one knows that Prince of Nanchen is back.

296
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,680
So we have to hide our names in the palace.

297
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I think so.

298
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Then can I not call you Master?

299
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,320
I'm going to show up immediately.

300
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
It makes sense.

301
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
I...

302
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Your Highness, the Empress Dowager asked you to make a bed.

303
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Go find the military counselor.

304
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
This is not my house.

305
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
Don't go around.

306
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,600
Miss, you are still in the palace.

307
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,600
If you want to see me, I will go and pick you up.

308
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm in Kexi.

309
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Kexi?

310
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Kexi what?

311
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
To get rid of Royal Uncle,

312
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
tonight is the best time.

313
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
He entered the capital to kill Prince of Qin.

314
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Except for a few people,

315
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
he also killed the emperor.

316
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
That's why he is still in the palace.

317
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
I think so.

318
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
I think so.

319
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
I think so.

320
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
I think so.

321
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
I think so.

322
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Except for a few people,

323
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
no one knows.

324
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Even if he dies here,

325
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
the King of Nanchen can't say anything.

326
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Killing Liu Yun and him overnight

327
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
is a double-edged sword.

328
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Unfortunately, the emperor is heavily guarded.

329
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
The Qing Dynasty

330
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
can't kill Royal Uncle.

331
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Change your clothes.

332
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Yes.

333
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Are you going to see Miss Cui?

334
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Princess.

335
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
No.

336
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
I should thank Royal Uncle for saving the emperor.

337
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
The Empress Dowager has invited him to leave.

338
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Congratulations, Empress Dowager.

339
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
You have regained your power.

340
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
You think I asked you here

341
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
to kill you?

342
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Guess who went back to the palace?

343
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I didn't ask about the common things.

344
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
The man in Xizhou

345
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
is the most important person

346
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
in the whole country.

347
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,160
That man.

348
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
You finally came back.

349
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
I'm sorry.

350
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I didn't mean to hurt you.

351
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I'm sorry.

352
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
In this bedroom,

354
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
there is no emperor and subjects.

355
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
There is only one family.

356
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
You are my future sister-in-law?

357
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
I was impulsive.

358
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Don't be afraid, sister-in-law.

359
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
I'm here to see her.

360
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
This is the military counselor

361
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,920
under Prince Chen of Nan Dynasty, Xie Chong?

362
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Your Majesty, I'm...

363
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Your Majesty, you can't be so polite.

364
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
I can't stand it.

365
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
No, you can.

366
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Get up.

367
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Your Majesty.

368
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
You are the teacher of the late emperor.

369
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
You are the benefactor of Royal Uncle.

370
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
I should do it myself.

371
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
There are two classes left.

372
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
You and the late emperor

373
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
only have a marriage contract.

374
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
You don't have the strength to marry.

375
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Why are you doing this?

376
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
After the late emperor died,

377
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Empress Gao forced me to marry.

378
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Later, she died.

379
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
I wanted to leave the palace.

380
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
I heard that you made great achievements

381
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
in the Tai Chi Hall.

382
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
You will never marry.

383
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
So I stayed here.

384
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
After all,

385
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
I'm the only one

386
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
who can marry you.

387
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
We met each other at first.

388
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Your Majesty, you are here

389
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
not only for the sake of the ceremony, right?

390
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
I want to ask someone.

391
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Have you ever heard

392
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,680
of a girl named Huai Yang?

393
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Gao Huai Yang?

394
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Yes, her surname is Gao.

395
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Your Majesty,

396
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
what do you want to ask her?

397
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
What does she have to do with you?

398
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,440
Her relationship with Royal Uncle.

399
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Your Majesty,

400
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
why do you think

401
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
she has a relationship with your uncle?

402
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
I'll ask the military counselor first.

403
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
I'll tell you after the counselor is finished.

404
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Your Majesty,

405
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,440
she is Empress Gao's cousin.

406
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Because she often has the opportunity to enter the palace.

407
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
After the late emperor saw her,

408
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
she fell in love with him.

409
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
But she wants to marry

410
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
the crown prince.

411
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Does Royal Uncle like her?

412
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I dare not ask.

413
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Then when Royal Uncle left,

414
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
he must be very sad.

415
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Maybe.

416
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
I only heard that

417
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Gao's cousin forced her to enter the palace

418
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
to serve the late emperor.

419
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
I think

420
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
she only has benefits

421
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
and no bad points for the counselor.

422
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
But Empress Gao

423
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
doesn't want her to get spoiled

424
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
and stop her from doing so.

425
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
In the end, she failed.

426
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
After the late emperor left,

427
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
there was no news of her.

428
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
She was married in the palace

429
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
until today.

430
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
She is still alive?

431
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
I think

432
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
as long as I stay in the palace,

433
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
I can wait for you sooner or later.

434
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Did you leave the palace

435
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
because of me?

436
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
It has nothing to do with you.

437
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,000
Why not be able to

438
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
get by in the palace?

439
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,120
I've left the palace

440
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,120
with additional days.

441
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
You are willing

442
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,640
give me extra days,

443
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
is that it?

444
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
It's not a bad idea.

445
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
What are you doing?

446
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,220
you can't leave the palace.

447
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
Where are you going?

448
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,220
I'm going out of the palace.

449
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
The palace gate is already closed.

450
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
If the ministers have important things,

451
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
I can go out.

452
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
You also said

453
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,220
that the ministers have important things.

454
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Do you think this is Xizhou

455
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,220
that you can't enter?

456
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,220
I already asked people to go to Cui's house

457
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,220
to report to Cui's house.

458
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,220
You can stay in the palace tonight.

459
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
His Majesty is also here.

460
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
Yes, I almost cried and passed out.

461
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
After talking with the military,

462
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,220
I really feel alive.

463
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
Why aren't you greeting His Majesty?

464
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
As Cui's daughter,

465
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
where do you think Li Yi went?

466
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
He's been here for an hour.

467
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
He?

468
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Your Majesty.

469
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
I said

470
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
that there are no ministers in this palace.

471
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Don't blame him.

472
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,220
Please sit.

473
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,220
Sit.

474
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,220
Sit.

475
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
I want you to eat.

476
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
Uncle,

477
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,220
what do you want me to reward you with this time?

478
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,220
No need.

479
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Jewelry,

480
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Feng Hao,

481
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
or a collar,

482
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,220
or a marriage?

483
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
I can't have a marriage.

484
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Even if I can't perform the wedding ceremony,

485
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
as long as the love is in harmony,

486
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
I can still live a life of happiness.

487
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Your Majesty is still thinking clearly.

488
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
What's the point of the wedding ceremony?

489
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,220
It's more important

490
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,220
to have love and friendship.

491
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
I don't want you to have no future.

492
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,220
If I have a child,

493
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,220
I'll raise it for you.

494
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Who dares to say anything?

495
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,220
Your Majesty,

496
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,220
I don't have a future.

497
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
I

498
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
have brothers and sisters.

499
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
When did you do that?

500
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,220
In my palace,

501
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,220
there are ten orphans

502
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
and one disciple.

503
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,220
So...

504
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
The military counselor is old.

505
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Please forgive him.

506
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
It's okay.

507
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
Your Majesty!

508
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Fatty!

509
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
Didn't I tell you

510
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,220
not to let anyone in?

511
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Please calm down.

512
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
I heard a noise.

513
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
I'm afraid you're in danger.

514
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,220
My guests are all in the bedroom.

515
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
How could it be dangerous?

516
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
Get out!

517
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Yes.

518
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,220
I asked my uncle

519
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,220
who else I could trust.

520
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
I heard from the military counselor

521
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,220
that Liu Yuan was your friend when he was young.

522
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
Did your uncle

523
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,220
want to plead for him?

524
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Can I have a word with him?

525
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
Your Majesty,

526
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,220
please do it in a polite manner.

527
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,220
I have only one request.

528
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,220
Please go ahead.

529
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
Don't make any more mistakes.

530
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,220
Your Majesty,

531
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
please go ahead.

532
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,220
I'm not afraid of anything.

533
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,220
I'm just worried about you.

534
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,220
I want to know

535
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,220
if you're okay.

536
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,220
I'll go with you.

537
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,220
I'm not afraid.

538
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
I'm not afraid.

539
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,220
I'm not afraid.

540
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
I'm not afraid.

541
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,220
I'm not afraid.

542
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,220
I'm not afraid.

543
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,220
I'm not afraid.

544
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,220
I'm not afraid.

545
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
Don't worry.

546
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
Don't worry.

547
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,220
I'm not afraid.

548
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Don't worry.

549
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
I'm not afraid.

550
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
I'm not afraid.

551
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
Let's go.

552
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Let's go.

553
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,220
Master,

554
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,220
you're awake.

555
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
I...

556
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
What?

557
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,780
You seem to have something on your mind tonight.

558
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,060
I'm young. I have few past events.

559
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,500
I don't have many chances to keep my mind.

560
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,060
When you came back, I found that you were in a bad mood.

561
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,700
What happened?

562
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,620
The wine I drank was called Sangluo.

563
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,580
It's often used to reward those who have done good deeds.

564
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:10,260
My father once used it to reward a general who claimed to be a good drinker.

565
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,300
He drank until he fell down half a month after he fell down.

566
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,620
He was so drunk that he drank too much.

567
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,940
I drank a lot tonight.

568
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,460
So if you have any worries, you can tell me.

569
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,740
I won't remember it tomorrow.

570
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,020
Your Majesty, please bring it here.

571
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,340
We buried it in every corner of the palace.

572
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,420
Who did you bury it with?

573
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,380
A few friends.

574
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,780
Was it him?

575
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,740
Yes.

576
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,460
He's really drunk. He said everything.

577
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,140
Then will you take him out of the palace this time?

578
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,900
He's really drunk. I have no reason to save him.

579
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
Your eyes are red.

580
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,740
I'm red.

581
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,980
If you can't sleep well, you'll naturally get red.

582
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:49,460
Shi Yi, we've known each other for too long. You can't lie to me.

583
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,540
He knows you longer.

584
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,660
The military counselor told you?

585
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,020
His Majesty was there. They talked a few words.

586
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,220
I listened to them.

587
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,220
His Majesty just asked me if I should plead for him.

588
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,220
Why? Because his surname is Gao?

589
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,220
When did Liu Yuan's surname change to Gao?

590
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,500
You've been talking about Liu Yuan?

591
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,820
If it's not Liu Yuan, then who is it?

592
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Forget it.

593
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,700
You should rest early.

594
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
Teacher, where are you going?

595
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,220
There's a lady in the palace. Be careful not to be an assassin.

596
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
Why are you following me?

597
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,220
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

598
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,220
You're afraid I'll be in danger too?

599
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Teacher drank a lot tonight.

600
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,220
Actually, I'm a good drinker.

601
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
That's true.

602
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,220
What is it?

603
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,220
Mother and I said a word that's written by you.

604
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,220
Drunk with white bone soup, put together a crazy song.

605
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,220
I should have guessed that you drank a lot.

606
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,220
The thing about the young man's madness was written down.

607
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
At that time, there were few soldiers.

608
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,220
So I was happy to take care of the treasure.

609
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
Teacher, put it on.

610
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
You put it on. It's not cold.

611
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,220
Come here.

612
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Let's go.

613
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
What are you digging?

614
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
Wine.

615
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,220
I'm going to meet an old friend later.

616
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,220
I buried this wine with him.

617
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
We once agreed

618
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,220
to dig it out with me.

619
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
We'll clear it together.

620
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,220
Who are you?

621
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,220
Let me go!

622
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,220
Do you still want to live?

623
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
Do you hear me?

624
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
Let me go!

625
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
Aren't you afraid of being humiliated?

626
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,220
Let me go!

627
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,220
Who are you?

628
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,220
Who are you?

629
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,220
Speak!

630
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
Who are you?

631
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220
Who are you?

632
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Who are you?

633
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,220
Who are you?

634
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,220
You?

635
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,220
That's right.

636
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,220
It can only be you.

637
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,220
I dug this wine and brought it to you.

638
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,220
If I had known this day,

639
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,220
I should have let Gao Huang Hao kill you.

640
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
Thank you for protecting me.

641
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,220
Protecting a person who wants to die.

642
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
Let me drink some wine.

643
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
My throat is so dry.

644
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,220
Forget it.

645
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
Only you

646
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,220
can make me feel at ease.

647
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,220
Do you have any other wishes?

648
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,220
In the past years,

649
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,220
I've thought of the only one.

650
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,220
Wu Han.

651
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,220
Does anyone need my care?

652
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
I have one more wish.

653
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,220
I will send someone to send him back to Ping City.

654
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,220
To help him avoid this disaster.

655
