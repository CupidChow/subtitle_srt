[Episode 6]

4
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,000
Master.

5
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,680
What is it?

6
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,289
You don't like the food?

7
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,680
I...

8
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,080
He's still that ungrateful, just like how he was

9
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,140
in the Buddhist Tower of the Mansion.

10
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,880
Don't you

11
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,320
underestimate him.

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,520
Back to

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,720
the days in Nanxiao,

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,640
he was well-versed in both literature and martial arts.

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,600
He once tamed

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
a running battle steed with just one hand.

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,320
His martial arts skills are much better than yours.

18
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,720
It's already in the past,

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,460
not worth mentioning.

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,380
In that case, I wanna compete with you again.

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
I surrender.

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,040
Surrender or not, you can't say that

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
until we have a competition.

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
This disciple of mine

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,880
once stayed half a month

26
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,420
along the riverside to learn how to swim.

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,520
You don't have much going on right now anyway.

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
It's not a bad idea

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,300
to practice a little after chanting sutras.

30
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,160
Fine.

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,780
Then I'll be a Kung Fu monk for a while.

32
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,440
It's just a competition.

33
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,040
Again!

34
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Feng Qiao.

35
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
As one from Nanchen Royal Mansion,

36
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,260
you should be a good sport.

37
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,560
I lost.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,880
Who would've thought

39
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,480
Feng Qiao would lose one day?

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,180
-Your Highness.
-Master.

41
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,330
Your Highness, I'd also like to compete with you.

42
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,120
Me?

43
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,159
That year your army and mine

44
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,720
confronted each other across the Huaishui River.

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,980
We almost had a battle.

46
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,520
Do you still remember it?

47
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,170
I of course remember it.

48
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,159
Back then, I was still fighting

49
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,690
all over the place for the Emperor of Nanxiao.

50
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
It was such a joke!

51
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,560
At that time,

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,940
you and I were enemies.

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,280
If we fought,

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,010
one of us would have to lose.

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,440
But now it's not

56
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,560
an issue anymore.

57
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
I'd like to compete with you.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
You are right.

59
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,080
Please.

60
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,810
Your Highness, I'm impressed.

61
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,820
I'm flattered.

62
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,300
Master.

63
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,120
I found a nice place.

64
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,880
Good.

65
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,160
Get me the horse.

66
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,560
Yes.

67
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Are you coming?

68
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
I don't have a horse.

69
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600
I have one.

70
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,720
But it once trampled on dead bodies.

71
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,580
Are you afraid?

72
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm not.

73
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,810
Let's go.

74
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,040
Shiyi,

75
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
do you wanna catch up on your master?

76
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,100
Your Highness.

77
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,180
Where are we going?

78
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,600
To the location of the new temple.

79
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
What new temple?

80
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Ask Eleven.

81
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,900
Oh, it's...

82
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,530
Tell me later when we get there.

83
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
Let's check it out over there.

84
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,960
There's nothing to see.

85
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Watch your steps.

86
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,920
Do you have a name for the temple?

87
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,840
Azure Dragon Temple.

88
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,570
Azure Dragon Temple...

89
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,080
are more powerful than the Azure Dragon.

90
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,880
are more powerful than the Azure Dragon.

91
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,809
It's a good name.

92
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
Why Azure Dragon?

93
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,760
My mother told me

94
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,039
that my father saw through the vanity of the world,

95
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,040
so he abandoned us and became a monk.

96
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
She also told me

97
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,120
that the monastery he joined

98
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,920
was called Azure Dragon Temple.

99
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,020
I asked General Cui

100
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,040
and my counsin to help me find it,

101
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,560
but it's been years,

102
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,000
they still haven't

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,320
found a temple

104
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,570
named Azure Dragon.

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,720
They are all here.

106
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,400
Let's go.

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,800
It is nice, and it's a huge space.

108
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,520
This place has been deserted for long.

109
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,680
If we can rebuild it,

110
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,960
it'd be a good deed.

111
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
We just scanned the whole area.

112
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,480
If this is the central axis,

113
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,800
the gate and the Hillside Hall can go over there.

114
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,600
Front yard.

115
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,640
Back yard.

116
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,600
And we can build the Four Heavenly Kings Hall,

117
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
the Ten Kings Hall,

118
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,280
and the Arhat Hall around it.

119
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,400
Your Highness, have you thought of a name?

120
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,680
Name?

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,730
We'll call it

122
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,280
Azure Dragon Temple.

123
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,160
Now, let's go.

124
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,090
Let's go.

125
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,000
Your Highness.

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,730
Advisor Xie.

127
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,440
The Prince of Guangling has been waiting for you in the camp.

128
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,960
And he brought four guards.

129
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,880
It's the Chief Commander's camp.

130
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,520
We can't even go in without my master's permission.

131
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,800
How dare he bring guards in?

132
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,400
I'll go kick him out!

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,120
Xiaoyu!

134
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
He's Shiyi's fiancÃ©.

135
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,380
Don't make a scene.

136
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,640
Military rules shall be obeyed.

137
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,800
You don't have to make an exception for me.

138
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,040
Master, if you don't wanna confront him,

139
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,240
I'll ask him to leave.

140
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,080
When did I ever ask you

141
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,760
for help while I was around?

142
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,120
Uncle.

143
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,180
Sorry that I kept you waiting.

144
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,010
What were you watching?

145
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
I was watching

146
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,890
the territory you fought for Beichen.

147
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,480
Shouyang is over here.

148
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,850
And the person who's been guarding

149
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,450
the frontiers down the south

150
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,800
is him, General Cui.

151
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,200
Greeting, Your Highness! I'm Cui Feng.

152
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,520
Your last name is Cui?

153
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,560
Yes.

154
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,680
So you are...

155
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
I'm Shiyi's cousin.

156
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
Then that makes you

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,330
my cousin-in-law, too.

158
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,980
I'm flattered.

159
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,560
Uncle, I hope we can interrogate

160
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,360
the Prince of Nanxiao together.

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
So this is what

162
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,130
you are really here for?

163
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Yes.

164
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,440
This is the Prince of Nanchen's camp!

165
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
Nobody is allowed to come in

166
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,640
without permission!

167
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,960
Those who break in the camp

168
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,000
must be killed!

169
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,120
My apology.

170
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,040
Get out, now!

171
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,920
Yes.

172
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,040
Master,

173
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,620
I'll go keep an eye on them.

174
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,680
Wen!

175
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,760
From now on,

176
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,440
we'll part ways

177
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,280
and you'll no longer be my father!

178
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,680
Why are you doing this?

179
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,720
You are my son!

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,520
The fact is not like

181
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,080
what your mother told you!

182
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,740
-You are...
-Don't come over!

183
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,360
Okay! Okay!

184
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,440
If you take one more step forward,

185
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,970
I'll kill myself right now!

186
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,120
Okay.

187
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
I won't push you!

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,680
I'll give you more time to think it over.

189
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,320
I'll wait for you to be back!

190
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,480
Protect him in secret.

191
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,400
Bring him back to me

192
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,760
unharmed.

193
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Yes!

194
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,840
The Prince of Guangling came from the capital city.

195
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,300
He wants to meet you on His Majesty's behalf.

196
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,250
Miss Feng, please lead the way.

197
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,850
Why did you come to Beichen?

198
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,680
I escaped here.

199
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,200
From the fight over the Crown Prince position of Nanxiao,

200
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
or...

201
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,480
My mother was a consort of the previous dynasty.

202
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,640
After the country declined,

203
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,760
she was forced to marry the Emperor of Nanxiao.

204
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,770
Seven and a half months later, she gave birth to me.

205
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,000
Therefore, people of Nanxiao

206
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,190
always suspect that I'm

207
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,100
the son of the late emperor.

208
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,650
The Junior Prince of Nanchen must have heard of it.

209
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,240
I surely have.

210
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,480
Are you saying

211
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,440
the rumor is true?

212
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,520
Yes.

213
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,440
Before my mother passed away,

214
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
she told me the truth

215
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,040
and asked me to avenge my birth father.

216
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,100
I've been troubled

217
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,760
by the fact ever since,

218
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,800
and I planned this escape.

219
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,720
I will tell His Majesty

220
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,440
what you said today.

221
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,200
And it's up to His Majesty

222
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,880
what to do with you.

223
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,310
Feng Qiao,

224
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,620
see him out.

225
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,640
Yes.

226
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Zixing.

227
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,760
You used me just now

228
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,700
and got rid of the four guards.

229
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,980
Do you have anything else to say to me?

230
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,920
I risked my life to come here because I want you

231
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,240
to send out an army and save His Majesty.

232
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,520
Zhao Teng colluded with General Liu Yuan.

233
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,480
They hold Empress Dowager hostage

234
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,640
and order around the officials in the name of His Majesty.

235
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,970
The esteemed officials

236
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
have all resigned to avoid trouble.

237
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,020
And what's left

238
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,480
is only the clique of Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan.

239
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,360
Grand Mentor Cui also resigned for that reason.

240
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,520
Go on.

241
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,480
Uncle, please send out an army

242
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,540
and take him back to the capital city.

243
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,200
I'll set off tonight and go back

244
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,530
to the palace to report.

245
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,960
Your Highness.

246
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,540
You can't send out an army.

247
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,180
If you do, I'm afraid

248
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,980
His Majesty

249
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,740
will mistake you intention for rebellion.

250
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,220
He won't.

251
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,500
When he said he looked out to the Western State

252
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,859
while he was in the Central State,

253
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,790
I knew right away

254
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,740
that he was still that young kid.

255
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
It's just

256
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,380
that I have to do it in secret.

257
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,150
If people see me,

258
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,500
they'd think something serious happened,

259
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,300
and some of them

260
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,339
would take the chance and revolt again.

261
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,540
It'd put the Central Plains in trouble.

262
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,319
We still don't know which side

263
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,210
Counselor-in-chief Liu Wei is on.

264
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,010
And he's quite close to Liu Yuan.

265
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,860
I'm worried that he'd get in the way

266
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,740
or trick the officials

267
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,380
into forcing His Majesty to step down.

268
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,340
We need someone who's

269
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,660
more influential than the Counselor-in-chief

270
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,120
to keep him under control.

271
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,630
This person has to be highly respected

272
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,540
and disinterested

273
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,220
so that he won't pose any threat to His Majesty.

274
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,020
Master,

275
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,480
I have a person in mind.

276
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,620
My uncle.

277
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,100
Aristocratic clans in the north are led by the Cuis.

278
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,860
Not to mention that my uncle

279
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,780
has served three generations of emperors

280
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,980
and enjoys high prestige.

281
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,100
The officials will listen to him.

282
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,420
But Grand Mentor Cui has resigned.

283
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,460
He may not be willing to return.

284
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,520
I'll go talk to him.

285
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,540
And my cousin will go with me.

286
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,700
My brother and I

287
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,420
will go back to

288
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,620
the Qinghe County regardless.

289
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,680
Let us give it a try.

290
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,170
I think it's worth trying.

291
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,900
Okay.

292
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,990
I'll let Xiaoyu see you off.

293
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Thank you, Master!

294
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,460
I'll go tell her.

295
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,100
What are you worried about, Your Highness?

296
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,940
This is the first time she's left the Western State

297
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,400
since she came to the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

298
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,880
She's going to the Cui's Mansion,

299
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,340
her own home.

300
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,580
I will do my best

301
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,900
to persuade my uncle.

302
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,340
Your Highness, rest assured.

303
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,620
I will talk my father into coming

304
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,300
even if I have to kneel and beg.

305
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,270
General.

306
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,100
It's cold at night.

307
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,560
Please go to sleep inside.

308
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,540
We didn't even have a piece of cloth

309
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,900
to block the wind when we were on the march before,

310
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,100
and we still made it.

311
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,700
We suffer 360 days a year.

312
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,580
You should at least rest for five days.

313
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,910
Otherwise, you'd be too hard on yourself.

314
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,660
It's okay.

315
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
You can leave now.

316
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,980
I'll watch him.

317
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,220
Yes.

318
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,500
Use an extra iron chain

319
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,340
and tie me on the shed.

320
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,950
You don't have to suffer because of me.

321
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
I'm just curious.

322
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,260
Why do you put yourself through this?

323
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,660
My master

324
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,260
didn't ask me to torture you.

325
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,260
Suit yourself.

326
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,620
I used to pave gravels

327
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,300
on the floor of my room.

328
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,500
When I reviewed the reports,

329
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,780
I'd walk on the gravels

330
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,540
back and forth barefoot

331
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,580
to get used to the rough feeling.

332
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,980
In that case, when I escape,

333
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,340
I can eat less, sleep on the straw mat,

334
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,260
and resist the coldness when there's no fire.

335
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,590
I trained myself to develop those habits.

336
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,220
Just to make your escape?

337
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,420
Yes,

338
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
and no.

339
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,100
I called him Father and was loved by him

340
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,340
for over 20 years,

341
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,620
but it turns out,

342
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,110
he's the one who killed my birth father

343
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,500
and slaughtered the people of my country.

344
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,300
My mother, bearing her hatred toward him,

345
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,260
was forced to marry him.

346
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,580
I'd never forgive myself

347
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,780
if I don't make myself suffer.

348
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,780
Master.

349
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,820
Lead an army of 30,000 soldiers tomorrow

350
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,020
and take him back to the capital city.

351
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Master, I thought

352
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,540
we'd decide

353
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,300
how to deal with him

354
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,140
after Prince of Guangling returns to the capital city.

355
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,800
Are you questioning my order?

356
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,700
I dare not!

357
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,940
Go ahead.

358
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,540
What are you doing?

359
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,700
Master asked me to stop you,

360
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,630
so we can hear their conversation.

361
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,740
You want to use me as an excuse

362
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,390
and deploy heavy forces in the Central State.

363
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,870
I've heard that you'd rebel

364
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,620
for over 10 years now.

365
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,600
And finally I'll get to see it.

366
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,980
Who told you that I'd rebel?

367
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,900
You won't?

368
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,540
Don't tell me you send out the troops

369
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,600
to the Central State just for a drill.

370
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,470
No. Just for escorting you.

371
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,420
Though I know Kung Fu,

372
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,420
I can hardly fight against 20 soldiers.

373
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,580
You need an army

374
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,660
of 30,000 soldiers to escort me?

375
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,140
Because

376
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,220
of your special identity.

377
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,420
No matter what, I'm your prisoner now.

378
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,500
I'm at your mercy.

379
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,660
You sent away the women in your mansion

380
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,180
and hid your son and daughter in a temple.

381
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,340
How did you know?

382
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,860
Emperor Xiao found them

383
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,620
and killed them.

384
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,880
But he regretted it right away

385
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,680
and gave them a proper burial.

386
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,060
He issued a decree

387
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,990
that you'll still be his son

388
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,980
as long as you get back.

389
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,140
I will never forgive him!

390
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,740
In fact, I do have another reason

391
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,300
to escort you back.

392
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,500
I can keep you alive

393
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,780
if you do what I say.

394
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,950
What do you want me to do?

395
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,380
Let this thing settle itself

396
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,340
and do not say a word.

397
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,030
What is Qinghe County like?

398
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,700
I haven't been home for so long.

399
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,960
I don't even remember.

400
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,220
I'd never stepped out of the house

401
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,420
since my father was gone,

402
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,510
until I left for the Western State.

403
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,300
I heard that the snacks there

404
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,220
are quite tasty,

405
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,260
and that they are always in high demand

406
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,620
on festivals.

407
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,660
When we finish our business,

408
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,180
I'll take you to try the snacks.

409
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,340
We can also bring some back

410
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,460
to other senior brothers and sisters.

411
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,820
Then I'll thank you in advance

412
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,060
on behalf of them!

413
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,860
You are very welcome!

414
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,220
Your Ladyship,

415
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,820
we'll cross the border soon.

416
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,180
[Residence of Cui]

417
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,340
Time really flies!

418
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,780
[Residence of Cui]

419
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,660
Young Master, Your Ladyship.

420
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,060
Please take a bath and change.

421
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,660
They are all waiting for you.

422
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:34,020
[Residence of Cui]

423
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:40,460
[Wende Hall]

424
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,420
Mother.

425
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,620
My daughter was recovered in the Western State?

426
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,260
Yes.

427
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,380
That's great!

428
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,220
Get up.

429
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,580
Though it's been a year,

430
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,640
Cui Feng hasn't changed a bit.

431
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,620
You made so many military exploits,

432
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,260
but you don't look like a fighter,

433
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,780
more like a scholar.

434
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,500
You stayed in the Western State for too long.

435
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,060
You forgot our family rules already, didn't you?

436
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,980
You were the last two

437
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,700
that arrived in the Qinghe County.

438
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,980
The clan leader asked about you many times.

439
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,380
We all dared not tell him.

440
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,660
Don't be mad.

441
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,220
The Western State is the furthest from here.

442
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,500
They were only a couple of days late.

443
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,060
It's no big deal.

444
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,300
But they came back the latest...

445
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,460
Fine.

446
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,620
Sister,

447
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,180
you always protect them.

448
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,540
Your uncle has been staying in the academy

449
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,900
and studying history.

450
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,860
When he has time

451
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
to see you,

452
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,340
you can go greet him.

453
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,580
In that case, I'll go

454
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,910
see my father by myself.

455
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,660
You need to go see him

456
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,920
at the academy as well.

457
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,880
What's the matter?

458
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,980
Mother,

459
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,660
we didn't come back this time

460
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,020
for the compilation of the history of Beichen.

461
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,540
We have something to talk to my uncle.

462
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,260
In another word,

463
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,060
we came bearing a secret letter from His Highness.

464
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,220
Father.

465
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,940
Shiyi.

466
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,580
I didn't get you into the palace.

467
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,580
I'm sorry.

468
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,780
I don't want to enter the palace.

469
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,790
And I don't blame you at all, uncle.

470
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:17,980
See,

471
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,020
the two people you care

472
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,500
about the most are home now.

473
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,030
Just be relieved and focus on getting better.

474
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,980
Aunt,

475
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,540
when did my father fall ill?

476
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,070
How come he never mentioned it in his letters?

477
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,300
For all these years, your father

478
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,060
appeared to lay low,

479
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,020
but actually he never stopped

480
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,420
fighting against Liu Yuan and Zhao Teng

481
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,740
in order to save people's lives.

482
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,340
Because of that,

483
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
he offended Zhao Teng and his people.

484
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,260
So,

485
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,670
he can't let people know that he's ill,

486
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,620
in case

487
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,740
our family will be in danger.

488
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,220
He's a well-respected veteran official.

489
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Liu Yuan wouldn't dare to touch him.

490
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,340
But

491
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,590
once something bad happens to him,

492
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,060
Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan will surely seek revenge

493
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,340
for the grudge they've been holding

494
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,020
and take it all out

495
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,900
on the descendants of the Cui family

496
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,740
Therefore,

497
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,060
we used the history compilation thing

498
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,900
as an excuse,

499
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,260
and asked you to resign or leave the army

500
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,520
so that you can come home for protection.

501
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,430
Even if your uncle passes away,

502
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,140
we can't

503
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,020
let people find out.

504
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,260
We have to keep it a secret as long as possible.

505
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,460
As soon as he's alive,

506
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,180
the Cui family will be safe.

507
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,460
Otherwise,

508
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,100
the Cui family will lose

509
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,150
its foothold in the court for sure.

510
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,580
And that's why your marriage arrangement

511
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,580
with the imperial family is more important than ever.

512
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,100
I understand.

513
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,820
What does

514
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,830
Jr. Prince of Nanchen want us to do?

515
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,360
My master didn't send us back.

516
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,220
It was our idea to come back.

517
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,300
My master has decided

518
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,660
to lead heavy forces to the Central State.

519
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,740
He'll get rid of those bad officials

520
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,500
and bring the court back on the track.

521
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,660
He'll do it by force?

522
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,220
My master said

523
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,150
any of his moves would spark rumors

524
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,220
about Prince of Nanchen

525
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,140
leading his troops invading the east,

526
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,540
and that would cause a big mess.

527
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,220
So,

528
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:26,940
he won't go

529
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,060
under the name of the Prince of Nanchen's army.

530
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,180
He'll find an excuse

531
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,840
and move the army to the Central State in secret.

532
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,780
That's a good idea.

533
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,860
Then what about Zhao Teng?

534
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,260
He's our primary target.

535
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,140
Prince of Guangling will offer help inside the palace

536
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,220
and deal with Zhao Teng,

537
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
while my master will deal with Liu Yuan

538
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,350
outside the palace.

539
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,140
So what does he

540
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,180
want us to do?

541
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,340
To keep the court in order

with uncle's prestige.

As long as my uncle is there,

544
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,020
even if Zhao Teng

545
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,340
and Liu Yuan are dead,

546
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,390
no one would dare say anything.

547

But we'll all die if we fail.

My master said

00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,830
His Majesty gave this to me.

554

that our Cui family has been

highly valued by the imperial family.

559

We should keep that in mind.

You are the only general in our Cui family.

I feel like I've let you down.

Our Cui family declined

We had nothing back then.

Later,

584
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,659
I became well-known for my scholarship,

585
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:21,100
and I was titled as Secretariat Director,

586
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,270
in charge of compiling the national history.

587
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,139
I was also appointed as Cavalier Attendant.

588
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:34,060
That's how I revived our Cui family.

589
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,699
And then I became the Grand Mentor

00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,540
If we can't win,

688
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,900
the generals should be beheaded

689
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,760
as punishment.

690
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,500
Judging by the palm force,

691
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,830
it must be General Feng.

692
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,540
You punk!

693
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,260
Your hearing is indeed good!

694
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,340
Master,

695
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,140
the Cui family's carriage

696
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,000
has passed through the city gate.

697
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,220
We'll set off

698
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,620
in one hour.

699
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:50,620
[Central State]

700
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,060
Stop!

701
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,100
General, where did you come from?

702
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,580
That's not a question

703
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,990
you're entitled to ask.

704
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,700
We are escorting a major criminal to the capital city

705
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
according to His Majesty's decree!

706
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,500
Forgive me, General!

707
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
General, please.

708
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,500
Feng Qiao is so bold.

709
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,300
She's holding a fake decree

710
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,780
as if it were real.
