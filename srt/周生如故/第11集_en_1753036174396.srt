1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Episode 4

60
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't move.

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Young Master Yang, let go of my senior sister.

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't come over.

63
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have only one request.

64
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Give me Liu Changshan.

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What do you want him to do?

66
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No need to ask.

67
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bring him to me.

68
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Bring the man here.

69
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,600
Yes. Yes.

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,140
Who wants to photo love?

71
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,800
Don't come

72
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,360
Young master

73
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,180
If I knew you are so heartless

74
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,700
I won't help you

75
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,040
Miss Cui

76
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,740
I save him for my own reasons

77
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,360
Don't move

78
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,560
You don't have to

79
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,040
He won't hurt anyone

80
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,800
General Yang, you came to save me?

81
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
Stop talking nonsense. Follow me.

82
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Prepare a carriage outside the city for me.

83
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Prepare the carriage.

84
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Yes.

85
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Miss, please forgive me.

86
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,000
You didn't get the five-storied-tree.

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
You should go to Wuzhou with me.

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's go.

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Your Highness, I won't hurt him.

90
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
You can follow me.

91
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
When we arrive at Nanxiao safely,

92
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
I will let him go.

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Young Master Yang,

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
if you dare to hurt him,

95
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
no matter it's in the south of Jiangsu,

96
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
or in the west of the desert,

97
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
or even in the hell,

98
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,400
I will personally kill you.

99
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Yang Jian,

100
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
I will kill you.

101
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I will kill you.

102
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I will kill you.

103
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I will kill you.

104
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I will kill you.

105
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I will kill you.

106
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I will kill you.

107
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I will kill you.

108
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I will kill you.

109
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
I will kill you.

110
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,400
Young Master Yang, you are too kind.

111
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

112
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Bring the carriage.

113
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Yes.

114
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
Your Highness, please think of a way.

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Nanxiao is your homeland.

116
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
It's okay to go to the south and the north.

117
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
But if someone finds out your identity in Nanxiao,

118
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
they will definitely make a big fuss.

119
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Are you talking nonsense?

120
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Zhao Ying,

121
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
all of you,

122
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,000
protect Master and Junior Sister secretly.

123
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes.

124
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,880
Get it placed.

125
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,400
Yes, yes.

126
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Yes.

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,900
All this while,

128
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,200
I have always been holding a sword.

129
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
My arms are about to break.

130
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't do that

131
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,620
Yang Zhen

132
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,020
Following Tangsuyi is not equal to

133
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,580
following Army

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,960
What?

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,260
Me?

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,900
Pelagic

137
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,800
Relax

138
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,900
You can think of it

139
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,460
Zhijie

140
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,260
You really finally find Yang Zhen

141
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,220
I have

142
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,660
a great 84 winning record

143
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Otherwise, why would a high-ranking king

144
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
risk his life to follow you to Nanxiao?

145
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
He is my master.

146
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
No matter what, he has you in his heart.

147
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Zhou Shengchen, Zhou Shengchen.

148
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
So,

149
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
you two are much worse than my sin of treason.

150
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Aren't you going to marry Prince Guangming?

151
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
The engagement has been canceled.

152
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
He is just my master.

153
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Tomorrow, you must tell me who you are.

154
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Otherwise, I can't protect you

155
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
even if you are caught and taken hostage.

156
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Eat some.

157
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Give it to my master.

158
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I only have one day.

159
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I can't bear to eat it.

160
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
He hasn't eaten anything for a day or a night.

161
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
You two can have a big meal in turn.

162
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
He can only be hungry.

163
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
If you don't give it to him,

164
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I won't eat either.

165
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I'll eat it.

166
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
You are really a master and a disciple.

167
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Your disciple will give you an egg.

168
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
I'll take both of these two boats.

169
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
This one.

170
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Give it to him.

171
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I'll take it.

172
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
My mother said

173
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
you must come back to Jiangling with me this time.

174
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
You must explain to them in person

175
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
about my sister's matter without permission.

176
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
If you can't explain it clearly,

177
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
she won't come back with you.

178
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Eat some.

179
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Eat.

180
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Eat.

181
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
The bandits are so trickery.

182
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
General, what should we do now?

183
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Call the soldiers to the river and make a private move.

184
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
In case they reveal the whereabouts,

185
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
we must be prepared to fight the national soldiers.

186
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Open the boat and follow her.

187
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,880
Go to Shouyang and tell General Cui

188
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,440
to prepare for the troops.

189
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,560
Yes.

190
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,800
Do you people in the north

191
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,080
like to run away?

192
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,400
Not really.

193
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
I don't blame your uncle for being so angry.

194
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,960
You must go back with him.

195
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,400
You can go to the next place and pray to the god.

196
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,240
You can thank your parents for raising you.

197
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
Then you can bring your wife back.

198
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,560
Okay.

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,200
But

200
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,400
that little lady always turns around.

201
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm afraid that you won't be too upset

202
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,240
if you go there.

203
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,440
As long as my daughter likes it,

204
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,840
I won't be too upset.

205
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,040
Can you see that she has me in her heart?

206
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,400
Since you were on the ship,

207
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,400
her eyes have never left you.

208
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,880
Who else can she have in her heart

209
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
except you?

210
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,480
She's back to Nanxiao.

211
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
I'll ask the lady to give me a life.

212
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,040
This is the military camp in the south.

213
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,080
Be careful.

214
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,320
Let's go.

215
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,680
Give me the military uniform.

216
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,960
Mr. Liang.

217
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,360
You brought me to Nanxiao

218
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,120
just for my military uniform.

219
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,560
I'll return the favor of the sword

220
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,400
and give you a life.

221
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,520
Take the news of the second prince Xiao Yan

222
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
and go to Nanxiao.

223
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,600
The crown prince is in a good mood.

224
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
He will definitely take you in.

225
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
Give me the military uniform.

226
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,520
I'll take all the rest of your scattered troops.

227
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,880
What are you doing?

228
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,480
I hate you the most for being so insolent.

229
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll kill you next time I see you.

230
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,680
I've got you into trouble.

231
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
Don't think too much.

232
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,400
If it weren't for this time,

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm afraid you wouldn't have had a chance to come here.

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,920
You're talking as if you were deliberately arranging it.

235
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,520
But to be honest,

236
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,080
I've really thought about it before.

237
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,880
One day, we will be united.

238
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,320
I'll bring you here.

239
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,080
Really?

240
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,320
Move aside.

241
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,480
Move aside.

242
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,640
Why are you sighing?

243
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,160
I just suddenly thought

244
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
that you've never fought with me in the south and north.

245
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm a little sorry.

246
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
We can do it in the future.

247
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes.

248
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
We can do it in the future.

249
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Come on.

250
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,800
I want to see your governor.

251
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,360
Hurry up.

252
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,480
Who are you?

253
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm Liu Changshan, the royal member of the northern city.

254
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,200
Take me to see your governor.

255
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,280
General, who's messing around here?

256
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,000
The king of the southern city is in the city.

257
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,760
Take me to see your governor.

258
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,240
Who are you talking about?

259
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,880
The king of the southern city, Zhou Shengchen.

260
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,840
Close the gate.

261
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,000
There's a horse carriage of Yang La.

262
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,720
Do people in Jiangling like to wander around?

263
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,320
It's not just Yang La's carriage.

264
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,360
There's a General Shen in Xian Song.

265
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,080
Every time he goes to court, he will make a strange carriage.

266
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,640
It's called Zhu Bi Wu Wei carriage.

267
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
The officials don't think it's strange.

268
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,800
They like this style.

269
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,640
Zhu Bi Wu Wei carriage?

270
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
Move aside.

271
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,320
Move aside.

272
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,280
Move aside.

273
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Move aside.

274
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Move aside.

275
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,960
What's wrong with the governor?

276
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,720
So many soldiers are not guarding.

277
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,880
Let me tell you.

278
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,360
The king of the southern city is in the city.

279
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,720
I don't know what happened.

280
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,120
Isn't this the Yi He of the north and south?

281
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,600
Yes, it's good.

282
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,960
Why did he come here?

283
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,480
Now the city gate is closed.

284
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
No one can enter or leave.

285
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,760
Let's go.

286
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,360
Let's go.

287
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Let's go home.

288
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,960
It seems that we have to stay for a few more days.

289
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,040
Don't you think of a way to send the message out of the city?

290
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
No hurry.

291
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,240
Where are we going now?

292
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,280
Find a place to stay first.

293
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,040
You are in the south and there is a place to stay.

294
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
An old friend is staying here.

295
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,040
It's really beautiful here.

296
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,040
Next to the river and the high mountain.

297
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,200
If we could reunite the Central Plains earlier,

298
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,640
the people in the south could see our ancient city, the Yellow Sand.

299
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,680
We can also see the high mountain and the water.

300
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,480
How nice it would be.

301
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,800
We still have to walk for half an hour.

302
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,080
Can you take it?

303
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,560
When my master is not here,

304
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
I often visit all the temples in the west.

305
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,440
I burn incense for the king's blessing.

306
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,720
So my foot strength is very good.

307
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,280
You can't call me master here.

308
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
It's dangerous to leave your identity.

309
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes, your majesty.

310
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
I see.

311
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,080
Are you going up the mountain?

312
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,120
Yes.

313
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,480
You have to walk faster.

314
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,480
The masters in the academy are not good-tempered.

315
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,360
They can't let people enter the temple after sunset.

316
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,840
You are not a good-tempered person.

317
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,760
But your wife is going to suffer.

318
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,280
Jinzhan.

319
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,840
What's up?

320
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,600
This is an souls-strolling coordinatory temple.

321
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,480
Really?

322
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,140
I like this place.

323
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,080
The mountain is holy.

324
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,920
The teachings are beautiful.

325
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
All the products are good.

326
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,080
Time and effort.

327
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,080
The mountains like the water likes the words people say

328
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Do you know how to go?

329
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
It's our teacher.

330
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
I don't have to look for it.

331
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
You can see it later.

332
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Teacher

333
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
Teacher

334
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Why did you come?

335
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
I'm here for a reason.

336
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
What is it?

337
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Go away.

338
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Go away.

339
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
I have to go to the library now.

340
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
I'm sorry.

341
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
I'm sorry.

345
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
I'm sorry.

346
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
I'm sorry.

347
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I thought I would never see you again.

351
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,880
I think this is Princess Nan Chen.

352
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
I...

353
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,880
She is my old friend's daughter.

354
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,280
Her name is Cui Shi Yi.

355
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,080
So you are my old friend's daughter.

358
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
Cui Shi.

359
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,280
The first official of the Beichen family.

360
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Nice to meet you.

361
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,480
This is Longkang Huan, Huan Yu.

362
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
My family often says that

363
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Longkang Huan

364
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,880
once had the beauty of the five emperors

365
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,480
of the three generations of the Jade Emperor.

366
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,280
I never thought...

367
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,480
Never thought

368
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,080
I could see the descendant of Longkang Huan again.

369
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Longkang Huan was killed by the Chao family.

371
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,680
The people who survived

372
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,280
are all happy.

373
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,680
They left for a foreign land.

374
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,080
It's a good ending.

375
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,280
But it's the ancestors' business.

376
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,480
Let's talk about the future.

377
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Do you know

378
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
my life

379
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,480
was saved by your fiance?

380
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,280
Not my fiance.

381
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,880
I was wrong again.

382
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,480
I shouldn't have been wrong.

383
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,480
We've been running for days.

384
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,680
We haven't had a good meal yet.

385
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Let's eat first.

386
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Let's eat first.

387
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,680
He hasn't said

388
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,080
how you saved him.

389
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,880
You still want him to stay here?

390
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
If we continue,

391
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
it's not just about the marriage.

392
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,880
This gentleman is good at everything.

393
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,480
He likes to talk nonsense.

394
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,480
Didn't you just praise

395
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,280
the three generations of the Jade Emperor

396
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,480
and the five emperors?

397
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Your friend

398
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,280
is right to praise.

399
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,680
Master hasn't had a good meal

400
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,480
these days.

401
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
You must eat more today.

402
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,680
Here.

403
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
I'll do it myself.

404
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
It seems that he's really hungry.

405
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,680
Here, your favorite.

406
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,480
I'll eat it.

407
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
Master, try this.

408
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
I've never seen it in Beichen.

409
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,680
This is bamboo shoots.

410
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
I'm an orphan.

411
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Is it good?

412
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
It's good.

413
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
It's good.

414
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
It's good.

415
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
It's good.

416
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,680
What's the relationship

417
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,280
between the two of your friends?

418
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
Look at their eyes.

419
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
What's there?

420
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,480
Eyes?

421
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,480
What can be in a clean room?

422
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Friendship.

423
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Then,

424
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,880
tonight, you sleep in the bedroom in the first room?

425
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
Of course.

426
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,880
You sleep in the first room?

427
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,280
The scholars

428
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,680
should be sensible.

429
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,880
If they don't say it,

430
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,080
don't tell them.

431
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,280
Go.

432
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,080
Wait.

433
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
But

434
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,680
you should be elegant.

435
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
I understand.

436
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,480
No one will pass by here.

437
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,680
Ming Ni.

438
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Taifu,

439
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,760
But I think

440
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,960
Nanxiao

441
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,400
dare not to make it difficult for you

442
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,920
but will send you back to Beichen safely.

443
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,600
Your Majesty.

444
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,040
Dingjiang building is already in peace.

445
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,320
From now on, Nanxiao will have no war.

446
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,680
The people will live and work in peace.

447
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,000
If you attack Nanxiao this time,

448
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,360
it will definitely cause a dispute between the two countries

449
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,600
and the war will not end.

450
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,640
If the war does not end,

451
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,360
the people of Nanxiao will also be caught in the fire.

452
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,480
You have a point.

453
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
There is only one room left.

454
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,360
Tonight, I will let you two suffer.

455
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,480
I remember when I came last time,

456
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,640
the room next door was also mine.

457
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,040
That one?

458
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,800
The one opposite to the one before.

459
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,160
It's absolutely clear.

460
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,600
It smells so good.

461
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,040
There are many evil bugs in the mountain.

462
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,120
It smells good at night.

463
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,440
It's not a bug.

464
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,400
The sands lotus also has this effect.

465
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,600
You are thoughtful.

466
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,040
One.

467
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
It's...

468
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Sorry.

469
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
It's okay.

470
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,880
My wife used to like to drag me around like this.

471
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,280
You two must be tired from the long journey.

472
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Rest early.

473
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,120
There are wild monkeys in the mountain.

474
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,920
Don't open the door at night.

475
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,160
There is only one bed here.

476
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
How do I sleep?

477
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I'll sleep on the floor.

478
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,480
You have not slept well all the way with me.

479
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,840
You should sleep on the bed.

480
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,360
Didn't you say that I am addicted to white bone soup?

481
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I can sleep on white bone.

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,240
Why can't I sleep on the floor?

483
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I know you are also sweet.

484
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,360
I've heard of the news.

485
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
First, Jiang Lin, second, Chai Sang.

486
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
This is a big trouble.

487
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Yang Shao, this bastard,

488
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
he actually knows to use this to contain us.

489
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Before we enter the cave, Jiang Lin has sealed the city. No one is allowed to enter or exit.

490
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
They have already started to search for Master and Junior Sister.

491
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Don't worry.

492
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
From what I know about your Master,

493
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,360
he is relaxing and enjoying the trip to Nan Xiao.

494
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,360
You said you don't have to worry for the whole night. Can't you think of something?

495
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
You take me as your military counselor?

496
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,360
After my father died, aren't you a military counselor?

497
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Jiang Lin's governor is a genius.

498
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
He was scared by the name of King of Nan City.

499
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
He only thought of searching for people at the gate of the city.

500
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
But what if he found someone?

501
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Kill him.

502
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
That will be a hopeless disaster for Jiang Lin City.

503
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
The people live well.

504
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
They are self-indulgent in war.

505
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
Stupid.

506
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
If it were you, what would you do?

507
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
If it were me,

508
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,360
I would pretend that this never happened and never heard of it.

509
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,360
I would open the gate and let His Highness come to me.

510
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
What if your father blames him?

511
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
There's nothing to be sorry about.

513
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Everyone in the world knows that he is my father.

514
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,360
The emperor of Nan Xiao must be looking forward to the officials to release His Highness in private.

515
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
The South and North have been in peace for a long time.

516
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,360
It's no good to offend His Highness at this moment.

517
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Now that it's so much,

518
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
the whole city knows.

519
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Who dares to open the door privately?

520
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
After all, the imperial doctor is the most difficult to figure out.

521
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
You guys are quite taciturn.

522
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,360
General Feng, why do you always look like the sky is going to fall?

523
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
My master is in the dark.

524
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
My master is in the dark.

525
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
He was locked in Jiangling City.

526
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
For me, the sky is going to fall.

527
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,360
It's them who should panic, not us.

528
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
After all, we have already suppressed the army.

529
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
They are all in the dark.

530
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
They sent soldiers to look for us everywhere.

531
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,360
In less than ten days, they will definitely find the Academy.

532
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
It won't take ten days.

533
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
They are too many soldiers.

534
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
It will take about three days to find them.

535
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Are we leaving then?

536
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
No need to leave.

537
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
The governor will receive a secret order.

538
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
You must not find me in Jiangling City.

539
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Because their emperor

540
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,360
doesn't want to fight with me because of such a small matter.

541
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
The world is full of problems.

542
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
Everyone is in a dilemma.

543
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Mister, what did you hear?

544
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
I didn't hear anything.

545
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
They heard everything you said.

546
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Go, go and knock on the door for Madam.

547
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Yes.

548
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
You go and knock on the door for Madam.

549
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
Yes.

550
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Go.

551
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Go.

552
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Go.

553
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,360
Tonight, there are many monkeys outside.

554
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Shu Tong and I are at the door to drive the monkeys away.

555
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
It's getting late.

556
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
My wife is waiting for me to go back to sleep.

557
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,360
I gave you the best cook.

558
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
You can't achieve your goal.

559
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
You are sorry.

560
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Are you secret all right?

561
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Then I'll be careful.

562
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
My wife will enjoy it.

563
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,600
I did not know if she took the body to the bathroom.

564
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,980
Do you believe it or not?

565
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:29,840
I

566
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,680
He is not a Korean.

567
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
He selection is pure Chinese.

568
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,900
Chinese?

569
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,860
He is a Chinese.

570
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,940
A family like that, once the light is gone,

571
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,860
all the ancient treasures, and the treasures of the boat

572
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,500
will become a source of hidden goods.

573
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,140
I've met a few families of this kind before.

574
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,060
They couldn't survive in the north.

575
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,700
So I sent soldiers to send them to cross the river.

576
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,700
I wish them a safe journey to the south.

577
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,340
There's a play in the west that's also a safe journey to the south.

578
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,460
Some families are safe to the south,

579
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,900
while some are left behind in the north.

580
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,140
The south and north of the Great Yan are all for survival.

581
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,460
Yes. Like the people we met, who fled from the south,

582
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,340
aren't they all for survival?

583
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,860
Yes.

584
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,180
It's been a long time since I've had such a free day.

585
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,220
Senior Brother and Senior Sister must be so anxious.

586
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,540
And you're saying it's free?

587
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,900
In the past, I was the one who worried about them every day.

588
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,620
Now, I should be the one to pay them back. They're worried about me.

589
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,020
You're a teacher, and you're still thinking about these?

590
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,740
Have you forgotten? Xiaoyu and Tian Xing are about the same age as me.

591
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,940
The other disciples are about the same age as me.

592
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,140
Even the monks say that.

593
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,220
Only the monks know how hard it is for me.

594
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,180
I know that too.

595
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,780
You... you did it on purpose.

596
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,180
What do you mean?

597
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,580
You lied to me on purpose.

598
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,380
Why would I lie to you on purpose?

599
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
I can't beat you.

600
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,180
Okay, go to sleep.

601
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Why aren't you sleeping?

602
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
I'm not sleeping.

603
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,980
Why aren't you sleeping on the bed, but on the floor?

604
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,180
It's not like I haven't slept.

605
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,780
The day you took me to see Jia Chen,

606
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,780
I slept in your study.

607
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,980
It was also on the floor.

608
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,980
That day, you used a fox skin to wrap me and took me home.

609
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,180
That fox skin is still in my room.

610
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,980
If you like it, I'll get you a new one.

611
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,580
I only like that one.

612
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,180
My girl.

613
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,040
Your Highness, you've been looking at the

614
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Why don't you like me?

615
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
You'd rather be a disciple of Zhou Shen Chen

616
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
than be my most noble consort.

617
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
As long as you're willing,

618
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
I can give up everything for you

619
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
and take you away from Zhong Zhu.

620
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Yes.

621
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
I don't understand these things.

622
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
But Your Highness, you can't

623
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
ignore your health.

624
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
You'd better take your medicine first.

625
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Put the medicine down.

626
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
You go down first.

627
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Yes.

628
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,000
The

629
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
They're all Han Men's children.

630
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
I heard that Cui Shi came to the academy.

631
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
He came to talk to you about Taoism.

632
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
You've been reading books since you were a child.

633
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Talk to them.

634
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
I'll go to the academy.

635
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
You may not understand everything.

636
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
People my age and Zhou Shen Chen

637
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
don't dare to say that they understand everything.

638
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
The number of books in the north is the number of Cui's.

639
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Many of the books you've read

640
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
I haven't even read them.

641
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
If you can tell them,

642
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
it will be of help to them.

643
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
If you say so, I'll go.

644
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
I'm not good at math.

645
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
I just take advantage of the many books in the house.

646
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
You just talk.

647
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Don't get too close.

648
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
Miss, please share your opinion.

649
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
We're not happy yet.

650
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Miss, please.

651
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
It's the first time I feel that

652
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
I'm not being used.

653
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
How do you feel?

654
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Pretty good.

655
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
You'll be like me in the future.

656
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
You're a big man.

657
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
What big man?

658
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
Good.

659
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Great.

660
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
You're reading books?

661
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
Yes.

662
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
Want to try?

663
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Try it.

664
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
Is the book accurate?

665
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
Change the person.

666
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
I'm the supervisor.

667
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
He's the chief.

668
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Who dares to say no?

669
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
He seems to like it here.

670
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
He rarely goes to crowded places.

671
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
I don't stay at the mansion for a long time.

672
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
For many years,

673
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,040
I've been his maid.

674
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
I've been with him in the library.

675
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
He's a poor man.

676
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
So impressive.

677
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
So impressive.

678
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
I've never seen him like this.

679
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Yes.

680
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
Did you see it?

681
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Who taught you?

682
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
The mansion is empty.

683
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
I'm not doing anything.

684
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
I'm just writing.

685
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
The accuracy looks good.

686
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
But the position of the bow should be changed.

687
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Come on.

688
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Ready.

689
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,040
The firefly in my heart.

690
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,040
There is a bright tree in the corner.

691
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,040
It's the starlight for you.

692
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
The bow in our academy

693
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
is sent by hunters.

694
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
It's not as good as the bow in your mansion.

695
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
I should have reminded you earlier.

696
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
I wouldn't have been able to pull the arrow.

697
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Do you need help with the wound?

698
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
No.

699
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
I can do it myself.

700
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
This medicine needs to be rubbed with palm.

701
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
Let go of the pain.

702
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,040
It's a pity that

703
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
our academy is full of scholars.

704
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
No one can help you.

705
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
Then,

706
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
can you ask the noble lady to help me?

707
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Brother Jiang.

708
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
You guys can go back to your work.

709
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
I won't bother you.

710
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
You can apply the medicine yourself.

711
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
After you put the white cloth on,

712
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
teach us.

713
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
I'm fine.

714
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
I'm fine.

715
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
I'm fine.

716
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Did I say something wrong just now?

717
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
You mean Mrs. Wan?

718
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
I don't know.

719
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm not sure.

720
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
I'm not sure.

721
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
I don't know.

722
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I don't know.

723
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
I don't know.

724
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
I don't know.

725
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
I don't know.

726
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,040
I'll find a chance to take you to her.

727
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,040
The End

728
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,040
The End

729
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,040
The End

730
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,040
The End

731
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,040
The End

732
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,040
The End
