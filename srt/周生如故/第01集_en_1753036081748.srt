1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh

3
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
Oh

4
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,260
Teach you

5
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:38,900
Do you know it?

6
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you know it?

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I hope you will have a good fortune next year.

8
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And you will be able to get married soon.

9
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Miss.

10
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Two months.

11
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Why hasn't the report come back yet?

12
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The road is rough, the fish are salty.

13
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The wine is open, the goods are scattered.

14
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The people are not taken care of, the cars are not chosen.

15
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The sky is clear, the waves are full of dust.

16
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is the West State you are in front of.

17
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The people are not taken care of, the cars are not chosen.

18
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The sky is clear, the waves are full of dust.

19
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is the West State you are in front of.

20
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I came to deliver the report.

21
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I heard that you didn't sleep well for more than ten days just to wait for him.

22
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Congratulations, Master.

23
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You won the whole game.

24
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was reading what Uncle Youshi said.

25
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The West State you are in front of, the West State you are in front of.

26
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wang Jun is back.

27
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The King of the West State

28
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This cup of Cui Shi

29
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I am the only female in the family.

30
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The rest of Da Du Yao Zhe Yu Qiang Bao Shi

31
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not born yet, but I was only given to the Crown Prince.

32
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Today is my wife's birthday.

33
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
The palace has brought gifts.

34
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Remember to give the gifts to the people who came to the palace.

35
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I understand.

36
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Father?

37
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Father, are you back?

38
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Father?

39
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Where is father?

40
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Mother?

41
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's time to go to practice.

42
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Third Madam.

43
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Clan Leader, he won't leave.

44
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He wants to see his daughter again.

45
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Where is father?

46
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He's not coming.

47
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Didn't mother say that father would come to the birthday banquet today?

48
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your father is not in the manor.

49
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
After Shiyi goes to bed, take her to see Shiyi.

50
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't delay it anymore.

51
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She has to leave tonight.

52
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The husband and wife are gone.

53
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
She's sick now.

54
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How can I bear to let her leave the Cui family?

55
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If it weren't for Your Majesty's blessing,

56
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I wouldn't have been able to live.

57
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If it weren't for Your Majesty's blessing,

59
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Shiyi and you would have been implicated.

60
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Third Madam, why are you still not awake?

61
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But he's my husband.

62
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He's innocent.

63
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sister, they offended Empress Gao.

64
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's the Gao family who controls the half of the country.

65
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If you can't bear it,

66
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
not only your mother and daughter,

67
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but the whole Cui family is implicated.

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But I'm his wife.

69
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're the third wife of the Cui family.

70
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The one you should protect is not your husband,

71
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but the Cui family.

72
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Father, I owe you.

73
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you know how to owe me,

74
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
then let me sleep tonight.

75
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know that father's illness is not yet cured.

76
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Shiyi is not sensible.

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Father, please don't blame him.

78
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Go and rest.

79
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You'll get better soon.

80
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll go and rest.

81
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Go and rest.

82
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You'll get better soon.

83
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Uncle has promised me

84
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that he'll take me to the birthday party when the snow stops.

85
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Then father can go with me.

86
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Lie down first.

87
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Go to sleep.

88
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Go to sleep.

89
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I found a place for you to hide.

90
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm a sinner's son.

91
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I have no regrets

92
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
for being able to have this couple.

93
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Qilang.

94
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Third wife, please help me.

95
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Qilang.

96
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're pregnant.

97
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's cold at night.

98
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Go back.

99
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I won't see you again.

100
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Mother, I'll go and greet father.

101
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Shiyi.

102
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Shiyi.

103
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Father.

104
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Father.

105
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Where is father?

106
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Mother, where is father?

107
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He said he would come back to rest last night.

108
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But why isn't he in the room?

109
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Where is father?

110
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Mother,

111
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
father is not here.

112
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Father is not here.

113
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Where is father?

114
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Shiyi,

115
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
your father...

116
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Your father has left.

117
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He left Qinghe County.

118
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He doesn't want you anymore.

119
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But don't be afraid.

120
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You still have mother and uncle.

121
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're still the daughter of Cui family.

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There won't be any change.

123
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
From now on,

124
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
here, in Qinghe County,

125
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
in Cui family,

126
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
no one will mention your father.

127
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can't mention him either.

128
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Shiyi.

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Shiyi.

130
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Father once said

131
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that snow was falling on the day I was born.

132
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Later, every time I was born,

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
it was a pity that it didn't snow.

134
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
On my 10th birthday,

135
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the snow finally came.

136
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But it took it away from me.

137
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Shiyi.

138
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Shiyi.

139
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's been half a year since you used the needle.

140
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Shiyi, why are you still so quiet?

141
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm incompetent.

142
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You are incompetent.

143
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You just made my daughter suffer.

144
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Please.

145
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Greetings, Grand Father.

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Zhao Changshi.

147
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
How are Concubine Qi and the Crown Prince?

148
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This is Concubine Qi's secret letter.

149
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I've been coming all the way here

150
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and working day and night.

151
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This letter has never left my side.

152
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Please.

154
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you have any other instructions?

155
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Please come in.

156
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Cui Shao.

157
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Get the carriage ready.

158
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Go to the capital.

159
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes.

160
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Chief, are we going to the palace now?

161
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Take a bath and change your clothes.

162
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Change into your uniform before you enter the palace.

163
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't let anyone find out anything suspicious.

164
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes.

165
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Go.

166
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Go.

167
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Go.

168
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Who else is in the palace?

169
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The King and the Empress's confidant, Qian Bing.

170
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
General.

171
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Grand Father.

172
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Please.

173
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

174
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Your Majesty has arrived.

175
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Your Majesty.

176
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The Yi family has arrived.

177
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Your Majesty.

178
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Your Majesty.

179
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Since His Majesty has already been demoted,

180
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
why hasn't the Crown Prince ascended the throne?

181
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We haven't informed the Empress yet.

182
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
How can we get on the throne so soon?

183
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
His Majesty has been demoted.

184
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If things go smoothly,

185
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
why should the Empress allow it?

186
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Grand Father, why are you so anxious?

187
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Can't we wait until dawn?

188
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The country cannot be without a ruler

189
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and wait until dawn.

190
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I can take the position of Grand Commandant.

191
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I will ascend the throne.

192
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Cui Guang, you...

193
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Qian Bing, I agree with Grand Father.

194
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Tonight, the Crown Prince must ascend the throne.

195
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You...

196
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You want to avoid the Empress.

197
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Zhao Changsheng.

198
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Bring the seal and the belt.

199
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Change the clothes for His Highness.

200
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You...

201
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Qi Zhenzhen!

202
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Qi Zhenzhen!

203
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
How dare you betray me and let the Crown Prince ascend the throne!

204
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You are so cruel, Qi Zhenzhen!

205
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Qi Zhenzhen!

206
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Come out with me!

207
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Long live the Emperor!

208
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Your Majesty.

209
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Your Majesty.

210
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Long live the Emperor!

211
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Long live the Emperor!

212
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Long live the Emperor!

213
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,180
Cheng notice

214
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:17,520
He Is

215
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,680
Though only she knows Lai Smith's heart.

216
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,520
Come

217
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,060
time.

218
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,840
Hopefully you pushed

219
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,680
Though,

220
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,040
the mic was weak today,

221
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,040
although the mic is on,

222
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,880
but still good.

223
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
It doesn't do anything,

224
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,040
so it can't reach Master Yi.

225
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,920
It's been 4 days since I searched village.

226
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Master Yi of theurs isTwenty melodra.

227
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,740
How dare you.

228
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,560
Please take the food out.

229
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,800
I know I'm not a good fit,

230
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,380
but I don't care.

231
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,040
If you didn't например,

232
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,540
ask your sister's back.

233
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,220
I'll get you physical która.

234
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,860
We must kill her first then.

235
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,840
berado que qué過來zu.

236
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
to the death.

237
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Congratulations, Your Highness, on your victory!

238
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Thank you for your time, Your Highness.

239
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Master, the soldiers are waiting for the celebration.

240
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Good.

241
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Sha Sheng, prepare the wine and light the fire.

242
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
Yes, Master.

243
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Your Highness, the weather is not good today.

244
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
Why don't you light the fire?

245
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Your Highness, I...

246
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,840
I came back with the cavalry.

247
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
The battle car and the infantry will be two hours late.

248
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
I...

249
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
Your Highness,

250
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
I'm sorry.

252
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Your Highness,

253
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
you came from Zhongzhou?

254
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
I came from the palace.

255
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,840
I reported to the capital a while ago.

256
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
I guess it's the imperial decree of the Shangshan Army.

257
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
I'm sorry.

258
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Wine...

259
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Light the fire and light the fire.

260
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Put the wine over there.

261
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Senior Sister.

262
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
Are you done?

263
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Let's go see Master.

264
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Okay, let's go.

265
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Your sword today is really amazing.

266
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
Go in.

267
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Wait a minute.

268
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Wait a minute before you go in.

269
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Wait a minute.

270
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Your Highness.

271
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Your Majesty,

272
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
the house is destroyed.

273
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
The house is destroyed?

274
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Your Majesty.

275
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Your Highness, you insist on going back?

276
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
It's my brother who raised me up.

277
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
If he leaves, I must leave.

278
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
But Your Highness, you made a vow.

279
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,840
You will never return to Zhongzhou and enter the palace.

280
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Now you are the new emperor.

281
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
You are leading the army to go there.

282
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Aren't you waiting for people to frame you and plot against you?

283
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
I have my own sense of propriety.

284
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
There are thousands of soldiers in the royal mansion.

285
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,840
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers outside the battle.

286
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
And the people outside the border.

287
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Tonight, I'll entrust it to the military.

288
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Your Highness, you can't.

289
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
I will return safely.

290
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Master.

291
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
The magic weapon camp is ready to leave at any time.

292
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
The magic weapon camp is ready to leave at any time.

293
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
The magic weapon camp is ready to leave at any time.

294
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
The magic weapon camp is ready to leave at any time.

295
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
You can order 3,000 cavalry to go to Zhongzhou with me.

296
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,840
We are going to Zhongzhou, not to go back to the Western State.

297
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Please think twice.

298
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Please think twice.

299
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Please think twice.

300
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I just went to see the late emperor for the last time.

301
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
It's not like I took over the country.

302
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
3,000 cavalry is enough.

303
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
Your Highness is right.

304
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
3,000 cavalry is enough.

305
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
I will go with you.

306
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Your Highness.

307
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
From the day he chased after you,

308
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
I made a promise.

309
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,840
If you win, I will win.

310
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
If you lose,

311
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
I will not live long enough.

312
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
If you want to go,

313
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
let's go together.

314
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Let's go.

315
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Let's go.

316
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Zhongzhou is the same.

317
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Who is going to enter the city gate?

318
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Why don't you get off the horse?

319
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
We are from the Western State.

320
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
We are from the Nancheng Mansion.

321
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
May I ask who this gentleman is?

322
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
This is King Nancheng.

323
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
I bow to King Nancheng.

324
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Has the late emperor left the capital?

325
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
The day after tomorrow.

326
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
Send the order to the palace.

327
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Tell them that I am back.

328
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
I won't enter the city gate.

329
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
Wait until the day after tomorrow.

330
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Send the late emperor out of the capital.

331
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Yes.

332
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Emperor, you cannot be afraid.

333
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
What?

334
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
He won't do anything blameless.

335
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Put down the Three zguts.

336
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Then what else should we be afraid of?

337
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,840
How can you rest by your matrimonial servant in the city?

338
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,840
How should we let him be outside the city?

339
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
Let him enter in the city.

340
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,120
to force him to enter the city.

341
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,600
The late emperor died suddenly.

342
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Everyone in the clan has doubts.

343
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,520
If even Zhou Shengchen is unwilling to enter the palace,

344
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,880
he will be heavily suspected.

345
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
Since he's here,

346
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,680
why not let him face the crowd

347
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,280
and force him to support His Majesty in the palace?

348
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,240
If he enters the palace,

349
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,160
he will be able to calm the people's hearts.

350
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,760
What if he refuses to come?

351
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,720
If he refuses to enter the palace,

352
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,240
he will be a part of the rebellion.

353
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,280
If he does so, he will be a target.

354
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,200
Even if His Majesty can't do anything today,

355
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,200
he will have a reason to punish him in the future.

356
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,920
In short,

357
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,880
whether he comes or not

358
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,600
is a good thing for His Majesty.

359
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,480
His Majesty refused to enter the palace.

360
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,520
I beg Your Highness

361
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
No!

362
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Master, you can't go in.

363
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Yes, they only let you in.

364
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
If there's an ambush, we can't save them.

365
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
You're sending the late emperor out of the forest.

366
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
Not to kill.

367
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

368
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
All rise.

369
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

370
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Everyone, the King of Lan City is in the middle of the battle.

371
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,520
Everyone, the King of Lan City is outside the city of Zhongzhou.

372
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,520
His Majesty is young, the country is unstable, and the court is unstable.

373
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,520
The people who guard the army are returning to the capital at this moment.

374
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Yes.

375
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,520
I can see the fear and suspicions in your hearts.

376
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Because I'm afraid too.

377
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
How many soldiers did he bring?

378
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Three thousand.

379
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Only three thousand?

380
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
I've sent an oral order to let him enter the palace.

381
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Let's wait and see if he can enter Tai Chi Hall and help His Majesty.

382
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
Wait here.

383
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
Master.

384
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
I'm here in Tai Chi Hall.

385
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,520
I swear to God from today on.

386
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,520
I'm willing to give up my royal surname and stay in the Western Zhou.

387
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,520
From now on, I won't enter Zhongzhou again.

388
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Thank you.

389
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
He's here.

390
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Your Majesty, he's here.

391
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Your Majesty.

392
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Brother, the six levels are not in the world.

393
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I can only be in the palace without being lost.

394
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
Your Highness, please take off your sword.

395
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Your Majesty.

396
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,520
I, Zhou Shengchen, bow to Your Majesty.

397
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
Uncle, please rise.

398
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

399
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
I forced you to break your oath today.

400
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
It's not my intention.

401
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
It's just because the rumors in the room...

402
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
Rumors in the room?

403
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I have the intention to rebel.

404
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
So you summoned me into the palace...

405
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,520
to show your sincerity to the court.

406
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

407
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,520
You can control the situation and keep me safe.

408
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
You don't have to.

409
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
You are the emperor, I am the subject.

410
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
How can I lose?

411
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,520
For the sake of the world, what can you do?

412
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Since your oath has been broken,

413
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,520
are you willing to stay in Zhongzhou and assist His Majesty?

414
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
No.

415
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
I've been away from Zhongzhou for a long time,

416
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
so I'm not willing to come back.

417
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
It's still the Western Zhou that suits me.

418
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
I'm sorry.

419
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,520
I've been troubled by rumors for many years.

420
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Today, I want to end it.

421
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,520
I'll treat it as a gift to His Majesty.

422
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
How to end it?

423
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,520
I'll stand here and guard the border for the rest of my life.

424
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,520
I won't marry my wife and keep my child.

425
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
Since I have no children,

426
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,520
there is no reason to fight against the rebels.

427
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,520
In this way, His Majesty can be at ease,

428
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
and all the ministers can be at ease.

429
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,520
I don't have to be troubled by rumors.

430
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Is this true?

431
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Yes.

432
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Your Highness is wise and righteous.

433
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Your Highness is wise and righteous.

434
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
But we...

435
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
I'm afraid to fight with you.

436
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,520
It's not bad to have this opportunity.

437
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,520
We can have a draw.

438
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,520
The name of the King of Nanchen is famous.

439
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,520
I dare not fight with you.

440
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Your Highness, I have a request.

441
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Please say it.

442
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,520
There is a woman named Shiyi.

443
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,520
The former king granted her marriage to the royal family.

444
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,520
I wonder if you would like to take her as your disciple.

445
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
If so,

446
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,520
the royal family, the Cui family, and the King of Nanchen

447
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,520
will be more close to each other because of this relationship.

448
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
That's good.

449
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
They will be closer.

450
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
I am so generous

451
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,520
to eliminate the gap between the Cui family and the King of Nanchen.

452
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,520
I can't ask for your permission.

453
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Thank you for your permission.

454
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Congratulations, Your Highness.

455
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
You have a good intention.

456
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Congratulations, Grand Tutor.

457
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,520
I will be in Nancheng soon.

458
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,520
In the past few years,

459
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
the whole mansion is armed.

460
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,520
No one can take care of the old and young.

461
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,520
After the battle of Jiangsu,

462
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
send her to Xizhou.

463
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
It's a deal.

464
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
The world is full of beauty.

465
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
The sword is like a horse.

466
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
The snake is like a snake.

467
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,520
The story is like a firefly.

468
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,520
The city is cold and the snow is cold.

469
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,520
The love is like a flower.

470
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,520
The water is like a flower.

471
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,520
The moon is like a flower.

472
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,520
The love is like a flower.

473
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
The sword is like a horse.

474
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
The snake is like a snake.

475
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,520
The story is like a firefly.

476
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,520
The city is cold and the snow is cold.

477
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,520
The story is like a flower.

478
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,520
The love is like a flower.

479
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,520
The story is like a flower.

480
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,520
The love is like a flower.
