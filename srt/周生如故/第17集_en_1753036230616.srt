1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,340
Naomi exit

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I never had any past.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I just want to stay in XiZhou and be with him.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The famous Wang family and the royal family are watching you.

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
For him, not for us.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You must leave.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Master ordered me to escort you to ZhongZhou safely.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Where is master?

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You will see him when you leave the city.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's go.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The King of NanChen is guarding XiZhou.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I am the King of NanChen.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
These are the King of NanChen guarding XiZhou.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You really don't want to see him off in person?

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's because the Emperor's decree is too urgent.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He can't be alone for a day.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If he can live until the spring comes,

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and wait until the flowers bloom,

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
wouldn't that be better?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The King of NanChen is sending you off.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He is telling the world that the King of NanChen is always your backer.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I am sorry.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I just wanted to say that I am sorry.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I am sorry.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I am sorry.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I am sorry.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I am sorry.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I am sorry.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I am sorry.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I am sorry.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I am sorry.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I am sorry.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I am sorry.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I am sorry.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I am sorry.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I am sorry.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I am sorry.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I am sorry.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I am sorry.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I am sorry.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I am sorry.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I still remember the stars in the sky.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can see your every shadow.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am still thinking about you.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I am still thinking about you.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I am still thinking about you.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I am still thinking about you.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I am still thinking about you.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When everything is quiet and peaceful, I can see the voice of the moon.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You are destined to be.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The epidemic in Guangli is hard to get rid of.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't take you to the city tomorrow.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please forgive me.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's okay.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
When are you going to enter the city tomorrow?

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
At noon.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's snowing.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When did it start?

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Just now.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It started early this year.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But it looks like it's going to rain.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It won't be long.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It just started.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Have you slept?

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I remember that it was snowing in Chuxi.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They all said that Master couldn't come back.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I only think that he can come back.

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are finally back.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Look, I bought you a lot of delicious food.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How is it? Do you miss me?

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What's wrong?

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you not feeling well?

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's okay. It's probably too cold.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, it's so cold. Why are you wearing so little?

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wear more later, okay?

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Tonight, I'm going to live at the gate of the city.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to Chuxi with the soldiers.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's go together.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's go together.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't want to move.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's okay. I'll carry you out.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We can take the carriage. You don't have to walk by yourself.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's too crowded. It's like the New Year.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The palace is too quiet.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I want to wait for Master to come back.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You want to wait for His Highness?

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There have always been reports of a disaster in the past half year.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But Master never returned to Xi State.

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
From the beginning of the summer to the end of the autumn,

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and today, it's Chuxi night.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I guess he should be back.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If he doesn't come back to the palace,

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you'll have to guard the palace by yourself.

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes, no one can guard the palace.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, I'll leave a few soldiers here.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If there's anything, let them come to me anytime.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll be waiting for you.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Your Highness.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's Chuxi night tonight. Bring the wine.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Are you with yourself?

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I didn't expect to have hot tea when I entered the palace.

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It seems that there will be many lucky people next year.

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Your Highness, the lady said that

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
once the tea is warm, you have to change to hot soup immediately.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Because she knows that you will come back.

112
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I guessed that you were waiting for me.

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So I came back alone at the fastest speed.

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The others can't catch up with me.

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Master, you rode a thousand miles.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Ordinary people can't catch up with you.

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But it's good.

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Tonight, we'll spend the night quietly.

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When your brothers and sisters come back tomorrow morning,

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
we'll spend the night in a lively way.

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Master, you're drinking wine for the first time.

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Is there any good news?

123
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Chuxi night, drink a cup of wine with your family.

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then we can start to celebrate.

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Here, eat.

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The sun is about to rise. Where are you going?

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I want to talk to my senior sister.

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Go ahead.

129
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's hard for people who want to see the prince's man after the wedding.

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll stop you when the third lady asks.

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay.

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll go with you.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll go with you.

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll go with you.

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'll go with you.

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll go with you.

137
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll go with you.

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Miss.

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm here to see my senior sister.

140
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This...

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're looking for Fengqiao?

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
She's not in this room.

143
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Have you been here all the way?

144
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes.

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll escort you to the city first.

146
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Then I'll take the Grand Tutor back to Xizhou.

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll light the lamp.

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No need.

149
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't think I'm right.

150
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why are you always next to me, but never see me?

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm afraid you'll be sad.

152
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
How do you and I get along?

153
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you want to write, how do you write?

154
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
How do you and I get along?

155
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The moon is long, flowers are in the air.

156
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
How to stop it?

157
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's something I didn't want to say.

158
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
When I left the mansion, I held back.

159
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
When I came back from the prison,

160
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I wrote a letter to my mother.

161
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I wrote in the letter,

162
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I want to learn how to write in the capital.

163
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Then I can stay in the mansion and be with you.

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I want to stay in Xizhou.

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like my senior brothers and sisters.

166
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I will never leave.

167
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I will be your family.

168
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I will be your family.

169
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The snow is falling.

170
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
My mother said,

171
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If there is no marriage,

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
she will accept me and let me stay in Xizhou.

173
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Just one step away.

174
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Just one step away.

175
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can stay in the mansion.

176
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It doesn't matter where you are.

177
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's still the same as before.

178
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You wait for the storm to come, I'll wait for the storm to come.

179
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But this time,

180
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
this time the battle will take a little longer.

181
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But I promise you,

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
we will meet again.

183
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I can stay in the mansion.

184
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I can stay in the mansion.

185
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I can stay in the mansion.

186
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I can live in the mansion.

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't come back.

188
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay.

189
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I won't come.

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Why are you crying like this?

191
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you reluctant to part with me?

192
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
It's almost dawn.

193
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Go back.

194
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Everyone is here.

195
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
But they are in different places.

196
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
They will meet one day.

197
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Senior.

199
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The person who killed Xiao Nan is in Zhongzhou.

200
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He didn't die.

201
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He was forced to leave.

202
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This Tai Fu just came back and died a few years ago.

203
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You should be quiet.

204
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The one on the right is Cui's daughter who is about to enter the city.

205
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
She is also his disciple.

206
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If people in the palace hear this, they will be unhappy.

207
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Senior is leaving for the city.

208
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's the day of the 11th entry.

209
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's time to say goodbye.

210
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Anyway,

211
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I hope you can get married.

212
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Soldiers.

213
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Goodbye.

214
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Where is Master?

215
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Master is here.

216
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What time is it?

217
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Your Highness, it's 13 o'clock.

218
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You have entered the city.

219
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
When Meng Luan comes back, tell him that I'm going out of the palace.

220
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Miss Jian Cui.

221
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Your Highness, I heard that there is a wedding in the Eastern Palace.

222
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So I brought a gift.

223
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Please.

224
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes.

225
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What gift is it?

226
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's a trick.

227
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What you say is important.

228
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm afraid you forgot the promise between you and me.

229
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Today I will be loyal to you.

230
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I will be faithful to you.

231
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I will be faithful to you.

232
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I will be faithful to you.

233
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I will be faithful to you.

234
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I will be faithful to you.

235
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Today I will be loyal to you.

236
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And you will leave the second position to me.

237
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
How could I?

238
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You are my biggest will.

239
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Then why did you ask for marriage?

240
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Cui family.

241
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
His Majesty ascended the throne at the age of six.

242
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Cui family is dependent on Cui Guang.

243
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Cui family is the center of the people's heart.

244
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Know and learn from the heart.

245
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't care how many reasons you have.

246
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
For this reason, the second position can only be Jin's.

247
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I never care.

248
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
They say you Jin's rich can conquer the country.

249
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The legend is true.

250
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
All the war horses used by the late emperor are from Jin's.

251
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Your Majesty.

252
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The horses on the hillside of Taiyuan County are all in different colors.

253
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You can't see such a view elsewhere.

254
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Come.

255
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Tell Meng Luan that I am not feeling well.

256
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I won't go to Cui's mansion.

257
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes.

258
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I will go.

259
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Miss Cui.

260
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
His Highness wanted to see you.

261
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But he is not feeling well.

262
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He can't go out of the palace.

263
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Please forgive him.

264
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's okay.

265
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I will leave now.

266
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Are you afraid of seeing Prince Guangling again?

267
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Are you afraid that you will leave without saying goodbye?

268
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Last time?

269
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Not for this.

270
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Then why did I see you so happy when you didn't see me?

271
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I just came to Zhongzhou.

272
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I am not used to it.

273
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Meng Yi said he wanted to see him.

274
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He was afraid that he would say something wrong.

275
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He will be fine in a few days.

276
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I will go.

277
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Cui Shiyi, daughter of Cui family, kowtows to Your Highness.

278
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I saw you last time.

279
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It was the year Cui's death.

280
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You are so professional.

281
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Get up.

282
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

283
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Prince Guangling is very affectionate to Miss Cui.

284
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He was the one who sincerely touched me and begged me to marry him.

285
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Speaking of which, you two are very distant.

286
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You can't be separated.

287
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Xinhua, Cui Shiyi, come with me.

288
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I will go with you.

289
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

290
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Although I am in the palace,

291
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I heard that you and your uncle went to Nanxiao to study in Longkang Academy.

292
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You are very knowledgeable.

293
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It was just a coincidence that I gave my master's old friend.

294
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I am afraid that you will be very sad.

295
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Why don't you want to look at me?

296
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Your Highness.

297
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Your Highness, you were still in a high fever last night.

298
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I heard that you went to the palace today and came to see you.

299
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Miss, you should talk to His Highness more.

300
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
He will be happier.

301
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Please take care of yourself.

302
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Be careful, Your Highness.

303
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I...

304
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I am not feeling well.

305
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I want to go back to my mansion.

306
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You have a body.

307
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You don't even have a sense of direction when you walk.

308
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You have the first child of Cui and Qishi.

309
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's not just your own child.

310
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Xinhua is wrong.

311
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Does Cui Feng know about this?

312
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
General, it's not worth it.

313
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Then how are you going to explain to Cui, Qishi and your husband?

314
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Do you think that only the Empress Dowager will not forgive you?

315
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Our Cui family can let you do whatever you want.

316
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Xinhua is willing to be the King of Jing.

317
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
She will be the King of Jing.

318
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
She will be the King of Jing.

319
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
She will be the King of Jing.

320
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You are the one who is going to do whatever you want.

321
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Xinhua is willing to be the King of Jing.

322
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Please calm down, Your Highness.

323
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Xinhua, you lied to me.

324
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You lied to my husband.

325
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Do you feel guilty?

326
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I have already divorced from General.

327
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He knows, I know.

328
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Both of us are in pain.

329
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Shiyi,

330
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
send a letter to your brother to return to the capital.

331
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yes.

332
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Master.

333
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I have a message.

334
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The Grand Preceptor is indeed ill.

335
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You send the Grand Preceptor back to Xizhou first.

336
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I will go to Shouyang.

337
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The world is peaceful there.

338
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
How did Master suddenly go there?

339
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The Grand Preceptor has left.

340
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The power in the capital is not in balance.

341
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Something must happen within two months.

342
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Our closest army horse to the capital is in Shouyang.

343
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You can observe the changes in the capital there.

344
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Go.

345
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The Central State is really hot.

346
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I will take you to Xizhou if I have a chance.

347
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's even hotter.

348
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Aunt.

349
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I rushed back as soon as I received your letter.

350
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I dared not delay it for a moment.

351
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Actually, my mother asked you to come back.

352
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because all the letters sent out of Zhongzhou are going to be disassembled.

353
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That's why I wrote that letter.

354
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What's the matter?

355
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You can't say it in the letter.

356
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Pour your brother a cup of tea first.

357
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let your sister tell you.

359
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Aunt, it's rare.

360
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What happened?

361
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Sister-in-law is not pregnant.

362
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Mother found it by accident.

363
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Everything is sister-in-law's lie.

364
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Brother San.

365
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That's great.

366
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's great?

367
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So I don't feel guilty to her.

368
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't feel guilty to Cui.

369
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You don't know that I...

370
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Anyway, it's true.

371
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
This is the best news I've ever heard.

372
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
What happened between you and the princess?

373
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Why did she lie to you and lie to us?

374
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's the past.

375
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Don't ask.

376
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Before today, I still feel guilty to her.

377
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And after today, I can really do nothing wrong.

378
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Do you want to divorce?

379
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The princess said you two had already divorced.

380
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Aunt won't agree.

381
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
My marriage with the princess is not between us.

382
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's too much.

383
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'll help you convince mother.

384
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I want to try for you.

385
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Divorce?

386
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't want to see brother San suffer like this.

387
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You saw it with your own eyes.

388
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
How did Cui's dance house make it difficult for us?

389
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Your brother is the prince consort.

390
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They dare to do this.

391
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
If there is no marriage with the seven-sister-in-law,

392
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Cui Zhen will not let us go.

393
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm here.

394
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I was the one who was married at first.

395
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Because my engagement was canceled,

396
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Uncle asked my brother to be the consort.

397
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Since I still want to marry,

398
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
between me and my brother,

399
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
why can't I have a free person?

400
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Please help me convince my brother.

401
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Mother.

402
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Mother agreed.

403
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I know you don't want to.

404
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So I want to convince your brother.

405
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I can see it.

406
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So I'll convince you.

407
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Thank you, third sister.

408
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Thank you, aunt.

409
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Feng, go back to Taiyuan County.

410
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Xinhua stays here.

411
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
This matter concerns our three tribes.

412
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I have to think of a thorough way.

413
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes.

414
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yes.

415
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Why is there no news from Jiangping?

416
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What did the imperial doctor say?

417
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The imperial doctor said it's going to be soon.

418
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
In these two days.

419
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Two days?

420
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I've been waiting for more than ten days.

421
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
His Majesty hasn't shown up for a long time.

422
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
If this continues,

423
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
the dukes will lose their chance.

424
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm afraid the dukes will lose their chance.

425
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm afraid the dukes will lose their chance.

426
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The dukes will lose their chance.

427
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The dukes will lose their chance.

428
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
If they suspect,

429
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
it will be troublesome.

430
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Especially the king of Nanchen.

431
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And general Jinrong,

432
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
who is the closest to Xizhou.

433
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We can't wait any longer.

434
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Go.

435
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Let the imperial doctor prescribe a medicine.

436
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I want to see my grandson in three days.

437
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yes.

438
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This is...

439
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Cui Shengyao.

440
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Does this medicine have any harm

441
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
to their mother and son?

442
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I hope the prince will be born soon.

443
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm asking

444
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
if it has any harm to their mother and son.

445
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm asking if it has any harm to their mother and son.

446
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm asking if it has any harm to their mother and son.

447
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm asking if it has any harm to their mother and son.

448
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
This...

449
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This...

450
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
My grandson

451
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
will be born when he wants to.

452
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Your Majesty, please.

453
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Get out. All of you.

454
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Get out.

455
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Why are you kneeling?

456
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Get up.

457
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The imperial doctor said

458
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
once the mother has a grandson,

459
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
she will ask for your life.

460
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm begging you.

461
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Please give me my life.

462
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Please give me my life.

463
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You want me to give you my life?

464
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I want you and my child to die.

465
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I want you and my child to die.

466
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I want you and my child to die.

467
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's impossible.

468
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I will never do that.

469
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I would rather die

470
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
than do that.

471
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm begging you.

472
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But I'm weak.

473
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Your Majesty.

474
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Where is the hairpin the imperial doctor gave you?

475
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Your Majesty.

476
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
This is the crown prince's

477
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
return gift.

478
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Your Majesty.

479
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The crown prince is right.

480
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The mother and son

481
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
will have a fight.

482
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I have to bear it

483
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and hurt the crown prince

484
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and you and me.

485
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I can't take her as my mother.

486
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Your Majesty.

487
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Send Jin Yan.

488
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Your Majesty.

489
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I want to see my mother.

490
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I

491
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
was always blinded by the bitch.

492
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
First, it was Zhao Teng.

493
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Second, it was Xie Chong.

494
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I know I was wrong.

495
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Please give me another chance.

496
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Give me another chance.

497
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Look at me.

498
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm not a woman.

499
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
How do you want me

500
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
to believe you?

501
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I

502
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
want to quit the throne.

503
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You are young

504
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and suddenly quit the throne.

505
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
How can you make the court

506
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
believe you?

507
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I don't believe you.

508
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I have been

509
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
blinded by them for a long time.

510
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Just like you.

511
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I have been involved in the court

512
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and supported the Qishi clan.

513
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I have been the leader of the nobility

514
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and raised the male-loving.

515
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Half of the

516
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
secrets in your hands

517
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
are the ones

518
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
that you killed.

519
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
They made me.

520
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You think I don't know?

521
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I am guilty.

522
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I will

523
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
punish them in the future.

524
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Chang Wanshan,

525
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I want to

526
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
have dinner with you.

527
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes.

528
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I will

529
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
have dinner with you.

530
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yes.

531
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Why don't you have wine?

532
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Your highness,

533
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
the doctor said

534
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
we need wine this month.

535
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Your highness,

536
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I haven't had dinner with you

537
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
for a long time.

538
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's okay.

539
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Bring me wine.

540
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yes.

541
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I will pour wine for you.

542
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I will pour wine for you.

543
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I will pour wine for you.

544
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I will pour wine for you.

545
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Come.

546
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Sit down.

547
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You and I

548
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
have been divorced

549
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
since Zhao Teng.

550
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Mother,

551
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
are you still blaming me for what happened?

552
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
No.

553
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I just

554
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
don't understand you.

555
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You and I

556
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
are biological mother and son.

557
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Why do you always

558
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
believe in others

559
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
and trust me?

560
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Your grandfather

561
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
is a good man.

562
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The empress dowager listens to the government.

563
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
They are very close.

564
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Why can't they?

565
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You and I are biological mother and son.

566
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Why can't they?

567
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
These years,

568
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
mother used all kinds of methods

569
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
to take care of the family.

570
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I didn't know what to do.

571
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But after Zhao Teng's death,

572
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I didn't want to

573
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
be involved in mother's private affairs.

574
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But mother

575
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
used the country to enjoy

576
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
and the family was more important.

577
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I don't know

578
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
what to do.

579
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I can't leave it alone.

580
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Hui,

581
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
if it wasn't for me,

582
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
you would have died.

583
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
If it wasn't for the family,

584
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I wouldn't be here.

585
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I wouldn't be here.

586
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You told your uncles

587
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
to be more impudent.

588
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What can you do?

589
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I

590
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
don't want to let others down.

591
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You don't want to let others down.

592
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Come.

593
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Why don't you drink?

594
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Why don't you drink?

595
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Are you afraid

596
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'll poison you?

597
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Drink.

598
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I didn't poison you.

599
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I can't bear to leave you.

600
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You are my biological son.

601
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm more

602
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
afraid of you.

603
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm afraid of you.

604
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm afraid of you.

605
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Dream, who are you here for?

606
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The heart is a stage.

607
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The heart is a stage.

608
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I can't love.

609
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
The heart is too open.

610
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The reliance of the yearning.

611
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
The pain is so hard.

612
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The pain is so hard.

613
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
The pain is so hard.

614
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The pain is so hard.

615
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The pain is so hard.

616
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The pain is so hard.

617
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The pain is so hard.

618
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I can't bear to leave you.

619
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I can't love.

620
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The pain is so hard.

621
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The pain is so hard.

622
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The pain is so hard.

623
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The pain is so hard.

624
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
The pain is so hard.

625
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
The pain is so hard.

626
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The pain is so hard.

627
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The pain is so hard.

628
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The pain is so hard.

629
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The pain is so hard.

630
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The pain is so hard.

631
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The pain is so hard.

632
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The pain is so hard.

633
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
The pain is so hard.

634
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
The pain is so hard.

635
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,080
The warm scent of honey meditation.

636
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,940
The love of my beloved.

637
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:05,140
Dziękuję
