4
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,440
Well.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
You're the only one

6
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,640
that makes me concede defeat.

7
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,080
Do you have any unfulfilled wish?

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
I've been arrogating power in court for years

9
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,520
and I've enjoyed the dignity as an emperor.

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
I have no pities.

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Is there any family member

12
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,840
you need me to take care of?

13
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,240
I have a son.

14
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,960
I'll have him escorted back to Pingcheng

15
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,680
so that he can escape this misfortune.

16
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,240
Before His Majesty was born,

17
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,200
the late emperor had an eldest son

18
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,160
who wasn't born to the empress.

19
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,640
But he died at three.

20
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,800
In order to find the truth out,

21
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,520
I offended Empress Gao.

22
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
But Liu Yuan begged for leniency

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,960
and saved me.

24
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
In my childhood,

25
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,400
I was on good terms

26
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,640
with Liu Yuan.

27
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,240
That's why you buried wine together?

28
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah.

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,280
Then,

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,280
have you ever buried some wine with any woman?

31
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,400
What do you mean?

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,840
Nothing.

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,440
You walked on every inch here

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,880
in your childhood?

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah.

36
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,000
Zhousheng Chen.

37
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,120
It doesn't matter.

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm just not used to

40
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,920
hearing you

41
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,800
call me by my name.

42
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,060
Your family is in the Western State

43
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,030
and you will live in the Western State later.

44
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,320
You just said

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
it's enough for you to have ten orphans

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
and one disciple

47
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,240
in your mansion.

48
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,640
Yeah, it's enough.

49
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Miss Cui,

50
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,900
The Prince of Guangling

51
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,900
is waiting for you outside the hall.

52
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm going to ask him back.

53
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,040
My bedding hall

54
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,120
is also in the imperial palace.

55
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,720
How can you stop the Prince of Guangling?

56
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,040
Ask him in.

57
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,980
Yes.

58
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,780
Wait.

59
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,020
I don't feel well.

60
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,260
I'm afraid I can't deal with him if he comes in.

61
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,940
If so, we can only ask him to go back.

62
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,900
Yes.

63
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,420
What's wrong?

64
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,820
I'll be better after having a rest.

65
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,220
Your Highness,

66
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,060
she is...

67
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,300
Advisor Xie,

68
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,580
summon an imperial doctor.

69
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,620
Your Highness, can't you

70
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,690
feel her pulse?

71
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,940
I'm unfamiliar with it

72
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,010
as I haven't done this for long.

73
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
Let me do it.

74
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,400
It's more reliable

75
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
to summon an imperial doctor.

76
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,270
Your Highness, you know

77
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,120
my medical skills.

78
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,860
I can...

79
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,540
OK.

80
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,460
I'll summon an imperial doctor.

81
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,060
Advisor Xie,

82
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,100
please feel my pulse.

83
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,460
Let me do it.

84
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,140
You feel a pain in the chest?

85
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,180
Sometimes you feel depressed?

86
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,100
You had ringing in the ears?

87
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,100
A little.

88
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,100
It's not serious. You'll be better after a rest.

89
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,980
Then I go to rest immediately

90
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,020
and won't meet any visitors.

91
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:42,980
Suit yourself.

92
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,300
The maid said

93
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,880
Empress Dowager wants to send the nun

94
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,640
to the Western State

95
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,700
to give the junior Prince of Nanchen a favor.

96
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,460
Second,

97
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,940
if she gives birth to a baby,

98
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,380
the baby can be sent back to the palace

99
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,900
to be raised as a hostage.

100
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,740
Are you sad

101
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
that you're being forced to stay here by me?

102
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,100
I'm just tired.

103
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,100
I know

104
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,780
you feel so restless

105
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,419
because she is in the palace.

106
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,299
Since you came here,

107
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,580
I've been with you,

108
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,420
haven't I?

109
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,420
That's just your helpless action.

110
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,140
She is my fiancée.

111
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,820
I'm worried about her since she is ill.

112
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,140
Is there anything wrong?

113
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,340
After marrying me,

114
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,860
she will be your sister-in-law.

115
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,980
You can't dislike

116
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,540
her like this.

117
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,380
If she is good to you,

118
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,020
I won't dislike her.

119
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,380
Don't worry.

120
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,220
Your Highness,

121
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,380
Princess.

122
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,580
What's up?

123
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,660
By order of Empress Dowager,

124
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,060
some of the Cui family directly drove a carriage from the palace gate

125
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,300
to her bedding hall.

126
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,700
Did you see who got off the carriage?

127
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,500
Many of

128
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,660
the Cui clan.

129
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,980
If you want to see me,

130
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,860
I can go to your mansion.

131
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,340
Why do you come regardless of your condition?

132
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,780
I'm afraid I can't wait any more.

133
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,060
You come

134
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,260
for the Crown Princess' engagement?

135
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,660
Now that His Majesty has concubines,

136
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,690
he'll have sons soon.

137
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,440
You won't allow the Prince of Guangling

138
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,900
to be the Crown Prince,

139
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,940
right?

140
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,300
Yeah.

141
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,180
The Prince of Guangling will be unqualified.

142
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,700
So Shiyi won't be the Crowned Princess.

143
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,460
But...

145
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,540
Please cancel Shiyi's engagement.

146
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,780
My son Feng.

147
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,540
I want to ask for an engagement

148
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,500
for him.

149
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,620
Which girl do you think suits him?

150
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,900
Tell me.

151
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,980
Princess of Xinghua.

152
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,740
My son has been guiding Shouyang for many years.

153
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,740
With many battle achievements,

154
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,940
he is worthy of Her Highness.

155
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,460
In the palace,

156
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,220
only she

157
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,540
reaches marriageable age.

158
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,140
But...

159
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,980
If she marries my son,

160
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,110
the Cui clan and your family

161
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,800
will be united through marriage,

162
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,540
which will be good

163
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,820
for you only.

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,020
Empress Dowager.

165
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,980
OK.

166
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,260
I'll certainly agree with this marriage

167
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,580
to make up for what the royal family

168
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,820
owe your family.

169
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,060
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

Your Highness, please behave yourself.

174
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,180
I won't definitely cancel our engagement.

175

Your Highness,

176
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,500
as a favored prince,

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,140
it's not hard for you

178
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,260
to have a better marriage.

179
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,820
Now that Empress Dowager has cancelled our engagement,

180
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,620
don't give your heart

181
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,980
to me.

182
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,940
Shut up.

183
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,700
You called her in public like this.

184
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,660
Aren't you afraid of offending the Cui family

185
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,300
and Nanchen Royal Mansion?

186
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,980
You're a prince,

187
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
but the Cui family's daughter

188
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,780
is not humbler than you.

189
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,820
Your Highness, My Lady,

190
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,740
please calm down.

191
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,620
Your Highness has loved Miss Cui since childhood.

192
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,340
He doesn't want to

193
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,940
and won't hurt her.

194
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,540
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,660
Uncle, please forgive me.

196
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,020
Go out of the palace

197
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,260
to stay in the Residence of Cui

198
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,100
with your mom for a few days.

199
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,380
And spend some days

200
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,540
with your uncle.

201
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,220
Yes.

202
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,260
Aunt, I don't want to marry him.

203
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,660
Aunt.

204
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,180
I don't want to marry him.

205
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,220
The marriage between the Cui family and us

206
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,940
is imperative.

207
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,620
Now we just let it be.

208
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,540
So you must marry him.

209
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,380
But, but I don't like him.

210
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,660
Who do you like?

211
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,620
I...

212
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,940
I grant you the status of princess

213
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,140
is not to make you enjoy yourself.

214
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,140
You can choose to marry Cui Feng of the Cui family,

215
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,540
or marry a ruler in the border areas

216
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,020
to make peace.

[Residence of the Grand Mentor]

218
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,540
Cui Xiu is dead,

219
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,900
and I'm dying.

220
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,940
The Cui family doesn't have anyone influential in the court.

221
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,580
Wenjun,

222
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,340
remember.

223
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,260
Don't mourn for me for three years,

224
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,980
but ask the Princess to marry in as soon as possible.

225
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,740
Dad,

226
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,500
I don't want to marry her.

227
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,140
Please cancel the engagement.

228
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
You,

229
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,540
you unfilial son.

230

Unfilial son.

Dad. Dad.

234
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,820
Cui Feng,

235
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,140
your dad gave up his dignity

236
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,860
to ask for this engagement for you.

237
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,220
Do you really want your dad

238
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,980
to die in anger?

239
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,340
Dad,

240
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,220
I always

241
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,140
listen to you

242
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,180
and have never gone against you.

243
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,500
This time,

244
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,420
I beg you to cancel this engagement.

245
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,660
I would rather remain single all my life

246
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,660
than marry the princess.

247

Beat him.

248
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,940
Don't stop until he promises.

249
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,940
Mom,

250
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,300
stop them.

251
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,980
Your uncle is the clan chief.

252
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,099
Who dares to disobey him?

253
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,860

Dad.

258

Favored by

259
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,340
the late emperor,

260
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,300
I was promoted to such a position.

261
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,340
I should have gone without regrets,

262
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:24,740
but I'm loath to leave the descendants

263
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,780

Dad.

265
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:42,140
Do you still treat me as your dad?

266
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,180
Promise your dad.

267
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,740
You unfilial son.

268
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,620
All of us

269
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,500
get married for the Cui family.

270
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,460
Promise him.

271
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
Wenji.

272
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,140
I know you dislike it.

273
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,060
But, Feng,

274
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,180
each of us

275
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,780
should sacrifice for our clan.

276
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,820
When Shiyi was 10 years old,

277
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,820
her dad's clan

278
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,500
offended Empress Gao.

279
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,380
To prevent the Cui family

280
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,860
and Shiyi from being implicated,

281
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,140
I wrote the divorce agreement

282
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,540
to divorce him.

283
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,340
I was more reluctant

284
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,180
than you are.

285
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,900
Feng,

286
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,500
I beg you.

287
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,860
Let your dad

288
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,420
go without regrets.

289
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,500
I promise.

I want to go back to the Western State.

I want to go back to the Western State.

304
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,420
I want to go back to the Western State.

She is not feeling well.

Give me some days

313
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,060
to persuade her.

314
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,700
You're her master,

315
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,260
but you're not her family after all.

316

Let us take her back.

Cui Wenji.

319
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,620
As a member of the Cui family,

320
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,140
you should know

321
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,820
Shiyi has lived in my mansion

322
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,820
for long.

all come

from here.

327
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,700
So I know more about her

So we have no time to talk things out with Shiyi.

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Back then...

334

You were so rude.

341
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
You wanted to see your own daughter,

Can't I

344
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,940
speak for you?

It has been years since my uncle's death.

353
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,900
I didn't expect that

354
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,300
she is still

355
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,820
dwelling on the past.

356
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,820
They were not destined to be together,

357
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,660
so she can't let it go.

358
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,460
In the palace that day,

359
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,260
Cui convinced me

360
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,780
to take Shiyi

361
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,140
as an apprentice

362
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,860
with the affair of my uncle with Cui Wenji,

363
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,940
so as to resolve the hatred between the two families.

364
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,460
Otherwise,

365
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,140
I wouldn't have agreed

366
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,980
with him easily.

367
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm sorry

368
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,060
to embarrass you.

369
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,580
Shiyi.

370
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,820
If I had known that

371
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
you didn't want to take me as an apprentice,

372
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,060
I wouldn't have stayed in the Western State.

373
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,780
If not,

374
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,860
where can you go?

375
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,900
Come with me.

376
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,020
Who is she?

377
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,520
She is from the Cui family.

378
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,960
Cui Shiyi.

379
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,360
She is the daughter of Li Qilang?

380
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,160
Yes.

381
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,600
Another blood debt

382
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
that the Gao family owes.

383
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,020
In the Taiji Palace back then,

384
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,940
considering the complicated relations

385
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,980
in the court in the Central State,

386
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,940
I just didn't want to connect with any family.

387
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,380
So back then,

388
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,180
no matter

389
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,410
who you are,

390
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,500
I couldn't

391
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,180
take you as my apprentice.

392
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,820
You smile finally.

393
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,420
Mind your words as a senior.

394
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,220
I'm less than ten years older than you.

395
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm not a senior.

396
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,340
But as an uncle,

397
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,340
you rank as my senior.

398
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,700
Your Highness.

399
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
Wait for me here.

400
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,760
I'll come back to you

401
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,960
after meeting her.

402
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
It's late.

403
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,800
Why does she want to meet you?

404
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,640
What brings you

405
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,800
here this time?

406
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,920
May I talk with you

407
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,360
on our own?

408
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,000
There are no outsiders here.

409
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,240
Go ahead.

410
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,800
Please help me.

411
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,120
The Empress Dowager

412
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,640
let me out of the nunnery

413
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,640
to finish a task.

414
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,240
What did she want you to do?

415
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Be your wife.

416
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,760
What if

417
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,680
I can't promise you?

418
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,680
At any cost, even if as your maidservant.

419
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880
There is only one maidservant

420
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,240
in my mansion

421
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,640
and she came with Shiyi.

422
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,000
The rest are bodyguards.

423
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,920
Moreover,

424
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,600
I need no maidservants.

425
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,760
The Empress Dowager hates the Gao clan.

426
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,680
The reason why

427
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,960
she didn't kill me

428
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,400
is our misleading past.

429
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,280
If you don't take me in this time,

430
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,040
she'll think that I'm useless

431
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,280
and will kill me.

432
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,960
Get up first.

433
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,180
I really can't

434
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,020
promise you this time.

435
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,060
Although I can't marry you,

436
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,620
I can take you away.

437
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,180
I have an adoptive brother,

438
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,420
the Prince of Pingqin.

439
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,820
I can pretend to take you away

440
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,380
and secretly send you to him to avoid trouble.

441
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,620
What if she is provoked

442
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,140
and sends men to kill me

443
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,940
when finding that

444
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,220
I'm not in the Western State?

445
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,980
As a vassal king

446
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,940
not from the imperial clan,

447
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,860
The Prince of Pingqin is less restrained by the imperial court.

448
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,020
As Pingqin County is the farthest from the Central State,

449
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,720
the people and soldiers there

450
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,080
all respect him.

451
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,240
Even assassins sent there by her

452
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
may either die halfway

453
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,440
or never return.

454
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
OK, I'll go.

455
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,560
The Royal Army of Nanchen will leave soon.

456
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,120
Go back and get ready.

457
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Miss Cui,

458
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,520
would you come out and see me?

459
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,800
Her uncle just passed away.

460
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,960
She is sad

461
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,320
and asleep.

462
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,080
Then I'll say it here.

463
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,000
I apologize

464
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,920
to you for my clan

465
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,160
killing your father's family.

466
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
I accept it for her.

467
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,280
You can leave.

468
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,680
My dad...

469
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,680
As a gentleman

470
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,800
from a famous family,

471
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,880
he was

472
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,680
known for his noble character

473
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,560
among his peers.

474
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,080
He loved your mom

475
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,880
and proposed many times,

476
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,480
but he was refused

477
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,680
for his humble origin.

478
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,760
At last, he chose to marry into the Cui family

479
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,160
and lived in the Residence of Cui.

480
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,400
How did that happen?

481
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,960
Why do you know it?

482
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,920
On the day he took you as his apprentice...

483
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,240
Why did he leave?

484
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,600
Is he hiding something from me?

485
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
No.

486
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,240
Perhaps

487
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,990
he wants me

488
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,550
to tell you without his presence.

489
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,730
On the day he took you as his apprentice,

490
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,560
your mom told him that

491
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,700
you got aphasia

492
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,050
because of your dad's matter.

493
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,230
Thus he got to know

494
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,220
the Li and Cui familys

495
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,670
and every detail

496
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,240
of what happened

497
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,520
to your dad.

498
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
His Highness is quite

499
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,240
attentive to you.

500
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,240
Advisor Xie,

501
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,360
what was the Gao's clan like

502
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,000
back then?

503
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,560
I know

504
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,440
it's a forbidden subject.

505
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,240
If it's not appropriate...

506
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,520
The Gao clan had two empresses,

507
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,739
so it had its heyday,

508
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,800
dominating the court

509
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,760
and overwhelming the royal Liu clan

510
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,630
and the Cui family.

511
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,719
However,

512
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,280
consequently,

513
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,320
few people today

514
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,840
remember the Gao clan.

515
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,600
Her Lady wants to return to the capital as soon as possible

516
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,120
to send the clan chief back to Qinghe County.

517
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,360
The condolence from ministers

518
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,960
will be over today.

519
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,000
I see.

520
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,199
So you must

521
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,600
be careful at night.

522
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,719
General Hong.

523
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,120
What can I do for you?

524
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,600
Both you and I

525
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,960
are generals

526
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,120
of the equal status.

527
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Please don't say so.

528
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,000
I was ordered to

529
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,080
guard the peace of the Residence of Cui.

530
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,320
Here

531
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm a guard

532
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,000
and you're the master.

533
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,640
Certainly you can order me.

534
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,800
I remember you were friendly to each other.

535
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,560
Why do you

536
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,360
have a conflict right after

537
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,560
his dad passed away?

538
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,760
It isn't a conflict.

539
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,120
It's public affair.

540
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,600
Well...

541
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,120
I'm in pain these days.

542
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,200
Perhaps what I did and said

543
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,680
have offended her.

544
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,880
Tonight,

545
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,320
may I see you

546
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,120
to apologize to you?

547
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,120
Tonight...

548
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,040
Sure.

549
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,920
I'll guard tonight.

550
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,440
What makes

551
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,840
the Royal Army of Nanchen invincible

552
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,280
is our united morale.

553
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,400
You two should

554
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,600
patch things up.

555
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,240
Today,

556
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,400
you must talk about it over.

557
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,240
I've kept some words

558
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,000
in my heart for years.

559
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,240
Let me say first.

560
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,880
Because of your status,

561
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,880
you need to consider

562
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,320
manner and reputation

563
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
whenever you talk.

564
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,920
But I'm an orphan

565
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,160
without any constraints,

566
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,440
so I'll say first.

567
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,080
That day

568
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,360
when you first went to

569
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,440
the Western State

570
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,800
with your sister,

571
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,720
I stopped you

572
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,520
under the gate tower,

573
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,080
but you made

574
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,590
a strong impression on me.

575
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,910
♫I don't seek glory of the multitude♫

576
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,760
I thought you

577
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:33,980
♫I only want to have a quiet conscience♫

578
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,080
couldn't stand the hardships in the army.

579
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,600
However,

580
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
you guarded Shouyang for years

581
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:42,010
♫With a pot of liquor, I travel all over the world♫

582
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,200
and resisted the enemy there.

583
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,720
Though you were in danger

584
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,200
when being besieged for several times,

585
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,720
you never retreated,

586
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:49,930
♫The horse's hooves sound on the battlefield♫

587
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,760
but guarded the south gate

588
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,440
for the people.

589
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm flattered.

590
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,190
♫I am griping a great ambition in my hand♫

591
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,000
I really

592
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,520
admire you.

593
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:06,420
♫I don't fear the rain and wind and have an inflexible will♫

594
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,680
I, I also...

595
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,000
Xiaoyu, it's my turn.

596
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,600
No.

597
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,360
Let me say first.

598
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,960
♫As a general, I may forget any wound on the shoulder♫

599
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,240
Perhaps what I want to say

600
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,800
is more than your words.

601
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:25,160
♫I am willing to stick to a ray of light for a lifetime♫

602
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,360
This is your news of victory.

603
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,640
I've kept it for years.

604
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,920
You've made greater achievements

605
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
than I've done.

606
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,200
You've long been famous in the Central Plains.

607
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,440
I love you,

608
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,430
♫The moon knows my heart♫

609
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
but I dared not say.

610
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,000
From beginning to end

611
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,340
♫Forgive me as I never retreat on the battlefield♫

612
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,120
I always love you,

613
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,760
but we can never be together.

614
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:57,890
♫There will be a grand scene of prosperity♫

615
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:10,560
♫I don't expect people to praise me, and I just want to have a clear conscience♫

616
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
I've heard of you,

617
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,560
Xiao Wen.

618
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,600
Xiao Wen is dead.

619
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,480
I'm Xiao Yan.

620
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,320
You changed your name?

621
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
My uncle believes you,

622
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,320
so do I.

623
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,160
I've drawn up an edict

624
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,720
to make you the Prince of Fengyang.

625
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,600
You'll stay in the Central State

626
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,880
and be protected

627
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,400
by Beichen in this life.

628
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

629
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,760
I don't want to stay in the Central State.

630
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,400
Where do you want to go?

631
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,000
Sure enough,

632
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,000
people prefer following uncle.

633
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,920
Your Majesty,

634
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,440
Xiao Yan wants to join the Royal Army of Nanchen

635
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,440
to get a chance

636
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
to avenge his parents.

637
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,120
Don't bother to explain.

638
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,480
I don't mind.

639
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,800
I promise.

640
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,720
I'll still give you

641
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
the title of Prince of Fengyang.

642
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,160
I'm already a monk.

643
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,920
Prince of Fengyang,

644
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,600
although you've got tonsured,

645
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,320
you still attach to the world.

646
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,720
When you avenge,

647
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,160
come tell me

648
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,640
whether you want this title or not.

649
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,600
I...

650
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,680
Just follow the edict

651
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,880
of His Majesty.

652
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,160
Don't disobey it.

653
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

654
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,640
That's right.

655
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,000
When will you leave, uncle?

656
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Tomorrow.

657
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,120
When will we meet next time?

658
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,280
We'd better not meet again in this life.

659
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,760
What's wrong

660
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,160
with me, uncle?

661
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Whenever I come back,

662
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,800
there will be great events in the court,

663
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,560
so I'd rather

664
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,400
not see you again in this life.

665
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,120
I'll guard the Central State in the Western State.

666
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,200
I hope that you'll be a wise emperor.

667
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,240
I envy you

668
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,520
having these able men around.

669
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,600
I want someone of them.

670
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,960
Who?

671
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,960
I'd like to invite Advisor Xie

672
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,000
to help me in the Central State

673
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,680
like how he taught the late emperor.
