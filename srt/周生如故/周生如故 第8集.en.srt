4
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,440
Well.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
You're the only one

6
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,640
that makes me concede defeat.

7
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,080
Do you have any unfulfilled wish?

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
I've been arrogating power in court for years

9
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,520
and I've enjoyed the dignity as an emperor.

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
I have no pities.

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Is there any family member

12
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,840
you need me to take care of?

13
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,240
I have a son.

14
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,960
I'll have him escorted back to Pingcheng

15
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,680
so that he can escape this misfortune.

16
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,240
Before His Majesty was born,

17
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,200
the late emperor had an eldest son

18
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,160
who wasn't born to the empress.

19
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,640
But he died at three.

20
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,800
In order to find the truth out,

21
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,520
I offended Empress Gao.

22
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
But Liu Yuan begged for leniency

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,960
and saved me.

24
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
In my childhood,

25
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,400
I was on good terms

26
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,640
with Liu Yuan.

27
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,240
That's why you buried wine together?

28
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah.

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,280
Then,

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,280
have you ever buried some wine with any woman?

31
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,400
What do you mean?

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,840
Nothing.

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,440
You walked on every inch here

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,880
in your childhood?

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah.

36
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,000
Zhousheng Chen.

37
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,120
It doesn't matter.

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm just not used to

40
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,920
hearing you

41
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,800
call me by my name.

42
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,060
Your family is in the Western State

43
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,030
and you will live in the Western State later.

44
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,320
You just said

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
it's enough for you to have ten orphans

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
and one disciple

47
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,240
in your mansion.

48
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,640
Yeah, it's enough.

49
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Miss Cui,

50
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,900
The Prince of Guangling

51
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,900
is waiting for you outside the hall.

52
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,260
I'm going to ask him back.

53
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,040
My bedding hall

54
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,120
is also in the imperial palace.

55
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,720
How can you stop the Prince of Guangling?

56
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,040
Ask him in.

57
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,980
Yes.

58
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,780
Wait.

59
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,020
I don't feel well.

60
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,260
I'm afraid I can't deal with him if he comes in.

61
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,940
If so, we can only ask him to go back.

62
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,900
Yes.

63
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,420
What's wrong?

64
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,820
I'll be better after having a rest.

65
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,220
Your Highness,

66
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,060
she is...

67
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,300
Advisor Xie,

68
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,580
summon an imperial doctor.

69
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,620
Your Highness, can't you

70
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,690
feel her pulse?

71
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,940
I'm unfamiliar with it

72
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,010
as I haven't done this for long.

73
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
Let me do it.

74
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,400
It's more reliable

75
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
to summon an imperial doctor.

76
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,270
Your Highness, you know

77
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,120
my medical skills.

78
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,860
I can...

79
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,540
OK.

80
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,460
I'll summon an imperial doctor.

81
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,060
Advisor Xie,

82
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,100
please feel my pulse.

83
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,460
Let me do it.

84
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,140
You feel a pain in the chest?

85
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,180
Sometimes you feel depressed?

86
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,100
You had ringing in the ears?

87
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,100
A little.

88
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,100
It's not serious. You'll be better after a rest.

89
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,980
Then I go to rest immediately

90
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,020
and won't meet any visitors.

91
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:42,980
Suit yourself.

92
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,300
The maid said

93
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,880
Empress Dowager wants to send the nun

94
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,640
to the Western State

95
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,700
to give the junior Prince of Nanchen a favor.

96
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,460
Second,

97
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,940
if she gives birth to a baby,

98
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,380
the baby can be sent back to the palace

99
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,900
to be raised as a hostage.

100
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,740
Are you sad

101
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
that you're being forced to stay here by me?

102
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,100
I'm just tired.

103
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,100
I know

104
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,780
you feel so restless

105
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,419
because she is in the palace.

106
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,299
Since you came here,

107
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,580
I've been with you,

108
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,420
haven't I?

109
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,420
That's just your helpless action.

110
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,140
She is my fiancÃ©e.

111
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,820
I'm worried about her since she is ill.

112
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,140
Is there anything wrong?

113
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,340
After marrying me,

114
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,860
she will be your sister-in-law.

115
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,980
You can't dislike

116
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,540
her like this.

117
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,380
If she is good to you,

118
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,020
I won't dislike her.

119
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,380
Don't worry.

120
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,220
Your Highness,

121
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,380
Princess.

122
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,580
What's up?

123
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,660
By order of Empress Dowager,

124
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,060
some of the Cui family directly drove a carriage from the palace gate

125
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,300
to her bedding hall.

126
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,700
Did you see who got off the carriage?

127
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,500
Many of

128
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,660
the Cui clan.

129
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,980
If you want to see me,

130
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,860
I can go to your mansion.

131
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,340
Why do you come regardless of your condition?

132
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,780
I'm afraid I can't wait any more.

133
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,060
You come

134
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,260
for the Crown Princess' engagement?

135
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,660
Now that His Majesty has concubines,

136
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,690
he'll have sons soon.

137
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,440
You won't allow the Prince of Guangling

138
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,900
to be the Crown Prince,

139
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,940
right?

140
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,300
Yeah.

141
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,180
The Prince of Guangling will be unqualified.

142
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,700
So Shiyi won't be the Crowned Princess.

143
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,460
But...

145
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,540
Please cancel Shiyi's engagement.

146
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,780
My son Feng.

147
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,540
I want to ask for an engagement

148
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,500
for him.

149
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,620
Which girl do you think suits him?

150
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,900
Tell me.

151
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,980
Princess of Xinghua.

152
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,740
My son has been guiding Shouyang for many years.

153
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,740
With many battle achievements,

154
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,940
he is worthy of Her Highness.

155
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,460
In the palace,

156
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,220
only she

157
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,540
reaches marriageable age.

158
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,140
But...

159
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,980
If she marries my son,

160
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,110
the Cui clan and your family

161
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,800
will be united through marriage,

162
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,540
which will be good

163
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,820
for you only.

164
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,020
Empress Dowager.

165
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,980
OK.

166
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,260
I'll certainly agree with this marriage

167
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,580
to make up for what the royal family

168
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,820
owe your family.

169
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,060
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

Shiyi.

173
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,020
Your Highness, please behave yourself.

174
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,180
I won't definitely cancel our engagement.

175
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,260
Your Highness,

176
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,500
as a favored prince,

177
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,140
it's not hard for you

178
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,260
to have a better marriage.

179
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,820
Now that Empress Dowager has cancelled our engagement,

180
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,620
don't give your heart

181
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,980
to me.

182
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,940
Shut up.

183
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,700
You called her in public like this.

184
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,660
Aren't you afraid of offending the Cui family

185
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,300
and Nanchen Royal Mansion?

186
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,980
You're a prince,

187
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
but the Cui family's daughter

188
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,780
is not humbler than you.

189
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,820
Your Highness, My Lady,

190
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,740
please calm down.

191
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,620
Your Highness has loved Miss Cui since childhood.

192
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,340
He doesn't want to

193
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,940
and won't hurt her.

194
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,540
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,660
Uncle, please forgive me.

196
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,020
Go out of the palace

197
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,260
to stay in the Residence of Cui

198
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,100
with your mom for a few days.

199
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,380
And spend some days

200
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,540
with your uncle.

201
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,220
Yes.

202
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,260
Aunt, I don't want to marry him.

203
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,660
Aunt.

204
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,180
I don't want to marry him.

205
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,220
The marriage between the Cui family and us

206
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,940
is imperative.

207
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,620
Now we just let it be.

208
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,540
So you must marry him.

209
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,380
But, but I don't like him.

210
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,660
Who do you like?

211
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,620
I...

212
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,940
I grant you the status of princess

213
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,140
is not to make you enjoy yourself.

214
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,140
You can choose to marry Cui Feng of the Cui family,

215
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,540
or marry a ruler in the border areas

216
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,020
to make peace.

[Residence of the Grand Mentor]

218
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,540
Cui Xiu is dead,

219
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,900
and I'm dying.

220
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,940
The Cui family doesn't have anyone influential in the court.

221
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,580
Wenjun,

222
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,340
remember.

223
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,260
Don't mourn for me for three years,

224
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,980
but ask the Princess to marry in as soon as possible.

225
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,740
Dad,

226
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,500
I don't want to marry her.

227
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,140
Please cancel the engagement.

228
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
You,

229
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,540
you unfilial son.

Unfilial son.

Dad. Dad.

234

Cui Feng,

235
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,140
your dad gave up his dignity

236
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,860
to ask for this engagement for you.

237
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,220
Do you really want your dad

238
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,980
to die in anger?

239
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,340
Dad,

240
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,220
I always

241
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,140
listen to you

242
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,180
and have never gone against you.

243
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,500
This time,

244
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,420
I beg you to cancel this engagement.

245
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,660
I would rather remain single all my life

246
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,660
than marry the princess.

248

Don't stop until he promises.

249

Mom,

250
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,300
stop them.

251
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,980
Your uncle is the clan chief.

252
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,099
Who dares to disobey him?

253
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,860

Favored by

259
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,340
the late emperor,

260
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,300
I was promoted to such a position.

261
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,340
I should have gone without regrets,

262
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:24,740
but I'm loath to leave the descendants

263

265
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:42,140
Do you still treat me as your dad?

266
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,180
Promise your dad.

267
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,740
You unfilial son.

268
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,620
All of us

269
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,500
get married for the Cui family.

270
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,460
Promise him.

271
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
Wenji.

272
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,140
I know you dislike it.

273
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,060
But, Feng,

274
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,180
each of us

275
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,780
should sacrifice for our clan.

276
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,820
When Shiyi was 10 years old,

277
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,820
her dad's clan

278
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,500
offended Empress Gao.

279
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,380
To prevent the Cui family

280
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,860
and Shiyi from being implicated,

281
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,140
I wrote the divorce agreement

282
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,540
to divorce him.

283
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,340
I was more reluctant

284
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,180
than you are.

285
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,900
Feng,

286
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,500
I beg you.

287
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,860
Let your dad

288
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,420
go without regrets.

289
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,500
I promise.

I want to go back to the Western State.

I want to go back to the Western State.

304
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,420
I want to go back to the Western State.

She is not feeling well.

Give me some days

313
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,060
to persuade her.

314
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,700
You're her master,

315
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,260
but you're not her family after all.

316

Let us take her back.

Cui Wenji.

319
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,620
As a member of the Cui family,

320
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,140
you should know

321
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,820
Shiyi has lived in my mansion

322
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,820
for long.

all come

from here.

327
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,700
So I know more about her

So we have no time to talk things out with Shiyi.

Back then...

334

You were so rude.

341

You wanted to see your own daughter,

Can't I

344
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,940
speak for you?

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,180
It has been years since my uncle's death.

353
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,900
I didn't expect that

354
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,300
she is still

355
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,820
dwelling on the past.

356
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,820
They were not destined to be together,

357
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,660
so she can't let it go.

358
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,460
In the palace that day,

359
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,260
Cui convinced me

360
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,780
to take Shiyi

361
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,140
as an apprentice

362
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,860
with the affair of my uncle with Cui Wenji,

363
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,940
so as to resolve the hatred between the two families.

364
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,460
Otherwise,

365
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,140
I wouldn't have agreed

366
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,980
with him easily.

367
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm sorry

368
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,060
to embarrass you.

369
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,580
Shiyi.

370
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,820
If I had known that

371
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
you didn't want to take me as an apprentice,

372
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,060
I wouldn't have stayed in the Western State.

373
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,780
If not,

374
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,860
where can you go?

375
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,900
Come with me.

376
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,020
Who is she?

377
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,520
She is from the Cui family.

378
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,960
Cui Shiyi.

379
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,360
She is the daughter of Li Qilang?

380
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,160
Yes.

381
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,600
Another blood debt

382
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
that the Gao family owes.

383
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,020
In the Taiji Palace back then,

384
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,940
considering the complicated relations

385
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,980
in the court in the Central State,

386
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,940
I just didn't want to connect with any family.

387
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,380
So back then,

388
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,180
no matter

389
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,410
who you are,

390
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,500
I couldn't

391
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,180
take you as my apprentice.

392
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,820
You smile finally.

393
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,420
Mind your words as a senior.

394
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,220
I'm less than ten years older than you.

395
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm not a senior.

396
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,340
But as an uncle,

397
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,340
you rank as my senior.

398
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,700
Your Highness.

399
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
Wait for me here.

400
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,760
I'll come back to you

401
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,960
after meeting her.

402
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
It's late.

403
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,800
Why does she want to meet you?

404
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,640
What brings you

405
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,800
here this time?

406
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,920
May I talk with you

407
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,360
on our own?

408
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,000
There are no outsiders here.

409
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,240
Go ahead.

410
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,800
Please help me.

411
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,120
The Empress Dowager

412
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,640
let me out of the nunnery

413
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,640
to finish a task.

414
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,240
What did she want you to do?

415
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Be your wife.

416
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,760
What if

417
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,680
I can't promise you?

418
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,680
At any cost, even if as your maidservant.

419
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880
There is only one maidservant

420
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,240
in my mansion

421
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,640
and she came with Shiyi.

422
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,000
The rest are bodyguards.

423
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,920
Moreover,

424
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,600
I need no maidservants.

425
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,760
The Empress Dowager hates the Gao clan.

426
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,680
The reason why

427
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,960
she didn't kill me

428
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,400
is our misleading past.

429
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,280
If you don't take me in this time,

430
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,040
she'll think that I'm useless

431
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,280
and will kill me.

432
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,960
Get up first.

433
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,180
I really can't

434
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,020
promise you this time.

435
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,060
Although I can't marry you,

436
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,620
I can take you away.

437
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,180
I have an adoptive brother,

438
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,420
the Prince of Pingqin.

439
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,820
I can pretend to take you away

440
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,380
and secretly send you to him to avoid trouble.

441
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,620
What if she is provoked

442
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,140
and sends men to kill me

443
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,940
when finding that

444
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,220
I'm not in the Western State?

445
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,980
As a vassal king

446
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,940
not from the imperial clan,

447
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,860
The Prince of Pingqin is less restrained by the imperial court.

448
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,020
As Pingqin County is the farthest from the Central State,

449
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,720
the people and soldiers there

450
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,080
all respect him.

451
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,240
Even assassins sent there by her

452
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
may either die halfway

453
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,440
or never return.

454
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
OK, I'll go.

455
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,560
The Royal Army of Nanchen will leave soon.

456
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,120
Go back and get ready.

457
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Miss Cui,

458
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,520
would you come out and see me?

459
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,800
Her uncle just passed away.

460
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,960
She is sad

461
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,320
and asleep.

462
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,080
Then I'll say it here.

463
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,000
I apologize

464
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,920
to you for my clan

465
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,160
killing your father's family.

466
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
I accept it for her.

467
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,280
You can leave.

468
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,680
My dad...

469
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,680
As a gentleman

470
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,800
from a famous family,

471
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,880
he was

472
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,680
known for his noble character

473
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,560
among his peers.

474
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,080
He loved your mom

475
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,880
and proposed many times,

476
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,480
but he was refused

477
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,680
for his humble origin.

478
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,760
At last, he chose to marry into the Cui family

479
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,160
and lived in the Residence of Cui.

480
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,400
How did that happen?

481
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,960
Why do you know it?

482
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,920
On the day he took you as his apprentice...

483
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,240
Why did he leave?

484
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,600
Is he hiding something from me?

485
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
No.

486
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,240
Perhaps

487
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,990
he wants me

488
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,550
to tell you without his presence.

489
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,730
On the day he took you as his apprentice,

490
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,560
your mom told him that

491
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,700
you got aphasia

492
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,050
because of your dad's matter.

493
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,230
Thus he got to know

494
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,220
the Li and Cui familys

495
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,670
and every detail

496
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,240
of what happened

497
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,520
to your dad.

498
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
His Highness is quite

499
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,240
attentive to you.

500
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,240
Advisor Xie,

501
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,360
what was the Gao's clan like

502
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,000
back then?

503
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,560
I know

504
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,440
it's a forbidden subject.

505
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,240
If it's not appropriate...

506
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,520
The Gao clan had two empresses,

507
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,739
so it had its heyday,

508
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,800
dominating the court

509
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,760
and overwhelming the royal Liu clan

510
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,630
and the Cui family.

511
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,719
However,

512
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,280
consequently,

513
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,320
few people today

514
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,840
remember the Gao clan.

515
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,600
Her Lady wants to return to the capital as soon as possible

516
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,120
to send the clan chief back to Qinghe County.

517
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,360
The condolence from ministers

518
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,960
will be over today.

519
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,000
I see.

520
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,199
So you must

521
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,600
be careful at night.

522
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,719
General Hong.

523
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,120
What can I do for you?

524
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,600
Both you and I

525
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,960
are generals

526
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,120
of the equal status.

527
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Please don't say so.

528
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,000
I was ordered to

529
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,080
guard the peace of the Residence of Cui.

530
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,320
Here

531
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm a guard

532
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,000
and you're the master.

533
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,640
Certainly you can order me.

534
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,800
I remember you were friendly to each other.

535
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,560
Why do you

536
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,360
have a conflict right after

537
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,560
his dad passed away?

538
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,760
It isn't a conflict.

539
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,120
It's public affair.

540
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,600
Well...

541
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,120
I'm in pain these days.

542
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,200
Perhaps what I did and said

543
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,680
have offended her.

544
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,880
Tonight,

545
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,320
may I see you

546
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,120
to apologize to you?

547
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,120
Tonight...

548
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,040
Sure.

549
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,920
I'll guard tonight.

550
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,440
What makes

551
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,840
the Royal Army of Nanchen invincible

552
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,280
is our united morale.

553
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,400
You two should

554
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,600
patch things up.

555
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,240
Today,

556
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,400
you must talk about it over.

557
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,240
I've kept some words

558
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,000
in my heart for years.

559
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,240
Let me say first.

560
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,880
Because of your status,

561
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,880
you need to consider

562
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,320
manner and reputation

563
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
whenever you talk.

564
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,920
But I'm an orphan

565
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,160
without any constraints,

566
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,440
so I'll say first.

567
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,080
That day

568
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,360
when you first went to

569
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,440
the Western State

570
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,800
with your sister,

571
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,720
I stopped you

572
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,520
under the gate tower,

573
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,080
but you made

574
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,590
a strong impression on me.

575
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,910
â«I don't seek glory of the multitudeâ«

576
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,760
I thought you

577
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:33,980
â«I only want to have a quiet conscienceâ«

578
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,080
couldn't stand the hardships in the army.

579
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,600
However,

580
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
you guarded Shouyang for years

581
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:42,010
â«With a pot of liquor, I travel all over the worldâ«

582
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,200
and resisted the enemy there.

583
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,720
Though you were in danger

584
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,200
when being besieged for several times,

585
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,720
you never retreated,

586
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:49,930
â«The horse's hooves sound on the battlefieldâ«

587
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,760
but guarded the south gate

588
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,440
for the people.

589
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm flattered.

590
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,190
â«I am griping a great ambition in my handâ«

591
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,000
I really

592
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,520
admire you.

593
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:06,420
â«I don't fear the rain and wind and have an inflexible willâ«

594
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,680
I, I also...

595
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,000
Xiaoyu, it's my turn.

596
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,600
No.

597
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,360
Let me say first.

598
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,960
â«As a general, I may forget any wound on the shoulderâ«

599
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,240
Perhaps what I want to say

600
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,800
is more than your words.

601
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:25,160
â«I am willing to stick to a ray of light for a lifetimeâ«

602
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,360
This is your news of victory.

603
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,640
I've kept it for years.

604
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,920
You've made greater achievements

605
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
than I've done.

606
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,200
You've long been famous in the Central Plains.

607
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,440
I love you,

608
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,430
â«The moon knows my heartâ«

609
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
but I dared not say.

610
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,000
From beginning to end

611
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,340
â«Forgive me as I never retreat on the battlefieldâ«

612
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,120
I always love you,

613
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,760
but we can never be together.

614
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:57,890
â«There will be a grand scene of prosperityâ«

615
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:10,560
â«I don't expect people to praise me, and I just want to have a clear conscienceâ«

616
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
I've heard of you,

617
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,560
Xiao Wen.

618
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,600
Xiao Wen is dead.

619
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,480
I'm Xiao Yan.

620
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,320
You changed your name?

621
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
My uncle believes you,

622
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,320
so do I.

623
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,160
I've drawn up an edict

624
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,720
to make you the Prince of Fengyang.

625
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,600
You'll stay in the Central State

626
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,880
and be protected

627
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,400
by Beichen in this life.

628
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

629
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,760
I don't want to stay in the Central State.

630
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,400
Where do you want to go?

631
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,000
Sure enough,

632
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,000
people prefer following uncle.

633
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,920
Your Majesty,

634
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,440
Xiao Yan wants to join the Royal Army of Nanchen

635
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,440
to get a chance

636
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
to avenge his parents.

637
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,120
Don't bother to explain.

638
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,480
I don't mind.

639
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,800
I promise.

640
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,720
I'll still give you

641
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
the title of Prince of Fengyang.

642
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,160
I'm already a monk.

643
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,920
Prince of Fengyang,

644
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,600
although you've got tonsured,

645
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,320
you still attach to the world.

646
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,720
When you avenge,

647
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,160
come tell me

648
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,640
whether you want this title or not.

649
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,600
I...

650
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,680
Just follow the edict

651
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,880
of His Majesty.

652
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,160
Don't disobey it.

653
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

654
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,640
That's right.

655
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,000
When will you leave, uncle?

656
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Tomorrow.

657
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,120
When will we meet next time?

658
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,280
We'd better not meet again in this life.

659
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,760
What's wrong

660
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,160
with me, uncle?

661
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Whenever I come back,

662
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,800
there will be great events in the court,

663
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,560
so I'd rather

664
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,400
not see you again in this life.

665
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,120
I'll guard the Central State in the Western State.

666
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,200
I hope that you'll be a wise emperor.

667
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,240
I envy you

668
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,520
having these able men around.

669
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,600
I want someone of them.

670
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,960
Who?

671
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,960
I'd like to invite Advisor Xie

672
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,000
to help me in the Central State

673
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,680
like how he taught the late emperor.
