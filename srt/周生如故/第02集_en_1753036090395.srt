00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,400
Episode 12

2
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,140
I'm here to republic with battle with Southeast.

3
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,520
I beg you.

4
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,840
I thank your highness.

5
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Congratulations, Your Highness, you have a new disciple.

6
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Congratulations, Grand Father.

7
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,840
I will be taking the army to the south soon.

8
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,840
After I leave for a few years, all the royal family will be armed.

9
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,840
No one can take care of the young girl.

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,840
After the battle at Jiangshui, send her to Xi State.

11
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,840
It's a deal.

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
It's a deal.

13
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Wait.

14
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Uncle, wait!

15
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Your Majesty, what can I do for you?

16
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,840
I've been the Emperor's guard for many years and I'm tired.

17
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I'll drink to the soldiers.

18
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm getting thinner.

19
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Go back quickly. I'm leaving the palace.

20
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
Uncle, aren't you staying here for the night?

21
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,840
This place isn't where I should live.

22
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,840
When can I see you again?

23
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,840
On the day of the spirit day. I'll go.

24
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
I'll go.

25
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Go.

26
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Stop!

27
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Stop!

28
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Today, no matter who the emperor is, you will be the only one who will be the emperor.

29
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Please lead the way.

30
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,840
I'm the King of the outside world. I can't enter the palace.

31
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Uncle.

32
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Zhao Teng.

33
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
I'm here.

34
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm here to see you, Huang Yue.

35
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
From now on, you don't need to be smart.

36
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
You don't need to be a criminal.

37
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
You can go to the palace with a sword.

38
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I'm going.

39
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

40
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
I don't need these sacred beads.

41
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Uncle.

42
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Your Majesty, take care.

43
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Your Majesty.

44
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
I've been living in the palace for four years.

45
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
I'm a prince.

46
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
I'm six years old.

47
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Kneel!

48
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Long live the Emperor!

49
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Long live the Emperor!

50
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Long live the Emperor!

51
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Bow!

52
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,840
I know that you have a stone in your heart.

53
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,840
When the late emperor was here, it was hanging.

54
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,840
This is the imperial edict to the crown princess.

55
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Uncle, this is a big event.

56
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Uncle, please take the edict.

57
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,840
When the late emperor was married, the emperor was the crown prince.

58
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,840
The daughter of the Cui family was the crown princess.

59
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Now the emperor is the emperor.

60
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,840
The daughter of the Cui family should be the empress.

61
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
This edict is wrong.

62
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,840
The late emperor was married to the crown princess, not the empress.

63
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
You don't have to force me.

64
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,840
The emperor is the emperor.

65
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I think today, the royal family and the Cui family should step back.

66
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
We have already stepped back.

67
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
What else do you want?

68
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm afraid that you are only six years old.

69
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Why do you come to the crown prince?

70
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Isn't this edict a waste of time?

71
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Please wait a moment. The crown prince is coming.

72
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Zixing greets the emperor and the imperial concubine.

73
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Get up.

74
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Thank you, your majesty.

75
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,840
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
I'm sorry.

79
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
This is the third son of the king of Wuyan, Liu Zixing.

80
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
From today, he will stay in the palace for a long time to be the emperor's half-sister.

81
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
He will be crowned as the crown prince.

82
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Cui Gong, are you satisfied with this crown prince?

83
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
I'm satisfied.

84
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Grand Tutor, this edict is better than nothing.

85
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,840
I thank your majesty.

87
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Take them away.

88
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Yes.

89
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Be careful.

90
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Stop.

91
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Your majesty.

92
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,840
The entire family of Grand Tutor has been executed.

93
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,840
The entire family of Grand Tutor has been executed.

94
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
This is a big prize.

95
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Cui family is the leader of all the Wang family in Jiangshui.

96
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Our national number is the one that Cui family proposed to the emperor.

97
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
So great.

98
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Stop the car.

99
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Stop the car.

100
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Mengyu Wushan.

101
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,840
He is the one who gave up the royal family to lead the army and protect the country.

102
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
You don't want to see him just because of this?

103
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
You said it.

104
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,840
He has never lost a battle.

105
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Don't you think he is curious?

106
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
You also said it.

107
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
He has fought many famous warriors.

108
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,840
In Jiangzhou, Shuozhou, Daizhou.

109
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,840
These are all great battles that can be written in military books.

110
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Okay, I said it all.

111
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
You can't bear to leave your family.

112
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
I understand.

113
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
So I stayed to join the army.

114
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
I'll stay with you.

115
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
My father has promised.

116
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Anyway, I don't need to inherit the family business.

117
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
I can stay in the family of the king of Nanchen.

118
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,840
I think my father will agree.

119
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Happy?

120
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Silly.

121
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Stop.

122
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
I am Zhu Tianxing.

123
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Nice to meet you.

124
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Cui Shi, Cui Shao.

125
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
This is young master.

126
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
The border is in a big disaster.

127
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Master has moved back to the city.

128
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
He will arrive tomorrow.

129
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Please go back to the mansion with me.

130
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
We have to stay in the station.

131
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
We won't bother general Zhou.

132
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
But master asked us to do it.

133
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
It's not a long time.

134
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
General Zhou, please send us to the inn.

135
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Okay.

136
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Please.

137
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
General Zhou.

138
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
When will your highness come back?

139
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
He will be back before dawn.

140
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Master likes to go to the east during the day.

141
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
This is his habit for many years.

142
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Then I have a chance to see him.

143
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
You are not from my mansion.

144
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I want to take my sister to see him.

145
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840
We won't bother you.

146
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Just stay in the city.

147
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Old stone, take this.

148
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,840
I told the soldiers in the city.

149
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
I took you there.

150
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Thank you, general Zhou.

151
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
I will leave now.

152
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Goodbye, general.

153
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Aunt.

154
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Aunt.

155
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Don't sleep too much at night.

156
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840
I heard the sound of the bamboo flute.

157
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
So I came to see you.

158
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
To see master.

159
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Master.

160
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
How's it going?

161
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Are you sleepy?

162
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,840
I'm not afraid.

163
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
This is General Zhou's token.

164
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,840
He allowed us to go up to the city tower and observe the sun rising.

165
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,840
If you don't trust us, you can watch from the side.

166
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Please.

167
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Thank you.

168
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
The sun rises.

169
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,840
The one who gets on the high platform will be your future master.

170
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,840
He's coming. He's coming.

171
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840
The sun rises.

172
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,840
The rain is falling.

173
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,840
The waiting is over.

174
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Who will wake up from this dream?

175
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,840
The heart is beating.

176
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
We will see the world.

177
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
We will die.

178
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,840
We will see the world.

179
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
We will die.

180
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,840
We will see the world.

181
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
We will die.

182
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
We will see the world.

183
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
We will die.

184
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,840
We will die.

185
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,840
We will die.

186
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
We will die.

187
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
The night is harsh.

188
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
When the three armies march out,

189
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
the wolf's eye is the best view.

190
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,840
There is yellow sand all over the sky.

191
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,840
This is the real Zhou Shengchen.

192
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
His family has more than 1000 soldiers.

193
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,840
He's the little prince of the seven hundred thousand soldiers.

194
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
His body is covered in blood.

195
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
I was lucky.

196
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,840
I didn't know these things.

197
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,840
I was just shocked by what I saw.

198
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Who are you?

199
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Sister, don't be afraid.

200
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
How dare you come to the city?

201
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
I'm not afraid.

202
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Say something!

203
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
Xiaoyu, don't scare them.

204
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Yes, master.

205
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm not afraid.

206
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
The one I saw this morning was Cui's family.

207
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Two?

208
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
One male and one female.

209
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
The male one is older.

210
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
That should be it.

211
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
I sent the token to Cui's third son.

212
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
He said he admired master and wanted to see him serve.

213
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
I thought it was a spy.

214
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
I almost caught him.

215
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Thanks to master's words.

216
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Otherwise, you would have been in trouble.

217
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Master, I made the decision.

218
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
It doesn't matter.

219
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
When is the banquet?

220
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
The day after tomorrow.

221
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
The day after tomorrow?

222
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Prepare it simply.

223
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Yes.

224
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Slow down.

225
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Slow down.

226
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
I'm a junior.

227
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
I'm from the Shi family.

228
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
I'm a person who cares about etiquette.

229
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Don't be so careless when you work.

230
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,840
You can't use your feet when you're holding things.

231
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,840
I heard that the Shi family doesn't show their teeth.

232
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Smile.

233
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
General, I'm not smiling well.

234
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
I'll hide.

235
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
I'll go back to work.

236
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Let's go.

237
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
General Feng.

238
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
What?

239
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
General Feng, what are you doing?

240
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I'm training soldiers to defend the mansion.

241
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
General Feng, do you know that you should not be afraid of others?

242
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
General, slow down.

243
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
What chicken and what fish?

244
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,840
General Cui and two of his soldiers are staying here.

245
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
They will protect you in the West.

246
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,840
You must be careful when you enter the mansion.

247
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
You must not insult the reputation of the Cui family.

248
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
General Feng.

249
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Prince Nanchen.

250
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Who is this?

251
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
This is Cui Feng.

252
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
I'm here to greet you.

253
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Your Highness, no need to be so formal.

254
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Please come in.

255
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Your Highness.

256
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Shi Yi.

257
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
In the family, you were replaced by Shi Yi, right?

258
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
It's good.

259
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
I already have ten disciples.

260
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
I also call you Shi Yi.

261
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Is that good?

262
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
He didn't support himself.

263
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
I'm sorry.

264
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm sorry.

265
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
I'm sorry.

266
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
I'm sorry.

267
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
I'm sorry.

268
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
I'm sorry.

270
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,840
I'm sorry.

271
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
I'm sorry.

272
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm sorry.

273
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I'm sorry.

274
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
He didn't call himself the king.

276
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
It's me.

277
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
What a strange person.

278
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
What are you going to do next?

279
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Are you going to bow your head?

280
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Get up.

281
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
There are not many rules in the mansion.

282
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
You don't have to care about the power of the stone.

283
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
This is your senior sister.

284
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
You can find her in any situation in the future.

285
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Your Highness, someone came to the palace.

286
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
They said they brought a gift from His Majesty.

287
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Let them in.

288
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Yes.

289
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Your Highness.

290
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
I'm here to see you.

291
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm here to see you.

292
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
I'm here to see you.

293
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I'm here to see you.

294
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
I'm here to see you.

295
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Your Highness.

296
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Your Highness.

297
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Miss Cui.

298
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Come on.

299
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,840
These two are the gifts from His Majesty.

300
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
What if I still refuse to accept them?

301
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,840
His Majesty said that I'm the emperor.

302
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
I should accept the gifts from His Majesty.

303
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,840
His Majesty also said that these two are for you two.

304
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,840
You can choose the one you like.

305
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,840
I have to thank His Majesty.

306
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Tie Xing.

307
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Yes.

308
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Take these to Shiyi's yard.

309
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Yes.

310
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Please.

311
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,840
His Majesty also invited a painter this time.

312
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
He wants to make a portrait for Miss Cui.

313
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,840
He will send it to the Eastern Palace in the future.

314
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Zeyu.

315
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Take Shiyi and the painter to my study.

316
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Yes.

317
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
This way, please.

318
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,840
I have a few words to tell His Highness.

319
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
You can leave.

320
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Yes.

321
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Miss Cui, please.

322
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
This is Cui Shou.

323
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,840
This time, he led the Cui family to two thousand soldiers.

324
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,840
He wants to stay in Xizhou to protect his daughter.

325
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
I hope His Highness will allow it.

326
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
Okay.

327
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
I will order someone to arrange it.

328
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

329
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,840
General Cui, do you want to farm land and grow crops?

330
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Farm land?

331
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,840
My army usually has a farmland.

332
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
When it's not war, it's self-farming.

333
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,840
When it's not war, it's self-farming.

334
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,840
General Cui, you can go back to your home country.

335
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Yes.

336
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
There is one more thing.

337
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
I have admired you since I was a child.

338
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,840
I want to fight with you everywhere.

339
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,840
I have a letter written by my brother.

340
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
You don't have to write it.

341
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
As long as the young master of the Cui family is not afraid of death,

342
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
he can join the army at any time.

343
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,840
I thought I would have to talk about it.

344
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840
I never refuse to join the army.

345
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
As for whether he can stay, it depends on his real ability.

346
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
The last thing...

347
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,840
It's about Shiyi.

348
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Your Highness, you have seen it.

349
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Shiyi has been like this since childhood.

350
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
She can't talk.

351
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Is it a disease or...

352
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Since her father left home,

353
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,840
she has been sick.

354
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Maybe it's a real disease.

355
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Maybe it's a heart disease.

356
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm sorry.

357
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
It's wonderful.

358
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Good.

359
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Miss Cuiyi, you have worked hard.

360
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Little sister, say goodbye to your mother.

361
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,840
I owe you a new one.

362
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
I will be your teacher for a day.

363
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
I will be your father for a lifetime.

364
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
You have to listen to me.

365
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I remember.

366
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Your Highness, I'm leaving.

367
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
From now on,

368
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,840
I will not be by your side.

369
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,840
You have to get used to it.

370
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
I'm leaving.

371
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
At the age of little sister,

372
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
my teacher is a general.

373
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
He can't bear to leave his mother.

374
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
You have come a long way.

375
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Take a rest for a few days.

376
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Teacher, how about I take him back to the yard?

377
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Go.

378
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Yes.

379
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Wait.

380
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
It's the first day of the king's house.

381
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I will take you there.

382
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
I will take you there.

383
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Who is bullying my sister?

384
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
I will eat her.

385
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Two news.

386
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
His Highness has promised me to join the army.

387
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I can go with the army.

388
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Secondly, tonight,

389
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
I will go with General Hong

390
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
to patrol the city.

391
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
I can't accompany you.

392
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Shiyi, you can do it alone.

393
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
Don't worry.

394
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,840
If you think that Gu Dan likes to read,

395
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
there is a library in the backyard of the king's house.

396
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
You can go and have a look.

397
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Thank you, sister.

398
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Take good care of yourself.

399
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
We are leaving.

400
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Let's go, General Hong.

401
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Your Highness.

402
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
You can't enter the king's study.

403
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
What's the matter?

404
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
I...

405
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,840
You can leave first.

406
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Yes.

407
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Your Highness, the girl is missing.

408
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
The princess of the king's family has been missing for a long time.

409
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
If the news spreads, it will ruin the reputation.

410
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
I dare not say it.

411
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
I can only come to see you.

412
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Don't worry.

413
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
There will be no trouble in the king's house.

414
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
I will go and have a look now.

415
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Gu Dan.

416
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Gu Dan.

417
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Why did you come to the library?

418
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Gu Dan.

419
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
I miss home.

420
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Your brother and sisters

421
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
have always treated the king's house as their own home.

422
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Although they call me master,

423
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
they are all living with their families.

424
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
You don't have to be so stubborn.

425
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Gu Dan.

426
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I don't usually live in the king's house for a long time.

427
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
When I was not in the king's house,

428
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
the doors of the library were locked.

429
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Since you like it,

430
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
I will leave this key to you.

431
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Take it as today's wedding gift.

432
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Gu Dan.

433
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
You forgot what I said in the day.

434
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Don't bother.

435
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Go back and rest.

436
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Gu Dan.

437
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,840
In the study.

438
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Gu Dan.

439
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Are you looking for master?

440
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
What's up?

441
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
I'm Chen Li.

442
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Master.

443
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
He...

444
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
What's up?

445
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
He wants to say hello to you.

446
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Hello?

447
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
You...

448
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
You have to pray every day?

449
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Your highness.

450
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,840
I will not be late for the wedding.

451
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,840
You must be late once and then ask again.

452
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Can't miss once.

453
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,840
I must.

454
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,840
What else?

455
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
What?

456
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
The king is asking how many times you three

457
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
called him to say hello.

458
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I'm not careful.

459
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I'm good at talking and eating.

460
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm good at traveling.

461
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
If...

462
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
If he wants to find me in the library,

463
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
how many rules does he have?

464
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Before entering the door, you must tell master three times.

465
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
You must not sit in the door.

466
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
You must sit on the left side of master.

467
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
You must sit three times.

468
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Then you can sit down.

469
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Forget these.

470
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
I'm a teacher.

471
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
How can I forget?

472
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
There is only one rule here.

473
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
That is the military order is like a mountain.

474
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
You can forget everything else.

475
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
If you teach like this,

476
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
Cui's family will be in trouble.

477
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Since we are in Xizhou,

478
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Cui's family can't be bothered.

479
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I'm sorry.

480
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Shiyi.

481
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
What are you doing?

482
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Tidy up the ancient books.

483
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Who told you to tidy up?

484
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Isn't it you?

485
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
Master told me to manage the library.

486
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Of course I have to sort out the books.

487
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
I gave you the key

488
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
to let you come to the library at any time.

489
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,840
There is no other good place in the palace.

490
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Only the old mother's library is more interesting.

491
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
I came to teach.

492
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
I came to learn.

493
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
I'm not late.

494
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
I'm not late.

495
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
You are not late for learning.

496
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
You are not late for fun.

497
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I know.

498
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Then why didn't you teach me?

499
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
I haven't figured out

500
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
how to teach you.

501
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Because you are my first student.

502
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
What's wrong, Your Highness?

503
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
You are upset?

504
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
I never had a student.

505
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Xiao Yu and the others

506
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
are all your students.

507
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
They call me master

508
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
because

509
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
I want to give them a home.

510
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Let them have a reason to live in the palace.

511
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
I never had a reason

512
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,840
to teach them.

513
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
It's true.

514
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,840
But...

515
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,840
The military teacher was a great man.

516
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Your Highness,

517
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
that was 20 years ago.

518
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
You have experience.

519
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
No.

520
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,840
I taught the princes.

521
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
I never taught any

522
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
noble girls.

523
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
No.

524
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
What did he learn

525
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
in Cui's mansion?

526
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Your Highness,

527
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
except for etiquette,

528
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
I didn't learn anything else.

529
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,840
But she likes to study.

530
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
She has been in the academy since she was a child.

531
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
Did Cui say

532
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
what she wanted to learn?

533
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
She can't do martial arts.

534
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
She can do everything.

535
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,840
But she doesn't learn

536
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,840
martial arts in the mansion.

537
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,840
She can't do martial arts.

538
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
She doesn't learn martial arts in the mansion.

539
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Is she just asking for a disciple's name?

540
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Let her learn the back-chess in the study.

541
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Back-chess?

542
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
Master, you can do this?

543
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,840
What?

544
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,840
You think I can't?

545
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
We really think you can only learn martial arts.

546
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
In the past,

547
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
you often made

548
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
criticism about etiquette.

549
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
But when it comes to talent,

550
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
no one can compare to you.

551
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
You guys

552
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
should learn more.

553
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
The love here

554
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,840
is a legend.

555
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
There's one

556
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
that you've been using for years.

557
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
It was sent to Xi State

558
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
by the Emperor.

559
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,840
The Emperor said

560
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
you can choose.

561
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,840
