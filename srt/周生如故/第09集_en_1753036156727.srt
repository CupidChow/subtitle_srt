1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,760
curb your desire

32
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,120
to flee

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,980
from this life

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,340
I promise

35
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,920
Lord Fongyang's title

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,320
including mine

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
I am a monk

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
King of Phoenix

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Although you have a belly

40
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
But you still have a heart

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
When will you have a bloody revenge

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Come and tell me

43
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Do you want this title

44
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I am the emperor's word

45
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Just follow the order

46
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Can't be without you

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,320
I obey the order

48
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
That's right

49
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
When will you leave the city

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Leave tomorrow

51
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
When will you see me next time

52
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
It's best not to see you again in this life

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
What place is there that makes you unhappy

54
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,320
I came back

55
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
There must be a big thing happening in the court

56
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
So I would rather not see you again in this life

57
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,320
I hope you can stay in the capital

58
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
In Xizhou, East China

59
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
I hope you can become a great emperor

60
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
I envy you

61
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
You have this capable general

62
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I want to ask you for one person

63
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Who

64
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Please teach the emperor like you taught the old emperor

65
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Stay in Zhongzhou

66
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Help me

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Master is thinking about the military

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
The military is like a father to me

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Leave him in the capital

70
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
I can't rest assured

71
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
The military is back

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
I came to say goodbye to the crown

73
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,320
You want to stay

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Yes

75
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
His Majesty did not force

76
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
You still have a chance to consider

77
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
I know

78
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
The emperor is worried about me

79
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
In the past, I was entrusted by the late emperor

80
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Follow the emperor out of the palace

81
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
This lie

82
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
You and I have been fighting for decades

83
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Now the emperor can completely take over

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Is there a presence

85
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
All the same

86
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
I'm not sure

87
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
I'm afraid you can't

88
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
All the same

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Your Highness

90
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Whenever

91
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
You are my right hand

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
If I go

93
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Can't be hurt

94
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
Can't be broken

95
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Listen to this sentence

96
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I died in Wuhan

97
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
The emperor of the Qing Dynasty is still young

98
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
No one can use it

99
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
So I decided

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Stay to assist him

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Just like the first

102
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Assist you

103
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Since you have decided

104
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Then I

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
I have to turn my head

106
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Military counselor

107
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Please remember

108
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Xizhou

109
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Always waiting for you to come back

110
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
it is good

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
I also ask the next thing

112
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
After

113
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Please

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Walk me in Xizhou

115
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Your Highness

116
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
When are you and the princess getting married

117
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Three years later

118
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Father's life

119
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
No need to be filial

120
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
The sooner the better

121
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
That's what I mean

122
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
When do you want

123
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Before I go back to Qinghe County

124
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
He wants the princess to accompany me back to Qinghe County

125
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
For my father

126
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Even if you don't care about filial piety

127
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
How do we hold the wedding

128
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
The Empress Dowager's order is not to hold the wedding

129
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
Send the princess into the mansion and finish the wedding

130
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
I'll be back in two years

131
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Look at the sister nervous

132
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm afraid the prince doesn't want her to go back

133
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
I'm counting the time

134
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
See if I can pick you up in person

135
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
At that time

136
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
I should be in Liu Zhen

137
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
State affairs are important, I can go back by myself

138
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
State affairs and family affairs are all important

139
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Even if I don't send it, there is also a general to be sent

140
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Your Highness

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Father

142
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Father

143
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
I made a piece for you

144
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
I am your brother

145
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
At the top of power

146
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Who can stand alone

147
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
This piece cannot be told to anyone

148
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Even the prince can't say

149
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
General Feng

150
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
I

151
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Meet the king of Fengyang

152
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
General Feng is too polite

153
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
We are so far

154
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
There is a phoenix in the name

155
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
I can't compare to General Feng

156
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
General Feng is a hero of Jin

157
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
I'm a phoenix

158
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Some people are really lucky

159
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm going to be a phoenix when I'm born

160
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Where are you disappointed

161
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Some people are really lucky

162
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Born to be a disciple of the little prince

163
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm a man of Nancheng's palace

164
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
You are really

165
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
You are trying hard to enter our king's army

166
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I was there from the beginning

167
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
So I should envy General Feng

168
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
So I should envy General Feng

169
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Master doesn't let people disturb

170
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Senior

171
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Master is inside

172
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Yes, go in quickly

173
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Master is waiting for Junior

174
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
After tomorrow

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Junior will see Master

176
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
After Junior will see Master

177
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Don't occupy today

178
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Don't occupy today

179
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Thank you for your advice

180
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Shiyi

181
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Shiyi

182
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Shiyi

183
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Shiyi

184
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
How did you know it was me

185
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Your senior is guarding outside

186
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Won't let outsiders in

187
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Master is leaving tomorrow

188
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Yes

189
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
This is the longest time

190
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
I left the royal mansion after I lost my master

191
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
The longest time

192
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Yes

193
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Although mother has set a date

194
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
But I haven't been home for a long time

195
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm afraid if something happens

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm afraid I'll have to wait longer before I can go back to Xi Zhou

197
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
It doesn't matter

198
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
I said so much

199
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Master only returned four words before and after

200
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
You just have to remember

201
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Nancheng's royal mansion has always been there

202
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I and your brothers and sisters have always been there

203
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
For us

204
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
You just go and go and come back

205
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
I'll take you to a place

206
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Okay

207
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm going to take Shiyi out of the palace

208
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Do you want to go together

209
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Master came to Zhongzhou this time

210
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
No one knows

211
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm afraid to expose my identity

212
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Yes, this farewell is urgent

213
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
I also want to take a closer look

214
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
This Zhongzhou palace

215
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
I won't accompany you

216
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Let's go

217
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Master

218
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
I forgot to be outside the palace

219
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Did you come here often when you were a child

220
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,320
I often came before leaving Zhongzhou

221
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Then I have to take a good look

222
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Why is he going inside to put water

223
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
The white horse-drawn monk has been used to it for many years

224
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Every month

225
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Will let the little disciple check the water inside

226
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
If there is a thin layer of ice on it

227
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Must change water immediately

228
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
In case the pigeons can't drink

229
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
You are really thoughtful

230
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Pigeons are very spiritual

231
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
They like to hide in the temple in winter

232
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
By the way, did you burn incense here?

233
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Never burned

234
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
I am a general

235
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Walk through the valley of blood and white

236
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Shouldn't disturb the Buddha's situation

237
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
But there are more people that Master has guarded

238
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
It's okay

239
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
From now on, I will burn incense for Master and Senior

240
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Let's go

241
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Let's go and fill up your youthful incense

242
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Come back

243
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Do you know how to go

244
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Let's go

245
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Let's go

246
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Which king is here

247
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
King

248
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
How do you know it's a king

249
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Look at this atmosphere

250
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
If there are people like this in Zhongzhou

251
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Already spread

252
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
How come I haven't seen it

253
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Then the king is waiting outside

254
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
I think this princess

255
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Is burning incense inside

256
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
I burned the incense before you were thirteen

257
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I hope you can burn the incense before thirteen

258
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Next time we come, we will fill up the rest

259
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Can't burn too much at a time

260
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Otherwise it looks too lazy

261
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
The sun is still bright

262
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Where are we going

263
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Are we going back

264
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Why are you here

265
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
It's getting dark

266
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
I'll send you back to the house

267
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Are you leaving

268
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
There is still time to sit

269
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
How long

270
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
If the third lady doesn't mind

271
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
You can stay and have dinner

272
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Then go in

273
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
I'm going to go

274
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
I'm going to go

275
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm going to go

276
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
I'm going to go

277
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
I'm going to go

278
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Girl, you're back

279
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
I brought a friend back to eat a meal

280
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Let's go

281
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Go

282
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Your Highness

283
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I came today

284
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I want to be a junior

285
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Put a incense on the row

286
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Please

287
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
I'm going to go

288
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
I don't know if the fourth lady

289
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Would you like to take me to Cui's mansion

290
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
I have little contact with the prince

291
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Aunt

292
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Go

293
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
If so

294
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Then take the prince to go around

295
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Please

296
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Shiyi

297
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Shiyi

298
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Uncle

299
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
I've mentioned the fourth lady

300
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
What did he say

301
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
He said

302
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
He really let you down

303
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
He really let you down

304
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
If I knew one day I would be rich

305
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I shouldn't have gone to Qinghe County

306
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
To see you

307
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
You're right

308
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
He doesn't want to marry me

309
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
He shouldn't have come to see me

310
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
He saw me and didn't marry me

311
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
How can I face the Cui family

312
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
I know

313
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
He thought I was a beast

314
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
He was rejected after seeing me

315
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
He was rejected after seeing me

316
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
He once said

317
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
The fourth lady

318
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
Is the only regret in his life

319
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Actually my uncle

320
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Was forced to cancel the marriage

321
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
The late emperor was afraid of Cui's

322
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
And the marriage of the prince

323
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
He was too powerful

324
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
So that year

325
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
A secret decree was sent to the palace

326
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Forced uncle to cancel the marriage

327
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
I don't want to ask for your forgiveness

328
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
I just hope

329
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
The fourth lady can open her heart

330
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
To feel better

331
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Your highness

332
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Please

333
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Your highness

334
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Please

335
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
This wine

336
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Is unique

337
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Please try it

338
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Is it good

339
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Not bad

340
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,600
The peach has spiritual effect.

341
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,760
Its rainbow-colored Ultra-large add gray.

342
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,280
This is called called sharkales.

343
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,740
Its flakes are made from shark fin,

344
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,060
and they are also from Qinghe County.

345
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,560
You won't see sharks on the Bulin sea.

346
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,280
Give it a try.

347
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,320
How is it?

348
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,020
Not bad.

349
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
I'll go to the gate tomorrow to see you off.

350
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
See you tomorrow.

351
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Then I'll go.

352
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
I'll go.

353
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
I'll go.

354
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
I'll go.

355
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
I'll go.

356
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
I'll go.

357
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
I'll go.

358
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
I'll go.

359
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
I'll go.

360
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
I'll go.

361
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
You're a criminal when you get out of the city,

362
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
but you're a phoenix when you get out of the city.

363
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
No wonder the people came to see you.

364
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,320
The people didn't know that the little boy they cherished was dead in the car.

365
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
You don't know the court in the palace.

366
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
I want to ask the military.

367
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Don't say the wrong words and get the military involved.

368
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
I will be close to you and protect the military.

369
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I brought you out myself.

370
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Don't embarrass me.

371
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
You have to remember it.

372
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
I dare not.

373
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Your Highness.

374
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Take care.

375
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Teacher.

376
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Take care.

377
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Take care.

378
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Go.

379
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,320
See you in the future.

380
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Depart!

381
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Where are you from?

382
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
The king of Taiyuan has entered the city.

383
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Why don't you let him in?

384
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
We're from Xizhou.

385
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Teacher.

386
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
His name is Jinrong, a man from Qihu.

387
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
The late emperor was once a judge in the palace.

388
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Now there is a woman who is in the palace as a concubine.

389
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
It's time.

390
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Go.

391
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
General.

392
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,320
Why did you give them the order?

393
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Did you see the man in white?

394
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
He should be...

395
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
The little boy.

396
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Your Highness.

397
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
Prince Guanglin.

398
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
General Jin.

399
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Please sit.

400
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
I saw a man at the gate of the city.

401
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
It seems to be Prince Nanchen.

402
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
It's him.

403
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Liu Yuan gave all the troops to a man named Qin Yan.

404
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Have you heard of it?

405
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
I have.

406
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
I don't know where this nameless man came from.

407
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
He can actually seduce the emperor.

408
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
He gave all the troops to him.

409
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
He is from Prince Nanchen's mansion.

410
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,320
The military counselor of Prince Nanchen's mansion, Xie Chong,

411
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
also stayed in the palace.

412
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
He will assist the emperor in the future.

413
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
He killed Zhao Teng Liu Yuan.

414
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,320
And here comes Xie Chong Qin Yan.

415
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,320
My son-in-law is very simple-minded.

416
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
He is always taken by others.

417
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Your Highness.

418
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Is my daughter doing well in the palace?

419
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
She didn't get the emperor's favor.

420
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,320
But with my relationship with the general,

421
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I will take care of Jin Ping for you.

422
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

423
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,320
I will rely on the general in the future.

424
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
It's easy to say.

425
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,320
In the future, I will be at your disposal.

426
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Prince Guang Ling.

427
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Father, you are here to see me?

428
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Let me see.

429
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,320
It seems that you are really angry with me.

430
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
I have no choice.

431
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,320
I have to judge for this useless son-in-law.

432
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
You judge for him?

433
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
He has forgotten his daughter.

434
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
In front of Prince Guang Ling,

435
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
you dare not talk nonsense.

436
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Good.

437
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Shiyi.

438
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
Miss Cui is in the mansion.

439
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Do you want to visit her?

440
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
The engagement is not here.

441
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
It's always like this.

442
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,320
It's the first day of the new year.

443
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,320
I will take the emperor to send her to Cui Mansion.

444
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Of course I can see her.

445
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Brother.

446
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Mother is afraid that you will escape from the battle.

447
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
She asked me to accompany you to the end.

448
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Your brother and I look like this kind of man.

449
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,320
The people of the Nancheng Mansion can't escape from the battle.

450
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Let's go.

451
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Prince Guang Ling.

452
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Third wife.

453
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
The Empress Dowager and the emperor can't leave the palace.

454
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,320
The princess has my brother to send to Cui Mansion.

455
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
The emperor's order.

456
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Cui Gong just passed away.

457
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
No need to take the wedding.

458
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Everything is in the past.

459
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Third mother received the edict.

460
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
You are not going to see me?

461
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
I have to go to the palace.

462
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
I have to go to the palace.

463
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
I have to go to the palace.

464
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Third mother received the edict.

465
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Xinhua.

466
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Xinhua.

467
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
This is not a game.

468
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Come down.

469
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Come down.

470
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
It's hard to bear to leave home.

471
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
The same with the princess.

472
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
I hope you won't mind.

473
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
I know the usual.

474
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Please.

475
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
I will go.

476
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
What are you burning at night?

477
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
The military report.

478
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
The military report.

479
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Why are you crying?

480
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Why are you crying?

481
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,320
I never thought of marrying you.

482
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
I have someone I love.

483
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
General Cui.

484
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Do you have someone in mind?

485
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
I want to tell you the truth.

486
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Yes.

487
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Tonight.

488
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
You plan to treat me as your wife.

489
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
I will be your wife.

490
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
I will be your wife.

491
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
You will be her.

492
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
The princess is not her.

493
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
Tonight you and me.

494
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
Not yourself.

495
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
But the princess and general of Beichen.

496
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
General.

497
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Please get on the bed.

498
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
You forgot the moon for an hour.

499
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
I miss sister.

500
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
Your highness.

501
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Prince Guang Ling.

502
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
It's so late.

503
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
Why didn't you go back to the palace?

504
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Are you still angry?

505
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
No.

506
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I know the engagement was cancelled.

507
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
I was in a hurry.

508
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
I made you embarrassed.

509
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
I should apologize to you.

510
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
It's over.

511
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
You don't have to take it to heart.

512
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,320
If you have nothing else, I will leave first.

513
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,320
Shiyi.

514
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
If I leave the palace.

515
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
I will not be the crown prince.

516
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I will leave Zhongzhou.

517
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Will you go with me?

518
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
No.

519
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
You want to be the crown princess.

520
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
The empress of the future.

521
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Never thought about it.

522
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
It has nothing to do with the crown princess.

523
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
I never wanted to enter the palace.

524
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
I have a chance to choose again.

525
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Why didn't you choose the one you wanted?

526
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
How do you know?

527
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
You are not the one I want.

528
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
How do you know?

529
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
I don't want to marry you.

530
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Prince Guang Ling, please be careful.

531
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
I have no choice when I was married.

532
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
Everything in the past is a marriage contract of the father and the son.

533
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
It's not my intention.

534
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,320
It's not what I want.

535
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,320
From now on, please forget about the daughter of Cui.

536
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
I will leave the palace.

537
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
I will leave the palace.

538
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
I will leave the palace.

539
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
I will leave the palace.

540
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
I will leave the palace.

541
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
I will leave the palace.

542
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
I will leave the palace.

543
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
I will leave the palace.

544
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
I will leave the palace.

545
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
I will leave the palace.

546
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
I will leave the palace.

547
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
I will leave the palace.

548
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
I will leave the palace.

549
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
I will leave the palace.

550
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
I will leave the palace.

551
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
One is a king who has no power.

552
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
One is a concubine who is not favored.

553
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
In this palace, you and I are like each other.

554
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,320
What do you want from me?

555
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,320
The second king.

556
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Although I am his brother,

557
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,320
I can't control which concubine he favors.

558
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,320
What if you become the emperor?

559
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
I will help you to be the emperor.

560
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
I will help you to be the emperor.

561
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
You are the daughter of Taiji Palace.

562
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
You have to give me a second wife.

563
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
I will give you a second wife.

564
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
I will give you a second wife.

565
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I will give you a second wife.

566
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
I will give you a second wife.

567
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
I will give you a second wife.

568
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I will give you a second wife.

569
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
I will give you a second wife.

570
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
I will give you a second wife.

571
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
I will give you a second wife.

572
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
I will give you a second wife.

573
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
I will give you a second wife.

574
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
I will give you a second wife.

575
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
I will give you a second wife.

576
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
I will give you a second wife.

577
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
I will give you a second wife.

578
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
I will give you a second wife.

579
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
I will give you a second wife.

580
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,920
Third wife,

581
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
all the houses have come.

582
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
They will be garlicguards.

583
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Princess, please go inside and rest.

584
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
Shiyi, come with me.

585
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Third Young Mistress is back.

586
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
Everyone sit down and talk.

587
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,320
Third Young Mistress, Cui Palace left suddenly.

588
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,320
We rushed here as soon as we got news.

589
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Why don't you send a letter first?

590
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,320
I'll arrange someone to entertain you.

591
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
I'm afraid you won't worry about it.

592
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,320
Third Young Mistress, now you only have you and Fourth Young Mistress left.

593
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,320
What are your plans in the future?

594
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,320
From now on, I will be in charge of the internal and external affairs of the Wushui House.

595
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,320
From now on, I will be in charge of the internal and external affairs of the Wushui House.

596
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,320
This is the betrothal gift. Please have a look.

597
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Who is this betrothal gift for?

598
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
It's a betrothal gift for you.

599
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
The Wushui House can't be without a master.

600
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,320
This is the betrothal gift I ordered to prepare overnight.

601
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
I thought it was a betrothal gift for Xiaobei.

602
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
I didn't expect it to be mine.

603
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Shiyi.

604
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
Mother.

605
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,320
Give it back to uncle.

606
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Yes.

607
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Yes.

608
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
If it's a betrothal gift for Xiaobei,

609
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
my brother will have three sons.

610
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,320
And two unmarried couples can arrange it.

611
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
If it's me, then it's not necessary.

612
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,320
We are also thinking for Third Young Mistress.

613
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
Thank you.

614
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
After Duke Cui left,

615
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,320
if the Wushui House doesn't marry us,

616
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,320
what if something happens?

617
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
We have no reason to help.

618
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
We are of the same kind.

619
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,320
If you want to help, you can help us in any way.

620
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
If you don't want to help us again,

621
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
I won't blame you.

622
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,320
We came with good intentions.

623
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Why do you have to be so rude?

624
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
You may not know.

625
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Before my brother left,

626
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,320
he recommended the eldest son and the fourth son to the court.

627
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,320
He also asked the third son to marry Princess Xinhua.

628
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
My little daughter Shiyi

629
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
has been a little boy since childhood.

630
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Whether it's the royal family of Liu,

631
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
the seven generations of the Empress Dowager,

632
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
or the rest of the Zhou family,

633
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,320
we will be a family in the future.

634
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
Since

635
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,320
you insist so much,

636
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,320
I won't force you.

637
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
This is not a concubine.

638
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,320
It's obviously a man who took my family business.

639
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
I'm not going to force you.

640
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,320
The man who is going to marry my mother today is called Cui Zheng.

641
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,320
His wife was the most successful in the six houses.

642
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Later, she offended the emperor.

643
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,320
She had no choice but to escape to Jiangshui.

644
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
That was also the most defeated time in our Cui family.

645
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Then your uncle became an official in the court.

646
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Our Cui family returned to the old prosperity.

647
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Those who fled to the South were gradually moved back.

648
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
Uncle asked them to go home.

649
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,320
But they wanted to take the position of the chief after uncle left.

650
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Fortunately, uncle left.

651
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
He won't be sad because of this.

652
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,320
You finally agreed to talk to me.

653
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
Master said

654
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
the old prosperity

655
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,320
always wanted to find a chance to destroy the Cui family.

656
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
If mother didn't do that,

657
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
not only mother and I,

658
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
the whole family would be in trouble.

659
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
I have to go.

660
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
I have been thinking about that night countless times.

661
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
I also regretted it.

662
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
That night,

663
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
it would be great if I could leave with him.

664
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
It's too pitiful

665
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
to let your father go on his own.

666
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
If it's for me,

667
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
I would rather die than be a prisoner.

668
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
I would rather die than be a prisoner.

669
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
I would rather die than be a prisoner.

670
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
I would rather die than be a prisoner.

671
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
I would rather die than be a prisoner.

672
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,320
I would rather die than be a prisoner.

673
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,320
I would rather die than be a prisoner.

674
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,320
The shadow is wandering, the boat is broken.

675
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
It's waiting.

676
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,320
Who is the dream for?

677
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
The heart is a stage.

678
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
I can't love, my heart is burning.

679
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
The reliance I yearn for.

680
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,320
The pain is burning deep.

681
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,320
It's waiting for me inside the box of averages.

682
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:52,680
The edges of the box are
