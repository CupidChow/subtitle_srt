00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 14

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Master, we're here.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Xie Yun and Cui Feng are left.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Senior Xie wrote a few letters,

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and he learned to ride horses.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He can come back to the capital at any time,

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and be the first master.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let Xie Yun guard the border in Beichen.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The only thing I'm worried about now is Cui Feng.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The new emperor ascends the throne,

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and summons the kings and emperors back to the capital.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Only Taiyuan Jun is not returning.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's better to let Shiyi write a letter to his family,

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and summon him back to the capital with the emperors.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What emperors?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are you so straightforward?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's the best reason to let Xie Yun come back

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to the capital with the sister getting married.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No, the emperors are right.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll write it now.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is the pen.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Write it here.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, I have to think about how to write this letter.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll write it here.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're so detailed,

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and you can think of these six words?

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can understand these six words

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
if I talk too much.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll write it here.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Miss Cui.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
General Feng.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is specially prepared for you.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Your Highness said that if you don't like it,

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
you can still make a new one.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's it.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The emissary was still nervous just now.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Why did he laugh suddenly?

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
My sister is getting married.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's a big wedding.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A bigger wedding is yet to come.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Go and pack up quickly.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No need.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Take ten days' food and leave immediately.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
With my brother's intelligence,

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can guess that this is a message to defeat the Taiyuan Army.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Because any general in the Nancheng Army

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
will not leave the battlefield because of private matters.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Taiyuan Army is my brother's battlefield.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And now, the king has called him back

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
after three blows.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The emperor is young.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
His life is hard to take on.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And the king of Nancheng has no intention of setting up a government.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The courtiers who are led by Cui Zheng

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
have secretly made the most suitable person to set up a government.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's Prince Guangling who has been like the previous emperor

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
since he entered the palace since childhood.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The marriage between Cui Zheng and Prince Regent

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
has become the most important thing

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
in the court of the imperial court.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In Xuan Guang Palace,

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
it's also a person who comes to visit.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
In the future, Cui will be the Princess Regent.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes, she might not be the Princess Regent.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I heard that she is the Princess Regent's daughter.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, she might not be the Princess Regent's daughter.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I heard that the Prime Minister has already made the decision.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Miss, just wait for the good news.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Senior Sister is finally back.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Master said that you went to Nanxiao.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
My heart has always been with you.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I rushed to here before your wedding.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Otherwise, I will regret it forever.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Master said that he would let me accompany you tonight.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to guard the military camp tonight.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't accompany you.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's important to have a good family.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Greetings, Third Miss Cui.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Greetings, Madam.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
These two are the generals of the King of Nanchen.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They have been fighting for the northern city for decades.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I heard that there is a female general named Feng in the King of Nanchen's family.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
She has made great contributions to the western country.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She saved thousands of women and children from the foreign tribes.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's this general.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you for protecting my country and saving the people.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Madam, you are too kind.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Mother, I want to go with Senior Sister tonight.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, I will go out of the palace first.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you, Mother.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Shiyi is from the Cui family.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The nuns should be sent by the Cui family.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let her stay in Xuan Guang Palace.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
As for the etiquette...

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We are using etiquette and ritual to tie her into the palace.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Can't she break her wish before she marries?

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Soldiers!

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The late emperor died for no reason.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They even took a child and ascended to the throne.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They wanted to stop the people.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They wanted to stop the people from killing the emperor.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They wanted to stop the people from killing the emperor.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You can ask them anything.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But I am a great favor to the late emperor.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
How can I just sit and watch?

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Today, I, Jin Rong, will raise my army.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
For the late emperor! For the moral justice of the world!

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
For the late emperor! For the late emperor!

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
For the late emperor! For the late emperor!

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I wear armor more often than women.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You look good in women's clothes.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is there anyone at Taiji Palace tonight?

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I guess so.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Forget it.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You want to go?

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:18,920
But I can't go because of my

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
illness.

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Your Highness.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He will become a father tonight.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why don't you go to Xuan Guang Palace now?

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How do you want me to answer?

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You never said anything to anyone.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I should keep my words in my heart.

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's go to the hospital.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Go.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's the 11th year since I came back to the north.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is the first time I stand in front of Taiji Palace.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's Princess Guang Ling.

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Lan Tang, don't kill me.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you don't stop me, I will be scolded.

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Three days and three nights!

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Is there a rule of three days and three nights in the palace?

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's okay. We can sneak in.

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
General Feng, show your general's aura.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go in while there is no one.

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You don't want to go in?

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I will be trapped here in the future.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I can't get out of here.

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Master.

149
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why are you here?

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Senior sister said that her shoes can't enter the palace.

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I want to take her to see it.

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Next time I come, it's not a year-end.

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Master, don't blame sister.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's all my idea.

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I didn't blame her.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
General Feng, don't you want to see the palace?

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Please.

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Please.

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's interesting.

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is the symbol of wealth and power.

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's the pinnacle of power in a country.

162
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How many people dream of this place?

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How many people neglect human feelings and use all means to get close to this place?

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why do you speak so lightly?

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I used to just listen and didn't look at it.

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Of course I would worry.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You are worried about it?

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Now I see it.

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Except for the bright yellow eyes, there is nothing strange.

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You speak too lightly.

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm going to find the master.

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Wait a while.

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Why do I have to wait a while?

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's rare to enter the palace.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Take a look.

176
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I've already seen it.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What's wrong?

178
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I have something to tell you.

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You haven't heard the sound of the tigris in the Tai Chi Palace, have you?

180
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can tell you.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You couldn't sleep the night before the wedding.

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know how to be a princess consort.

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You are Cui Guang's niece.

184
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Cui San Niang is the only daughter.

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You don't need to be a doctor.

186
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Although it's true, I'm still afraid of losing my mother's trust.

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm also afraid of causing trouble for the prince's family if I do something wrong.

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm afraid you won't live well.

189
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The palace is crowded.

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
How can it be not as good as the night?

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The wind blows gently.

192
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The wind blows gently.

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The wind blows gently.

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The wind blows gently.

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The wind blows gently.

196
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
These days, the emperor often wants to see the Imperial Palace.

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But my master is not here.

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Where did you go?

199
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I've been in the military camp outside the city.

200
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
These years, I live with the generals.

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I like it.

202
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's the same as in Xizhou.

203
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't live in the royal palace, I only like the military camp.

204
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
At first, I thought my master didn't like me being a maid.

205
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's troublesome to teach, so I tried to avoid it.

206
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
How could it be?

207
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I often get injured.

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't go to the palace.

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's because I'm afraid you'll be scared when you're young.

210
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I want to spend my life with you.

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
If this life is for you,

212
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll wait for the end of time to open.

213
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then we can meet again.

214
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I want to spend my life with you.

215
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I want to spend my life with you.

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I miss you so much.

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm so worried.

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Who can tell me?

219
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If I can't think of you,

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll try to protect you.

221
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I want to spend my life with you.

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If this life is for you,

223
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll wait for the end of time to open.

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I have a crush on someone since I was a child.

225
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I've never told anyone.

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Except my mother, no one knows.

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I dare not tell anyone.

228
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're scared.

229
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Second brother or third brother?

230
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I can't tell.

231
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You have a chance after you get married.

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's too late to tell.

233
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's okay if you don't tell.

234
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I won't feel sad if I don't see him.

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I think he's disappointed in you.

236
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He's not disappointed in you.

237
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Never.

238
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I didn't expect that I could be here.

239
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I used to be here.

240
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Have you been abroad?

241
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I have a north city there.

242
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
How can I go?

243
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I've never had a chance.

244
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's almost time.

245
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's put out the fire.

246
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's time to get off the train.

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes.

248
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Sister said she forgot to leave the key to the library before leaving Xizhou.

249
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Sister also said she would do her best to help the king of Guangling from today.

250
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And pray for the people.

251
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The door to the library is locked.

252
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Since you like it, I'll leave this key to you.

253
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Just take it as today's gift.

254
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Zhongzhou Wind and Snow with Gula.

300
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Enjoy.

301
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
In the South,

302
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I rarely see such a big snow.

303
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
In the West,

304
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
he likes to watch the snow on the roof.

305
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Why on the roof?

306
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Because he is the future Crown Princess.

307
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If it's not necessary,

308
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Gong Li and Cui Shi don't want him to show up in front of people.

309
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The year we first met in Qilan Temple, he just arrived in Junyu.

310
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Then why didn't you go to Donggong Temple?

311
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I promised him that I would never go there.

312
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's the same here.

313
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's the same Zhongzhong.

314
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He's wearing the same long-sleeved shirt.

315
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'll send him home.

316
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Donggong Temple

317
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,640
The

318
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Wengjing Sect is here.

319
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Your Highness.

320
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What is it?

321
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We can't talk about it until the ceremony is over.

322
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What did you say?

323
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The Wengjing Sect

324
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Wait in the palace.

325
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The Wengjing Sect

326
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Charge!

327
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
General Zhong.

328
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Master.

329
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What's the matter?

330
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The army is attacking the river.

331
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Go to the city and guard the camp.

332
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes.

333
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Miss.

334
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Your Highness can't come back for a while.

335
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
If you're hungry, we'll go prepare dinner.

336
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm not hungry.

337
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
General Zhong.

338
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
How dare you take His Majesty away?

339
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm a man of my word.

340
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I won't let you get away with this.

341
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Take him away.

342
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Your Highness, stay.

343
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Kill him.

344
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Kill him.

345
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Kill him.

346
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Your Highness.

347
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yuan Wuchong.

348
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You still have the nerve to come and see me.

349
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Your Highness.

350
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That was my last resort.

351
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I just wanted to find a chance to get you out of here.

352
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Please believe me.

353
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
How can I believe you?

354
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Your Highness.

355
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Your Highness.

359
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The Qishi clan is waiting

360
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
to negotiate with you.

361
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Please leave with me.

362
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Miss, why don't you rest earlier?

363
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
What time is it?

364
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's past midnight.

365
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's almost dawn.

366
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's winter night.

367
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's going to be late.

368
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Go ask what's wrong.

369
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Miss,

370
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
they said that the King of Guangling

371
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
ordered to lock the gate of the Eastern Palace

372
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and guard it.

373
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
No one is allowed to enter.

374
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What happened?

375
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't know.

376
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No one in the palace knows.

377
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Miss.

378
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Why did you lock the gate? What happened?

379
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't know.

380
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You've been in the palace. Why don't you know?

381
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I was ordered to guard the Eastern Palace since yesterday.

382
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Miss, there's no one you know in the palace.

383
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't panic.

384
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
My son-in-law

385
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
doesn't allow the maid of the Cui family to enter the Eastern Palace.

386
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I feel strange. What is he hiding from?

387
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
He has his own ideas.

388
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What I'm worried about is

389
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that the gates and gates of the palace are locked.

390
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Look at the streets.

391
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There's no one.

392
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I don't know what happened in Zhongzhou.

393
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I want the Emperor to enter the palace.

394
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I want to sleep.

395
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Shut up.

396
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
If you keep crying,

397
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'll make you cry.

398
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Find another child to be the Emperor.

399
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Empress Dowager.

400
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We're here.

401
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Let me.

402
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
This is

403
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
General Jin's camp?

404
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes.

405
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Where's General Jin?

406
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
He's waiting for you in the tent.

407
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Follow me.

408
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
General.

409
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Thank you for your help.

410
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's useless to say it nicely.

411
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Sit down.

412
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Drink with me.

413
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I've been on the horse carriage all the way.

414
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm not used to it.

415
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm not used to it.

416
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm not used to it.

417
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm not used to it.

418
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I've been on the horse carriage all the way.

419
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm not used to it.

420
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yang Shao.

421
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Pour the wine for the Empress Dowager.

422
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'll die with you

423
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
in the future.

424
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'll die with you in the future.

425
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Then I have to

426
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
thank you for your appreciation.

427
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
When are you leaving?

428
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Leaving?

429
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Where?

430
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
To Taiyuan.

431
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Zhou Sheng Chen is in Zhongzhou.

432
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
He must have sent troops to catch him.

433
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I know.

434
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I've been on the horse carriage all the way.

435
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I know.

436
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But I have to be careful

437
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
when I face the King of Nancheng.

438
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
This is the

439
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
new emperor?

440
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes.

441
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I heard

442
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
that the royal family of Liu has an unwritten rule.

443
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The crown prince

444
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
must first live with a gold man.

445
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
If he lives in the city,

446
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
he is the real emperor.

447
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
If he fails,

448
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
he must choose another person.

449
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
May I ask the Empress Dowager

450
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
if this little emperor

451
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
has ever lived with a gold man?

452
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This is urgent.

453
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Urgent?

454
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's just an excuse

455
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
for you to deceive the world.

456
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I had to do this

457
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
to stabilize the court.

458
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I don't want to

459
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
listen to your nonsense anymore.

460
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Prepare to live with a gold man.

461
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I want to check

462
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
if you, the little emperor,

463
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
have the right to the throne.

464
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Let's begin.

465
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yes.

466
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Let's go.

467
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
General,

468
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
we failed.

469
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
General,

470
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
if you don't know

471
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
how to create a gold man,

472
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
you can call the family of the Seventh Clan.

473
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I can let them arrange it.

474
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The family of the Seventh Clan?

475
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There are no family of the Seventh Clan here.

476
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Nonsense.

477
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's the family of the Seventh Clan

478
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
that I went out of the White Horse Temple.

479
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The family of the Seventh Clan?

480
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The family of the Seventh Clan?

481
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
How dare the family of the Seventh Clan

482
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
save you?

483
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Today,

484
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I'll let you die.

485
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The ones who saved you

486
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
were me

487
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and Prince Guang Ling.

488
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Liu Zi Xi?

489
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If it weren't for his imperial guards,

490
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
could this little girl get out?

491
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You...

492
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's because you

493
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
want to get into Rong Hua's wealth.

494
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Now,

495
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I should go with you.

496
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Come.

497
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Throw her and this fake emperor

498
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
into the river.

499
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
How dare you, Jin Rong!

500
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm the Empress Dowager.

501
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm the Empress Dowager.

502
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm the Empress Dowager.

503
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
What are you doing?

504
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Let me go.

505
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Prince Tai Yan!

506
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Prince Tai Yan!

507
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Prince Tai Yan!

508
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Prince Tai Yan!

509
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Prince Tai Yan!

510
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't want to die.

511
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Prince Tai Yan!

512
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Help!

513
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Help!

514
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Help!

515
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Help!

516
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Help!

517
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Help!

518
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Help!

519
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
General Yuan.

520
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
General Jin.

521
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
General Yuan has been watching

522
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
if Prince Regent

523
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
is afraid that I'll die?

524
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
General, you've wronged Prince Regent.

525
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
He said that Qi Zhen Zhen

526
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
killed his brother.

527
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
He hates him.

528
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
He said that he would see him

529
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
die in person.

530
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
He was relieved.

531
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I didn't expect that.

532
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So Prince Regent

533
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and the late emperor

534
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
are so close.

535
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I didn't expect that either.

536
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Come.

537
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Let's go in and drink.

538
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
General Yuan,

539
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
drink with me.

540
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Cheers.

541
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Cheers.

542
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm so happy.

543
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I've been angry with Qi Zhen Zhen

544
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
for a long time.

545
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm happy today.

546
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
General!

547
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
The war in the river is over.

548
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You didn't make it in three days?

549
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes.

550
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Where is Zhou Shengqian?

551
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
300 miles away.

552
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Retreat!

553
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Retreat!

554
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Is it Jin Rong's army?

555
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Your Highness.

556
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Your Highness.

557
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You've been scared these days.

558
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What happened?

559
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The emperor sent troops to attack the river.

560
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
What about my third brother?

561
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The military intelligence reported that

562
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the late emperor had left the Taiyuan Army.

563
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
He's still missing.

564
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
If he leaves early, he might be in a place

565
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
waiting to meet with his master.

566
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
When he comes back,

567
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
he might have news for you.

568
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Why did he lock the east palace?

569
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The imperial guards

570
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
rebelled against Qi's army.

571
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
After my uncle led the troops out of the battle,

572
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
they kidnapped the emperor

573
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and ran to Jin Rong.

574
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The emperor was kidnapped?

575
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
After my uncle left,

576
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
General Zhou and the imperial guards

577
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
were together to guard the city.

578
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
General Zhou...

579
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
was seriously injured.

580
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
He hasn't been able to wake up yet.

581
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Shiyi...

582
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Shiyi...

583
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000

589
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Shiyi...

590
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Shiyi...

591
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Shiyi...

592
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Shiyi...

593
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Shiyi...

594
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Shiyi...

595
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Shiyi...

596
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Shiyi...

597
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Shiyi...

598
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Shiyi...

599
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Shiyi...

600
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Shiyi...

601
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Shiyi...

602
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Shiyi...

603
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Shiyi...

604
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Shiyi...

605
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Shiyi...

606
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Shiyi...

607
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Shiyi...

608
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Shiyi...

609
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Shiyi...

610
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Shiyi...

611
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Shiyi...

612
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Shiyi...

613
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
