1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,060
Thank you.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
Do everything I say.

3
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,040
I don't have any other thoughts.

4
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,240
Otherwise, you will be the first one to be buried by His Majesty.

5
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,240
I am your Royal Uncle.

6
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,040
To me, you are more important than the Emperor.

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,720
Royal Uncle.

8
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,520
It's all my fault.

9
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
I didn't protect you well.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
I am sorry.

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Master is worried about Junior Sister.

12
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,920
Junior Sister is in the palace.

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
The Empress Dowager knows that she can control the forces of the forces.

14
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,880
She dares not to do anything.

15
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,320
Since Master is so sure, why are you still worried?

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,040
Go to Cui's Mansion.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,640
Go.

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,600
Your Royal Highness.

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,040
How did you get into the city?

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,640
I have always been here.

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
I came for this.

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't have many soldiers in Zhongzhou.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
I can only control the palace.

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
But I can't control the whole city.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,640
This must end in the palace walls.

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,520
In case the enemies find out and use this to attack.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,280
What is your plan?

28
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,600
To establish the new emperor instead of the Empress Dowager.

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,320
Your Highness.

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,000
How long do you want to lock us in?

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840
The Empress Dowager is busy with the ceremony.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
She can't make it.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,640
Please wait a moment.

34
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,240
After the Empress Dowager's busy,

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,240
I will meet you.

36
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,920
Who is on the stage?

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,120
Jiang Pin.

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,200
Elder Huang.

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,240
Jiang Pin.

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,080
What are you worried about?

41
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,120
After the enthronement, all the nobles and emperors will receive the edict.

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,240
Are you worried about your master's ending

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,320
in the capital as Gao's?

44
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,880
Are you not afraid?

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
I don't care about this.

46
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
My father has many children.

47
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
He doesn't care about me.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
My father got sick in recent years.

49
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Even the imperial decree asked him to come to the capital.

50
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
He didn't show up.

51
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm afraid there's an ambush waiting for him in Zhongzhou.

52
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Want him to come and save me in person.

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Impossible.

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
I am honored to be a queen.

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Yes.

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Even more honored.

57
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
From now on,

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
you can try to be the queen.

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

60
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

61
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Stop.

62
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
Your Majesty.

63
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Stop.

64
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,880
I just want to hold the Emperor's grandson for the Empress Dowager.

65
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,880
How can a swine like you hold the Emperor's grandson?

66
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Your Highness.

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
My lords.

68
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Third Miss Cui has come to see you.

69
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Third Miss Cui.

70
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,880
The army of Zhongzhou City is in the hands of the Empress Dowager.

71
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
If it is not necessary for you to come,

72
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
you should return to the Qinghe County as soon as possible.

73
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Thank you for your concern.

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Third Miss came here just to say a few words.

75
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Third Miss, please go ahead.

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Do you want a newborn child to ascend the throne?

77
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
There are many emperors in our dynasty.

78
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,880
There are many people who have ascended the throne.

79
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
As long as he is the blood of the late emperor,

80
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
he can inherit the throne.

81
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,880
What if the Empress Dowager is lying to you?

82
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
This...

83
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Third Miss Cui.

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Go.

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

86
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,880
From now on, you are the Emperor's half-sister.

87
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Get up.

88
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

89
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Follow me.

90
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Mother.

91
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Long live the Emperor.

92
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Emperor...

93
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,880
My lords, you...

94
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Prime Minister, why are you looking at me?

95
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I was looking at you, but you didn't move.

96
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
I didn't move.

97
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Your Highness.

98
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Your Highness.

99
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,880
We know that the Crown Prince died on the night of his birth.

100
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,880
You are holding a fake prince in your arms.

101
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Is this true?

102
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Nonsense.

103
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
It's a crime to say such a thing.

104
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I also think that this is absurd.

105
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,880
I wonder if the Empress Dowager can find a witness to face the truth.

106
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Who are you looking for?

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Speak.

108
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Who in this palace can prove what you say?

109
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Cui Shiyi.

110
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay. I'll call him.

111
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Prime Minister.

112
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Go. Bring him here.

113
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,880
I want to see what you can find out.

114
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Yes.

115
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Your Highness.

116
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,880
The Empress Dowager is calling Miss Cui.

117
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Yes.

118
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,880
If you want to go straight, you have to go straight.

119
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Go.

120
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Your Highness.

121
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Your Highness.

122
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Your Highness.

123
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

124
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Your Excellencies have a few questions for you.

125
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Listen carefully.

126
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Yes.

127
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,880
This question is about the late emperor.

128
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Your Excellencies, please ask.

129
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Have you seen the late emperor in the palace?

130
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Yes.

131
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Nonsense.

132
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
When did you see him?

133
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
That day, the Empress Dowager held a banquet.

134
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I was too drunk to go back to my bed.

135
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
That night, His Majesty called me in.

136
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Impossible.

137
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
You can't have seen him.

138
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,880
What did His Majesty say when he saw you?

139
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,880
His Majesty said that the prince is gone.

140
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
He is not well.

141
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,880
He wants to choose a suitable person from the royal family.

142
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Shut up.

143
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Your Highness, please let him finish.

144
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
I want to know the truth.

145
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
He is talking nonsense. He has never seen the late emperor.

146
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
When he entered the palace, the late emperor was still alive.

147
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Why is that impossible?

148
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
The late emperor was in a state of panic.

149
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
He couldn't even speak.

150
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
How could he see him?

151
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
This is the Empress Dowager's words.

152
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Isn't it her words?

153
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,880
You would rather believe a woman from the palace

154
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,880
than believe me, the Empress Dowager.

155
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
What the Empress Dowager has done all these years

156
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
is not worth believing.

157
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Continue.

158
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
His Majesty also said that

159
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Grand Tutor Xie's death was also strange.

160
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
How could this be?

161
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Cui Shi Yi, you are a man of your word.

162
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,880
I will cut your head off.

163
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Commanding Officer, Yuan Wuchu.

164
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
You...

165
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,880
You want to set the situation up.

166
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Miss Cui, let's stop here.

167
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Prime Minister, why don't you let him continue?

168
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
I think Miss Cui is a man of her word.

169
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
I can't believe it.

170
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,880
We can tell the truth when we face it.

171
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
What kind of identity is the Empress Dowager?

172
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
How can you tell the truth?

173
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,880
My lords, this concerns the reputation of the royal family.

174
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Please leave for a moment

175
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
and let me ask you.

176
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
As the royal family,

177
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,880
I will not favor anyone.

178
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Why didn't you help me earlier?

179
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880
The Empress Dowager heard me first.

180
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Zhou Shengchen is in Zhongzhou.

181
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,880
Why would she come?

182
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
You?

183
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,880
She asked me to bring you a message.

184
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
I have to go.

185
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
I have to go.

186
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
You?

187
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
She asked me to bring you a message.

188
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
You have no way out today.

189
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Does she want to go against me?

190
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,880
No, she wants you to make Liu Zizhen the emperor.

191
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
What about my grandson?

192
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
My grandson is still...

193
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Enough.

194
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,880
The Empress Dowager knows very well that your grandson is real and fake.

195
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,880
If the Empress Dowager wants to protect the royal family,

196
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,880
she should do as she says.

197
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,880
My lords, please.

198
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,880
I had no choice but to do this.

199
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
My lords,

200
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
His Majesty left in a hurry.

201
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,880
The prince went with his mother.

202
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
If everyone knows,

203
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,880
the late emperor will be in chaos.

204
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
I have to go.

205
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
I have to go.

206
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
I have to go.

207
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
The emperor is in chaos.

208
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,880
I had no choice but to do this.

209
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,880
I had planned to take the dead sea back to the heart

210
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
and tell the world that the world is ruined.

211
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
I will make him the new emperor.

212
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
The emperor of the Yi Dynasty.

213
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
You are just saying nonsense.

214
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,880
You are still lying.

215
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Yes, you are lying.

216
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Ridiculous.

217
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I will make him the new emperor.

218
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
The Empress Dowager

219
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Mother.

220
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
You like this child?

221
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Someone wants to see you.

222
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
The one from Xizhou

223
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,880
is in the bedroom where she lived before.

224
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Go.

225
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
You are like your own child.

226
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
You still don't want to let go.

227
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Miss Cui.

228
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Why are you all wearing the clothes from the palace?

229
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
The princess asked for it.

230
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Inside.

231
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
I am here.

232
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
You wait outside.

233
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Yes.

234
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Yes.

235
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Come in.

236
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Yes.

237
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
You have to hold her.

238
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Put her down.

239
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Yes.

240
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Hui Er was only six years old when she got into the palace.

241
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Dao Zou was only 19 years old.

242
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
19 years old.

243
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,880
She was called the rightful owner in the four seas.

244
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
But I couldn't protect her.

245
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Teacher has tried his best.

246
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Look, she is asleep.

247
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Is it fast?

248
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,880
The child sleeps as soon as he says.

249
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,880
coercive kind of child

250
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Second round,

251
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,880
just two more minutes.

252
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Wait,

253
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
yes,

254
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
it's her.

255
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Here you are.

256
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,160
Why didn't you leave?

257
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,620
I was afraid you'd get into trouble

258
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,640
and there would be an accident.

259
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,900
Crying won't be embarrassing.

260
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
I didn't cry.

261
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,760
It's better in Xi State.

262
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,320
With us here, who would dare to bully you?

263
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,980
Of course, Xi State is better.

264
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,720
Master, Feng Qiao and the military strategist are on their way.

265
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,620
They'll arrive in ten days.

266
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,020
Okay, I understand.

267
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,540
Senior sister.

268
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,660
My mother has already agreed to let her divorce the princess.

269
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,860
Doesn't the princess have a child?

270
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,020
No, it's fake.

271
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,860
They have no relationship.

272
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,020
They have a separate intention.

273
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,140
But they are tied up by Cui and Qi.

274
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,340
They can't be free.

275
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,900
When everything is settled,

276
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,820
I'll call the governor of Taiyuan Army back.

277
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,900
You can ask him yourself.

278
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,940
What are you laughing at?

279
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,780
Seeing you laugh,

280
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,460
it reminds me of the past.

281
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,140
When will you leave?

282
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,500
I don't know.

283
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,740
You don't know?

284
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,540
There are still many things I haven't done.

285
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,060
It's not a matter of a month or two.

286
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,460
Then,

287
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,340
at least one or two months.

288
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,700
This child is so poor.

289
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,460
I don't know what happened.

290
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,220
I don't know who his parents are.

291
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,060
Who will take care of him in the future?

292
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,140
Leave it to me.

293
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,940
You?

294
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,940
In my mansion,

295
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,140
there are ten orphans.

296
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,060
They have grown up now.

297
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,980
They are doing very well.

298
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,020
Hai Chi.

299
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,020
This is

300
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,300
Chou despite that he knows all it takes 8667 existent in this world

301
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,060
초�這位便是

302
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,100
Liu Zizhen greets Shuling palace.

303
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,180
Why are you laughing?

304
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,660
How can we call Shuling palace by master?

305
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
Come on, get up.

306
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Why did you hug me?

307
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Father always said that the Imperial Palace is a good person.

308
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,320
This child knows who can protect him.

309
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Come on.

310
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Are you afraid to be an emperor?

311
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
I'm afraid.

312
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,820
The Emperor of the High Ancestral Tribe is five years old.

313
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,820
The late emperor is six years old.

314
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,820
They are not afraid. You don't have to be afraid.

315
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,820
The Imperial Palace wants to choose a good Grand Tutor for you.

316
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Before that,

317
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
this Miss Cui is your teacher.

318
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,820
Greetings, teacher.

319
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,820
How can I teach her?

320
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,820
Today, you, A'Jiu, are the Grand Tutor.

321
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,820
I believe you can do it.

322
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,820
Your Highness, Prince Guangling wants to see you.

323
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Let him in.

324
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
Yes.

325
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Your Highness, we'll leave first.

326
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
Let's go.

327
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,820
Prince Guangling, Prince Jin is here.

328
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Prince Guangling, Prince Jin is here.

329
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Thank you for your kindness.

330
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,820
You're welcome.

331
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,820
I don't know if you can allow me

332
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,820
to talk to my fiancee alone.

333
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
Okay.

334
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,820
On the way here, the maid said

335
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,820
that you were in the Eastern Palace for days.

336
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,820
I don't want to be late for this.

337
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,820
Xia Yuan, let's get married.

338
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,820
Let me tell my mother first.

339
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,820
I'll tell your mother in person.

340
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,820
Where have you been these days?

341
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,820
Xuan Guang Hall.

342
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
Xuan Guang Hall?

343
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
It's been a long time since I've been here.

344
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
The facilities are very good.

345
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
I'm sorry to have to bother you.

346
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,820
I'll send some common materials

347
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
to your palace later.

348
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

349
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Your Highness, please.

350
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,820
I'll go to the palace now.

351
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Okay.

352
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
Greetings, Prince Guangling.

353
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Get up.

354
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,820
The medicine in this hall is too strong.

355
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
I heard that you said

356
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,820
a few good words

357
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,820
for me in the palace.

358
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
I'm telling the truth.

359
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
After Cui Guang's death,

360
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,820
you were able to get out of the palace.

361
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
After Cui Guang's death,

362
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
you want to be the master of Cui clan?

363
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,820
I dare not.

364
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
What do you dare not do?

365
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,820
Dare not tell the truth?

366
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,820
Go and get the general here.

367
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Yes.

368
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,820
Thank you, Prince Guangling.

369
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
I'm Yuan Wuchu.

370
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,820
Greetings, Prince Guangling.

371
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,820
Get up.

372
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,820
You're looking for a master in Cui clan.

373
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,820
I'm looking for a bride.

374
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,820
This is my sincerity.

375
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,820
The imperial guards are in my hands.

376
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,820
Prince Guangling knows that you're used to

377
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,820
living in Prince Nancheng's mansion.

378
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,820
He's afraid that you're not used to coming to Zhongzhou.

379
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,820
So he moved all the good things in the Eastern Palace.

380
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,820
The mansion is not what you think.

381
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,820
I live in a normal house.

382
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,820
What kind of mansion is it?

383
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,820
The mansion is full of soldiers and servants.

384
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Only in my house

385
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,820
is there a maid brought by Cui family.

386
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,820
Is there no beauty in your mansion?

387
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,820
No.

388
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,820
There are countless women in the royal family in the capital.

389
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,820
They often come to the palace to ask for the empress dowager's hand.

390
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,820
Yes.

391
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
The prime minister is old.

392
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,820
There are many women in the mansion.

393
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,820
Really?

394
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,820
Can I ask?

395
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
What kind of face is he?

396
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,820
Is he really like the one in the world?

397
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,820
He's got a beautiful face.

398
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,820
He's the best in the world.

399
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,820
It's because he's from the Imperial Palace.

400
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,820
The world is getting bigger.

401
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,820
He's better than the world.

402
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Your Majesty.

403
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,820
Your Highness.

404
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,820
This is my uncle,

405
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,820
the prince of Nanchen.

406
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Your Highness.

407
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,820
I need to talk to my teacher.

408
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,820
You may leave.

409
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,820
Yes.

410
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,820
I'm leaving.

411
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,820
I've been teaching her to recite.

412
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,820
She's been coming to see her brother every night.

413
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,820
I've been taught by you.

414
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,820
I'm useless.

415
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,820
You're useful.

416
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,820
You taught me yesterday

417
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,820
to be a noble, to design and to be a good person.

418
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,820
You taught me well.

419
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,820
Master.

420
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,820
Seventh Empress has lost her hair.

421
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,820
Master. Seventh Empress has lost her hair.

422
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
Please forgive me.

423
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,820
Uncle, save me. Uncle.

424
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
Uncle.

425
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,820
Your hair loss

426
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,820
is to let me see you.

427
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,820
Tell me. What do you want to say?

428
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,820
Hui.

429
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,820
The Empress wants to kill me.

430
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,820
She wants to kill her own mother.

431
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,820
She wants to kill her own mother.

432
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
Do I just let her kill me?

433
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,820
Zhou Shizhen.

434
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,820
You're not selfish.

435
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,820
You don't understand my feelings.

436
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,820
My son,

437
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,820
my biological son,

438
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,820
imprisoned me.

439
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,820
Wanted to kill me.

440
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,820
I never wanted to

441
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,820
have a child with him.

442
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,820
So you admit

443
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,820
that you killed him.

444
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,820
No.

445
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,820
I didn't kill him.

446
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,820
It was Qin Yan.

447
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,820
Qin Yan poisoned him.

448
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,820
Qin Yan is your man.

449
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,820
If this news

450
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,820
is spread, you can't get away with it.

451
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,820
The traitors of the King of Nancheng

452
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,820
have their own ways of killing.

453
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,820
Qin Yan will die sooner or later.

454
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,820
But he will not

455
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,820
spare you.

456
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,820
You killed Grand Tutor Xie, right?

457
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,820
No.

458
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,820
No.

459
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
I didn't kill him.

460
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
You can't

461
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
blame me for his crimes.

462
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,820
He is a high-ranking family.

463
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
He is also

464
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,820
sent by your brother to supervise you.

465
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
I killed him.

466
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,820
You should thank me.

467
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,820
Not kill me.

468
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,820
I'm asking you.

469
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Yes or no?

470
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,820
I'm your

471
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,820
sister-in-law.

472
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,820
I'm your sister-in-law.

473
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,820
There are many concubines in the harem.

474
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,820
Only me.

475
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,820
Only me.

476
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,820
I gave birth to a prince

477
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
for your brother.

478
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,820
Your brother loves you since childhood.

479
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,820
For his sake,

480
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,820
please spare my life.

481
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Please spare my life.

482
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,820
Qi Zhenzhen,

483
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,820
the crime of

484
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,820
killing the emperor,

485
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
treason,

486
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,820
and killing loyal subjects,

487
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,820
you have three crimes.

488
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,820
Now,

489
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,820
instead of defending yourself,

490
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,820
you should plead for the Qishi.

491
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,820
How dare you!

492
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,820
I dare not.

493
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
You killed the late emperor.

494
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,820
You will be punished.

495
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,820
Only then can the Qishi live.

496
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Come!

497
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
The Empress Dowager wants to marry Xue Fa

498
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,820
and marry into the White Horse Temple.

499
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,820
From now on,

500
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,820
there is no Empress Dowager in the court.

501
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,820
Take her to the temple.

502
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,820
Yes.

503
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,820
You...

504
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,820
The Empress Dowager

505
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,820
The Empress Dowager

506
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,820
The Empress Dowager

507
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,820
The Empress Dowager

508
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,820
The Empress Dowager

509
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,820
The Empress Dowager

510
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,820
The Empress Dowager

511
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,820
The Empress Dowager

512
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
The Empress Dowager

513
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,820
The Empress Dowager

514
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,820
The Empress Dowager

515
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,820
The Empress Dowager

516
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,820
The Empress Dowager

517
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,820
The Empress Dowager

518
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,820
The Empress Dowager

519
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,820
The Empress Dowager

520
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,820
The Empress Dowager

521
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,820
The Empress Dowager

522
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,820
The Empress Dowager

523
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,820
The Empress Dowager

524
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,820
The Empress Dowager

525
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,820
The Empress Dowager

526
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,820
True and false

527
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,620
When your are at the army camp,

528
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:44,620
If you dare betray the King, I will chase you to the end of the world and kill you.

529
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
You will die if you shout out.

530
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,620
This is the traitor of King of Southern City.

531
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,620
Please pass on the message to your governor.

532
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Uncle.

533
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
You don't know how to write?

534
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,620
King of Guangling said he would marry teacher next month.

535
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Yes.

536
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,620
Next month.

537
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,620
What should I send to teacher?

538
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
You are his teacher.

539
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,620
You must know what he likes.

540
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,620
What he likes...

541
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
He likes books.

542
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,620
Mother said the books of Cui's family are not as good as those in the palace.

543
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,620
Your mother is right.

544
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,620
Then I won't be pleased with the books.

545
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
What else does he like?

546
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,620
What did you send to him in the Imperial Palace?

547
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
I sent...

548
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
The traitor.

549
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Did you read the whole bowl? Is it important?

550
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,620
Yes.

551
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,620
This is the seal my teacher took every time he fought in the battle.

552
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,620
What are you doing?

553
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,620
My hometown is in the west.

554
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,620
I was saved by King of Southern City.

555
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Please tell me more about King of Southern City.

556
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Yes.

557
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,620
Okay.

558
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
Yes.

559
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,620
Okay.

560
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,620
Where is your hometown?

561
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,620
Qingcheng.

562
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,620
Qingcheng?

563
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,620
That is the longest battle the king has fought.

564
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
I was still young at that time.

565
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,620
Mother said if there was no King of Southern City, we would be defeated.

566
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
I was young at that time, too.

567
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
I heard from my brother.

568
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,620
After Qingcheng was captured, my teacher led ten thousand cavalry.

569
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,620
The enemy kept advancing day and night, but there were thirteen thousand enemy troops.

570
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
This was half a month.

571
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,620
Twenty days later, the reinforcements arrived at the city.

572
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,620
The officials did not expect anything.

573
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,620
But they called on the city wall.

574
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,620
They were hung by dozens of long cloths of Yajingse.

575
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,620
The defeat was unbearable.

576
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,620
They were flying in the wind.

577
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,620
Yajingse is the royal flag of King of Southern City.

578
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:29,620
The cloths flying on the wall of the city wall were said to be unbreakable.

579
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,620
Twenty thousand soldiers cheered the sky with their lives.

580
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,620
They cheered the king with their lives.

581
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
This is the great disaster of Qingcheng.

582
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,620
Go ahead.

583
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,620
What else do you want to know?

584
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,620
Did the teacher cry when he left the mansion?

585
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,620
Didn't he cry?

586
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
He cried.

587
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
It's just that he likes to cry secretly.

588
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,620
I didn't see it with my own eyes.

589
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,620
What's wrong?

590
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,620
This is the king's homeland.

591
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
It's not the most dangerous place.

592
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,620
I'm sorry.

593
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,620
I'm sorry.

594
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,620
I'm sorry.

595
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,620
I'm sorry.

596
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
I'm sorry.

597
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,620
I'm sorry.

598
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
I'm sorry.

599
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,620
I'm sorry.

600
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,620
I'm sorry.

601
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,620
I'm sorry.

602
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,620
I'm sorry.

603
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,620
Let's go to the city.

604
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,620
Master, we're here.

605
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
Xie Yun and Cui Feng are missing.

606
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,620
Senior Xie wrote a few letters.

607
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,620
He's learned to ride a horse again.

608
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,620
He can come back to the ice at any time.

609
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,620
He's the pioneer of the master.

610
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,620
Let Xie Yun guard the border in Beichen.

611
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,620
The only thing I'm worried about now is Cui Feng.

612
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,620
The new emperor ascended the throne.

613
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,620
He summoned the kings and the envoys to return to the capital.

614
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Only Taiyuan Jun is not returning.

615
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
Why don't you ask Shiyi to write a letter to him?

616
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,620
Use private letters to summon him back to the capital.

617
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,620
What private letter?

618
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
What are you selling?

619
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
Just say it.

620
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,620
Just say it.

621
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,620
It's the best reason for my sister to marry and let my brother come back to the capital.

622
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,620
Just pretend I didn't say it.

623
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
No.

624
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,620
You're right.

625
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,620
I'll write it right now.

626
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
If you write it here, write it here.

627
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
No.

628
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,620
I have to think about how to write this letter.

629
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,620
I'll write it right now.

630
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,620
Who are you here for?

631
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,620
My heart is a stage.

632
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,620
I can't love you.

633
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,620
My heart is burning.

634
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,620
I'm dependent on you.

635
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,620
I'm suffering from pain.

636
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:28,620
I'm in pain.

637
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,620
I can't help thinking about you.

638
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,620
I'm suffering from pain.

639
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
The world is changing.

640
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,620
The sword is sharp.

641
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,620
The sword is sharp.

642
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,620
The story is like a black-eyed flower.

643
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,620
The city is full of sorrow.

644
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,620
I'm lonely.

645
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,620
I'm lonely.

646
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:10,620
I'm lonely.

647
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,620
I can't help thinking about you.

648
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,620
I'm suffering from pain.

649
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,620
The world is changing.

650
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,620
The sword is sharp.

651
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:33,620
The story is like a black-eyed flower.

652
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,620
The sword is sharp.

653
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,620
The story is like a black-eyed flower.

654
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:45,620
The story is like a black-eyed flower.
