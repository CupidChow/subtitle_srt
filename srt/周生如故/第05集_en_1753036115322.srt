1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you for watching!

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you for watching!

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Where is the musician that Nan Xiao invited?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He poured a pot of tea.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm punishing him for over-examining.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Teacher, you're bullying Junior Sister and can't speak.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you playing with her?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The tea is worth a thousand gold.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But she can destroy it at will.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Shouldn't you punish her?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I feel wronged.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You should know that

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
if you pour a cup of tea,

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it will be enough for the people for a month.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If you like tea,

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll buy you some.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But I don't want you to be too proud.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know how hard it is for the people.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You should be a good example

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
for the future Crown Princess Consort.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What?

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm a disciple of Prince Chen.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I should remember that

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have nothing to do with the Crown Princess Consort's name.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A disciple?

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're willing to be punished?

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
These teas are all from Nan Xiao.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There are also from the Jido dynasty.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm the master of the Jido dynasty.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait for me to look for it.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This one?

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, it's this one.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Look, there are words on it.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But it says Rokui on it.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Rokui is not tea?

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Then where did the tea go?

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
When did you learn Jido?

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I went to the temple to pray for you.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I saw many monks from the dynasty

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and learned from them.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You must have learned their language often.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I will go when I miss you.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No wonder you were so happy

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
when you went to the battlefield.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You said that you have a little sister

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
waiting for you at home

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
so that you don't lose your life.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Your third brother knows you best.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
These four are the four most famous

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
These four are the dead in the palace

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
to protect me.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I am Zhou Tianxing.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I am Fengqiao.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I know you.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You are the official who

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
pacified the rebellion of the six towns with the king of Nan.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Where is Uncle?

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Master is in the military camp.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He left us to entertain you.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Uncle really loves his soldiers.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It seems that he is going to spend the New Year with the soldiers.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I am sorry.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Is there anything

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that is strange in the palace?

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't want him to feel

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that he is being subdued

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the first time he sees me.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There is a garden in the palace

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
where the pheasant and birds gather.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
My sister often practices there.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Go to that table.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I will go.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Everyone in the palace is talking about Prince Guangli.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They say he has been handsome and beautiful since childhood.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He is a rare and beautiful man.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He is a rare and beautiful man.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why do you want to be the top of the appearance?

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He is not a bad thing.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The king of Xi Yan, Murong Chong,

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
was a woman.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He was imprisoned in Nan Chong

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and was humiliated.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Isn't it because he was born good?

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You have been

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
a rare and beautiful woman.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Whether it is a blessing or not,

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
it is a guest.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can't be a guest.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You are more like a descendant of Cui.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you were me,

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
it would be fine.

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Cui Shi Yi greets Your Highness.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Your Highness.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Your Highness.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Your Highness.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is not Zhong Zhou.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Please get up.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This year, we don't have to look at the paintings anymore.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
In Zhong Zhou, I often hear that the prince of Nan Chen's mansion is very handsome and beautiful.

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I often hear that the prince of Nan Chen's mansion is very handsome and beautiful.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Now, I am the only one who is true.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Now, I am the only one who is true.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Your Highness, don't be misled by the people.

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What?

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
My master

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
is not a saint.

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But he is the king who guards the border.

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The king's mansion must be in a state of chaos

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to win the hearts of people.

139
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Are you afraid that I will be like King Zhu

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and think he is suspicious?

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Shi Yi doesn't dare to think so.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I have eyes

143
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and heart.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Those royal and Han generals

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
who have several hundred thousand military power

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
will all rebel.

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Or they will wait for the time to rebel.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Only the royal uncle will not move.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have him.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How lucky I am.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This is not the right way.

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you okay?

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I am fine.

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I am just worried about you. Let me see.

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
There is a doctor in the mansion.

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I will see it myself.

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let the doctor see it.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes.

159
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How did you get hurt so easily?

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:20,520
Is this a

161
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
This is a strange place.

162
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Highness, how is it?

163
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
It's okay.

164
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
I am fine.

165
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
I can't tell you clearly

166
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,520
when I see her.

167
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I am fine.

168
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I can't tell you clearly when I see her.

169
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
I can't tell you clearly when I see her.

170
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I am dead.

171
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
I am dead.

172
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
But I am still human.

173
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I am human.

174
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
I can understand.

175
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
She is different from the picture.

176
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
She is different from the picture.

177
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
She won't stop me from looking.

178
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
She won't stop me from looking.

179
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
She will be afraid.

180
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
Then she will avoid me.

181
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Uncle Wang is not in the mansion.

182
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I have to find a suitable reason to see her.

183
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
I have to find a suitable reason to see her.

184
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Today is your birthday.

185
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
What do you want?

186
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Listen to the gift I prepared for you.

187
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
You are my guest.

188
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
You don't have to pay.

189
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

190
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,520
You are finally here.

191
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

192
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
You have two people.

193
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
What can I do for you?

194
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
I prepared some wine and wine.

195
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
I want to go to the military camp with you.

196
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
I want to see your birthday.

197
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
The whole mansion is like a family.

198
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
I want...

199
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Shiyi's birthday

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I want to spend it with my family.

201
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
But Wang Jun is a good person.

202
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I am an outsider.

203
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
I mean

204
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
no military level.

205
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
If I take the imperial decree

206
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
I will take the emperor to the three kings.

207
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
I will arrange it right away.

208
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
I just want to give you a birthday gift.

209
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
I don't know the imperial decree.

210
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
I am sorry to make you embarrassed.

211
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,520
It's okay.

212
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Your Highness, the poison is completely gone.

213
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Shiyi is here.

214
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Isn't she in the mansion?

215
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Prince Guangling brought her here.

216
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
He said he wanted to hold a birthday party for her.

217
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
He wanted to take this opportunity to reward the emperor.

218
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Go and welcome her.

219
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Uncle.

220
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Prince Guangling.

221
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Why are you hurt?

222
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Jingyun, take Shiyi to see the military doctor.

223
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Yes.

224
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Prince Guangling, go to the tent and rest.

225
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
No hurry.

226
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
It's rare to have a chance to enter the military camp.

227
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
I don't know if uncle is free.

228
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Take me around.

229
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Okay.

230
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Follow me.

231
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Come on, girl.

232
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Master won't be at ease if you don't let the military doctor take a look.

233
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Although the imperial doctors in the palace are well-educated and have high ranks,

234
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
their experience is far less than our military doctors.

235
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
General, you are too much.

236
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
I have used the best medicine.

237
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
But I have military medicine here.

238
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
It's better than this medicine.

239
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
I'll get it right now.

240
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Okay.

241
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Okay.

242
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
What did he bring you?

243
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
He brought me gifts.

244
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
You are shy.

245
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
I brought you some wine.

246
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Okay. If you don't want to say it,

247
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
I won't say it.

248
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Okay.

249
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Be careful.

250
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Put it here.

251
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Yes.

252
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
It smells good.

253
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
It's all your favorite.

254
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Master, I brought you some Tusu.

255
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Tusu?

256
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Compared with the food prepared tonight,

257
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
it's a little sour.

258
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
I'll go get some fat sheep.

259
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Knife.

260
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Here it is.

261
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
This cup of Tusu

262
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
is for our guests from afar.

263
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Prince Guangli.

264
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Thank you, Uncle.

265
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
I'll also use this wine

266
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
to toast to all the soldiers.

267
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
If you win,

268
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
you don't need the emperor to help the city.

269
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

270
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Thank you, Prince Guangli.

271
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

272
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
This cup is for

273
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
the soldiers who died in the civil war.

274
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Thank you.

275
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
May peace be upon you.

276
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
May there be no more smoke

277
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
in the country.

278
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
May the people of the north

279
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
have a long life.

280
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
May the people of the north

281
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
have a long life.

282
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Finally, I want to say

283
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
today is Shiyi's birthday.

284
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
I hope she can be happy

285
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
here every day.

286
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Shiyi,

287
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
you've grown up again.

288
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Thank you, Master.

289
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Okay.

290
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Sit down, everyone.

291
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Here, Chen.

292
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Sit here.

293
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Okay.

294
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Thank you, Uncle.

295
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Shiyi,

296
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
who is that?

297
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
It's the military counselor Xie Chong.

298
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Your Highness.

299
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
The climate in Xizhou is different from Zhongzhou.

300
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Your Highness, drink this bowl of medicine while it's hot.

301
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Go to bed early.

302
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Cheers.

303
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Shiyi.

304
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Brother San.

305
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
You...

306
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
I can talk now.

307
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Great.

308
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Great.

309
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
If Aunt knows

310
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
you can talk now,

311
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
she will be so happy.

312
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Okay, don't stand there.

313
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
Sit down.

314
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Here, Brother.

315
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Here,

316
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
drink some for Shiyi.

317
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Shiyi.

318
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Everyone, today is my sister's birthday.

319
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
And she can finally

320
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
talk.

321
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I'll drink to you all.

322
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Cheers.

323
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Cheers.

324
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Cheers.

325
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I heard

326
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
a lot of things along the way.

327
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
I specially memorized them

328
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
and want to recite them to you.

329
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
What are they?

330
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
The beauty of the valley is rare.

331
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
There are the valley and not the skin.

332
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
There are the skin and not the valley.

333
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
And the little prince of Nanchen

334
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
is the only one

335
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
who has both the valley and the skin.

336
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
Yes.

337
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
The people said

338
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
the valley is more rare than the king's.

339
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Yes.

340
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Shiyi.

341
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
There are outsiders in the army.

342
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Don't talk nonsense.

343
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
How can there be outsiders in the army?

344
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Prince Guangling is here.

345
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
I'll talk to him again.

346
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Cui Feng, tell me about Shouyang.

347
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Shouyang is not a big deal.

348
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
It's just that the soldiers miss you

349
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
and are waiting for you to go.

350
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Shouyang

351
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
was destroyed by the army.

352
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Why are you hiding there?

353
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
I'm here to ask for forgiveness.

354
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Sit down first.

355
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,520
What crime did you commit?

356
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,520
I know the rules of the army, but I didn't stop King Guang Ling.

357
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,220
He is the king, you are the daughter of a minister.

358
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
How can you stop him?

359
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,720
But you can spend a birthday with us in the camp.

360
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
We are all very happy.

361
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
King Guang Ling

362
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Wake up.

363
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Wake up!

364
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,320
Wake up!

365
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
Come on, have a gala album.

366
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,120
I drink it, but you don't?

367
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Okay, I'll drink with you.

368
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,120
The old saying goes, the flower is like a shadow.

369
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,120
It's the new year.

370
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm afraid of getting drunk.

371
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,120
The old saying goes, this cup of wine

372
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,120
doesn't ask for a future, doesn't fear wealth.

373
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,120
I only wish to bless my master and my senior sisters.

374
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,120
May they live in peace and harmony.

375
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
The report.

377
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Where is the report?

378
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
It's been two months.

379
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Why hasn't the report come back yet?

380
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,120
It's never been that long.

381
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,120
I don't even know where the report is.

382
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
If my master dies,

383
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,120
where will I find it?

384
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,120
The report is in the north.

385
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,120
It's in the east and the west of the Western Zhou.

386
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,120
I know it's me thinking of you,

387
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,120
but I can't stop.

388
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
If he dies,

389
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,120
I don't want you to find it.

390
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Where is he dead?

391
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Where is he buried?

392
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,120
I hear the sound of the flute, but I can't stop.

393
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,120
I think of you, but I can't stop smiling.

394
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,120
You're always asleep.

395
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Where is he dead?

396
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Where is he buried?

397
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Why won't you let me find you?

398
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
If he dies,

399
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,120
everything left behind is empty.

400
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Even if you find it,

401
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,120
there's nothing else but sadness.

402
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
I'm sorry.

403
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Go to sleep.

404
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Go to sleep.

405
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Master, did you see Shiyi?

406
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,120
She's in my tent.

407
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
You came here so late at night.

408
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,120
I almost squeezed out my master.

409
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Why don't you stay and stay with her?

410
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
What about you?

411
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I'll just walk around.

412
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
You don't have to worry about me.

413
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
You...

414
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
You used to play the zither.

415
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
You used to sleep in master's study.

416
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
You're the one who did that.

417
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Shiyi.

418
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
What?

419
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Where have you been these two years?

420
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Master, your second brother and I went to the north.

421
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
After the six-day war,

422
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
we went to Pingzhou and Shanggu.

423
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Your third brother and fourth sister are in the west.

424
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Your brother is in Shouyang.

425
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,120
We rarely see each other.

426
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,120
My brother is going back to Cui's family.

427
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Well, let's not talk about him.

428
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,120
I have something to give you.

429
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,120
This is a protective armor that a princess wears.

430
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,120
I'm afraid she'll lose it, so I've been wearing it.

431
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
It's for you.

432
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
I'm not going to the battlefield. I don't need this.

433
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Just take it. Don't refuse.

434
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,120
I got everything from my master.

435
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
I have nothing.

436
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
I finally found a treasure.

437
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
You must take it.

438
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,120
In my heart, you're the princess of our Nancheng Mansion.

439
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
This thing is for you.

440
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
What's so good about a princess?

441
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Everyone envies the golden jade leaf.

442
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
But I don't envy the princess.

443
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
I envy you.

444
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Envy me?

445
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,120
You and your second brother, Nancheng Jun,

446
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
suffered a lot with your master.

447
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
I'm here to enjoy it.

448
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
I don't have any contribution.

449
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Actually, we're all late.

450
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
When the master was in the most difficult time,

451
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,120
he survived by himself.

452
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Do you know how many soldiers the late emperor gave him?

453
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,120
In those years, the royal family used a lot of soldiers.

454
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
They refused to give up any soldiers.

455
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
When the master left Zhongzhou,

456
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,120
there were only 20,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry.

457
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
How could such a small number of soldiers be killed?

458
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
He took a box of official seal and left the capital.

459
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
He asked for a decree.

460
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,120
But on the way, he appointed all the officials.

461
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
The master went south.

462
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
He used these official seal to recruit soldiers.

463
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Then he had a large army.

464
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,120
He used these to fight and recover the city.

465
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,120
He made the name of Nancheng King disappear.

466
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Your second brother and I

467
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,120
are orphans who fled to the temple.

468
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
After the master recovered his brother,

469
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,120
we decided to join the army together.

470
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,120
This is the little Nancheng King you want to see.

471
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Your Highness, these two children have been shouting outside the camp

472
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
and insisting on seeing you.

473
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Why are you looking for me?

474
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
To join the army.

475
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
You look young.

476
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Why do you want to join the army?

477
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,120
You're not old either, are you?

478
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm not young anymore.

479
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
I just look young.

480
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Let me tell you.

481
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Although His Highness looks the same as you,

482
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
he is already very young.

483
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
I'm not afraid of the virus.

484
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
I'm afraid that no one will join the army.

485
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
The king will return to Xizhou tomorrow.

486
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
I'll give you one night to think about it.

487
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
If you're not afraid of death,

488
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
then follow me.

489
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,120
It's been so many years since I last saw you.

490
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,120
I'm afraid that in the future,

491
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
you won't die on the battlefield,

492
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,120
but die in the camp.

493
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
What can I do when I'm old?

494
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
Feed the horse, wash the horse,

495
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
or clean the camp.

496
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
As long as you can stay in the king's camp,

497
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
you can do anything.

498
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
Yes, as long as it's here.

499
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Let me take you to find something to eat.

500
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Over there.

501
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,120
Let the fireman make something hot for General Hong.

502
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Yes.

503
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Wait.

504
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,120
General Hong is a man who takes pride in himself.

505
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Tell the fireman that I'm hungry.

506
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Let him burn it.

507
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Yes, Your Highness.

508
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
I'll go.

509
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Do you all have a wife and children?

510
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,120
If you die, will someone bury you?

511
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,120
I dare not marry.

512
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
I'm afraid that there will be a day like today, but not tomorrow.

513
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Even if you want to marry,

514
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
he doesn't dare to marry.

515
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Xie Yun always comes out to find food in the middle of the night.

516
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,120
He told me that the fireman would secretly leave some pancakes for him.

517
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Why isn't there any today?

518
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,120
General Hong.

519
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
General Hong.

520
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
I brought my junior sister to the night patrol.

521
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,120
I found that there was a movement here, so I came to see.

522
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,120
Your Highness is hungry, so I asked you to come and cook.

523
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,120
If General Hong doesn't mind, I'll cook more.

524
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
I'm fine.

525
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
I'm afraid that my junior sister will be hungry.

526
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,120
Then you can cook more.

527
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
When the time comes, send it to me.

528
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
Send it to my husband.

529
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Okay.

530
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,120
General Cui.

531
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,120
Who is inside?

532
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
It's His Highness.

533
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,120
Every time he comes to burn the fire, he is in front of the war.

534
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,120
This time...

535
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,120
I haven't heard of a long-distance fight.

536
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Go get my Hu Jia.

537
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Yes.

538
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,120
It's your style.

539
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,120
No one in Shou Yang understands me.

540
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
It's rare to come back. I want to work with you.

541
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Okay.

542
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
We Shou Yang are the best.

543
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,120
Who told you that?

544
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
What do you think?

545
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
It must be General Hong.

546
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
You're awake.

547
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Senior Sister, where did the music come from?

548
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,120
Master likes to play the music in front of the war.

549
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,120
This time, it's not for the war.

550
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,120
It's only for the music.

551
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Master.

552
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
General Hong.

553
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
You were very greedy today.

554
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
It's all my fault.

555
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,120
I'll leave him to you.

556
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,120
In this camp, only the two of you are idle.

557
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
I'll go look for the soldiers.

558
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm idle?

559
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,120
I'm not idle.

560
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,120
I'm not idle.

561
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,120
I'm not idle.

562
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,120
I'm idle?

563
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Guard the camp.

564
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Send the soldiers.

565
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Yes.

566
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
How did you two get the sword?

567
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
What do you look like?

568
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
Line up.

569
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Yes.

570
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,120
They seem to be afraid of Senior Sister.

571
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,120
In the camp, a female general wants to help her men.

572
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,120
It's much harder than men.

573
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,120
Last night,

574
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,120
I was too cold.

575
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
It's okay.

576
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
I'll take you around.

577
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Let's see the camp.

578
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Pay attention to the movement.

579
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
The army has arrived at a place.

580
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,120
Your senior sister's rear camp will choose a camp.

581
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
The soldiers will cut trees.

582
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
We'll build a wall again.

583
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
We'll surround the camp.

584
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Tighten your legs and hold your horse back.

585
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,120
What are you doing?

586
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Look at you. Get off.

587
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Yes.

588
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
How can horses use horses?

589
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
I'll give you a horse.

590
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
A horse is more expensive than a soldier.

591
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,120
So how much do you usually spend on training?

592
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Senior Sister said that

593
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,120
I'm better than a soldier.

594
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,120
I have the highest horse.

595
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Continue.

596
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,120
If you don't eat, I'll eat.

597
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Master.

598
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Why?

599
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
You don't like the food?

600
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,120
He's not good enough.

601
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
He's not good enough.

602
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,120
You can't look down on this prince.

603
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,120
He used to be a great man in Nanxiao.

604
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,120
He used to be alone.

605
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
He was a soldier.

606
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,120
He was far better than you.

607
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,120
He used to be a soldier.

608
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,120
He used to be a soldier.

609
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Why do you mention it again?

610
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
Let me try your martial arts again.

611
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,120
I admit defeat.

612
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,120
You can't say that.

613
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,120
You have to fight with me.

614
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
My disciple once spent half a month

615
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
in Jiangsuyan'an to learn feng shui.

616
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Now he has nothing to do.

617
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
He can't do anything.

618
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
He can't do anything.

619
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,120
The star is a stage.

620
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,120
I can't love.

621
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
My heart is burning.

622
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,120
The reliance of the yearning.

623
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,120
The pain is burning.

624
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Deeply.

625
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,120
I'm in pain.

626
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,120
I can't help thinking about you.

627
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,120
The love that makes people feel pain.

628
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,120
The world is full of flowers.

629
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,120
The sword is like a horse.

630
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,120
It's true love.

631
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,120
The story is like a piece of smoke.

632
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,120
The city is cold and the snow is sad.

633
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
I only care about you.

634
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,120
I'll follow you to the end of the world.

635
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,120
I can't help thinking about you.

636
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,120
The love that makes people feel pain.

637
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
The world is full of flowers.

638
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,120
The sword is like a horse.

639
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,120
It's true love.

640
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,120
The story is like a piece of smoke.

641
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,120
The city is cold and the snow is sad.

642
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,120
I only care about you.

643
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,120
The story is like a piece of smoke.

644
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,120
The sword is like a horse.

645
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,120
It's true love.

646
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,120
I can't help thinking about you.
