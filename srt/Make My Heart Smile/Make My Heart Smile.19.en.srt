Defend school hunk together

00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,790
Yanluo, have some water.

5
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,460
Yanluo, you...

6
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,070
Be careful when you have fencing classes.

7
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,900
I’ll take care of the president election.

8
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,230
You don’t need to worry.

9
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,910
Thank you, but don’t bother.

10
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,020
Yanluo,

11
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,870
I know you’re still angry with me.

12
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,990
I was drunk.

13
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,260
I didn’t know I would do that.

14
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,450
If I got her to misunderstand you,

15
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,190
I can go and explain for you.

16
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,770
Keep your distance from me

17
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,680
and that’s the best explanation.

18
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,660
Most terribly,

19
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,020
he managed to put a one-man show

20
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,870
all alone.

21
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,830
Whenever they’re together,

22
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,270
there’s always trouble!

23
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,070
How can I live?

24
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,540
When he comes, he brings trouble.

25
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,660
I won’t see him anymore!

26
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,820
You mean Mu Ze?

27
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,380
He annoyed you?

28
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,310
Don’t bring him up.

29
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,590
He can do nothing,

30
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,020
but make trouble.

31
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,590
I’m sorry.

32
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,150
Yao must be missing me.

33
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,560
She’s cursing me at the same time, though.

[Modern Motorcycle Technology]

35
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,100
Lu Yao,

36
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,820
as far as I know Mu Ze,

37
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,380
he looks like a casual playboy.

38
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,590
But he’s in fact an adorable boy.

39
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,780
I’m sure he didn’t mean to annoy you.

40
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,430
I wish he didn’t mean that.

41
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,780
But...

42
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,870
Forget him.

43
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,659
You have an intelligent boyfriend

44
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,430
and a genius childhood sweetheart.

45
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,890
What makes you depressed?

46
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,780
Come on.

47
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,250
They are treasures if they’re alone.

48
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,740
But they’re useless if they come together.

49
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,310
There’s no reason,

50
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,150
but they insist on competing all the time.

51
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,950
No wonder the Animal World says,

52
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,780
males’ desire to win

53
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,580
is mostly unreasonable!

54
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,770
You remind me of something.

55
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,710
On the college forum,

56
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,780
I saw someone say that

57
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,220
he would challenge Gu Yanluo
in a fencing class.

58
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,100
Who wants to be defeated so eagerly?

59
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,220
Wait.

60
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,710
Look. It’s him.

61
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,630
I hear he’s also the arch rival for Gu Yanluo

62
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,780
in the election.

63
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,910
Oh, him?

64
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,450
He lost to Gu Yanluo in a basketball game.

65
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,460
He doesn’t want to give up?

66
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,980
But it’s the forum for Gu Yanluo.

67
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,630
Yeah.

68
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,960
Why are you browsing it?

69
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,190
Well, I’ll confess.

70
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,870
When I’m free,

71
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,540
I like to review posts about your couple.

72
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,710
Couple? Of him and me?

73
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,870
Yes.

74
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,590
You don’t know?

75
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,580
That’s Luo&Ye Couple.

76
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,940
But after you pretended to break up,

77
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,500
your fans were all gone.

78
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,030
Except me,

79
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,870
there’s another man

80
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,910
named Autumn Leaves

81
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,500
who often comment.

82
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,910
So, I wonder...

83
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,860
Don’t look at me.

84
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,740
It can’t be me.

85
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,150
I don’t have an alternate.

86
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,150
I didn’t mean you.

87
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,660
Considering your IQ,

88
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
you can’t leave such wise comments.

89
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,060
That man sounds

90
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,820
much like your boyfriend.

91
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,780
No way.

92
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,260
He wouldn’t do such a boring thing.

93
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,790
Why hasn’t she come back yet?

94
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,920
Looks like I must add a new rule.

95
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,660
Excuse me, this is a public place.

96
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,250
Please protect books and read politely.

97
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,380
Why do you think I’m impolite?

98
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,940
Putting back the books you don’t need

99
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
is showing the basic respect to books.

100
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,060
You’re doing impolitely.

101
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,159
What are you doing?

102
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,100
Collecting the books.

103
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,380
I haven’t finished them yet.

104
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,940
Books are for reading, aren’t they?

105
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,470
This is the way I read books.

106
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,630
Well,

107
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
polite man,

108
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,960
could you show some respect to me?

109
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,470
Fine.

110
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,190
I’ll collect the books you don’t need.

111
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,820
I remember you’re not
from the Mechanical Engineering Department.

112
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,350
Why do you read these books?

113
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,900
Hey,

114
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,400
Ye Weimian said you were

115
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,140
from the Mechanical Engineering Department.

116
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,430
Well, just talk.

117
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,430
Don’t pull me.

118
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,450
You look exactly like a straight-A student.

119
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,600
How was your ranking in the last final?

120
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,390
The second of the grade.

121
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,910
Good, you’re indeed a straight-A student.

122
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,870
Thanks.

123
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,750
Could you do me a favor?

124
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,660
I...

125
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,419
Do you a favor?

126
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,950
If you help me,

127
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,990
I promise you I’ll tidy up all books

128
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,070
whenever I come to the library again.

129
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,270
No,

130
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,510
I’ll even clean the library.

131
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,460
What do you think?

132
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,190
Are you sure?

Yes.

What a perfect chance!

137
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,660
I must do it quickly.

138
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,950
Wrong.

139
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,990

140
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,860
What’s the password, then?

I want to check something on your computer.

147

What do you want to check?

148
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,870
Nothing.

149
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,390
Use my computer as you wish.

150
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,720
But don’t open my files.

That’s really your ID?

I’m sorry. I don’t mean to laugh,

155

but...

156
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,020

What?

160

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,750
Thank you,

176
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,580
for doing so many things secretly.

177
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,480
♫ My heart is not at peace recently ♫

178

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,510
tell me your ID on the forum.

180

♫ You suddenly got upgraded ♫

181
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,960
You won’t tell me, huh?

182
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,900
I’ll...

183
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,420
♫ These sweet little secrets ♫

184
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,100

185
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,270
What?

186
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,900
That’s my ID.

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,750
Autumn Leaves.

♫ I’m in a good mood with you ♫

194
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,700
You can’t keep reading books.

195
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,990
Intense mental work

196
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,870
will greatly increase the oxygen consumption

197
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,870
of brain neurons.

198
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,950
Have some.

199
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,220
I don’t eat junk food.

200
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,780
So,

201
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,780
you’d better have more rest.

202
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,990
She’s so greedy about boys.

203
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,690
I don’t know

204
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,540
why Yanluo still wants her!

205
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,140
I’ve got breaking news.

206
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,670
I nearly forgot to tell you.

207
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,830
Look.

208
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,190
It’s just Ye Zhenhan.

209
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,510
She won the prize?

210
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,510
No, no. This isn’t Ye Zhenhan.

211
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,750
This is her twin sister.

212
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,460
They look the same.

213
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,390
What nonsense are you talking about?

214
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,340
Since when did Ye Zhenhan have a twin sister?

215
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,190
She is!

216
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,020
Someone asked about her in the art college.

217
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,480
She really studies there.

218
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,950
I feel something wrong.

219
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,430
Ye Zhenhan has a twin sister?

220
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,830
Wait, you mean she’s also in our college?

221
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,650
Yes, she’s in the art college.

222
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,780
Something’s wrong.

223
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,040
Pay more attention to Ye Zhenhan lately.

224
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,890
If you find out anything suspicious,

225
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,290
let me know immediately.

226
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,140
No problem.

227
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,430
Si...

228
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,470
Looks interesting.

229
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,630
Sichen,

230
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,630
here’s the layout of graduation exhibition.

231
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,390
Have a look.

232
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,780
Leave this region for me.

233
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,140
I’ve got my own arrangement.

234
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,220
What do you want it for?

235
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
Don’t bother.

236
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,670
I’ll take care of it.

237
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,070
But you should tell me

238
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,530
so that I can get prepared.

239
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,220
Just go get prepared.

240
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,900
But...

241
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,340
No buts. Go get prepared.

242
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,460
Fine, I’ll leave you alone.

243
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,090
I’ll go get prepared and leave it for you.

244
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,310
Prince Charming will certainly win.

245
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,580
It’s not time to celebrate yet.

246
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,510
We don’t know until they compete.

247
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,630
You!

248
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,540
Say no more.

249
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,660
Get ready!

250
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,220
Go!

251
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,340
Come on! Come on! Come on!

252
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,580
Awesome, Prince Charming!

253
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,310
Come on!

254
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,190
Come on! Come on!

255
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,460
Come on!

256
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,390
Bravo!

257
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,510
Stop!

258
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,580
My leg!

259
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,630
My leg!

260
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,750
How is it? Let me have a look.

261
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,750
Don’t shed crocodile tears.

262
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,990
You lured me up

263
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,150
and then dodged.

264
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,070
Yeah, you were attacking.

265
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,460
Why did you suddenly take back your sabre?

266
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,870
He bumped into Gu Yanluo.

267
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,220
What? Yanluo can’t dodge?

268
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,020
Nonsense!

269
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,630
He shrank back a few times.

270
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,700
He was obviously fooling Hong Yu

271
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,990
and forced him to attack.

272
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,940
Yanluo had advantage.

273
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,340
He didn’t need to do that.

274
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,220
Yeah.

275
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,430
I don’t think so.

276
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,450
Isn’t there a president election?

277
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,580
Now, Hong Yu is hurt.

278
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,310
He’ll miss many activities.

279
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,340
Gu Yanluo will have a chance, then.

280
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,830
Please don’t make evil speculation.

281
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,870
You!

282
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,920
Why are you quarreling
instead of caring for him?

283
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,000
Sir, I didn’t mean to hurt Hong Yu.

284
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,420
But I’m sorry

285
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,780
for having hurt him.

286
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,240
Be more careful next time.

287
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,630
Everybody, you may leave.

288
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,760
Come and take Hong Yu to the infirmary.

289
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,390
I’m such a genius cook.

290
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,690
[Nerd]

291
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,180
Hello, Jiuyue?

292
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,180
Weimian, my roommate Hong Yu was hurt

293
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,380
in the fencing class.

294
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,340
I hear he was hurt by Gu Yanluo.

295
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,390
What?

296
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,910
I just heard of it,

297
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,910
and now I call to tell you.

298
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,000
No wonder he hasn’t come back yet.

299
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,550
Fine, I see.

300
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,330
Gotta go.

301
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,150
I took back the sabre. Why did he fall?

302
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,110
I did nothing wrong.

303
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,550
Guess who I am.

304
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,410
Mengpo Wants Milk Tea.

305
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,580
How can you say

306
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,860
such a naive name?

307
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,510
If you say it again,

308
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,910
you’ll be sorry.

309
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,240
I’ll be sorry, huh?

310
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,910
Sorry?

311
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,980
Show me.

312
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,060
Put me down. Put me down.

313
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,700
No, no.

314
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,910
No, no. Stop that.

315
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,510
Want to attack me secretly?

316
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,670
The sabre looks fun.

317
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,750
I hear you’re skilled at it.

318
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,270
I’ve never seen it before.

319
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,630
You haven’t learned any before.
Don’t get hurt.

320
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,740
I’ve been adoring you

321
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,440
and want you to be my master.

322
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,030
How will you be my master?

323
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,750
I want you to shut up

324
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,940
and learn carefully.

325
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,210
Show me your hands.

326
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,060
Take a small step forward.

327
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,610
The rear foot sticks
to the heel of the forward foot.

328
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,060
Stand akimbo.

329
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,900
Straighten your arm.

330
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,960
Point the sabre to the lower right corner.

331
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,930
Then raise it gradually

332
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,840
and point right ahead.

333
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,420
Then point at the front.

334
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,870
And back to the lower right corner.

335
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,340
It’s the starting etiquette of fencing.

336
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,150
Understand?

337
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,550
No?

338
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,790
One more time.

339
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,460
Do this,

340
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,340
and this,

341
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,910
and this,

342
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,790
and then this.

343
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,820
Remember?

344
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,150
Still can’t?

345
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,630
You’re on purpose, huh?

346
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,020
I’m not!

356

368
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,580
So, that’s why

369
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,340
you’re so excited in the early morning?

370
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,270
Yanluo,

371
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,150
the president election is starting soon.

372
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,030
Public opinions are very unfavorable.

373
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,620
Yes.

374
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,750
In the estimated election on the forum,

375
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,180
Hong Yu is nearly as popular as you.

376
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,350
Is this reasonable?

377
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,700
I believe most college students

378
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,630
will pick the best candidate.

379
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,990
Yes.

380
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,790
You have no sense of crisis at all.

381
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,020
Yes.

382
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,030
Stop saying yes!

383
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,300
I think you both sound reasonable.

384
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,910
Now, Gu Yanluo has

385
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,700
both crisis and real strength.

386
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,630
You make sense.

387
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,860
I don’t know how to argue.

388
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,390
When someone is under attack,

389
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,150
shouldn’t he fall back?

390
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,550
Why did he still pounce forward?

391
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,820
It doesn’t make sense.

do you know fencing?

397
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,630
I’ve learnt it for a couple of years.

398
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,820
In fencing games,

399
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,790
there are safe protective tools

400
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,320
and a long safety distance.

401
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,550

He rushed slightly.

405
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,180
Even if he fell accidentally,

406
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,420
he wouldn’t have easily hurt his knees.

407
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,700
He might have done that on purpose.

408
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,630
He’s still telling sad stories everywhere!

409

We’re just guessing.

438

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
Take more photos.

519
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,670
I’m going.

520
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,510
Be careful.

521
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,700
What?

522
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,090
Leave this to me.

523
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,990
I’ll go.

524
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:02,990
Come on!

525
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,910
Be careful.

526
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,630
Don’t peek.

527
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,700
You, don’t peak.

528
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,300
Shuffle the cards.

529
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,990
Shuffle the cards.

530
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,550
Do it.

531
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,380
Shuffle them.

532
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,030
What’s wrong with you?
Haven’t you got eyes?

533
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,230
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

534
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:15,870
I’m sorry.

535
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,800
Don’t touch me!

536
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,060
Blind? You did it on purpose, right?

537
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,870
Yeah, I did.

538
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,510
Punch me!

539
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,340
This one.

540
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,670
Do I look good?

541
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,020
Do I look like a beautiful country girl?

542
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,340
Well, Xingxing,

543
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,810
you promised to treat me dinner.

544
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,150
Why don’t we pick today?

545
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,220
What do you think?

546
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,390
Today?

547
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,580
I can’t.

548
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,180
I’ve got a tracing mission.

549
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,730
Let’s pick some other day.

550
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,990
But I’m starving now.

551
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Let’s do it today.

552
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,670
I didn’t know

553
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,750
you looked handsome with sunglasses.

554
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,750
- I do?
- Come and have a look.

555
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,060
I look okay.

556
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,220
This one. This one.

557
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,580
All these bright colors suit you well.

558
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,220
Try them on.

559
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,910
Okay. I’ll try them on.

560
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,940
Red.

561
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,290
Red looks overbearing.

562
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,290
Red is good.

563
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,940
I look so handsome in pink.

564
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,180
Xingxing, here’s a yellow one.

565
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,920
The yellow one looks good.

566
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,910
Xingxing, what do you think of it?

567
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,700
Xingxing?

568
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,460
Where’s she?

569
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,750
Fine, then.

570
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,510
You always got me.

571
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,460
I’ve sneaked out in front of you

572
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,840
nearly a hundred times.

573
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,580
This is just one more time.
