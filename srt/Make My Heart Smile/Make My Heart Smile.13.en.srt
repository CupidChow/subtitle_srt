No.

This one is perfect.

Good morning, princess.

I’m not Ye Zhenhan.

43
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,710
I’m her sister Ye Weimian.

44
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,530
Three months ago,

45
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,220
my twin sister Ye Zhenhan

46
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,909
lapsed into coma by accident.

47
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,640
In order to help with her dream,

48
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,940
I had to pretend to be her.

49
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,000
Since I’m talented at acting,

50
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,260
I successfully joined the Finance Department

51
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,940
and started my double life as a top student

52
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,260
of both Finance and Fashion Department.

53
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,710
But I didn’t expect

54
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,780
there’s a big loophole in my double life,

55
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,060
which is also my best serendipity.

56
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,640
Life treats me like cannon fodder,

57
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,500
but I will fly high up into the sky.

58
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,340
Isn’t it just an English speech?

59
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,800
I’m a genius of acting.

60
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,150
I…

61
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,670
Even a genius of acting can’t handle it.

62
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,030
I really believe

63
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,660
my double life

64
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,940
will end today.

65

66
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,880
Why are you so late?

67
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,100
Do you want to run away?

68
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,050
How is it possible?

69
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,980
I look like a newbie,

70
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,150
but in fact

71
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,710
I am an old hand.

72
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,050
All right.

Hello everyone, my name is Ye Zhenhan.

121
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
The topic of my speech today is

122
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,870
how to achieve the set goals.

123
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,990
What stand between us and achieving

even our most dreams has

125
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,340
far less to do with the possession of

126
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,310
some magic skill or talent.

127
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,570
Why did she change the subject?

128
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,220
And far more to do
with how we approach problems

129
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,080
and make decisions to solve them.

130

Why didn’t you use

131

the script I prepared for you?

132
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,580
I was too nervous, and forgot them all.

133
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,270
So I improvised.

134

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,950
Oh no.

175
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,710
There’s no chance if we step out of the mall.

176
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,900
Zhenhan.

177
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,140
I’m here.

178
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,330
Why are you so slow?

179
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,580
I still want a few more things.

180
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,700
Wait for me.

181
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,010
Look at you.

182
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,540
You were cold, and now you’re sweating.

183
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,070
Are you feeling cold or hot?

184
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,540
With Prince Charming by my side,

185
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,430
of course I’m nervous and feeling cold

186
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,160
but also excited and sweating.

187
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,340
You silly.

188
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,510
Let’s go.

189
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,390
Time to show you

190
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,750
my Michelin talent for cooking.

191
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,870
Eggs,

192
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,660
flour,

193
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,270
chips,

194
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,660
and plum.

195
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,590
Nothing I can use for bakery.

196
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,510
Ye Zhenhan,

197
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,580
are you pranking me?

198
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,660
Let me try it.

199
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,270
I hope her recipe

200
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,020
will not cause an explosion.

201
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,220
[Low calories food and beverage]

202
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,270
It will be ready soon.

203
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,070
A heads-up, promise me you won’t hate it.

204
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,070
I’m starved. I have no other choices.

205
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,200
Why don’t we just forget about it?

206
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,010
Is it too hot?

207
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,020
This…

208
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,100
Are you sure they’re cookies?

209
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,140
Are they edible?

210
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,340
Shall I try it for you first?

211
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,950
Let me try it.

212
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,980
It doesn’t look good,

213
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,030
but still tasty.

214
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,700
I can see through your bad acting.

215
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,950
Don’t eat if they’re yucky.

216
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,070
This is a white lie.

217
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,540
What if…

218
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,020
I mean if,

219
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,510
I also told you a white lie?

220
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,990
Would you hold a grudge against me?

221
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,790
How many lies have you said to me?

222
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,030
When I first saw you,

223
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,750
you told me your name is Lu Yao,

224
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,010
instead of Ye Zhenhan.

225
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,310
Sorry,

226
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,580
in fact my name is not Ye Zhenhan either.

227
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,950
You not only lie,

228
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,520
but also stole my heart.

229
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,390
What?

230
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,540
Does it hurt?

231
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,099
What can I do?

232
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,819
I didn’t lie to you on purpose.

233
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,030
Remember

234
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,270
our products are cheap and cheerful!

235
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,340
Please follow us!

236
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,300
This is the end of our livestreaming today.

237
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,510
Our new clothes for spring

238
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,870
will be launched on time.

239
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,030
Let me Lu Yao help you

240
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,990
with your fashion choices.

241
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,340
Bye.

242
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,990
Ye.

243
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,100
I’ve done my part.

244
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,270
When are you going to do yours?

245
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,100
Don’t pretend you can’t hear me.

246
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,900
Where are your design sketches?

247
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,420
Lu Yao, let me ask you a question.

248
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,330
If you have a boyfriend,

249
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,420
but you find that his identity and name

250
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,550
are fabricated.

251
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,290
What are you going to do?

252
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,060
What am I going to do?

253
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,790
Of course I will kill him.

254
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,270
Are you talking about you and Gu Yanluo?

255
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,340
Zhenhan will go back to school tomorrow.

256
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,260
She is Gu Yanluo’s girlfriend.

257
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,900
No, I am his girlfriend.

258
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,510
No.

259
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,860
Anyway, everyone believes

260
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,820
Zhenhan is Gu Yanluo’s girlfriend.

261
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,460
And he believes so too.

262
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,100
Are you saying

263
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,790
Gu Yanluo will find out

264
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,100
the truth?

265
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,550
So I can’t wait and let him find out.

266
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,580
Or I will be a dead meat.

267
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,820
I have to tell him before he finds out.

268
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,580
Is this going to be better?

269
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,460
Yes.

270
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,940
I need to admit it to him

271
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,790
and sincerely ask for his forgiveness

272
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,420
in the most romantic

273
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,920
and relaxing atmosphere.

274
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,320
Thumbs up for your courage.

275
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,750
Here, a few more letters.

276
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,150
Here, some colorful ribbons.

277
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,970
A romantic setting

278
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,820
will give him an adrenaline rush

279
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,580
and a spinning head to forgive me, right?

280
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,060
Wait.

281
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,790
I need to dress up for it

282
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,700
to make sure it will succeed.

283
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,420
Yao.

284
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,790
Look,
we always bump into each other by chance.

285
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,550
By chance?

286
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,750
You’re as punctual as a clock.

287
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,750
Yao.

288
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,790
I keep sending you flowers even though

289
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,300
you always refuse me. For the sake of that,

290
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,100
can you tell me

291
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,790
why you don’t like me,

292
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,180
except that I am unreliable,

293
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,300
childish, have too many exes,

294
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,030
and play too many tricks?

295
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,670
Didn’t you just list all the reasons?

296
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,550
But you have to tell me yourself

297
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,640
so I will give it up.

298
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,300
Are you sure?

299
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,180
I am.

300
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,550
One,

301
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,060
bad hairstyle.

302
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,700
Two,

303
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,650
bad taste for flowers.

304
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,210
Third,

305
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,700
your IDs for WeChat, Weibo and games

306
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,180
are "proud player".

307
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,870
Too teenagery.

308
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,750
Too clingy.

309
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
You fell in love with me too fast,

310
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
like a kid.

311
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,390
Ninety seven,

312
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,960
too many tricks.

313
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,180
Ninety eight,

314
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,570
too stupid.

315
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,060
Ninety nine,

316
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,810
dishonest.

317
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,220
I love you.

318
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,790
I love you.

319
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,510
Cute Bean.

320
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,390
Surprise.

321
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,300
You.

322
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,630

Cute Bean, turn off the music.

334
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,990
Tell me, what tricks are you playing now?

335
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,300
How’s it?

336

Are you surprised?

337
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,820
Do you like it?

338
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,940
Is your heart racing?

339
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,910
Is your head spinning?

340
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,450
Today is

341
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,550
the 72nd day of our relationship.

342
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,820
I have an important secret to share with you.

343
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,070
What is this cute little thing?

344
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,340
This is the loving heart for you.

345
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,190
Wait a minute.

You, stand still.

In fact,

My dear son, look at you.

353

An insensitive boy like you

now knows how to be romantic!

355
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,050
She did it all.

356
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,460
Mom, why are you here?

357
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,550

Mrs. Gu, in fact,

360
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,700
I don’t often come here.

361

When I came here, I stayed in the guest room.

Yes.

367
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,380
It’s your bad, my boy.

368

You didn’t push it forward.

are you going to get engaged?

374

It seems like I picked the right gift.

Come on, try it.

You have such a good taste.

Your outfit looks good too.

378

Silly boy, why are you standing there?

379
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,360
Come here, have a seat.

Tell me when do you plan to get engaged?

381
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,460
Mom, you have to ask her.

382

Engagement is too soon.

We don’t really know well about each other.

386

Don’t know me well?

387

What do you want to know about?

388
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,060
Mrs. Gu, I remember that I have classes later.

389
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,270
I need to go now.

390

Goodbye, Mrs. Gu.

I planned to admit everything to him.

393
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,990
Why were we asked about engagement?

394

My silly boy, look,

395
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,550
she was scared and ran away.

396

Look how embarrassed you both are.

401
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,560
I need to get prepared.

402
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,220

It’s not strange.
