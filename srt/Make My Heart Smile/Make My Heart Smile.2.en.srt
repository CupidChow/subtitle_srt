Episode 2
Temporary Secondary Account Goes Offline

4
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,430
This is so tasty.

5
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,590
Try it.

6
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,950
It’s really tasty.

7
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,230
Try it.

8
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,430
I said no.

9
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,230
What’s Lu Yao’s background?

10
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,220
Come on, it’s also my first time to see her,
OK?

11
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,510
Even you don’t know.

12
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,230
Could it be she’s hired by my cousin?

13
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,020
How could that be?

14
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,680
That’s not what he would do.

15
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,460
The marshmallow is quite sweet.

16
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,150
Is it tasty?

17
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,790
Have some more if it is.

18
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,720
I’ll go and ask him now.

19
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,660
You must not be used to such a place

20
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,790
for your first time.

21
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,660
Take a sip of champagne to calm yourself down.

22
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,510
Thanks.

23
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,360
I don’t think there will be a next time.

24
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,340
Why…do you look a bit familiar?

25
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,460
Look familiar? How can that be?

26
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,790
Yanluo,

27
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,310
I know auntie

28
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,510
has been urging you to find a girlfriend.

29
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,310
But you can’t bring any girl home

30
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,230
just to fob her off.

31
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,620
Don’t assume you know me well

32
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,900
or pass casual judgement on her.

33
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,380
I’m sorry. I’ve got other things to do.

34
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,510
I’ll excuse myself.

35
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,150
Don’t rush.

36
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,180
I haven’t eaten the cake yet.

37
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,890
Why do you put on such a long face?

38
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,220
I haven’t eaten enough cake
because of you.

39
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,260
Glutton.

40
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,700
Narcissist.

41
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,190
Bore!

42
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,470
I understand
you don’t like girls dressed in loud colors

43
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,340
and those who throw themselves in your arms.

44
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,400
But the one just now

45
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,780
has elegant manners and decorous demeanors,

46
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,180
still you don’t like her.

47
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,760
What type of girls do you like exactly?

48
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,740
Do you…have any peculiar idiosyncrasies?

49
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,500
Little Luo.

50
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,190
I’ve found you at last.

51
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,380
Got it.

52
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,490
Who’s this girl?

53
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,660
Why didn’t you tell me?

54
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,430
You make me so upset.

55
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,310
Speak properly.

56
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,370
Don’t get me wrong.

57
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,940
I’m just here to help.

58
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,659
He rejected all the girls

59
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,310
for you just now.

60
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,990
I wish you guys…

61
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,820
What’s on your mind?

62
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,909
I’m not gonna hold you up for helping.

63
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,780
Let’s get acquainted. I’m Mu Ze.

64
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,940
Public enemy of Prince Charming

65
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,740
and 9 million girls’ dreamboat.

66
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,260
I…I am Lu Yao.

67
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,220
This year…

68
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,750
Come with me.

69
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,590
You, stay here to wait for me.

70
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,910
- Why?
- Why?

71
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
I’m the extra one.

72
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,970
I’ll go. I’ll leave you guys talking.

73
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,470
Auntie, this apple is very fresh.

74
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,650
Let me peel one for you.

75
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,630
Your little mouth can’t stop eating.

76
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,710
Eat it yourself.

77
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,630
Auntie Gu.

78
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,190
Auntie,

79
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,100
I wondered why Yanluo

80
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,560
brought home the girl who slapped him today.

81
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,420
It turns out they are dating.

82
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,659
Did they bicker during the day?

83
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,590
What does that mean?

84
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,720
I don’t know either.

85
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,880
You guys don’t know?

86
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,260
It happened
when Yanluo was doing a live stream today.

87
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,790
Everybody on campus saw it.

88
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,750
Look.

89
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,990
Oh my gosh, auntie.

90
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,310
Isn’t this too much?

91
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,580
How dare anybody slap my cousin
like this?

92
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,430
This is an interesting girl.

93
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,030
She has my aura back then.

94
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,630
Great.

95
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,720
Finally there is someone
who can have sway over Yanluo.

96
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,750
Interesting.

97
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,270
It’s wrong to slap people,

98
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,100
but it is also disgraceful

99
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,330
to be a snitch.

100
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,380
I thought you had known already.

101
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,310
Auntie, I’m going out for now.

102
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,630
Go have fun. Enjoy yourself.

103
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,650
Well,

104
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,620
is Lu Yao also a student of your college?

105
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,630
Yes.

106
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,490
Pay close attention to her

107
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,590
for me with Mu Ze.

108
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,040
Leave it to me, auntie.

109
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,160
How dare you slap my cousin?

110
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,970
Let me drink you under the table today

111
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,690
to make you confess the truth.

112
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,150
Lu Yao,

113
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,400
I tell you what,

114
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,100
you…are the first girlfriend

115
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,030
my cousin has brought home,

116
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,100
and you are his…

117
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,750
first love.

118
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,430
First love?

119
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,700
My cousin

120
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,220
is both narcissistic and haughty.

121
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,770
What do you like about him?

122
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,100
I know.

123
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,130
His handsome look.

124
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,539
Not quite.

125
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,530
His callousness makes me ignore his
handsome look.

126
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,270
You don’t like my cousin at all.

127
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,680
That’s why you slapped him
in front of so many people.

128
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,900
That…that was a misunderstanding.

129
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,660
Actually your cousin has many merits.

130
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,090
Since you two are together,

131
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,580
why did you slap him?

132
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,780
I don’t quite get it.

133
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,070
Evil karma.

134
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,580
Are you talking about me?

135
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,770
What are you doing?

136
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,220
I’m not…going.

137
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,740
I’m not going.

138
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,700
Take care, take care.

139
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,870
I can drink.

140
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,220
I’m able to drink.

141
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,310
You must take good care of my cousin,
you know?

142
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,270
Take care.

143
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,510
Take good care of him. He’s drunk.

144
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,630
Take them off.

145
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,310
My shoes. You stained my shoes! You…

146
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,750
Why…why are you holding my hand?

147
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,590
Do you think I want to?

148
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,340
You…

149
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,900
You are on such good terms with Mu Ze.

150
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,460
Could you guys be…

151
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,830
You don’t like girls?

152
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,230
I suggest you not go too far,

153
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,570
or the deal will be…

154
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,870
Now I know your secret.

155
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,390
You’d better be careful.

156
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,700
I…

157
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,750
Siwan, did you ask…

158
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,950
I…

159
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,430
Mom.

160
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,430
I didn’t see it.

161
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,090
I didn’t see anything.

162
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,750
Go on.

163
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,220
Sorry, I…

164
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
am a little dizzy.

165
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,480
So you can do whatever you want
when you are drunk?

166
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,950
What?

167
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,130
This really comes out of nowhere.

168
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,700
Think no more.

169
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,580
Dancing, cocktail party, fending off
romantic rival.

170
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,750
I had a really busy day today.

171
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,990
[Debtor Creditor]

172
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,790
Starting from today, you must pay monthly,

It’s a long story.

That’s what happened.

dropped his express delivery parcel
in the afternoon,

in the evening.

Aren’t there a lot of double majors?

this is no joke.

209

You must think it over.

210
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,190
Although our fashion design classes

211
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,270
are mostly free practice sessions

212
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,340
and teachers don’t often take a roll call,

213
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,510
you run back and forth between the two colleges

214
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,510
while doing so many part-time jobs,

215

But that’s the only way.

Only by doing so

219
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,270
can I win a place of exchange student.

I’m sure she’ll have no problem getting it.

222
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,780
I must guard this opportunity for her

223
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,800
until she comes out of her coma.

224

Something is not right.

338
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,910
In principle, as a campus belle harvester,

339
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,240
I should have known her.

340
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,670
But she doesn’t join any club or societies

341
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,670
or any other activities.

342
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,070
She’s an invisible girl.

343
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,180
It’s only normal that such a haughty guy
like you

344
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,420
don’t know her.

345
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,160
Why did such a person

346
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
get selected for the Challenge Cup?

347
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,420
Bro,

348
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,300
your excellence is there for all to see.

349
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,790
Over the past two years,

350
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,220
you took part in every competition
on behalf of our university,

351
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,420
making others think you are the only one

352
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,670
of our Charlotte College who has something
to show for it.

353
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,030
You should also think of our university’s
leadership.

354
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,820
This can’t be the reason for her to
replace me either.

355
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Little Luo, isn’t it just a Challenge Cup?

356
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,600
You don’t understand.

357
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,310
The one who can replace me

358
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,740
must have capabilities.

359
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,150
Zhenhan!

360
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,820
What on earth has happened?

361
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,150
Why are you avoiding me?

362
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,510
You’ve been following me across
a few streets.

363
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,300
Who else shall I avoid if not you?

364
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,030
Today is the first day of class.

365
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,510
You were ten minutes late
when you came downstairs.

366
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,240
Let me give you a ride on my bike.

367
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,760
He was even keeping watch on me.

368
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,270
Now it’s 4 minutes before class.

369
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,530
Your step is 60cm long.

370
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,630
At a speed of three steps per second,

371
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,360
there’s a high probability
that you’ll be late.

372
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,390
Is he a weirdo or a husky?

373
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,580
Zhenhan,

374
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,470
what on earth has happened?

375
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,700
I’m going to class.

376
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,650
Step aside. Get out of the way.

377
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,580
Why are you here?

378
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,820
IQ is a good thing.

379
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,500
I hope you have it too.

380
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,150
Damn it. I can run into you everywhere.

381
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,480
That makes the two of us.

382
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,420
You are full of negative energy early
in the morning.

383
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,620
What’s the big deal of being a creditor?

384
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,990
Extra bonus!

385
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,420
Gu Yanluo has chosen this course too.

386
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
Who is he looking at?

387
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,550
The way he’s looking is so handsome!

388
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,130
Meimei…

389
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,460
Over there. Let’s go.

390
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,340
What’s going on?

391
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,870
What a special day is it today?

392
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,530
My Princess Charming is here.

393
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,460
What a coincidence, Yanluo.

394
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,720
We happen to have chosen the same course.

395
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,630
The Charlotte couple is in the same frame.

396
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,160
How well-matched they are!

397
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,270
A perfect match.

398
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,660
Prince Charming is so handsome.

399
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,840
Hello everyone.

400
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,100
I’m your sociology teacher,

401
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,990
also the vice dean of our college.

402
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,470
Without further ado,

403
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,600
let me introduce sociology to you.

404
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,580
This subject

405
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,570
is different from other ones.

406
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,540
It involves a lot of practice

407
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,910
and social surveys,

408
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,700
so you’ll be divided into groups,

409
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,700
and your grades

410
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,750
will also be calculated based on your scores
as a group.

411
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,990
You are required to form a group of two.

412
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,910
Here I have a tip for you:

413
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,220
Be sure to pay attention to your partner.

414
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,460
Choose a good one.

415
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,820
The partner you choose must have a high
composite index

416
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,030
so that you will not flunk the course.

417
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,850
OK, please feel free to choose your partner.

418
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,270
It’s killing me.

419
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,510
I only know three people on this course.

420
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,300
Gu Yanluo and Fang Meimei are a definite no.

421
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,580
Shall I go for Xia Yuanqing?

422
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,670
She looks soft and gentle.

423
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,870
She’s supposed to be approachable.

424
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,340
Sir, I want to form a group with Gu Yanluo.

425
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,630
Sir, me too.

426
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,630
Sir!

427
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,750
My mother says

428
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,860
she won’t let me go to college

429
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,190
if I’m not in the same group with Gu Yanluo.

430
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,750
Yes. My mother also says

431
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,420
she won’t let me go to work

432
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,820
if I don’t teach you well.

433
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,390
Gu Yanluo,

434
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,220
come and stand beside me.

435
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,390
Yanluo.

436
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,930
It seems you are very popular.

437
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,820
Look, you are quite handsome indeed.

438
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,050
You look a bit like me when I was young.

439
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,410
OK, choose

440
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,550
a classmate to be your partner.

441
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,990
Choose me.

442
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,510
Her.

443
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,910
OK.

444
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,060
Gu Yanluo,

445
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,580
are we enemies?

446
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,940
Didn’t we agree yesterday

447
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,340
to mind our own business?

448
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,550
OK. Gu Yanluo, Ye Zhenhan.

449
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,150
You two will be in a group then.

450
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,990
Very well chosen.
A combination of straight A students.

451
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,990
Very well chosen.

452
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,990
I am Yanluo’s girlfriend.

453
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,340
My name is…Lu Yao.

454
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,990
You are Ye Zhenhan?

455
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,820
Aren’t you Lu Yao?

456
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,100
I can’t communicate with you.

457
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,580
Narcissus, pretentious death.

458
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,110
What did you say?

459
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,550
No…nothing.

460
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,510
I complimented you are handsome immortal
on the altar.

461
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,990
I complimented you as Prince Charming.

462
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,870
Narcissus

463
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,820
usually refers to those who are

464
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,150
super narcissistic, conceited and selfish.

465
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,060
“Life is hard, don’t lay everything bare.

466
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,220
If you keep being pretentious,
I’ll surely beat you to death.”

467
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,620
It is commonly known as pretentious death.

468
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,300
Naughty girl!

469
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,390
Men silent women tears.

470
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,990
Men would become silent

471
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,460
and women would shed tears when they see it.

472
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,820
Master procrastinator.

473
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,080
People who break promises to themselves
by procrastinating.

474
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,740
