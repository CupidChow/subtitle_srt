Make My Heart Smile

3
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:27,450
Episode 14
You’re my beloved young man.

4
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,350
Hello? Do you hear me?

5
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,260
Our happy home is waving at you.

6
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,540
OK. See you at home.

7
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,460
I have a surprise for you, too.

8
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,700
You have?

9
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,430
See you tonight.

10
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,460
Kiss you.

11
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,950
Morning, Lu Yao.

12
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,950
Morning.

13
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,620
Tastes great.

14
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,660
Good.

15
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,380
A maid has become

16
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,590
a naughty elf.

17
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,790
Whether the plan goes smoothly

18
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,620
depends on how charming I am.

19
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,350
You’ll make it.

20
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,940
I gotta go.

21
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,000
I’ll carry out my confession plan.

22
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,660
Take it and don’t leave it in the bus.

23
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,340
Your gift.

24
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,220
Don’t worry.

25
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,660
I’ll show him my full sincerity

26
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,710
and make him forgive me immediately.

27
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,310
See you.

28
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,100
Okay.

29
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,660
Come on!

30
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,990
Hope my dear friend

31
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,870
will not fail again.

32
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,510
You go home now?

33
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,130
I’ll leave you alone, then. Bye-bye.

34
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,590
Yanluo, you’re not home yet?

35
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Come with me.

36
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,650
Where are we going?

37
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,079
Don’t play with your phone
when you’re by my side.

38
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,820
You’re back?

39
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,990
Come out.

40
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,990
Which one is more surprising

41
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,820
yours or mine?

42
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,820
sis

43
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,100
[I’m sorry.]

44
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,190
Name?

45
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,940
Ye...

46
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,940
Ye Weimian.

47
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,780
Identity?

48
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,430
A third-year student
of the Fashion Department.

49
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,430
Motives?

50
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,440
Several months ago,

51
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,870
my sister Ye Zhenhan fell in coma
due to a car accident.

52
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,060
To defend her quota for exchange student,

53
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,820
I took classes in the Finance Department.

54
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,870
I never expected to meet you!

55
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,760
You mean it’s my fault?

56
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,100
No. You’re an accident.

57
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,150
I had planned to leave after Zhenhan woke up.

58
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,380
You mean

59
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,790
you’ll leave without telling anyone?

60
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,310
What about me?

61
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,150
I was looking for a chance to confess to you.

62
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,500
Confess?

63
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,780
We’ve been together for such a long time

64
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,660
when you have chances to confess.

65
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,200
But I don’t even know who my girlfriend is.

66
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,820
Can you not trust me at all?

67
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,110
After all the time, what do I mean to you?

68
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,540
Your hand...

69
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,150
I know

70
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,330
no matter how I explain,

71
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,590
you won’t believe me.

72
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,100
But I never expected

73
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,030
to meet you and be with you.

74
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,660
If you still can’t forgive me

75
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,100
and want to break up...

76
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,100

I have an important secret to share with you.

87

Engagement is too soon.

88
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,220
We don’t really know well about each other.

89

Yes.

Sit down.

112
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,780
You fled, didn’t you?

113
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,330
Why are you back again?

114
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,210
If you don’t want to see me,

115
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,200
I’ll leave after I dress up your wound.

116
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,070
Still hurts?

117
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,580
I know you’re angry.

118
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,750
If I were you, I would be angrier.

119
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,060
That’s why I didn’t dare to tell you.

120
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,140
It was an accident to meet you.

121
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,690
It was my luck, too.

122
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,300
I told you a fake name and identity,

123
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,990
but I gave you my true love.

124
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,190
I cherish you so much
and don’t want to lose you

125
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,540
that I didn’t dare to confess.

126
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,540
The deception in the beginning
isn’t the problem.

127
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,070
The latter concealment is.

128
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,020
You don’t trust me.

129
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,960
It’s the worst thing for a couple.

130
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,870
Trust is also the most important.

131
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,950
I’m sorry.

132
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,440
You’ve hid the truth for such a long time.

133
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,750
I just got to know

134
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,010
my girlfriend’s name.

135
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,510
Isn’t it ridiculous?

136
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,430
I’m guilty.

137
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,950
And...

138
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,340
When you made a mistake,
you wanted to break up.

139
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,670
You’re irresponsible.

140
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
One more mistake.

141
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,430
I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

142
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,830
I won’t propose to break up again.

143
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:34,780
You said you wouldn’t break up...

144
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,770
You mean you forgive me?

145
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,900
No way!

146
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,750
It depends.

147
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,000
Look at this.

148
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,990
It’s the apology gift
I especially made for you.

149
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,750
It’s a small gift,

150
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,270
but it’s unique.

151
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,700
Will you accept it?

152
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,390
I’ll make you forgive me with my action!

153
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,590
[You’re my beloved young man.]

154
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,870
You’re my beloved young man?

155
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,230
Sounds so literary.

156
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,270
My beloved young man is you.

157
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,020
Zhenhan.

158
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,340
Jiuyue?

159
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,780
I’m sorry.

160
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,750
I shouldn’t have let you
go back to your dorm alone yesterday.

161
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,030
It’s not your fault.

162
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,980
I’m sorry to bring trouble
to my sister and Gu Yanluo.

163
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,260
Zhenhan,

164
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,630
the probability of meeting each other

165
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,270
is merely one in fifty million.

166
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,090
The probability of falling in love
is one in two hundred million.

167
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,190
Because of you,

168
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,660
they met each other luckily

169
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,870
and fell in love.

170
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,900
Thank you, Jiuyue.

171
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,540

[Siwan]

345
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,140
Cousin, everyone is rumoring that

346
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,990
you broke up with Ye Zhenhan.

347
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,220
Go refute it!

348
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,570
That’s not a rumor.

349
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,010
[Idiotic Him]

350
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,210
Hello, Little Luo?

351
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,220
What happened to you and Ye Zhenhan?

352
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,420
We broke up amicably.

353
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,820
Sounds like you were dumped.

354
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,700
Dumped?

355
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,400
What makes you think I was dumped?

356
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,950
Gotta go.

357
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,700
Don’t.

358
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,550
Let’s meet.

359
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,510
My God.

360
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,700
Gu Yanluo was dumped?

361
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,940
What breaking news! I’ll tell others.

362
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,060
No wonder he looks so haggard.

363
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,940
I feel sorry and sad.

364
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,290
But I’m still excited.

365
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,670
Someone believes I was dumped?

366
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,940
Me?

367
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,030
School hunk, straight-A student,
and Prince Charming.

368
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,580
For my sister’s reputation,

369
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,790
please bear with it.

370
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,150
Here.

371
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,170
What do you want me for?

372
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,750
What do I want you for?

373
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,020
For alcohol.

374
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,300
It can’t drown your sorrow,

375
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,280
but it makes you forget the pain temporarily.

376
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,030
Cheers.

377
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
What makes you think I feel the pain?

378
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,130
Pretend to be strong, huh?

379
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,300
I saw that.

380
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,990
You kept texting her,

381
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,790
even though she didn’t text back.

382
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,630
Right?

383
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,420
Show me now

384
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,990
You just don’t admit it.

385
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,520
You still have her photo
as your lock screen, huh?

386
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,680
Think about it.

387
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,690
Why do you and I

388
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,990
fall for her and her friend?

389
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,220
You and I

390
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,510
are different.

391
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,550
Yes, we’re different.

392
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,320
I haven’t been with her yet,

393
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,020
but you’ve been dumped already.

394
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,580
Eat and shut up!

395
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,180
Ice cream.

396
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,420
Miss,

397
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,150
come in and try some.

398
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,910
Miss,

399
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,960
would you like to try our ice cream?

400
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,180
Who are you?

401
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,480
What’s going on?

402
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,220
Ye!

403
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,390
Hello?

404
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,820
Gu Yanluo, Ye was taken away in a car!

405
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,150
Did you see the plate number?

406
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,280
It was a brown Buick.

407
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,700
Luo A 88888.

408
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,600
Shall I call the police?

409
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,240
Follow them.

410
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,580
I’ll take care of the rest.

411
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,380
Buddy, I have no bag for band cards.

412
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,790
I have no money for apartments.

413
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,100
I’m strong enough and I don’t need insurance.

414
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,340
Kidnap me and you’ll lose money.

415
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,470
Let go of me! Please!

416
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,460
Please!

417
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,030
Miss, don’t be nervous.

418
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,700
I made a divination

419
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,850
and knew you had trouble in love.

420
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,100
I then come to give you some advice.

421
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,910
Hello, police?

422
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,630
Here’s a man Mu Ze.

423
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,940
He kidnapped me. He...

424
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,340
Are you an idiot?

425
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,510
How can I dial with my eyes covered?

426
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,980
Kidnap me with such a low IQ?

427
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:03,920
I was freaked out!

428
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,270
How boring you are!

429
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,760
I came to pick you up

430
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,990
and I’m taking you to see your Mr. Right.

431
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,160
But you frightened me!

432
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,990
Hey,

433
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,700
who frightened the other one?

434
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,930
Hello? What the hell are you doing?

435
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,810
Little Luo,

436
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,100
a man is angrier after he was dumped.

437
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,870
Don’t blame me for not helping.

438
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,270
Soon you’ll see the girl

439
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,790
you’ve been missing

440
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,750
and you can talk with her

441
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,030
to get her back.

442
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,990
Where?

443
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,220
See you at Gallery Cafe.

444
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,300
Mu Ze!

445
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,750
Lu Yao, I...

446
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,210
Who allowed you to do that?

447
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,800
Spare me, Lu Yao! Spare me!

448
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,080
Look what you’ve done!

449
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,080
I never expected you to think
I kidnapped her.

450
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,420
You’re mocking her

451
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,670
for being stupid?

452
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,750
No, no, no.

453
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,150
I don’t mean that.

454
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,870
I won’t do that again.

455
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,700
I’m serious.

456
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,990
Little Luo, at last!

457
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,610
I’ve been helping around for you.

458
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,080
Are you alright?

459
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,630
Little Luo, she’s fine. But I’m not.

460
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,790
You deserve it!

461
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,870
He’s right.

462
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,940
Gu Yanluo,

463
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,880
you have girls before buddies!

464
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,870
I even felt sorry for you

465
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,150
when you were dumped.

466
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,420
Ye, I hear coffee of this shop tastes great.

467
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,880
Let’s go and I’ll buy you some coffee.

468
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,960
What’s going on?

469
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,870
My sixth sense tells me

470
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,160
you’re hiding something from me.

471
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,060
You didn’t tell me such big news?

472
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,270
Am I still your buddy?

473
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,090
It’s a serious matter.

474
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,390
If many people knew,

475
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,890
I’m afraid they would find out the twins.

476
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,110
Do I look like I can’t keep a secret?

477
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:17,940
You can’t.

478
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,410
Twin sisters are in love with one school hunk.

479
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,910
Such breaking news

480
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,030
can easily be the headline.

481
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,420
Ye Weimian is my only girlfriend.

482
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,750
Very well.

483
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,510
You’re a loyal school hunk.

484
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,830
It’s hot. Be careful.

485
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,270
You, too.

486
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,630
Are you staying as the third wheel

487
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,550
or taking a ride with me?

488
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,880
Make your decision.

489
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,390
This time,

490
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,580
you’re back for graduation.

491
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,910
But there’s much time
before the graduation exhibition.

492
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,550
So, I got you a job as a judge

493
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,990
for a fashion competition.

494
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,910
Be careful.

495
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,740
Not interested.

496
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,420
Don’t!

497
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,750
Being invited as a judge

498
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,510
will make you more popular in China.

499
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,640
I said I wouldn’t go!

500
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,910
Sichen, don’t be stubborn.

501
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,300
We must go

502
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,220
to tomorrow’s news conference.

503
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,630
Do you know what this is?

504
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,700
What’s this?

505
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,150
Impossible!

506
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,150
Don’t say that, Sichen.

507
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,740
I beg you.

508
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,420
I beg you to say yes.

509
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,910
Yes?

510
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,630
Yes.

511
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,510
No!

512
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,990
Sichen,

513
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,660
don’t be stubborn.

514
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,910
Being a judge for such competitions

515
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,750
brings good to your development.

516
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,870
I’m a mere painter.

517
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,990
I don’t need to gain popularity

518
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,450
through any competition.

519
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,700
Besides,

520
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,060
going to the news conference
is simply a waste of time.

521
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,820
But...

522
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,950
But I signed the contact.

523
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,220
You did?

524
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,800
I did.

525
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,750
Look, isn’t he the genius painter Zuo Sichen?

526
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,150
He looks younger.

527
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,870
His paintings are avant-garde.

528
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,600
He turns out to be more stylish.

529
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,330
Look! They’re quarreling.

530
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,790
You sighed it?

531
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,340
I did.

532
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,030
You go, then.

533
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,670
Me?

534
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,750
What can I do there?

535
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,540
Didn’t you hear them?

536
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,550
Explain.

537
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,100
Hi, beautiful girls.

538
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,580
Yes, he’s the genius painter Zuo Sichen.

539
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,870
We were talking

540
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,700
about the news conference.

541
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,220
We didn’t quarrel.

542
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,460
Mr. Sichen?

543
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,270
Sichen!

544
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,430
Fatty, go after him!

545
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,330
Coming! I’m coming!

546
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,100
Sichen!

547
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,300
Sichen!

548
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,030
Waiter.

549
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,510
Hello?

550
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,500
Stop bothering me.

551
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,670
I need some peace

552
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,300
before I consider about your offer.

553
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,450
That’s it. Don’t call again.

554
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,550
Bye-bye.

555
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,700
Well, I’m going to the toilet.

556
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,550
Okay.

557
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:09,820
Wait!

558
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,350
You should apologize to my girlfriend.

559
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,900
- You?
- You?

560
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,940
What?

561
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,130
You stole my buddy’s girlfriend?

562
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,790
How come?

563
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,030
You get it wrong.

564
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,200
I’m warning you.

565
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,520
Ye Zhenhan is my buddy’s girlfriend.

566
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,470
Stay away from her!

567
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,000
Ye Zhenhan isn’t Gu Yanluo’s girlfriend.

568
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,340
They broke up.

569
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,550
So what?

570
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,440
They’ll get back together.

571
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,790
No way.

572
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,699
They just have a little problem

573
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,750
for some romance.

574
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,679
Don’t you understand?

575
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,139
You’re wrong.

576
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,699
We’ve got so much news today.

577
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:27,270
Playboy and adorable straight-A student.

578
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,310
What a great couple!

579
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,219
Get up!

580
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,110
How can I get up when you’re on me?

581
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,850
Give me a hand.

582
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,420
Be together! Be together!

583
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,380
Be a couple!

584
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,420
What do you want?

585
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,219
Come with me.
