00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,200
with the money on their hands.

171
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,140
The Barnum Effect explains

172
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,140
why many people think

173
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,990
fortune-tellers make accurate predictions.

174
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,630
Since those who turn to fortune-tellers

175
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,870
are very susceptible to suggestion.

176
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,630
Excuse me,

177
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,220
is this the place to hand in

178
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,620
application forms for exchange students?

179
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,690
Don’t you see I’m busy? Wait a moment.

180
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,340
Actually the Barnum Effect is nothing strange
to us,

181
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,310
for instance, in common astrology.

182
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,870
In the following,
let me demonstrate the effect

183
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,630
through an example.

184
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,990
Let’s welcome one of the viewers on the scene

185
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,140
to come up and do the demonstration with me.

186
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,890
Come on.

187
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,240
Someone needs to go up.

188
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,800
You.

189
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,460
Me?

190
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,270
I can’t.

191
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,780
Come on!

192
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,070
Miss Ye, right?

193
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,620
Yes.

194
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,340
I’ll take this form.

195
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,950
Do us a favor and go on the stage.

196
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,950
I can’t.

197
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,990
Come on.

198
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,660
Be quick to do us a favor on the stage.

199
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,270
I…I really can’t.

200
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,020
I’ve taken your form.

201
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,020
I’m not ready yet.

202
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,780
I…

203
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,580
I really can’t, I…

204
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,590
Thank you for your participation.

205
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,140
It’s you, the exhibitionist.

206
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,340
Have you seen enough?

207
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,180
Excuse me, what is your zodiac sign please?

208
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,430
I…am Aquarius.

209
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,210
In terms of astrology,

210
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,390
girls of every star sign

211
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,580
have fixed personalities of their own,

212
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,780
and the Barnum Effect

213
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,070
sums up the common characteristics of them.

214
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,340
If you can master them all,

215
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,750
just like courting girls,

216
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,870
you’ll be able to win

217
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,460
these female audiences’ favor very quickly.

218
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,270
OK, my fellow student,

219
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,930
move to this side a little bit.

220
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,900
This nasty jerk courts girls with tricks.

221
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,420
Who’s she? Can’t she understand what I say?

222
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,520
Right, I don’t know what coordination is.

223
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,400
It seems this student is a bit nervous.

224
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,990
So for the sake of the camera,

225
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,520
I’ll move to this side a bit.

226
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,660
What’s she thinking?

227
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,130
Aquarius girls appear soft and sensible

228
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,510
with a peculiar, free inner world.

229
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,580
They can accept many unconventional ways of
doing things.

230
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,020
They are the most maverick,

231
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,270
free and open-minded girls of all.

232
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,070
But

233
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,990
on a lot of occasions,

234
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,990
Aquarius girls

235
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,190
don’t pay much attention to their

236
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,850
demeanors, appearances and dressing details.

237
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,580
Don’t you have any misunderstandings about
Aquarius girls?

238
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
Your dress.

239
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,460
Pervert, what are you looking at?

240
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
So indecent.

241
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,320
She’s so stupid.

242
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,020
Your dress.

243
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
What’s she doing?

244
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,780
Intercut.

245
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,390
Pervert!

246
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,140
Was Prince Charming slapped just now?

247
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,870
Who was that girl? Wasn’t she crazy?

248
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,070
Ye Zhenhan even dared slap my Prince Charming!

249
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,020
Yes.

250
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,100
An anti-fan appears.

251
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,020
Fans of Gu Yanluo, head for the studio!

252
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,190
Look, this is what Aquarius girls are like.

253
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,190
According to Barnum’s Law,

254
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,990
they are daring and play by different rules.

255
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,140
Love you or break up with you,

256
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,660
they just won’t give you any reason.

257
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,780
Just like now, who would have thought

258
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,920
I’d be slapped in the face when I asked her
to dine out?

259
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,000
It seems I don’t have an adequate mastery

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,930
of Barnum’s Law.

261
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,850
Boys who understand Aquarius girls are welcome

262
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,320
to leave your comments and suggestions.

263
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,270

Stop!

265
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,710
I can’t run any more.

266
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,950
Forget it, stop chasing.

267
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,140
Ye Zhenhan, I’ll see you in the dorm tonight!

268
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,140
We didn’t find her. Where did she go?

269

Let’s go ahead to have a look.

270
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,270
OK. Let’s go and have a look over there.

271
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:07,990
Go.

272

I have an urgent order.
I’ll tell you tonight.

What an egregious grievance!

This is just a coincidence.

305
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,900
Besides, you acted indecently in the corridor

306
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,870
and openly touched my breast in the studio.

307

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,340
Who’s that girl?

339
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,460
It doesn’t matter who she is.

340
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,510
Growing up,

341
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,870
girls around Yanluo have been pulling
all sorts of tricks

342
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,270
to derive a sense of existence.

343
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,220
I’m used to it,

344
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,390
and Yanluo is used to it too.

345
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,100
Mu Ze.

346
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,500
Then I’m gonna look for delicious food.

347
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,170
Then I’m gonna look for beautiful girls.

348
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,900
Why did you come back?

349
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,180
It's not a lucky day for me.

350
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,380
I’m back here to hide.

351
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,300
Hide from what?

352
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,460
What’s there to hide from?

353
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,580
Mu Ze!

354
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,670
Three months ago,
you said you were terminally ill

355
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,660
and didn’t want to waste my time,

356
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,750
so you bore the pain to bring up a breakup?

357
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,790
I was cured unfortunately.

358
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,940
A month ago, you said the dimension of
my personality you used to like

359
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,870
was gone?

360
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,940
What personality?

361
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,150
Why can’t I remember?

362
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,410
Ten days ago,

363
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,100
in order to catch

364
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,550
the total lunar eclipse’s once-in-400-years
return to its home planet,

365
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,810
you had to part with me?

366
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,550
I missed that indeed.

367
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,270
Maybe I’ll have to stay on the earth

368
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,790
for another 400 years.

369
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,030
How did you manage to

370
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,580
make up such wacky reasons?

371
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,790
And you guys!

372
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,400
You guys even believed him!

373
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,150
How did such a wonderful banquet

374
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,310
turn into a gathering of my exes?

375
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,060
Because you love every woman you meet

376
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,390
as a philanderer.

377
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,640
Although my cousin

378
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,420
often fools around with you,

379
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,670
look at him,

380
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,670
he didn’t acquire any bad habits.

381
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,940
He’s just a chunk of wood.

382
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,220
I’m responsible for this incident.

383
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,180
I apologize to you for the slap.

384
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,300
I’ll pay you the original price of
this bracelet.

385
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,780
But I have a small request.

386
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,060
Could you not lodge a complaint against me?

387
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,050
This job really means a lot to me.

388
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,480
You ought to pay for it.

389
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,010
Why do you bargain with me?

390
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,940
50,000!

391
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,950
This bracelet is so expensive!

392
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,340
Siwan.

393
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,220
Auntie.

394
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,910
Did you see your cousin?

395
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,170
Why hasn’t he come yet?

396
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,460
Auntie, don’t worry.

397
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,180
He’s sure to come for your birthday.

398
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,390
Go on talking. I’ll give him a call.

399
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,300
OK.

400
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,860
My auntie craved for a daughter,

401
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,270
but she

402
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,990
only…has a son.

403
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,030
She’s been urging him to find a girlfriend,

404
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,330
but he puts on a long face

405
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,120
and scares all the girls away.

406
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,580
What’s to be done?

407
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,670
I tell you what,

408
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,630
Sometimes it’s a blessing, not a misfortune.

409
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,800
I’ll see how your brother will
get off the hook this time.

410
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,600
Have you figured it out?

411
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,580
Why? You want to refuse to pay?

412
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,630
How…how can that happen?

413
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,150
Well, could I apply to

414
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,870
pay by installments?

415
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,420
I’ll pay you this amount every month.

416
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,870
10,000?

417
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,270
1,000.

418
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,810
Wait for my complaint.

419
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,860
1,200?

420
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,820
1,500?

421
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,570
In this way, I can pay you 18,000 a year.

422
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,060
Over about 33 months.

423
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,460
Either pay in full or receive a complaint.

424
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,510
It’s up to you.

425
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,250
[The Empress Dowager]

426
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,990
Hi, mom.

427
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,930
Brat, why haven’t you come yet?

428
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,790
I’ll be back soon.

429
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,900
There’s something wrong

430
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,220
with the present I prepared for you.

431
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,030
I tell you what,

432
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,210
I don’t want anything from you

433
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,610
other than a girlfriend.

434
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,820
Mom, why do you relate everything to
a girlfriend?

435
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,550
Honey, I’m waiting for you!

436
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,820
Shut up!

437
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,570
Yanluo, who was that just now?

438
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,630
Your girlfriend?

439
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,870
How could that be?

440
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,550
Save your breath.

441
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,420
Bring her to me right away.

442
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,970
Mom…

443
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,670
That’s settled then.

444
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,940
Hello, hello?

445
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,420
Handsome guy.

446
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,060
Do you need a girlfriend?

447
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,670
One who goes home with you to pacify
your mother.

448
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,870
In your dreams!

449
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,220
As long as you agree to my pay by installments
and don’t complain,

450
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,030
you’ll have a natural choice right away

451
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,270
to fend off your mother.

452
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,880
You don’t need one?

453
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,550
Well, I’m going then.

454
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:58,940
One,

455
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,820
two,

456
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,810
three…

457
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,180
Stop.

458
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,250
Handsome guy,

459
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,910
I’m a professional bit player of my college’s
drama troupe.

460
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,150
Your satisfaction with my acting skills
is guaranteed.

461
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,510
Professional? Bit player?

462
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,550
You look like an aunt.

463
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,410
Handsome guy, it’s not that
I’m afraid of all the troubles.

464
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,340
What on earth are you unhappy with?

465
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,170
It’s my first time to see a girl

466
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,400
who can show no beauty
in every piece of dress she wears.

467
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,890
If you’ll pardon my saying so,

468
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,260
ordinary people cannot

469
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,770
grasp my sophisticated beauty.

470
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,290
Can I design it myself?

471
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,380
You?

472
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,120
Just try every possible way.

473
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,210
Besides, as long as you have my words,

474
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,640
I’ll definitely do a good job of it.

475
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,240
No more nonsense,
or the deal will be canceled.

476
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,330
Are you happy with it?

477
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,870
Barely passed.

478
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,650
Please give me your hand.

479
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,740
I thought

480
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,410
you’d do the opening dance
with Prince Charming.

481
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,810
Exactly. We’ve been looking forward to it.

482
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,580
Look, Prince Charming!

483
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,810
Here comes my brother!

484
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,740
He’s also brought his girlfriend.

485
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,220
He’s so handsome today.

486
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,050
Yes.

487
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,040
Yanluo.

488
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,500
Sorry I’m late. Please go on.

489
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,330
Since you’ve brought your girlfriend here,

490
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,380
why don’t you do a dance together?

491
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,170
Yes.

492
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,100
Do a dance!

493
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,010
Do a dance!

494
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,930
Yes, do a dance.

495
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,050
Do a dance!

496
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,100
Do a dance!

497
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,000
Do a dance.

498
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,860
Come on, clap our hands.

499
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,790
Clap our hands.

500
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,110
Why didn’t you tell me beforehand
it’s such great pomp?

501
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,340
Aren’t you
a self-claimed professional bit player?

502
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,130
So…sorry.

503
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,500
Be careful.

504
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,640
Well, if I finish this dance with you,

505
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,010
can I pay by installments?

506
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,790
Do a good job of dancing first.

507
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,650
Then…you mustn’t go back on your word.

508
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,700
You…wait a minute.

509
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,930
Have a kiss.

510
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,260
- Have a kiss.
- Have a kiss.

511
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,980
Have a kiss.

512
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,190
They are embarrassed.

513
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,170
Mom, let me introduce.

514
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,410
This is…my girlfriend.

515
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,460
Hello, auntie.

516
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,530
I am Yanluo’s girlfriend.

517
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,650
My name is…

518
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,100
Lu Yao.

519
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,930
Great.

520
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,890
Yanluo

521
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,980
has shown his girlfriend to me
for the first time.

522
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,100
It’s because I’m shy.

523
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,660
So in this case,

524
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,270
have you known each other for a long time?

525
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,840
You brat, how dare you keep me in the dark?

526
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,180
I’m gonna kick your ass.

527
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:11,810
Auntie,

528
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,220
Yanluo wanted to give you a surprise

529
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,700
as the best birthday present.

530
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,340
Indeed.

531
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,470
This is absolutely the best present.

532
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,860
What a surprise!

533
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,650
Great.

534
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,340
Everyone, let me introduce to you.

535
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,290
This is my son’s girlfriend

536
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,530
Lu Yao.

537
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,770
Isn’t she as beautiful as her name?

538
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,620
I’m so happy today.

539
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,580
Enjoy yourself. Have a good time,

540
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,340
OK?

541
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,410
OK.

542
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,990
Mom, we are going to…

543
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,810
Grab something to eat. Go quickly.

544
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,100
There’s a lot of delicious food here.

545
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,360
Go quickly. So lovely.

546
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,250
Go.

547
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,260
Brat.

548
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,450
Yanluo…

549
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
What do you think?

550
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,530
Do you think my service is OK?

551
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,160
Barely passed.

552
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,890
Cake.

553
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,050
Sweet and soft.

554
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,340
It’s the taste of happiness.

555
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,500
Marshmallow!

556
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,360
Are you hungry?

557
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,040
Would you like one?

558
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,010
No. It’s childish.

559
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,260
This is so tasty.

560
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,410
Try it.

561
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,770
It’s really tasty.

562
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,050
Try it.

563
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
I said no.

564
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,330
Here I am!

565
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,340
Why do you pull me so hard?

566
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,700
It scares me.

567
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,310
Can you walk properly?

568
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,970
Are you gonna pay for the dress
if you get it dirty?

569
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,580
I…

570
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,380
I’ll roll it up so it won’t get dirty.
