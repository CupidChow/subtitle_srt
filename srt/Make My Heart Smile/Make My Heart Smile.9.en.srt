How am I in bed?

To express my gratitude,

You can make clothes?

My best friend is in the
Fashion department.

How could it be possible?

47

I got no time for anything else.

54

If by any chance you fail it
in front of the camera,

55
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,220
you will be exposed in front of
the whole world?

By any chance?

62
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,670
That will definitely be a blockbuster.

63
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,250
My image will fall apart.

64
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,910
Actually, I don’t care about that.

65
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,310
But it’s related to
Zhenhan’s reputation.

66
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,900
I would risk my life for it.

67
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,260
I don’t think you can make it through
even risking your life.

What to do then?

71

We can’t make the contest cancelled.

72
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,720
No, we don’t.

73
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,590
We can change the contestant.

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,590
Yeah, right!

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,310
Seems badly.

178
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,140
Sir.

179
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,510
I…

180
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,000
Hey, Ye Zhenhan.

181
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,100
What’s happened to you?

182
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Fought with someone?

183
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,020
No, it was a car accident.

184
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
I definitely can’t participate

185
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,540
in the Challenge Cup looking like this.

186
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,510
Of course.

187
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,310
Just leave it.

188
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,870
Are you feeling okay?

189
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,190
Do you want to go back to have a rest?

190
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,870
No need.

191
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,340
Sir, I really cherish

192
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,750
this chance.

193
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,020
But, I can’t make any help this time.

194
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,710
It’s okay.

195
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,760
You just,

196
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,890
sit down, all right?

197
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,190
Ye Zhenhan.

198
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,150
Why do you have to get hurt

199
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,460
at such a critical moment?

200
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,190
You’re dragging Charlotte down.

201
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,990
Sir.

202
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,550
The backing card and banner

203
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,660
are all set now.

204
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,950
I don’t think it’s a good time
to change a contestant.

205
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,630
And more importantly,

206
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,450
the substitute has too less time

207
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,950
to get prepared.

208
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,000
Charlotte is gonna miss
the championship for sure.

209
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,660
We have won for five consecutive years.

210
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,220
It would be a pity

211
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,700
to lose it this year.

212
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,460
Zhenhan, sorry I shamed you

213
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,870
and Charlotte.

214
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
I’ll go for her.

215
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,830
How could he come?

216
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,770
Since it happened,

217
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,660
as long as we pull together,

218
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,990
we will make it through.

219
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,750
And the contest hasn’t started yet.

220
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,900
Don’t lose morale.

221
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
I am willing to fight for Ye Zhenhan.

222
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,870
To help us bring back the trophy.

223
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,660
Please trust me.

224
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,270
We will definitely win if he is in.

225
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,900
Yes, we will definitely

226
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,950
regain the glory.

227
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,070
Yes, regain the glory!

228
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,190
Yanluo, go for it!

229
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,700
Go for it!

230
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,700
Go for it, Prince Charming!

231
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,630
Yanluo! Yanluo!

232
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,830
Go for it, Prince Charming!

233
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,140
Pump it, pump it, pump it!

234
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,340
Okay. Pump it, pump it.

235
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,510
I got all filled up.

236
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,320
Okay guys.

237
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,590
Enough for cheering.

238
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,520
We are in class now.

239
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,950
OK, everyone, sit down.

240
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,780
Open your book to page 23.

241
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,700
So stupid.

242
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,390
How taking care of the others
made yourself like this?

243
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,630
He tried so hard helping me.

244
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,750
But I have to pretend to be sick.

245
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,180
Don’t know if this T-shirt

246
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,780
can make up to it.

247
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,060
What are you muttering here?

248
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,070
Nothing.

249
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,360
Are you preparing for the Challenge Cup?

250
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,700
Is there anything I can help?

251
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,630
Look at you,

252
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,420
how dare I need your help?

253
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,280
Just stay quiet for me.

254
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,580
What are you hiding?

255
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,180
You designed it for me?

256
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,000
Just as childish as you.

257
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Give it back.

258
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,310
But,

259
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,630
I can take it as a thank-you gift.

260
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,270
Is your arm okay?

261
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,870
Don’t worry.

262
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,310
I’m low-born, and I’m tough.

263
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,790
And to thank you

264
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,270
for standing out,

265
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,390
I’ve decided,

266
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,030
that you only need to do
the preparation work

267
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,500
and I will take care of
all the labor work for you.

268
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,180
I need peace.

269
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,990
Just stay quiet.

270
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:57,670
Okay.

271
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,060
Wait for my delicious food.

272
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,420
Your Majesty.

273
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,300
Your clothes have been washed.

274
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,180
Please don’t forget to hang it up.

275
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,220
Silly bean.

276
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,100
It’s a little annoying

277
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,460
repeating these two sentences every day.

278
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,060
Your Majesty, do you have
any instructions?

279
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,150
Or you can call me Your Highness later?

280
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,700
Okay, Your Highness.

281
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,220
Descend

282
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,550
What are you doing there?

283
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,870
Hanging up clothes.

284
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,470
Hanging up clothes?

285
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,470
Do you still want your arms?

286
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,820
Don’t worry.

287
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,790
I’m broken in body but firm in spirit.

288
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,060
I’m a model of toughness.

289
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,670
Don’t flatter yourself.

290
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,680
Do you want me to
give you an award?

291
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,580
No need.

292
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,870
But yes, if the award is money.

293
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,550
I’ll get you a cup of coffee.

294
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,630
Smells good.

295
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,940
For you.

296
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,300
Specially made mocha.

297
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,790
An artifact to stay up late.

298
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,300
Too much sugar and milk.

299
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,390
Excessive sugar content.

300
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,720
I only drink Americano.

301
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,510
I’ll make another cup then.

302
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,510
No need.

303
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,920
Go back to your room.

304
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,710
You’re distracting me.

305
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,150
I’m in the living room.

306
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,910
How does it distract you?

307
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,460
I can’t concentrate.

308
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,420
Silly Bean.

309
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,820
Turn off the living room lights
in five minutes.

310
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,940
Yes, Your Highness.

311
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
Your Highness?

312
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,460
I’m going back to the bedroom.

313
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,450
Silly Bean. Can you change this name?

314
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,420
Yes, Your Highness.

315
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,750
Okay, beans not spilled.

316
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,270
Breakfast?

317
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,270
[Remember to eat it up.]

318
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,420
Remember to eat it up.

319
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,030
My goodness.

320
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,100
Gu Yanluo is turning sweet?

321
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,570
Where is his facade as an idol?

322
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,100
Why am I feeling shameful and guilty?

323
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,700
Seems I have to behave well.

324
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,550
I made a nutritious meal for you.

325
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,390
An unnecessary move.

326
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,030
When will this arm stop swinging?

327
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,870
It makes me feel bad.

328
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,150
The meal looks great.

329
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,910
So many beauties around the handsome.

330
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,640
I don't  have to worry about his
meals.

331
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,420
But look at you,

332
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,400
even your lunch box looks
inferior than hers.

333
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,630
Ye Zhenhan.

334
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,400
This is library. Keep your voice down.

335
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,150
Yanluo, I’m lost here.

336
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,670
Can you explain it to me?

337
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,740
If you think I’m a third wheel,
just tell me.

338
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,030
I don’t think

339
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,310
this question will trouble you.

340
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,460
Since you believe me so much,

341
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
I’ll try it again.

342
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,680
Risking your arm for money.

343
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,420
I cooked by myself,

344
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,230
it’s your bad luck

345
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,750
not having this delicious meal.

346
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,820
So,

347
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,290
you’re here to bring me lunch?

348
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,030

of welfare economics.

Answer now!

475

The equilibrium achieved
by market competition

476
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,130
is the Walrasian equilibrium device…

There is a trap in this question.

489
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,700
What the two conclusions of welfare
economics want to express

490
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,630
is not the relationship between
fairness and efficiency at all.

491
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,460
It mainly expresses

492
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,630
the two key points that
the market can solve

493
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,030
are welfare fairness and efficiency.

494
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,990
To solve fairness,

495
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,630
the initial endowment must be adjusted.

In other words,

I didn’t lose my face in the Pacific Ocean.

520
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,060
Let’s celebrate

521
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,270
for him tonight, okay?

522
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,790
Sure.

523
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,990
Thank you, Gu Yanluo.

524
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,630
Zhenhan, during your absence,

525
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,030
I met a great guy.

526
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:16,910
You…

527
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,910
So handsome!

528
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,160
He is standing in the light,

529
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,230
but I am covered with lies.

530
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,100
I can only look up at him in the corner.

531
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,290
Thanks to Gu this time.

532
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,070
How does Ye Zhenhan have a nerve

533
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,930
coming to the celebration party?

534
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,150
I called her.

535
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,800
We are classmates, anyway.

536
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,150
Yanluo saved her.

537
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,910
She must have a drink to
show her gratitude.

538
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,910
I just don’t feel comfortable with it.

539
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,340
We take turns to drink with her later.

540
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,420
Get her drunk.

541
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,750
So she can remember.

542
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,250
Stop at where it should.

543
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,790
Don’t go too far.

544
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,630
Ye Zhenhan.

545
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,150
It’s just a few days
after the Challenge Cup.

546
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,610
You’ve recovered so fast.

547
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,530
I want to thank you for the injury,

548
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,950
leaving such a precious
opportunity to Gu.

549
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,670
Here, to you!

550
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,790
What?

551
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,060
Gu won the championship,
shouldn’t we celebrate for it?

552
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,060
You’re right. We should.

553
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,100
I will drink it up.

554
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,030
Ye Zhenhan, I wanna make a toast too.

555
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,670
For what?

556
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,110
For…

557
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,139
Whatever it is.

558
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,590
It’s worth celebrating for Charlotte’s
championship.

559
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,190
Yeah.

560
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,989
Yeah.

561
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,860
Yeah, right.

562
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,469
Cheers!

563
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,800
I can’t mess with you
but I can escape from you.

564
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,790
No.

565
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,469
I’m a little dizzy. I need to go.

566
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,350
Wait.

567
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,460
Ye Zhenhan.

568
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,989
I found you are a shirker.

569
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,179
This is just the beginning.

570
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,510
Are you gonna slip again?

571
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,900
I’m really drunk. See?

572
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,000
How did you come?

573
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,260
Thank you for throwing

574
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,760
a party for me.

575
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,630
But we are still students.

576
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,690
We shouldn’t drink too much alcohol.

577
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,830
Just a sip is enough.

578
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,200
You drank too much.

579
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,460
Go back to sober up.

580
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,280
I am not drunk.

581
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,420
I can walk…by myself.

582
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,360
You see?

583
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,920
Gu Yanluo, you dumbass.

584
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,270
You made me a thorn for all girls.

One more.

614
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,790
Three, two, one!

615
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,140
Pick it up.

616
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,710
Hurry.

617
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,750
He still kept it.

618
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,470
And put it in such a place.

Hold it.

634
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,270
Would it be too embarrassing if I wake up now?

635
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,550

Gu Yanluo.

00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,740
This is for me.

644
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,460
For you.

645
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,790
Me.

646
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,940
Still mine.

647
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,220
There’re a lot of foods in our fridge.

648
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,550
This one…is still mine.

649
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,140
No more room.

650
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,470
We need one more fridge.

651
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,190
Why don’t you buy a floor mopping robot?

652
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,900
We do need a robot.

653
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,550
Fine, let’s buy one.

654
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,870
They’re two-for-one. I love them.

655
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,350
It’s no good for your health.

656
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,110
Look.

657
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,790
Keep diet.

658
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,310
This one is OK.

659
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,170
You’ll like it.

660
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,900
No, I don’t like it.

661
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:34,940
How about this?

662
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,470
This one.

663
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,380
I don’t like it either.

664
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,700
This one can be used

665
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:41,830
for cooking.

666
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,550
I hate this carrot flavor most.

667
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,180
What do you want, girl?

668
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,110
Where’re you going?
