2
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,110
Make My Heart Smile

3
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,060
Episode 12
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

4
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,620
What… What are you doing?

5
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,710
Applying the medicine.

6
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,100
No, thanks. I can do it myself.

7
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,790
Don’t move.

8
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,950
It’s permeable.

9
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,540
It doesn’t work if it’s applied on surface only.

10
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,150
I…

11
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,520
If capillaries are broken when you move,

12
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,400
it will be more swollen.

13
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,150
I’m not badly injured. You spray,

14
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,690
and let me rub it by myself.

15
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,430
Ye Zhenhan.

16
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,710
Sorry, I couldn’t help it.

17
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,790
You still haven’t answered

18
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,590
the question I asked that night.

19
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,260
What… What question?

20
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,100
Who was injured?

21
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
It’s me.

22
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,370
Does it hurt?

23
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,710
It’s fine, not too bad.

24
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,230
It’s treated properly.

25
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,230
I’ll prescribe some pills for you.

26
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,180
But you still need to

27
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,900
get a X-ray scan at hospital,

28
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,820
all right?

29
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,230
Don’t you need to go to hospital?

30
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,060
No.

31
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,820
You haven’t answered my question.

32
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,190
You…

33
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,580
Do you hate me?

34
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,420
What you asked was…

35
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,100
What was it?

36
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,340
So you heard it that day.

37
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,800
You’re playing innocent.

38
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,590
I am the soberest one.

39
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,630
Gu Yanluo.

40
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,460
I like you.

41
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,780
Really?

42
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,030
Yes.

43
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,750
I like your confidence, courage and talent.

44
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,640
I love it when you’re acting cool.

45
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,100
I even love your aloofness and ego.

46
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,350
I love everything about you.

47
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,470
But love doesn’t mean we’re meant to be.

48
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:56,710
Why?

49
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,270
Give me a reason.

50
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,710
Reason?

51
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
I’ve told you.

52
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,060
You’re out of my league.

53
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,510
You’re always in the spotlight.

54
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,750
You have plans for

55
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,710
your future, your study and your life.

56
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,110
But I am just a wall flower

57
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,940
who can’t even

58
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,660
imagine where my future is.

59
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,650
I want to know the real reason.

60
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,590
I don’t want to live in your shadow.

61
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,190
I don’t want to be watched

62
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,520
in every single minute.

63
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,030
And if

64
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,659
they know I really love you

65
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,980
and we’re together,

66
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,780
they’ll be pickier on me.

67
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,390
I don’t want every bit of me to be discussed.

68
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,659
So,

69
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,920
just because of these,

70
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,100
you decide to give up on  us,

71
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,909
and to give up me?

72
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,030
Gu Yanluo, no matter how much I love you,

73
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,460
I’m not Zhenhan.

74
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:00,310
I can’t do whatever I want in her name.

75
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,470
Yes.

76
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,680
How could I end up like this

77
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,500
if it’s not because of you?

78
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,470
That’s how you feel

79
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,630
about me.

80
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,220
It really hurts.

81
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,430
Ye, I was looking for you.

82
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,220
Mu Ze told me you’re injured.

83
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,659
How could you get injured

84
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,060
at a P.E. class?

85
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,150
I’ve always been “lucky”.

86
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,220
Did you cry?

87
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,750
Is your ankle broken?

88
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,840
Let me take you to hospital.

89
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,540
I didn’t cry for this.

90
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,870
What else could it be to

91
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,540
make you cry like this?

92
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,910
I

93
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,310
want to go back for a rest.

94
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,500
What? You kissed?

95
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,660
It hurts!

96
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,700
Oh, I’m sorry.

97
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,820
I was too excited.

98
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,750
I’m sorry.

99
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,940
And then?

100
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,750
He left.

101
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,580
What else could it be?

102
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,780
He has so much ego.

103
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,020
Of course he got upset after I refused him.

104
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,309
Why did you upset him

105
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,059
when you know how proud he is?

106
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,460
What else can I do?

107
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,110
Wait a second.

108
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,340
Ye, I heard that

109
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,740
it’s lucky for a girl

110
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,220
to meet her Mr. Right

111
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,020
in her lifetime.

112
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,510
But now I think

113
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,350
it’s kind of a bad luck for you

114
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,190
to have met Gu Yanluo.

115
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,660
Why?

116
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,900
It means

117
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,460
if your Mr. Right is a top notch guy,

118
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,270
but since you can’t be with him,

119
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,670
all the man you meet later

120
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,860
will be overshadowed by him.

121
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,220
Just like the saying,

122
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,390
"comparisons are easily done,

123
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,900
once you’ve had a taste of perfection",

124
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,700
So have you made up your mind?

125
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,100
I…

126
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,310
I don’t know.

127
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,070
But I know I’m not Ye Zhenhan.

128
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,700
I’m Ye Weimian.

129
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,420
Everything he saw about me

130
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,780
is not real me.

131
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,460
Maybe it’s not me who he really loves.

132
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,870
And I can’t take any more risks.

133
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,950
I need to protect Zhenhan

134
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,560
before she wakes up.

135
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,990
What? You really kissed her?

136
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,140
Good for you, man!

137
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,990
Come on, tell me everything.

138
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,140
And then she…

139
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,630
She refused me.

140
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,110
Prince Charming got rejected too.

141
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,780
I am all ears.

142
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,540
Come on,

143
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,710
tell me the details.

144
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,580
Don’t get me wrong.

145
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,440
I just want to help you to analyze.

146
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,220
Sometimes, it’s not necessarily a bad thing

147
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,620
to be rejected by a woman.

148
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,630
It’s true.

149
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,510
They believe a relationship which moves

150
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,220
too fast is not deep enough.

151
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,390
Only after they refuse it a few more times,

152
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,540
can they prove how important they are.

153
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,700
Ye Zhenhan is not

154
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,460
one of those women you talked about.

155
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,310
Women are complicated creatures.

156
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,910
You cannot understand them.

157
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,990
Follow my advice.

158
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,590
You have to be resilient when chasing love.

159
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,870
Don’t give it up.

160
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,670
Where are you going?

161
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,990
Lecture me after you get your dream girl.

162
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,950
Little Luo, you…

163
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,540
Do you see it?

164
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,700
A heart of stone

165
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,820
[Lu Yao]

166
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,390
is melted by me.

167
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,950
Hello, Yao.

168
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,630
Yeah, it’s me.

169
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,580
I am free, totally.

170
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,390
I’ll be right there in a minute.

171
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,630
How’s it?

172
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,140
Do you want me to carry your canvas board

173
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,270
or be your model?

174
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,190
If you want to do nude sketch,

175
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,430
it’s fine with me.

176
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,900
So you’ve already had this plan for long?

177
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,190
Not at all.

178
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,320
One condition:

179
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,780
not many people in the room.

180
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,660
Preferably just you.

181
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,070
I do have a nice body.

182
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,140
Forget about nude sketch.

183
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,340
But

184
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,540
you can be my model for autopsy.

185
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,130
It’s murdering your better half.

186
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,190
All right. Stop joking around.

187
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,510
I have something serious to discuss with you.

188
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,770
Gu Yanluo was refused.

189
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,100
What do you think about the situation

190
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,390
between my bestie and your bro?

191
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,850
Well, that makes two of us fellow sufferers.

192
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,750
I am also being refused by you all the time, right?

193
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,070
I am serious.

194
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,580
We can’t let them torture each other

195
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,190
like this anymore.

196
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,090
We need to find a solution.

197
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,630
That’s absolutely right.

198
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,020
So why don’t you teach me?

199
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,830
I must be an idiot

200
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,700
to discuss it with you!

201
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,750
I know him too well.

202
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,900
He is favored by all.

203
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,950
Barely had setbacks since little.

204
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,870
His pride and ego

205
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,990
will not allow him to

206
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,660
forgive your friend after

207
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,990
being rejected by her over and again.

208
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,900
So what?

209
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,700
There’s nothing impossible

210
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,960
for two people in love.

211
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,780
Mu Ze,

212
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,700
I’ll give you three days

213
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,140
to find a solution.

214
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,900
Or,

215
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,700
I’ll blacklist you.

216
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,140
Yao,

217
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,970
may I have dinner with you?

218
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,620
Go find a solution first.

219
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,510
Why am I always suffering?

220
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,660
I don’t want to see frozen images.

221
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,100
And don’t be out of focus.

222
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,020
Or you’ll be responsible for it.

223
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,220
Get ready, everyone!

224
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,270
Light! Light!

225
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,700
Come on, let’s try it now.

226
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,460
First mode,

227
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,510
second,

228
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,990
third,

229
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,580
forth.

230
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,830
Awesome!

231
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,370
Where is Gu Yanluo?

232
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,510
Here, he’s here.

233
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,750
Gu Yanluo, here you are.

234
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,920
Our guest professor is busy today.

235
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,460
Please help us with the livestream.

236
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,340
But today,

237
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,070
it might take longer.

238
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,630
You…

239
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,540
Your clothes.

240
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,140
Gu Yanluo?

241
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,990
Gu Yanluo?

242
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,300
Let’s start now.

243
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,180
All right.

244
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,780
Get ready, everyone!

245
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,380
Get ready.

246
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
It’ll start soon.

247
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,580
Hurry up.

248
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,540
Gu Yanluo has a livestream today.

249
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,140
We need to go and support him.

250
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,330
Wait a minute, everyone.

251
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,210
Hold on please.

252
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,630
Come on, be quiet.

253
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,360
I have an announcement to make.

254
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,830
It’s not a bad thing.

255
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
Tomorrow afternoon,

256
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
a delegation will visit our campus.

257
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,900
The headmaster wants

258
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,990
the poster wall of every department

259
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,460
to be painted

260
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,750
and updated.

261
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,100
The theme is love and life.

262
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,430
Look,

263
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,830
what a great theme!

264
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,980
It’s time to show your talent now.

265
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
Who wants to be the volunteer?

266
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,390
Well,

267
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,220
our poster wall was

268
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,540
painted by Gu Yanluo.

269
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,770
But today,

270
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,740
he needs to give a livestream lecture.

271
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,700
I guess he can’t make it tonight.

272
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,140
We need someone to

273
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,190
do the job for him.

274
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,990
Who volunteers to do it?

275
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,110
I don’t know how to draw.

276
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,950
I know a little.

277
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,510
But who dares to redo Gu Yanluo’s painting?

278
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,770
What if it’s destroyed?

279
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,170
Why don’t we wait for him?

280
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,070
Don’t leave it to him every time.

281
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,220
He is not Superman.

282
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,990
It’s too much work for him

283
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,070
to give a lecture and paint the wall.

284
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,270
I can do it.

285
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,830
Ye Zhenhan, can you finish it alone?

286
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,430
I give you my word.

287
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,950
Great! It takes a lot of courage.

288
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,140
We should give her a clap.

289
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,460
OK. Let’s call it a day.

290
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,270
Class is over.

291
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,340
Can’t believe she pushed herself forward.

292
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,950
Does she even know how to draw?

293
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,280
Don’t bring shame on us.

294
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,100
I don’t know if she knows how to draw.

295
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,270
But I know it’s going to rain tonight.

296
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,150
It’s going to rain?

297
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,210
Once upon a time, there was a crocodile.

298
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,030
He was chewing something.

299
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,220
The falling crumbs

300
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,300
became the stars all over the sky.

301
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,910
Somewhere far from the crocodile,

302
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,560
there was a little girl whose dreams were

303
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,750
brightened by the crocodile’s stars.

304
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,180
Anything missing here?

305
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,690
There’s a lot of space.

306
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,270
Love and life.

307
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,220
It feels like something is missing.

308
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,750
Got it!

309
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,860
Why is it raining now?

310
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,630
Oh my God.

311
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,880
My painting is destroyed.

312
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,940
What can I do? It’s getting heavier.

313
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,220
Please stop raining.

314
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,580
What to do now?

315
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,790
Are you awake?

316
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,920
Have some water.

317
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,390
Why am I here?

318
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
You were weak,

319
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,030
burnt out and caught in the rain.

320
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,340
So you passed out.

321
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,630
Shoot! The poster wall.

322
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,910
Don’t get out of bed.

323
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,270
Your feet are still swollen.

324
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,400
No, I have to go back.

325
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,700
If I can’t finish the painting, the delegation will

326
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,670
have a bad impression of the school.

327
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,060
Zhenhan will be smeared again.

328
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,940
Don’t worry.

329
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,780
Gu Yanluo said he’ll handle it.

330
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,870
Gu Yanluo?

331
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,300
He sent you to the hospital

332
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,150
and saw me in front of Zhenhan’s ward.

333
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,060
So Zhenhan…

334
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,100
He didn’t find out. He was rushing to

335
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,180
the hospital with you on his arms.

336
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,220
I said I’ll get the prescription from doctor.

337
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,030
Then he asked me to take care of you.

338
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,270
What else did he say?

339
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,150
Not much.

340
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,420
He said he’ll take care of the things

341
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,710
at school and asked you to get rest.

342
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,220
What can he do?

343
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,270
The painting must have been destroyed.

344
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,110
Here it is.

345
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,300
Be careful.

346
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,210
Do you have to go there today?

347
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,340
Why can’t you wait for another day?

348
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,550
You’re injured. Teacher will understand.

349
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,300
No.

350
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,300
It was raining the whole night.

351
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,230
The whole wall might be destroyed.

352
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,670
I need to check it.

353
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,700
Ye Zhenhan, why are you here?

354
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,420
You painting…

355
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,020
Hurry up. Not much time left.

356
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,420
I need to go now.

357
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,670
Bye.

358
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,590
Be careful. Watch your feet.

359
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,340
Call me if you need anything.

360
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,150
All right.

361
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,990
Excuse me.

362
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,670
Excuse me, please.

363
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,100
Ye Zhenhan.

364
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,620
I didn’t know you paint so well.

365
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,870
Yeah, so pretty good.

366
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,700
I don’t quite get it.

367
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,630
But it feels full of love.

368
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,870
Thank you.

♫ The sun comes out after the rain ♫

370

Your clothes.

375
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,540
♫ I just want to tell you that ♫

376
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,260
♫ I have been unsettled lately ♫

377
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,300
♫ My heart was racing ♫

Excuse me.

391
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,700
Yanluo,

392
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,060
thank you!

393
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,670
No problem.

394
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,100
I’m the president of Students’ Union.

395
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,690
It’s my duty to protect Charlotte College.

396
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,460
Little Luo is being stubborn again.

397
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,300
It seems I have to take it from here.

398
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,460
So

399
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,820
Gu Yanluo helped you again?

400
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,760
How’s his painting?

401
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,790
Is our fashion talent satisfied?

402
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,550
Just so so.

403
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,670
Seems someone is quite happy.

404
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,450
I have something to tell you.

405
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,220
What is it?

406
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,630
You were at low ebb these days.

407
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,580
And it affected your creation.

408
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,990
So I decided to

409
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,870
take you out tomorrow.

410
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,820
Sounds good?

411
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,220
No.

412
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,150
I have been running back and forth.

413
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,630
And I missed a lot of lessons.

414
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,870
I need to catch up.

415
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,870
Girl, with your talent, it’s no big deal

416
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,390
to take one day off.

417
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,820
Just be my guest.

418
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,460
All right, I’m all yours.

419
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,750
Look,

420
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,380
how’s it?

421
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,030
So why did you bring me here?

422
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,910
Today is an important day

423
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,940
in my life.

424
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,990
I plan to confess my love to

425
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,550
my angel Yao right here.

426
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,150
Are you sure you don’t want to see it?

427
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
I’m giving you a free lecture today.

428
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,180
To show you what a well-prepared,

429
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,940
sincere, unprecedented and

430
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,390
romantic confession looks like.

431
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,270
Look,

432
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,420
I will tell her I love her

433
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,550
in this house

434
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,180
full of love letters.

435
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,910
By the way,

436
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,560
please get me a speaker

437
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,690
and a bouquet of flowers.

438
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,620
Then wait for me somewhere nearby.

439
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,460
If love letters won’t work,

440
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,820
I have plan B,

441
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
the flowers.

442
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,270
Don’t run late.

443
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,430
My happiness will depend on you.

444
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,940
It’s such a nice day.

445
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,670
Are you happy?

446
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,390
Yes, I am.

447
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,270
Look at this color.

448
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,340
So beautiful!

449
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,750
So pretty!

450
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,420
Come here.

451
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,580
Ye.

452
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,020
What’s wrong?

453
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,030
Why did you stop?

454
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,670
Lu Yao,

455
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,460
why did you bring me here

456
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,870
all of sudden?

457
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,510
Because since last time you told me

458
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,910
about the social practice class,

459
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,670
I’ve always wanted to come here.

460
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,550
It’s so pretty,

461
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,300
so romantic, isn’t it?

462
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,300
Are you playing romance with me?

463
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,990
Why not?

464
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,150
Or are you going to love someone else?

465
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,550
How could it be?

466
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,300
Yao, welcome to my heart.

467
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,030
- Idiot!
- This way!

468
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,630
Yao, one may have lots of flings,

469
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,940
but one deep love only.

470
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,910
You’re my one and only ever since I saw you.

471
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,300
I know you feel the same to me.

472
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,630
Aha, I see.

473
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,500
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

474
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,630
Mu Ze!

475
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,570
How dare you do this to me?

476
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
I thought he truly wanted to help me.

477
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,340
But I didn’t expect this.

478
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,500
Just you wait!

479
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,700
Yao.

480
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,300
If you want to proceed our plan,

481
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,180
please find me at the location on your phone.

You had a plan?

485
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,460
Well, I…

486
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,910
Ye,

487
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,210
I need to go. Wait for me.

488
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,340
OK.

489
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,420
Yao.

490
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,700
Welcome to the house of love letters

491
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,270
I prepared for you.

492
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,750
I must take a good look at it.

493
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Please, my queen.

494
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,400
Take a look inside.

495
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,970
What are you doing?

496
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,380
You haven’t read the letters.

497
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,340
You’re just good at nothing.

498
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,080
I knew I cannot count on you.

499
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,090
Now, you just wait here.

500
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,340

501
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,510

Where are you going?

504
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,220
Don’t leave me alone.

505
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,670
I’m back.

506
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,990
You’re back.

507
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,390
How happy you are!

508
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,750
What did you do to him?

509
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,060
He asked for trouble himself.

510
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,710
I just let him reflect on it.

511
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
Look!

512
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,670
