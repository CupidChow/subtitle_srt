Protecting My Girl

4
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,350
Time for dinner. I’m a bit hungry now.

5
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,250
I miss Grandma’s cooking.

6
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,510
Grandma, we’re back!

7
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,350
Grandma!

8
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,620
Grandma!

9
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,350
You’re back.

10
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,860
Dinner is ready.

11
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,950
It smells so good!

12
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,100
Go wash your hands first.

13
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,720
And have a seat for dinner.

14
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,460
Grandma, is Gu Yanluo back?

15
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,660
Not yet.

16
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,460
Didn’t you three go out together this morning?

17
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,260
What happened? Is he lost?

18
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,150
Grandma, why don’t you have dinner first?

19
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,150
Let me go find him.

20
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,070
Xingxing.

21
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,740
It’s getting dark.

22
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,070
Let me go there with you.

23
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,620
No, thanks. You may have dinner first.

24
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,950
I’ll go find him myself.

25
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,150
Chen.

26
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,460
Chen.

27
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,540
Sit down and have dinner.

28
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,380
All right.

29
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,620
Chen.

30
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,820
Thanks, Grandma.

31
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,310
Why is it raining?

32
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,020
Gu Yanluo, the stupid one.

33
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,820
I bet he didn’t bring an umbrella

34
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,100
and is now sleeping in the car.

35
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Let me wake you up.

36
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,740
Gu Yanluo!

37
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,620
Gu Yanluo!

38
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,430
Yanluo!

39
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,540
Where is he?

40
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,590
Could it be he is still at that place?

41
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,310
Yao,

42
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,230
just give me a chance,

43
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,710
I promise to give you a big surprise.

44
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,590
Don’t act so cool.

45
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
I promise it will be super exciting.

46
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,060
This is the prelude.

47
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,659
The real surprise

48
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,430
is over there.

49
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,820
Look, how’s it?

50
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,490
Is it a surprise? Are you surprised?

51
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,870
Is it expensive?

52
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,770
How expensive could it be?

53
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,900
Sir.

54
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,750
How much is it?

55
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,710
This…

56
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,820
This is not for sale.

57
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,780
This engine was out of production long ago.

58
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,820
I put it here for decoration.

59
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,930
It’s my personal collection.

60
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,630
Can you please do me a favor?

61
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,750
My girlfriend’s motorcycle is broken.

62
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,540
This is the only model fit for her motor.

63
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,340
My happiness now totally

64
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,820
depends on this engine.

65
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,710
I met you before.

66
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,780
Did we?

67
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
Is my face so cute, so impressive?

68
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,190
I remember it when you talked about motor.

69
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,190
Last time

70
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,790
you added water in the fuel tank.

71
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,290
Were you out of diesel?

72
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,909
I told you at that time

73
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,940
you can’t do it to an old motor.

74
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,000
You didn’t listen.

75
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,750
Well, it wasn’t me.

76
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,220
Excuse me, is it true about what you said?

77
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,340
Yeah, I told him so,

78
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,220
but he didn’t listen.

79
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,100
So I just left him alone.

80
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,430
We’ll fix this ourselves.

81
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,340
All right. See you then.

82
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,310
Yao, Yao,

83
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,250
please give me a chance.

84
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,450
I can explain why you need to forgive me.

85
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,330
I didn’t know

86
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,750
that motor is so important to you.

87
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,550
And I didn’t expect to mess it up.

88
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,340
I was just…

89
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,150
Mu Ze, you badass.

90
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,190
You’re such a badass!

91
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,060
Yanluo.

92
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,060
It’s so dark now.

93
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,060
Where is he?

94
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,470
Y&y?

95
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Did he come here?

96
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,540
Gu Yanluo.

97
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,060
Where have you been?

98
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,060
Why don’t you go home for dinner?

99
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,930
Are you looking for me?

100
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,990
Grandma is worried. She asked me to find you.

101
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,320
You can go back now. I know how to get there.

102
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,220
Are you looking for this?

103
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,060
Xingxing!

104
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,710
Xingxing!

105
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,760
Didn’t you say you don’t care about me?

106
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,500
Why are you looking for me?

107
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,380
I wanted to ask you.

108
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,590
Why don’t you stay at home?

109
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,820
What are you doing here?

110
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,050
Why did you go out with Zuo Sichen?

111
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,980
If you weren’t angry with me the other day,

112
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,070
I wouldn’t go out.

113
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,440
I saw you two were so close that day,

114
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,780
how can I not be angry?

115
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,460
And I am your boyfriend.

116
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,230
I haven’t visited your home.

117
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,500
How could he go there before me?

118
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,250
Stop laughing!

119
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,390
I didn’t know
you poker face and Prince Charming

120
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,830
can be so jealous.

121
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,090
Who is the jealous one?

122
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,320
You misunderstood me and Xia Yuanqing

123
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,190
and stopped talking with me for so long.

124
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,080
No, you misunderstood.

125
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,140
In fact, I know there’s nothing

126
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,630
between you and her.

127
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,430
What I was upset about was

128
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,540
how could you let her

129
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,660
stay at our place and

130
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,390
let her wear the T-shirt I gave you?

131
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,750
How could you let it happen?

132
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,410
So you trusted me all the time.

133
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,780
Yes, you idiot.

134
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,470
You don’t even know what I was upset about.

135
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,900
How do you butter me up?

136
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,780
I’m sorry.

137
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,780
I promise it will never happen again.

138
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,340
I also did something wrong.

139
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,870
I will not be angry with you.

140
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,460
I’ll try not to lose temper.

141
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,060
It’s fine if you lose temper.

142
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,230
The important thing is to

143
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,540
trust me

It’s already in your hands.

149
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,130
You’re such an irresponsible owner of it.

150
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,510
You almost lost it.

Don’t believe you buy me like that.

156

Improper driving may cause accidents.

My advice for you,

207
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,110
don’t look into others’ car when driving.

I’m challenging your relationship with her

314
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,300
which led to the unfair result.

315
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,950
I have a picture as proof.

316
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,320
She has a picture.

317
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,180

We’ve paid so much effort for this.

321

In the end we’re just cannon fodder.

322
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,300
It’s so unfair.

323
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,910
Does knowing her mean I’m unfair to others?

324
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,670
There are other judges in the committee.

325
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,390
How can you be sure

326
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,260
I can make the final decision on my own?

327
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,940
Our scores are very close.

328
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,330
It’s possible she won because of

329
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,300
the additional points you gave her.

330
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,150
And we know that

you’re very popular in the industry.

He admitted they knew each other.

345
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
He may have leaked the theme.

346
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,870
It’s not surprising she has a better design.

347
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,270
- Yes.
- Right.

348

Nonsense.

for University Students sponsored by

353
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,060
the Gu’s Group.

354
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,460
I am the Group’s representative, Gu Yanluo.

355
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,390
The theme of this contest is

356
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,500
GS Get Surprise.

357
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,550
I believe all the candidates

358
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,790
are very talented.

359
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
But it’s out of our expectation that

360
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,920
the contest is challenged.

361
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,060
In order to address your concerns,

362
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,550
and to have a fair competition,

363
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,870
our group decides to add one more contest.

364
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,060
The committee will give another theme.

365
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,390
This candidate needs to be reassessed

366
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,220
within the given time.

367
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,100
If her next design

368
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,330
is not satisfying,

369
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,630
we will cancel her championship.

370
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,300
Of course,

371
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,600
if she can submit

372
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,270
a good work,

373
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,270
then

374
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,080
she will be the real champion of this contest.

375
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,460
I agree.

376
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,270
Let art and design speak for itself.

377

I’ll quit from the committee.

378
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:51,100
I’d like to attend the extra contest,

379
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,870
to accept the challenge.

380

Art is everywhere.

One cannot be confined by artistic forms.

What matters is your emotion.

Distance, overlapping.

This is my design for this contest.

The pattern is ouroboros.

398

The theme of the contest is

406
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,260
so close yet so far.

407
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,340
I was thinking

408
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,910
how to present the idea

409
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,300
of “so close yet so far” by clothes.

410
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,440
The idea of "far"

411
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,390
reminds me of remote places.

412
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,340
It’s a distant dream,

413
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,660
or slim hope,

414
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,620
or fear for an unknown future.

415
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,790
I was hesitant in my life.

416
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,750
I made mistakes.

417
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,300
I even felt depressed sometimes.

418
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,150
Just like every one of us here today.

419
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,060
But sometimes

420
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,300
we can pursue a simple life.

421
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,300
The difficulties lying ahead aren’t important.

422
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,910
What matters is how we face them.

423
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,870
I think "so close yet so far"

424
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,630
is a dialectical idea.

425
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,860
If you’re always hesitant,

426
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,750
a step away is like thousands of miles away.

427
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,270
But on the contrary,

428
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,060
if we’re brave and march forward,

429
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,300
the remote place is like next door.

430
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,030
And for this dress,

431
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,750
I have a special design.

432
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,030
Look!

433
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,860
Now it turns

434
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,030
from a short dress to a long one.

435
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,140
It’s like a bud becomes

436
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,670
in full bloom.

437
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,750
Just like our youth.

438
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,030
We need to face the difficulties bravely.

439
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,220
After we overcome setbacks and distance,

440
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,670
we will embrace a rosy future at last.

441

in such a short time.
