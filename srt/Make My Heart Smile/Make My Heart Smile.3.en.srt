00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,110
Make My Heart Smile

3
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,100
Episode 3
Secret romance? That’s thrilling!

4
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,950
Her.

5
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,430
OK.

6
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,430
Gu Yanluo and Ye Zhenhan

7
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,990
will be in a group.

8
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,760
- Are you Ye Zhenhan?
- Well done, well done.

9
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,380
- Aren’t you Lu Yao?
- Very well chosen.

10
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,050
- How can I use my real name
- Straight A students.

11
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,350
- when I practice fraud at other people’s home?
- Very well chosen.

12
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,740
- A girl must protect herself well.
- OK, class.

13
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,990
Next, please open your textbook.

14
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,610
[Ye Zhenhan]

15
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,710
What is sociology?

16
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,230
Are you OK?

17
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,940
- Are we enemies?
- Just as we are constantly dealing with

18
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,210
economic problems,

19
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,800
Turns out you are

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,370
- Ye Zhenhan.
- we are also constantly dealing with

21
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,500
- Well done.
- sociological problems.

22
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,150
From family relations to work relations,

23
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,870
from marriage and childbirth to childrearing.

24
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,670
Yuanqing, why did Prince Charming join a group
with that blockhead?

25
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,540
First of all, each of us

26
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,740
has social attributes.

27
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,260
Yanluo would of course choose a partner

28
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,730
who’d not drag down his grades

29
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,730
while also being honest and docile.

30
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,950
But I still think

31
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,060
you and Prince Charming are the best
combination.

32
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,950
Sociology focuses on objective

33
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,180
and measurable social phenomena.

34
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,740
Which page are we exactly on?

35
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,820
It studies the social foundations of
economic phenomena.

36
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,020
There’s even this kind of stock-in-trade.

37
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,460
No turning of pages, no note-taking.

38
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,010
Have you seen enough?

39
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,070
Ye Zhenhan.

40
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,660
Here.

41
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,460
Ye,

42
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,960
could you please answer my question?

43
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,020
What question?

44
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,070
Yes.

45
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,380
Gu’s side face is quite handsome indeed,

46
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,950
but you can’t take his side face

47
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,550
as the course you are taking.

48
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,820
You should also listen to what I say
when necessary,

49
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,540
OK?

50
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,149
OK, go on to

51
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,209
answer the question raised just now.

52
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,200
What’s wrong with you?

53
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,940
You don’t know what the question is?

54
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,340
Just now Xia

55
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,800
brought up Mrs. Machlup’s Wardrobe Theory.

56
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,100
Explain it to us.

57
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,310
I know what a wardrobe is.

58
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,200
I’m also good at wardrobe design.

59
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,340
But who is Mrs. Machlup?

60
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,310
Why is the finance major related to wardrobes?

61
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,050
Ye Zhenhan.

62
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,820
Sir,

63
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,060
I’d like to leave it to my partner Gu Yanluo.

64
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,220
You are afraid the top student

65
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,370
would drag your grades down, aren’t you?

66
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,310
Sir,

67
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,750
since Gu has volunteered to choose me
as his partner,

68
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,750
I’d also like to find out

69
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,540
my future partner’s actual strength.

70
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,380
I decline.

71
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,970
I’m also looking forward to Ye’s answer.

72
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,820
Sir, as you said just now,

73
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,190
the duo’s final score will be group-based.

74
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,600
I’m not being skeptical of Gu’s ability,

75
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,060
but the telepathic understanding of the two
is also very important.

76
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,020
Gu,

77
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,150
I’m really disappointed with your attitude.

78
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,090
That makes sense too.

79
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,710
So, Gu,

80
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,150
would you like to help your partner?

81
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,430
Mrs. Machlup’s Wardrobe Theory means

82
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,060
Machlup compared the monetary authorities’

83
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,590
behavior of increasing currency reserves

84
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,450
to maintain financial stability

85
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,990
to his wife’s pursuit of

86
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,470
new clothes in her wardrobe.

87
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,800
Technically speaking,

88
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,590
it is a half-joking metaphor.

89
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,780
Well done.

90
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,340
OK, you can both sit down.

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,300
Back to the content we are going to
look at in this lecture.

92
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,300
- Were you flirting with me?//
- French sociologist…

93
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,750
Flirting with you?

94
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,260
Gu, have you heard of

95
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,780
an Internet buzzword called

96
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,150
Narcissistic Personality Disorder?

97
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,590
Good job.

98
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,430
Listen.

99
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,159
Paying by installments is cancelled.

100
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,540
Is that clear?

101
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,430
You go back on your word!

102
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,920
Be attentive in class.

103
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,060
Comte was the first to propose

104
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,820
the new term sociology

105
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,990
and pioneered the framework and conception
of sociology.

106
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,520
He pointed out that

107
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,980
human society is marked by unitarity.

108
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,990
The sensibilities of human nature…

109
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,030
Handsome guy, I’m in the wrong.

110
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,470
And the intelligence of human nature

111
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,930
are the tools to propel social development.

112
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,940
An ideal society should be one

113
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,470
where everybody has positivistic thinking,

114
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,940
entrepreneurs or scientists are in power…

115
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,030
Gu, a generous man never remembers
past wrongs.

116
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,060
There is no war,

117
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,630
and a very orderly industrial society.

118
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,950
Everybody has one goal, which is…

119
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,910
I’m sorry.

120
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,750
Ye Zhenhan.

121
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,909
- Here.
- What happened?

122
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,370
I was picking up my pen.

123
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,630
OK.

124
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,750
I thought there was a scene of Havoc in Heaven.

125
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,170
Be attentive in class.

126
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,540
What a nice smell!

127
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,290
It tastes good.

128
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,340
Zhenhan.

129
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,410
Jiuyue, what brings you here?

130
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,910
There’s something on the corner of your mouth.

131
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,460
Wipe it off yourself.

132
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,370
Zhenhan, what’s wrong with you these days?

133
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,940
You are a bit unlike your usual self.

134
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,820
My usual self?

135
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,220
No, I’ve been doing well.

136
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,500
I’ve done the math carefully just now.

137
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,220
Plus today,

138
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,590
it’s been eight days since you stopped
calling me back,

139
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,870
three days since you
stopped going to the library with me,

140
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,429
and in the morning,

141
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,700
you were running away at a speed of 5km/hour.

142
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,750
It appears,

143
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,510
Zhenhan, you are shunning me.

144
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,220
No.

145
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,190
I was late this morning.

146
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,660
I didn’t see you in the teaching building.

147
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,100
Besides, my cellphone was broken and I’ve just
got it fixed.

148
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,140
That explains it.

149
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,780
Do… Do you have classes tomorrow?

150
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,180
Let’s go to the library together.

151
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,110
Same as usual. You work, and I read.

152
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,510
No, no, no.

153
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,020
I work, and you read.

154
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,310
You work, and I read?

155
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,090
Are you sure you didn’t get the wrong script?

156
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,670
How come they are together?

157
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,870
Mr. Playboy,

158
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
how are you getting on with the thing

159
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,270
I asked you to find out for me last time?

160
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,390
Rest easy.

161
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,310
I know the color of every female cat on campus.

162
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,920
Such a trifle of yours…

163
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,330
Can you not talk in such a disgusting way?

164
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,070
If you get it done,

165
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,580
I’ll immediately ask pretty girls

166
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,830
to play Penta Kill game with you this evening.

167
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,750
OK?

168
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,540
Lu Yao

169
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,900
doesn’t seem to be a student of our
main campus.

170
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,780
I heard

171
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,430
she’s the beauty queen of the Fashion Design
Department on the branch campus.

172
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,310
It’s said

173
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,000
she has fair skin, a pretty face and long legs

174
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,730
with shapely boobs and butts.

175
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,070
Hang on, hang on.

176
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,300
Well,

177
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,650
is the Fashion Design Department so short of
beauties now?

178
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,100
Besides, setting aside fair skin and
pretty face,

179
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,390
but long legs, shapely boobs and butts,

180
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,510
is that how the girl

181
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,970
we saw at the banquet last night looked like?

182
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,110
That’s the case indeed.

183
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,190
Well, can you do it or not?

184
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,430
Isn’t your so-called campus belle sniper

185
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,270
the tagline of a fake advert?

186
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,270
Gu Siwan.

187
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,270
What?

188
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,220
You can insult my IQ,

189
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,070
but you can’t insult my EQ.

190
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,750
Got it?

191
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,990
By the way, Zhenhan,

192
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,020
you usually practice English

193
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,460
in the lakeside corridor from 12 to 1
every noon.

194
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,270
Why did you come so early today?

195
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,580
No wonder I couldn’t find you there.

196
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,590
If I come at that time,

197
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,630
I can’t even buy some bone dregs.

198
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,990
I read it from the Internet that

199
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,830
it’s very ineffective to memorize English words
on an empty stomach,

200
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,780
so I’ve decided to study on a full stomach
from now on.

201
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,630
No.

202
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,780
You usually don’t like surfing the Internet.

203
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,750
Oh no, serial traps.

204
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,460
Zhenhan,

205
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,140
will I give myself away on the very first day
of disguising as you?

206
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,220
I found

207
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,580
I can also learn a lot of knowledge online.

208
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,630
Let’s eat first. The dishes are getting cold.

209
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,150
Isn’t this too much?

210
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,430
She’s just started to date my cousin brother,

211
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,630
then she came to the canteen

212
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,900
to eat spareribs with another young dude

213
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,630
in a lovey-dovey way.

214
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,310
This won’t do. I must go teach her a lesson.

215
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,900
Yanluo!

216
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,070
Cousin.

217
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,830
What’s up?

218
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,750
I…

219
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,900
Cousin, wait here.

220
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,500
I’m gonna enforce justice on behalf of Heaven.

221
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,120
Enforce justice on behalf of Heaven?

222
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,660
Zhenhan.

223
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,780
You usually eat very fast

224
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,210
to make more time for study.

225
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,540
You swallow as many as 40 times per minute.

226
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,870
Why today…

227
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,670
Are you feeling unwell?

228
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,310
Lu Yao, what a coincidence today!

229
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,830
Isn’t that your girlfriend?

230
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,220
She’s not my girlfriend.

231
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,480
She’s not your girlfriend?

232
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,580
She’s Ye Zhenhan.

233
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,150
The one who’s taken away your place for
the Challenge Cup?

234
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,580
Well, where is all this coming from?

235
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,870
It’s very simple.

236
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,660
She’s not my girlfriend.

237
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,140
Her name is not Lu Yao either.

238
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,020
She lied to us.

239
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,180
You’ve mistaken her for someone else.

240
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,170
Her name is Ye Zhenhan.

241
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:47,720
What?

242
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,990
Yan Jiuyue,

243
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,460
I’ve got things to do. I’m off for now.

244
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,390
I’ll see you in the library tomorrow.

245
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,140
Go, go, go.

246
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,840
Where are we going?

247
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,080
I haven’t eaten my spareribs yet.

248
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,190
You usually call me Jiuyue.

249
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,310
Slow down.

250
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,910
Why were you pulling me?

251
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,540
And why did the boy in the canteen

252
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,510
call you…

253
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,700
Ye Zhenhan?

254
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,750
That’s a long story.

255
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,220
Since it’s a long story,

256
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,260
just cut the long story short.

257
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,390
Anyway, I’m not gonna let you go

258
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,190
if you don’t make it clear today.

259
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,390
Siwan,

260
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,170
think about it.

261
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,430
Your cousin brother is both handsome and cool.

262
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,510
He’s Prince Charming of our Charlotte College

263
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,910
and Mr. McDreamy in the hearts of all the girls
of our college.

264
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:46,980
What’s wrong with you?

265
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,660
No, no.

266
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,390
This is different from what you said when
you were drinking last night.

267
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,340
That is not the point.

268
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,580
The point is

269
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,020
your cousin brother has a lot of fans on campus.

270
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,270
In order to protect me

271
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,100
from being dissed by other girls,

272
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,070
he wants us to keep a low profile,

273
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,070
so I don’t use my real name when I go out.

274
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,750
I see.

275
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,190
You guys keep a low profile.

276
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,430
- Yes.
- And have a fake name.

277
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,220
So… Secret romance.

278
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,900
Siwan, you are so clever.

279
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,100
Oh my goodness. This is so thrilling!

280
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,140
In this case,

281
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,660
you two are simply having a monetary
transaction

282
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,140
which has nothing to do with relationships?

283
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,020
That’s right.

284
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,680
Do you really not like her?

285
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,190
Not at all.

286
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,530
Then why did you take her home?

287
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,560
It was a move out of helplessness.

288
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,580
But what’s done by night appears by day, bro.

289
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,990
I won’t let things get out of control.

290
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,310
So make sure you don’t let Siwan know.

291
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,700
But Siwan has gone to see her already.

292
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,140
Here, here.

293
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,220
Hurry up!

294
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,000
I tell you what,

295
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,430
we’ve all been taken for a ride.

296
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,140
What did she tell you?

297
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,950
Anyway, what she should tell me and
what she shouldn’t,

298
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,100
she told it all.

299
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,900
Siwan, your cousin brother

300
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,540
might have done it out of helplessness.

301
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,000
The two of them are in a secret relationship!

302
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,700
This is really once in a blue moon.

303
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,850
My cousin brother is doing such a thrilling
thing with his first date.

304
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,270
Auntie and I were worried

305
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,630
he’d be obtuse and slow about it.

306
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,350
It seems we worried too much.

307
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,340
But I don’t object to

308
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,830
their secret relationship.

309
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,460
But concealment of marriage is a no-no.

310
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,100
Our Gu family will surely hold a high-profile
wedding,

311
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,900
as you know.

312
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,020
Is that really what she told you?

313
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,460
More or less.

314
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,790
I’m so smart anyway.

315
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,560
I’m sure she wouldn’t lie to me.

316
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,940
But I think

317
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,220
Lu Yao…

318
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,190
No, no, Ye Zhenhan

319
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,740
enjoyed eating spareribs with that boy

320
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,630
in the canteen so much just now.

321
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,390
You must remind my cousin brother.

322
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,270
He can’t let down his guard

323
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,100
because of his excessive superiority, right?

324
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
That makes sense.

325
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,460
Life is so hard.

326
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,990
This is just the first day,

327
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,000
and I got lethal serial bombings.

328
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,390
But thanks to my quick wits,

329
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,070
I got things under control and didn’t
let them fall apart.

330
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,790
Something comes up. Let’s meet.

331
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,560
Who do you think I am?

332
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,270
You ask me to come and meet whenever you want?

333
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,990
I’m busy.

334
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,390
We must meet,

335
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,869
or the interest rate will be up by 1%.

336
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,990
If you insist on meeting,

337
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,270
come to the supermarket where I work part-time.

338
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,180
Evil creditor.

339
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,510
The fish for today? So ugly.

340
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,630
A secret relationship?

341
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,870
Who gave you the nerve

342
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,750
to instill such a terrible idea

343
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,010
into my cousin's mind?

344
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,990
I thought we’d never meet again.

345
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,460
Who would have known I’d meet you again?

346
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,660
What’s more, I did it also for your good.

347
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,750
Or when your cousin comes to ask me,

348
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,210
shall I say I was a fake girlfriend you hired?

349
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,550
OK, since we can’t avoid crossing paths,

350
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,200
let’s make three rules.

351
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,910
All right.

352
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,670
As long as the conditions are not over-the-top,

353
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,270
I offer very good after-sales service.

354
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,670
First,

355
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,620
don’t tell anybody

356
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,420
we once pretended to be a couple.

357
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,270
Afraid of splashes?

358
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,060
OK.

359
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,180
Who would tell everybody that
they are a liar?

360
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,870
Second,

361
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,670
don’t have any private contact

362
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,930
with people around me.

363
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,990
OK.

364
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,690
I don’t want to.

365
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,510
Third,

366
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,090
don’t attempt to have any contact with me
on campus.

367
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,910
OK.

368
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,100
No.

369
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,870
I seem to be in the same group with you.

370
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,620
And it is you who forced me to.

371
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,910
Except in class.

372
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,910
What’s more, don’t play with such a
dangerous object.

373
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,820
Is this the fourth rule

374
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,630
or a kind reminder?

375
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,670
Hello, are your fish fresh?

376
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,700
Yes, very fresh.

377
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,310
Which one would you like?

378
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,300
Are they really fresh?

379
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,270
It looks to me like few people are buying.

380
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,580
How can that be?

381
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,870
Isn’t there one here?

382
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,510
Look at this customer’s way of dressing.

383
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,050
You can tell at a glance he has good taste.

384
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,220
He happens to want to try a slice of salmon
I cut.

385
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,030
What?

386
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,370
Didn’t you want to try it just now?

387
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,150
You can ask him in a while.

388
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,270
Here, ah…

389
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,940
Gu Yanluo,

390
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,390
if you don’t eat,

391
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,120
our three rules will be nullified at once.

392
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,400
I’m gonna ask Auntie Gu to have afternoon tea
with me later.

393
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,390
Be good. Ah…

394
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,340
You offer very good services.

395
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,270
It’s a must.

396
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,790
Ask him whether it tastes good or not.

397
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,460
No, no, no.

398
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,750
I’d better try it myself.

399
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,790
There’s also a beauty to feed it to me.

400
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,420
Here, here, here. Ah…

401
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,820
Is it tasty?

402
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,100
At this nerd’s speed,

403
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,550
how long am I gonna be stuck here?

404
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,800
My takeout delivery orders for the whole day…

405
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,270
What’s the time?

406
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,450
Why… Why do you come over here?

407
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,580
I get tired from reading and want to do some
exercise.

408
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,220
Zhenhan, you…

409
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,420
This book is on the upper shelf.

410
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,000
Let me pass it to you.

411
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,820
You didn’t like doing this before.

412
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,820
You said it was a waste of time

413
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,870
and you only came here to study every time.

414
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,870
I’m in my junior year.

415
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,390
I should take part in some social practice.

416
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,820
By the way, can I apply for

417
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,510
a job at the library too?

418
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,630
In this way, I can both do exercise and read
books.

419
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,510
How nice!

420
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,110
Let’s go and apply for it now.

421
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,100
Don’t worry.

422
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,790
You won’t be tired with me by your side.

423
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,390
This looks nice.

424
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,410
Are you done with the formalities?

425
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,750
Shall we start?

426
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,930
Are you all right?

427
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,020
I’m OK.

428
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,240
Does it hurt?

429
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,270
No.

430
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,990
Really not?

431
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,200
Ye Zhenhan, you are quite changeable indeed.

432
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,170
You are not coming to the library as president
of Student’s Union

433
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,460
to have a chat with me, are you?

434
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,180
We are here for an inspection.

435
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,940
Please provide

436
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,030
the book register and the list of reported
losses.

437
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,360
I’ll go get them for you.

438
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,030
Make an inventory of

439
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,650
lost and damaged books here.

440
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,270
You, please

441
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,900
take me to the borrowing area

442
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,430
for an inspection on the management of books.

443
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,060
I’ll take you there.

444
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,940
And you,

445
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,450
you need to provide assistance here.

446
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,870
Go.

447
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,600
Let’s go inside to have a look.

448
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,630
Non-standard hygiene. Points deducted.

449
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,300
Someone specially made rules yesterday

450
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,270
to keep a distance,

451
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,740
and specially came today for nitpicking.

452
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,060
Routine work excepted.

453
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,920
Yes, you are right in everything.

454
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,810
The Chomsky-Foucault Debate,

455
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,010
why is it placed here?

456
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,330
Non-standard. Points deducted.

457
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,680
Well, I’m tired from walking and stretching
my legs.

458
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,100
Bring me that book.

459
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,150
The one on the outer edge?

460
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,300
Here you are.

461
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,630
[How to Improve Language Expression Ability]

462
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,300
First tell me,

463
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,120
what do you check this book for?

464
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,950
Whether it has any damages.

465
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,300
Gu Yanluo, are you doing it on purpose?

466
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,380
This book is so old.

467
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,920
How can it have no damages?

468
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,340
You are indeed here for nitpicking.

469
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,820
I’m just carrying out my routine duties.

470
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,700
You abuse public power for personal revenge.

471
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,410
- Give it to me.
- No.

472
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,100
I won’t give it to you.

473
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,870
I won’t, I won’t, I won’t.

474
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,600
Give it to me.

475
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,790
Hi, Lu Yao.

476
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,630
Go to class?

477
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,990
Roll call?

478
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,190
OK, OK, OK. I’ll be right there.

479
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,180
I have an emergency. Go to someone else.

480
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,420
Class,

481
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,990
today we are going to look at

482
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,460
the three rules of color matching for clothes.

483
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,510
The first one is

484
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,580
you definitely can’t go wrong by matching

485
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,460
colors of the same color scheme together.

486
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,910
For instance, pink with red,

487
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,870
rose red with strawberry red.

488
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,540
In our daily life,

489
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,460
we also see achromatic colors.

490
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,740
Green with orange,

491
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,990
white with black.

492
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,870
Class,

493
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,300
as we can see, the colors on the model

494
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,510
are royal blue and red.

495
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:37,060
Red is a very strong color

496
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,050
which if excessively used

497
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,630
will have an overwhelming sensory effect,

498
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,030
especially vermillion.

499
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,870
The student who has just come in.

500
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,460
Yes, you.

501
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,510
Please come up to demonstrate for us

502
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,770
the application of Hans Hofmann’s arts.

503
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,740
Hans Hofmann

504
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,990
was hailed as Father of Abstract Expressionism.

505
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,670
He had an exceedingly unrestrained soul.

506
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,460
He was bold in using colors

507
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,820
and very good at using contrast colors and
complementary colors.

508
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,180
For instance, the color of my clothes today

509
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,380
is quite suitable for contrast colors.

510
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,030
Ma’am, that’s my answer.

511
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,190
Go back to your seat.

512
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,460
Remember to come to class on time next time.

513
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,100
Go back.

514
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,150
Thanks, ma’am.

515
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,870
All right, class,

516
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,270
now let’s use the materials on our hands

517
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,090
to match colors freely

518
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,960
and experience how they feel.

519
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,130
Judging from what you say,

520
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,060
did she use a fake name?

521
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,100
Exactly.

522
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,140
From given name to last name, it can’t be
more fake.

523
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,910
As I said,

524
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,820
my son is not a blockhead.

525
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,900
Good shot, good shot.

526
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,290
He’s really met the one that makes his heart
flip.

527
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,820
He’s even learnt the trick of secret romance.

528
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,420
Be quick to tell me more.

529
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,390
Anyway, Ye Zhenhan

530
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,210
has very good grades.

531
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,460
Though certainly
not as good as my cousin brother.

532
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,150
By the way,

533
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,460
she’s the one who took away my cousin brother’s

534
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,030
place for the Challenge Cup.

535
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,940
Really?

536
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,950
I begin to like her more and more.

537
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,790
That’s great.

538
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,910
This girl is really nice.

539
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,100
Well, Auntie.

540
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,910
Was my cousin brother given to you for free
when you prepaid your phone bills?

541
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,100
How can you be like this?

542
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,990
I tell you what,

543
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,630
after all these years, I’ve finally found
someone

544
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,560
who can get the better of that brat.

545
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,630
I just regret that

546
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,290
on that day,

547
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,390
I didn’t get to know more about her

548
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,390
on every side.

549
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,640
How does this sound?

550
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,510
Let’s ask her out for dinner

551
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,980
and get to know her again.

552
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,940
What’s going on?

553
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,460
All-around campus beau with an IQ of 200

554
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,030
becomes a dud once joining the game.

555
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,020
Same to you.

556
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,480
I guarantee I can lead my teammates to win.

557
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,180
I can’t lead at all.

558
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,670
What are you doing there?

559
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,790
Turn back. Be quick.

560
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,390
I’m waiting for you. Save me quickly.

561
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,580
How can you do this?

562
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,580
Up, up, up.

563
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,900
I did it. I did it. I did it.

564
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,700
Wait a minute.

565
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,030
Let me show you. Let me show you.

566
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,360
I’m coming. I’m coming.

567
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,820
What are you...

568
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,550
- Group fight is about to begin.
- Hi, Mom.

569
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,510
Brat, I’m formally notifying you

570
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,150
to bring Ye Zhenhan back home next week
for dinner.

571
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,870
Don’t reject. Don’t ask for leave,
Don’t be late.

572
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,300
Don’t, don’t, don’ts for everything.

573
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,030
Bye.

574
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,990
From your mother?

575
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,060
She deserves to be a strong businesswoman.

576
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,620
She means what she says. Hats off to her.

577
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,670
But how long are you gonna let Ye Zhenhan

578
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,550
pretend?

579
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,510
Auntie can tell if a jadeite is a knockoff

580
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,510
by touching it with her eyes closed.

581
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,190
So far it looks like Ye Zhenhan is good at
playing to the score.

582
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,510
She can switch freely between different
personae.

583
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,910
I think she can handle it.

584
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,420
Little Luo,

585
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,270
you have a cold fish personality from start
to finish.

586
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,060
A perfect lady killer.

587
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,190
Come on, let’s go on.

588
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,570
Come on, come on. Don’t use plug-ins.

589
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,510
Lu Yao,

590
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,140
life is so hard for me.

591
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,070
What’s wrong?

592
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,390
I’m dog-tired after having classes and
doing part-time jobs every day.

593
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,340
When I go to college,

594
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,990
I have to deal with the weirdos of
the Finance Department.

595
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,850
I feel I’m either being trapped or abused
every day.

596
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,670
You really can’t tough it out?

597
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,000
Why don’t you come back?

598
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,510
No.

599
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,750
Life treats me like cannon fodder,

600
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,280
but I’ll just fly as I like.

601
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,750
As long as I’m not abused to death,

602
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,870
I’ll definitely live to be my best self.

603
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,220
But if you go on flying as you like,

604
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,970
our livestream studio is gonna close down.

605
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,340
Count the days yourself. When was the last time
we launched something new?

606
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,060
The clothes I livestream every day

607
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,300
nauseate me.

608
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,670
Lu Yao, give me a couple of days more.

609
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,110
I’ll surely present you with the design draft
in two days.

610
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,350
Don’t be in too much of a rush.

611
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,300
Anyway, thanks to my beauty,

612
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,100
it can still last some time.

613
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,470
Just take it as if I’m investing with
my beauty.

614
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,470
Lu Yao, you are the greatest.

615
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,100
I’m in your debt.

616
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,080
Are you going out again?

617
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,420
The cold drink shop is doing a sales promotion.

618
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,030
The shop owner asks me to give a hand.

619
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,960
With double pay.

620
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,700
I’m off.

621
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,530
Hello, boss, I’ll be right there.

622
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,260
It’s me, Gu Yanluo.

623
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,670
It’s you?

624

Ice-cream cones, buy one and get one free!

632
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,670

00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,070
Our new ice-cream cones.

634
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
Ice-creams buy one and get one free.

635
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,700
Welcome to have a taste, guys.

636
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,750
Handsome guy.

637
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,270
Come on, have a taste.

638
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,470

639
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,110

640
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,670
she’s got a different look.

641
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,580
Ice-creams, buy one and get one free!

642
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,450

Ice-cream cones on special offer!

644
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,390
Zihan.

645
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,670
Sorry, I’m sorry.

646
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,550
It’s OK.

647
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,060
Ice-creams, buy one and get one free!

648
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,060
Not to be missed!

649
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,640
What show are you putting on this time?

650
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,060
Dear customer,

651
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,750
would you like to taste our newly launched

652
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,280
super big ice-cream cones?

653
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,550
I need you to have dinner with my mom.

654
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,140
I’m not going.

655
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,180
Let go of your hand.

656
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,780
You haven’t answered me yet.

657
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,050
We have three rules in place.

658
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,110
No contact with people around you.

659
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,060
Pretend to be my girlfriend again.

660
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,520
The terms are negotiable.

661
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,050
Such a man like you who’s fussy, bad-tempered

662
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,140
and requires complicated after-sales services

663
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,000
has been on my blacklist long ago.

664
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Loosen your hand!

665
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
So… So… Sorry.

666
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,810
Are you addicted to ripping clothes?

667
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,510
Come on, come on, come on. Ah…

668
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,630
Is it tasty?

669
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,040
What mischief are you up to?

670
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,060
You even dare to stare at me.

671
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,630
Sir, sir,

672
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,780
don’t take offense. Don’t take offense.

673
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,870
Sir, thank you for your help.

674
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,860
Please move aside if you are not buying.

675
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,190
Who says I’m not buying?

676
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,400
I’ll take all your fishes.

677
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,420
Can you eat them all up?

678
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,810
I can feed them to cats.

679
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,460
You…
