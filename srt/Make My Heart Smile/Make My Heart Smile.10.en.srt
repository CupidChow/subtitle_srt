00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,180
What about a good wish come true?

348
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,940
I’m very sorry, dear client.

349
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,460
You are indeed our shop

350
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,990
top 3 customers in order volume.

351
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,820
But we only draw one lucky customer.

352
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,100
Sorry you missed it.

353
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,030
Good luck next time.

354
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,460
If not me, then who is it?

355
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,550
Man or woman?

356
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,630
We can’t expose customer information.

357
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,750
See you.

358
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,030
Yao, you…

359
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,220
What is this?

360
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,790
What am I doing?

361
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,550
What is Muze doing with so many clothes?

362
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,630
The same T-shirt as Gu Yanluo’s.

363
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,510
Is it for sale?

364
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,670
How much?

365
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,060
Can it be cheaper?

366
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,340
One for each of us.

367
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,180
Yeah.

368
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,580
Anyway, it makes me sad.

369
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,180
If you girls like it,

370
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,460
I’ll give it to you.

371
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,270
Really?

372
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,940
Xiaoyu, come on.

373
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,990
Gu Yanluo’s same T-shirt for free.

374
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,790
Come on.

375
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,910
This for you. For you.

376
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,670
And for you.

377
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,300
Save me one as a souvenir.

378
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,790
Gu Yanluo’s girls are crazy.

379
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,300
Any more?

380
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,820
Would you like to give me one too?

381
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Gu.

382
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,340
Little Luo.

383
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,100
You see how enthusiastic your fans are?

384
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,460
Thanks to you.

385
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,030
I’ve seen a lot of people wearing
the same as me today.

386
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,030
Since you are so kind and generous,

387
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,580
the Student Union is currently
purchasing uniforms.

388
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,090
Not too many.

389
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,910
Just a few hundred.

390
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,300
Thanks Mr. Mu.

391
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,420
Little Luo.

392
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,700
Oh, right.

393
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,750
Tomorrow I will ask them

394
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,060
give you the number.

395
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,820
Come on!

396
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,630
Damn.

397
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,750
So cool.

398
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,810
Awesome!

399
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,580
No more give-aways.

400
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,300
I said, no more give-aways.

401
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,300
How can you do this?

402
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,580
Dear Yao,

403
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,580
you’re torturing me.

404
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,990
Haiyan League sends me
to deliver warmth.

405
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,750
I can finally knock on

406
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,180
the door of my prince charming.

407
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Ye Zhenhan.

408
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,750
Why is she here?

409
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,300
Yuanqing, look.

410
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,300
She is pretending to be serious at school,

411
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,100
and deliberately sat so far away from Gu.

412
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,090
We are all deceived

413
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,180
by her innocent appearance.

414
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,580
Now some people in the forum
support the Luo-Ye couple.

415
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,220
We can’t watch it and do nothing.

416
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,390
As the head of the Haiyan League,

417
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,100
protecting Gu from being entangled
by stalking fans

418
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,270
is my responsibility.

419
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,390
Ye Zhenhan.

420
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,210
Go back to the dormitory after class.

421
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,670
My dear lord,

422
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,100
you gotta answer the phone.

423
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,910
Hello? What is it?

424
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,750
I’m hanging up if nothing.

425
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,910
Thank god you finally answered the phone.

426
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,100
I’m busy.

427
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,550
You have only one minute.

428
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,150
Is that T-shirt still in stock?

429
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,790
Can I get a discount?

430
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,390
Didn’t I just give you a hundred pieces?

431
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,510
You want more?

432
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,340
I want much more this time.

433
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,870
For the sake of our friendship,

434
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,180
give me a discount,

435
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,300
30% off.

436
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,320
40% off.

437
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,700
25% off.

438
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,910
That’s how much our friendship is worth.

439
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,990
More talk, less discount.

440
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,040
Okay, okay.

441
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,100
30% off.

442
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:55,930
How many do you want?

443
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,220
Five hundred.

444
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,450
Five hundred?

445
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,270
Master Mu, are you changing your career?

446
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,460
I have my difficulties.

447
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,420
I love you so much that created some trouble for myself.

448
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,550
Now I’m your super VIP,

449
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,870
any exclusive comfort for me?

450
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,100
How about a dinner?

451
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,180
Sure.

452
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,420
I will send you a dedicated order link later.

453
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Please remember to check.

454
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,300
What have I done?

455
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,630
Ye Zhenhan.

456
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,420
You said you want to move out.

457
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
I always wanted to ask you,

458
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,990
where do you live?

459
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,910
You’re not a native.

460
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,870
How do you suddenly
care about me so much?

461
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,670
You think I don’t know?

462
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,460
You moved out because of Gu.

463
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,460
Fang Meimei, you can’t talk nonsense.

464
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,060
You still want to quibble?

465
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,750
You move out

466
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,700
just for your convenience

467
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,270
to spy on him at anytime?

468
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
Ye Zhenhan.

469
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,750
You’re honest usually.

470
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,150
Never thought you’re a stalker.

471
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,790
You dare come to Gu’s house

472
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,940
to interfere with his life?

473
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,820
You’re so cheeky.

474
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,300
Shame on you.

475
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,940
I didn’t. That’s nonsense.

476
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,910
You are lying.

477
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,870
I saw you go to Gu’s house.

478
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,220
Don’t deny it.

479
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,390
You saw it wrong.

480
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,300
Wrong?

481
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,050
Ye Zhenhan, guess what I got.

482
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,580
You still want to quibble?

483
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,090
Not only did I see,

484
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,150
I also took photos.

485
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
I’m warning you, Ye Zhenhan.

486
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,060
I dare you pester Gu Yanluo again.

487
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,550
Otherwise I will publish the photos.

488
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,180
So everyone in the school

489
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,550
will know

490
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,750
what a bitch you are.

491
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,990
You can’t insult me like that.

492
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,220
Give it to me.

493
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,060
Give it to me.

494
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,700
Who is there?

495
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,030
Who did it?

496
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,990
Come out.

497
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,230
[Student Dormitory]

498
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,390
Throw things down

499
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,940
from such a high place.

500
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,170
What if someone got hit?

501
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,150
Sir,

502
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,550
Ye Zhenhan pushed me on purpose.

503
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,790
So the flower pot is thrown down.

504
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,030
Sir, it’s not what she said.

505
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,300
We were in the dormitory…

506
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,940
OK, I get it.

507
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,630
You two were fighting in the dorm.

508
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,390
Good for you!

509
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,820
Fang Meimei.

510
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,510
Have you got any business to do?

511
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,870
Look at you,

512
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,100
except parties, you’re busy chasing idols.

513
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,340
What are you doing here in school?

514
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,300
Sir, I am an outstanding
representative of the club.

515
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,910
I see, you are excellent.

516
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,980
So excellent to fight in the dorm.

517
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,670
Ye Zhenhan.

518
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,580
