Episode 24
You’re my luck, and I’m your surprise.

4
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,950
Let me be brief.

5
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,230
Please take care of Weimian,
no matter what it takes.

6
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,990
Make sure she eats regularly, sleeps well
and doesn’t get sick.

7
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,870
Don’t let her do anything stupid again.

8
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,660
We’ll do it.

9
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,430
Write a long story about you and your sister.

10
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,460
Serialize it on the forum

11
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,150
so that many people will read

12
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,720
the whole story about you.

13
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,230
I’ll help you.

14
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,730
What can I do?

15
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,070
Use your talent as the king of gossip.

16
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,620
Promote the story as far as you can.

17
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,430
Make sure the story can be spread.

18
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,150
But remember. Don’t exaggerate
or make it sentimental.

19
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,980
Understand?

20
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,260
Yes.

21
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,470
Ye texted me that

22
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,350
she would leave the school.

23
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,350
Let’s get started.

24
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,900
I’m in.

25
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,620
Yao?

26
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,430
Ye.

27
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,460
Why are you here?

28
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,660
Why did you still ask?

29
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,579
How did you have the heart to leave me?

30
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,710
I don’t want this.

31
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,230
But the problem can’t be solved
until I leave.

32
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,260
What about me?

33
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,740
What about our store?

34
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,100
You’ll just give up?

35
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,100
You...

36
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,790
You have Mu Ze.

37
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,950
Give me an order
and I’ll disappear immediately.

38
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,660
Disappear!

39
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,510
Stop it, you two.

40
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,010
Ye,

41
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,100
you poured so much energy

42
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,650
in our featured series.

43
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,010
You should at least finish it.

44
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,150
I... I don’t think I can.

45
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,590
Even if you’re a loser,

46
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,430
you’re still brave Ye Weimian!

47
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,820
Even when you drop out of school,

48
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,610
you have your career and dream.

49
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,990
Our store and I can’t live without you.

50
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,640
It’s so nice to have you.

51
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,500
Come. Let me put it on you.

52
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,589
Let’s go.

53
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,200
Get on the motorcycle.

54
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,980
What about me?

55
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,640
When I keep her luggage,

56
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,550
Little Luo’s girlfriend will not run away.

57
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,140
Grandma, be careful.

58
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,260
Grandma, thank you

59
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,520
for coming all the way.

60
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,659
I’m sorry for the trouble.

61
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,430
Thank you for helping Weimian and Zhenhan.

62
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,870
Let’s go and see the headmaster.

63
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,630
Come on.

64
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,010
You’re not going to show clients
such a bad ending, are you?

65
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,750
Can’t it be a bad ending?

66
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,430
Of course,It can’t!

67
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,500
Everyone suffers in life.

68
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,500
They all want something sweet.

69
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,120
That’s why everyone loves sweet dramas.

70
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,050
They’ll totally

71
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,190
say no

72
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,320
to such a bad ending.

73
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,880
It won’t be popular.

74
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,630
But this is indeed the ending for the story.

75
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,150
There’s regret for certain.

76
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,310
Who told you?

77
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,780
This isn’t the end yet. Why are you sure?

78
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,990
Come and have a look.

It’s the most touching substitute story
I have even known.

81
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,590
There’s sympathy against laws.

94
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,630
There’s no if.

95
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,710
Dude,

96
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,260
however awesome you are, you’re a student.

97
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,990

what do you do?

99
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,520
She still has me.

100
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,470
I finally realize

101
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,730
why you got a girlfriend earlier than me.

102
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,150
Even my heart is thumping.

103

Who can resist your sweet words?

104
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,510
We never expected this problem

105
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,909
to come this far.

106
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,590
As their department head,

107
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,520
I think I should bear some responsibilities.

108
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,260
As far as I know

109
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,909
about Ye Zhenhan,

110
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,940
she has a good attitude

111
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,100
towards study

112
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,650
and she studies very well.

113
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,180
She also helps low achievers

114
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,430
to make progress together.

115
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,870
Could you give her a chance

116
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,540
to continue her education?

117
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,270
If she isn’t punished
for breaking school rules,

118
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,220
that isn’t reasonable.

119
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,960
What will others think?

120
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,380
Can we come up with a solution

121
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,940
to satisfy both side?

122
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,140
Why isn’t there a result yet?

123
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,230
Let’s keep waiting.

Miss Ye Zhenhan,

129
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,220
we’ll maintain your quota
as the exchange student.

130
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,780
But you must catch up with your lessons

131
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,400
and make up for the credits.

132
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,430
Also, you must be
one of the top three students

133
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,700
among final exchange students!

134
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,660
Can you do that?

135
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,540
Yes, I can.

136
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,090
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

137
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,340

You don’t need to drop out of school, either.

145

You’ll have a suspension.

146

how many things he has done for you lately.

You think he has no temper?

157
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,990
All right. For Yao’s sake,

158
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,000
I’ll say no more.

176
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,200
♫ For holding you in his arms ♫

177
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,950
Miss Ye,

178
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,660
I don’t think you should do this.

179
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,430
We broke up, didn’t we?

180
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,240
♫ Loves you with a true heart ♫

183
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,220
Does it mean

184
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,310
you think

185
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,130
you can break up with me

186
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,350
and then get back as you wish?

187
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,580
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

188
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,390
That’s not right.

189
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,520
I didn’t want you to be involved, so...

190
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,070
Can you understand?

191
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,100
When we love someone,

192
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,460
we don’t help him by avoiding him.

193
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,540
Instead, we should work together

194
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,270
to defend our future.

195
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,100
I’m... I’m sorry.

196
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,290
Love that can be easily abandoned

197
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,220
will not be cherished.

198
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,290
♫ Change your taste ♫

199
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,060
♫ The world is beautiful ♫

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,240
♫ There’s another feeling ♫

201
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,630
It’s carved with a capital Y
and a small letter y,

202
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,430
which means

203
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,830
Gu Yanluo will always love Ye Weimian.

204
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,310
Why is it soft drink, instead of liquor?

205
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Drinking liquor will make you more depressed.

206
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,190
The same old rule.

207
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,430
Come on. Three, two, one.

208
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,560
Can you understand?

209
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,300
When we love someone,

210
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,830
we don’t help him by avoiding him.

211
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,990
Instead, we should work together

212
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,510
to defend our future.

213
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,830
Love that can be easily abandoned

214
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,340
will not be cherished.

215
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,270
Ye,

216
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,190
if you can’t hold out,

217
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,770
cry out.

218
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,190
You can use my shoulder at any time.

219
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,990
Don’t try to be strong in front of me.

220
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,190
Don’t worry. I won’t cry.

221
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,580
I’ve made up my mind that

222
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,750
I won’t leave him!

223
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,750
I didn’t know how to love someone.

224
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,220
After I saw what Gu Yanluo did for me,

225
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,960
I suddenly understood.

226
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,100
My girl has grown up.

227
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,190
Love is where people grow up.

228
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,340
When a couple laugh and quarrel,

229
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,190
they will always care for each other.

230
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,070
Yeah.

231
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,340
Only when a couple grow up together

232
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,660
can they help each other.

233
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,830
Bingo.

234
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,780
Miss Ye, shouldn’t you draw the ending

235
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,690
for our featured series?

236
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,430
Don’t you think urging me to paint

237
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,450
is kind of casting a chill?

238
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,900
Anyway, such pep talk

239
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,270
doesn’t suit us.

240
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,190
We should enjoy our happy drink.

241
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,660
- Be happy!
- Cheers.

242
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Ye, it’s raining.

243
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,430
♫ It’s raining What do I do ♫

244
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,660
♫ I miss you so much ♫

245

249
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,600
♫ You bear it alone

250
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,390
♫ Your innocent smile
is replaced by tiredness ♫

251
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,550
It’s for you.

258
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,750
Isn’t it a nice place?

259
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,880
Let’s put them here.

260
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,410
For your information,

261
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,390
I’ve warned Mu Ze

262
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,140
to bring Gu Yanluo to you.

263
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,870
Thank you for helping me

264
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,670
by taking down the best friend
of my boyfriend.

265
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,700
You’re welcome.

266
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,460
But are you okay with this?

267
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,700
No problem.

268
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,150
I always set off firecrackers
every Spring Festival.

269
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,310
It’s a piece of cake.

270
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,580
I don’t mean this.

271
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,420
I mean in love,

272
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,130
men usually set off firecrackers for girls.

273
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,420
But now,

274
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,430
you’ll do it for your boyfriend.

275
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,030
Don’t you think

276
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,940
you’re reversing it?

277
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,060
In fact, we can use another identity

278
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,330
and get on with each other in a new way.

279
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,340
Don’t regard me as your boss.

280
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,390
Regard me as an ordinary man.

281
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,100
A young man is asking you.

282
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,220
Do you like me?

283
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,630
I’m sorry. I’m in a hurry.

284
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,700
I gotta go.

285
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,790
Ye Zhenhan.

286
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,870
I’m sorry, but I must go.

287
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,120
Are you missing him?

288
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,980
I owe him

289
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,220
the fireworks.

290
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,910
After the fireworks,

291
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,940
I’ll chase him.

292
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,660
It must be him.

293
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,420
Hello, Yanluo?

294
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,180
I’ve prepared you...

295
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,750
This is me, Mu Ze.

296
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,910
Little Luo...

297
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,150
He’s got some problem in his lessons.

298
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
He won’t go today.

299
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,100
He won’t?

300
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,670
Well,

301
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,410
he must have figured out

302
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,950
it’s me asking to see him.

303
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
Don’t lose heart.

304
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,180
Let’s try a second time.

305
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,540
As for today’s failure,

306
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,390
please put in a good word for me
in front of Yao,

307
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,940
or I can’t get away.

308
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,820
Okay.

309
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,860
Gu Yaoluo,

310
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,630
you’re a hero!

311
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,460
But I’m like a coward.

312
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,270
Now, the coward has grown up.

313
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,420
I want to be as brave as you.

314
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,100
Will you accept me?

315
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,870
So, he still didn’t come?

316
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,910
Yeah.

317
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,960
But it doesn’t matter.

318
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,030
I’m ready to try a long time.

319
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,270
After all, I tortured him first.

320
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,940
What’s your next plan?

321
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,340
I’m going to the library.

322
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,330
We had a lot of memories there.

323
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,270
I’m going to bring back old memories.

324
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,220
Good idea.

325
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,100
Come on!

326
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
I’m going to

327
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,020
punish my unreliable boyfriend.

328
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,750
Gotta go.

329
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,870
Don’t blame Mu Ze.

330
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,510
Mu Ze, don’t blame me for not defending you.

331
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,460
Your girlfriend is just too irascible.

332
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,320
Hope God will bless you.

333
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,670
Sure enough, I know him best.

334
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,200
But look at this.

335
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,910
Where’s he?

336
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,170
Yanluo?

337
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,630
He was here.

338
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,670
Where’s he now?

339
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,940
Weird. I just saw him.

340
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,630
Where is he gone?

341
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,550
Weird. Why is he gone?

342
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,790
I did put it here.

343
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,030
How miserable I am!

344
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,940
My girlfriend tortures me.

345
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,420
I must also disappear with you.

346
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,960
I think you’re risking your neck.

347
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,110
What if you annoy Ye Weimian

348
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,300
and she finds a new boyfriend?

349
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,670
A little impatience spoils a great plan.

350
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,060
Great plan?

351
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,750
Since we were heartbroken,

352
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,220
we should get it worth.

353
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,280
The headmaster told me that

354
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,700
a good relationship

355
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,510
will make the couple better.

356
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,700
So, I want us to know our real feelings

357
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,510
through this chance

358
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,510
so that we won’t easily break up

359
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,870
in case of any problem.

360
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,550
Gu Yaoluo,

361
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,790
you’re a hero!

362
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,980
But I’m like a coward.

363
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,510
Now, the coward has grown up.

364
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,260
I want to be as brave as you.

365
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,510
Will you accept me?

366
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,910
Awesome!

367
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,220
Really awesome!

368
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,100
I was too naive.

369
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,670
Be my master, then.

370
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,630
Awesome.

371
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,060
Gu Yanluo,

372
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,490
I thought you were so overbearing

373
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,630
that Xingxing would suffer losses.

374
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,750
I decide

375
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,390
if others suffer losses.

376
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,550
I never let her suffer.

377
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,940
But this time, you make me relieved.

378
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,990
It’s never your turn to worry about this.

379
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,940
Why do you still have a sharp tongue?

380
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,670
How annoying!

381
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,550
I’ll leave Xingxing to you.

382
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,460
I’ll protect her,

383
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,400
and won’t let you steal her.

384
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,020
Xingxing.

385
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,100
What do you want to tell me? So serious.

386
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,670
I’m leaving tomorrow.

387
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,220
I want to say goodbye to you.

388
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,300
So quick?

389
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,270
Well, the college you’ll go to is very famous.

390
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,150
I believe you’ll have a bright future,

391
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,100
Snotty!

392
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,030
I’m now a famous painter.

393
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,940
How dare you still call me Snotty!

394
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,100
So what?

395
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,860
I’ve been protecting you since we were little.

396
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,340
When will you come back?

397
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
After I graduate.

398
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,580
I’ll certainly come back after graduation,

399
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,340
even if

400
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Gu Yanluo doesn’t want to see me.

401
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,270
He has a bad temper and sharp tongue,

402
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,420
but he’s indeed a good boyfriend.

403
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,300
I know.

404
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,220
That’s why I must get back to him

405
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,150
and never leave him again!

406
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,300
Well, wish you always a happy life.

407
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,340
Zuo Sichen,

408
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,340
thank you.

409
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,220
Thank you for your blessing,

410
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,000
and thank you for your company
when I was little.

411
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,030
Thank you for adoring me

412
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,420
and thank you for what you’ve done for me.

413
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,180
I’ll accept your gratitude.

414
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,630
When is your flight tomorrow?

415
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,300
Shall I go to see you off?

416
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,580
No, thanks.

417
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,030
But I’ll wait for you
at the world-class art hall.

418
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,550
Okay, I’ll work hard!

419
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,100
Xingxing, let’s do it the last time.

420
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,750
Xingxing.

421
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,150
Zuo Sichen?

422
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,220
I came for you.

423
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,820
Just joking.

424
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,210
I come for classes.

426
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,990
Yanluo, I didn’t send the letter.

427
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,300
I know.

428
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,550
You know?

429
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,630
We already made many mistakes

430
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,790
It doesn’t matter

431
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,390
who reported us.

432
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,440
But I know you were too proud

433
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,550
to do that.

434
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,820
Thank you.

435
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,420
And I’m sorry for what I did.

436
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,340
What’s done is done.

437
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,670
After you graduate,

438
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,420
you’ll see a better world.

439
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,670
I may see a better world,

440
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,150
but I’ll never meet a man better than you.

441
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,930
Cousin, you broke up with Ye Weimian?

442
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,460
She just called me,

443
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,820
asking me to help her see your mother.

444
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,940
She said when you didn’t forgive her,

445
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,030
she would give the store back to your mother.

446
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,390
What happened to you?

[Drama Queen Ye]

448
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,060
Sorry,

449
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,960
the subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected.

450
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,790
Why didn’t she answer the phone?

[Retarded Him]

452
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,760
Hello, Little Luo?

453
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,670
Ask Lu Yao where Weimian is.

454
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,630
You went too far, didn’t you?

455
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,720
Cut the crap and ask her.

456
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,630
I don’t need to. I know where she is.

457
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,030
She’s going to where
you start your relationship

458
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,270
and say goodbye for the last time.

459
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,030
Come on, Weimian.

460
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,590
Here comes Gu Yanluo.

My feet!

462

We’ve been together for such a long time

463
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,990
when you have chances to confess.

464

[I’m sorry.]

465
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,600

00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,660
[You’re my beloved young man.]

467
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,750
I used to think

468
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,210
I wasn’t a lucky girl.

469
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,060
After I met you, I finally realized

470
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,510
I saved all my luck,

471
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,940
simply to meet you.

472
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,460
I was afraid to be your Achilles’ heel.

473
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,670
Because of timidity,

474
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,910
I had meant to escape.

475
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,990
But now I understand!

476
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,790
When we’re in love,

477
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,830
we not only have Achilles’ heel,

478
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,340
but also an armor.

479
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,070
Since we decide to be together,

480
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
we won’t easily let go of each other,

481

no matter what trouble we’re in!

482
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,630

♫ I’ll warmly light you up ♫

509
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,420
♫ Hold your hand ♫

510
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,380
Loves starts from having a crush.

511
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,380
But its process comes

512
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,790
with all kinds of tests.

513
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,360
Cupid proves that we’re destined to meet.

514
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,420
Yet we must learn how to stay together.

515
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,900
I’m Ye Weimian.

516
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,620
I’m Gu Yanluo.

517
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,420
This is the ending for our story.
What about yours?

518
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,190
♫ Open your heart ♫

519
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,370
♫ Give me your love ♫

520
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,840
♫ Our eyes are filled with love ♫

521
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,640
♫ I won’t keep you waiting anymore ♫

522
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,590
After Zhenhan leaves,

523
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,590
I don’t know when she’ll come back.

524
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,790
You took all the trouble

525
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,510
to make her have education abroad.

526
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,680
Don’t worry about her.

527
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,940
With Yan Jiuyue around her,

528
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,700
she must be living a happy life.

529
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,420
Yeah.

530
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,510
Your boyfriend looks unhappy.

531
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,060
Are you neglecting him lately

532
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,510
because you’re busy with the clothing store?

533
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,660
Don’t worry.

534
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,510
I can always make him happy!

535
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,420
Just go.

536
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,310
Cool man,

537
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,340
you don’t feel happy?

538
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,700
Smile.

539
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,350
Smile.

540
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,550
♫ When smiling, you look as nice ♫

541
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,620
♫ As flowers in spring ♫

542
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,510
How disgusting!

543
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,550
I wanna throw up.

544
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,320
I’ve learned from them.

545
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,860
What?

546
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,270
Today’s also the day that

547
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,220
your gorgeous face got me in love.

548
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,230
You’re disgusting, too.

549
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,790
I’m not as lucky as her.

550
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,900
♫ When smiling, you look as nice ♫

551
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,820
Get ready. One, two, three.

552
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,940
Make my heart smile!
