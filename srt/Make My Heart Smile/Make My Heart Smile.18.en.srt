1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,110
Make My Heart Smile

3
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,100
Episode 18
I went to your bed by sheer accident.

4
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,180
Won’t it be nice to have dinner together?

5
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,310
The more friends the merrier.

6
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,540
Who’s a friend of him?

7
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,100
Same here.

8
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,460
All right, both of you are rough.

9
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,590
Then we’ll not eat.
Let’s go back to our own home.

10
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,710
- No.
- Don’t, Xingxing.

11
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,710
What are we eating then?

12
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,380
I remember
when you did well in exams at school,

13
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,100
Grandma would cook seafood for you as a reward.

14
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,020
Let’s go and have seafood.

15
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,820
You even remember that?

16
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,790
I’ve reserved a table at a restaurant.

17
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,100
Your favorite crayfish.

18
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,730
Crayfish? Let’s go.

19
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,430
No.

20
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,790
No oily and spicy food late at night.

21
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,900
Xingxing has a weak stomach.

22
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,450
I’m really out of my mind.

23
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,950
Why do I ask for you guys’ advice?

24
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,310
I’ve made up my mind.

25
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,660
It is surprise that makes life beautiful.

26
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,230
The first restaurant when we turn left ahead.

27
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,590
We’ll eat whatever is offered there.

28
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,380
Go.

29
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,510
Let’s sit here.

30
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,350
I’m going to the bathroom.

31
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,350
Wait for me for a while.

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,380
This is my seat.

33
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,300
Strange and weird.

34
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,380
Hello, sir, welcome to our restaurant.

35
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,010
This is the menu of our restaurant.

36
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,990
Gu Yanluo, let’s make a bet.

37
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,620
Not interested.

38
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,620
You don’t dare?

39
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,230
All right, I’ll order for Xingxing.

40
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,350
After all, I know her better than you do.

41
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,820
What entitles you to say so,

42
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,380
as an outdated childhood friend?

43
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,350
I’m back.

44
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,540
- Xingxing.
- Come here.

45
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,420
Here. Come on.

46
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,180
Here’s your seat.

47
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,660
Here. Take a seat.

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,990
What are you guys doing?

49
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,190
The air conditioner is a bit cold here.

50
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,940
I’d better sit there.

51
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,340
I’ll sit here.

52
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,210
OK, that’s what you’ve got.

53
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,659
Here, order whatever you want to eat.

54
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,930
[Don’t be angry.]

55
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,940
What’s going on?

56
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,060
You guys didn’t order anything
after a long while.

57
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,470
There must be something wrong with your mind
if you are not keen on eating.

58
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,260
I’ll choose.

59
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,909
Stewed Duck in Beer,

60
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:51,820
Crabs in Hot and Spicy Sauce,

61
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
Rice in Veggie Soup.

62
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,490
You are drooling.

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,310
Fried Pork Slices with Chili.

64
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,150
Done!

65
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,060
Level of telepathic understanding, full mark.

66
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,540
What exactly are you guys doing?

67
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,940
Nothing. Reality makes one grow.

68
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,180
How boring! Take my order.

69
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,660
Gu Yanluo, bottoms up.

70
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,940
Here. Ah…

71
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,190
Bottoms up again.

72
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,630
Aren’t you guys drinking a bit too much?

73
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,310
Since we are having a celebration,

74
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,470
we should drink more

75
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,820
and have more fun.

76
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,980
Let’s have another glass.

77
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,430
- Here.
- Cheers.

78
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,380
Cheers.

79
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,590
Cheers.

80
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,470
Gu Yanluo,

81
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,220
have a drink, have a drink.

82
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,100
Seaweed, seaweed, seaweed, seaweed.

83
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,470
Swaying with the waves.

84
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,820
Seaweed, seaweed, seaweed, seaweed, seaweed.

85
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,540
Dancing in the spindrift.

86
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,990
Seaweed, seaweed, seaweed, seaweed.

87
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,940
I have my own leisurely fun!

88
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,940
There’s also such a funny side of him.

89
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,590
Let’s seaweed together.

90
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,060
Seaweed, seaweed, seaweed, seaweed…

91
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,380
Seaweed, seaweed, seaweed…

92
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,870
Seaweed, seaweed, seaweed…

93
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,530
Seaweed, seaweed, seaweed…

94
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,030
Where do you live, Zuo Sichen?

95
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,060
I live in your heart.

96
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,190
Or come to my arms.

97
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,380
Xingxing, Xingxing.

98
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,380
Prince Charming Gu,

99
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,220
he’s not safe this way. If he is sold…

100
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:06,940
Shall we…

101
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,940
No way.

102
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,340
Seaweed, seaweed, seaweed…

103
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,590
Dancing in the spindrift!

104
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,150
No more seaweed. Let’s go.

105
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,150
Xingxing, you have strong strength.

106
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,220
Watch your head!

107
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,340
Stay still.

108
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,470
Well,

109
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,220
Prince Charming, you have so many clothes.

110
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,990
Why don’t you lend him a set?

111
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,470
No.

112
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,530
Stingy.

113
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,540
Don’t be angry.

114
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,500
You should think if you lend him your clothes,

115
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,650
it is our sofa that will be saved.

116
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,780
It’s better for our sofa

117
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,470
if he stays in a hotel.

118
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,260
OK, I’m gonna get my clothes for him.

119
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,340
Stop.

120
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,310
Come back.

121
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,990
Please change his clothes for him,
Prince Charming.

122
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,429
Me? Why?

123
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,659
All right, all right, all right.

124
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,780
I can’t make you do it, Lord Gu.

125
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,659
I’ll do it for him.

126
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,340
Anyway, he and I

127
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,950
grew up together in split pants.

128
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,220
Bear the inconvenience.

129
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,660
I… I’m not looking.

130
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,020
I can’t see anything.

131
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,140
What are you doing?

132
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,990
Stay inside.

133
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,010
Thank you then.

134
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,570
Don’t play dead. Change into them yourself.

135
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,750
Thank goodness. He didn’t throw up.

136
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,700
So soft and comfy.

137
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,310
Zuo Sichen, what are you doing?

138
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,190
- So comfy.
- Wake up!

139
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Xingxing…

140
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,750
Xingxing…

141
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,190
Xingxing…

142
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,390
Xingxing…

143
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,210
Xingxing…

144
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,430
Xingxing…

145
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,900
Xingxing…

146
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Xingxing…

147
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,270
Go.

148
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,990
What are you doing?

149
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,700
Changing your clothes. What else can I do?

150
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,220
What are you doing?

151
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,580
What are you doing?

152
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,310
taking advantage of me.

153
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,700
You are taking advantage of 
me.

154
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,390
He’s so restless even in sleep.

155
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,900
Zuo Sichen!

156
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,700
Don’t make a noise. Let me sleep more.

157
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,310
Get the hell out of here!

158
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,270
You…

159
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,630
You are quite heavy-handed.

160
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,900
I got up bleary-eyed in the middle of the night
to go to the bathroom,

161
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,500
and I thought I was at home.

162
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,340
So I went to your bed by sheer accident.

163
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,270
Have you sobered up?

164
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,310
Get out of here quickly.

165
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,210
I can’t.

166
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,460
I must thank Xingxing before I go.

167
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,390
What’s more,

168
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,220
I must show her what you’ve done to me.

169
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,220
I’m sure Xingxing will feel sorry.

170
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,950
Stay away from her.

171
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,980
Is it because you are unsure of yourself

172
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,340
or have no confidence in Xingxing?

173
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,100
Don’t think highly of yourself.

174
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,010
You are actually encouraging me by doing so.

175
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,750
It shows you also think I’m a threat to you.

176
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,140
Right?

177
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,820
What are you doing?

178
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,960
Hey, hey,

179
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,190
Gu Yanluo, what are you doing?

180
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,950
I’m not like you who’s all talk and no deed.

181
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,190
Gu Yanluo!

182
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,680
Hey, hey!

183
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,950
Gu Yanluo!

184
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,660
I haven’t changed my clothes yet!

185
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,750
So noisy in the morning.

186
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,830
The door is locked?

187
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,900
Face-saving Gu, are you in?

188
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,310
My door is locked.

189
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,580
Face-saving Gu!

190
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,780
Is it you who locked it?

191
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,870
Why?

192
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,660
An outsider was here. Remember to lock
your door when you go to bed.

193
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,780
Aren’t you thinking too much?

194
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,510
I’m thinking too much?

195
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,310
Last night, he…

196
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,700
Did he do anything to you last night?

197
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,510
Where is he?

198
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,020
He’s gone.

199
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,190
Gone? So early.

200
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,990
He didn’t take his clothes

201
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,270
or wear yours.

202
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
How did he go?

203
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,190
In a bed sheet.

204
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,750
A bed sheet?

205
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,430
And pajamas.

206
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,190
Given his personality,

207
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,540
it’s impossible for him to leave like this.

208
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,900
You drove him away, didn’t you?

209
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,270
He provoked me first.

210
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,990
OK, I’ll go and give his clothes to him.

211
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,980
Don’t go.

212
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,060
Gu Yanluo, knock it off.

213
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,870
He’s more or less a public figure.

214
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
He can take a taxi.

215
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,310
He has no money.

216
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,270
He has a cellphone.

217
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,510
Gu Yanluo, can’t you knock it off?

218
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,310
He grew up with me

219
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,630
and takes me as his elder sister.

220
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,900
I only take him as a younger brother.

221
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,310
What’s more, didn’t we agree

222
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,540
to trust each other?

223
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,460
Students' Union
is about to have a new election.

224
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,580
Although Gu becomes single again,

225
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,900
a lot of people stop being his fans.

226
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,310
He’s not as popular as he used to be.

227
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,900
You even have the nerve to talk about others.

228
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,950
I’m wronged.

229
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,700
I’ve stopped being a fan of Hong Yu long ago,

230
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,020
but he also seems to be on the candidate list

231
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,390
with quite a high popularity.

232
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,310
Hold your ground then.

233
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,630
I’ll keep an eye on you.

234
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,510
Is there any big news?

235
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,100
With her outstanding talent,

236
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,820
Ye Weimian of Charlotte College

237
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,990
became the winner of the GS Fashion Design
Contest

238
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,630
and is hailed as Girl of Inspirations.

239
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,140
What did he say? Ye Weimian?

240
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,070
Yes.

241
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,700
Isn’t that Ye Zhenhan?

242
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,990
When did Ye Zhenhan

243
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,870
enter a fashion design contest?

244
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,140
And even became the winner?

245
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,750
Is it a stage name?

246
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,070
No.

247
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,870
I’ve never seen Ye Zhenhan

248
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,270
designing any clothes before.

249
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,070
We are finance majors.

250
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,310
Isn’t that too different?

251
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,090
There’s a Fashion Department
on the campus for arts.

252
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,540
I have a friend at art school.

253
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,390
Let me ask.

254
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,510
They are like two peas in a pod.

255
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,770
Could it be Ye Zhenhan is doing a side job?

256
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,830
No.

257
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,780
Look, the one in the video is indeed
Ye Weimian.

258
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,220
My friend says there is indeed someone

259
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,900
called Ye Weimian in their fashion department.

260
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,100
She’s also won a major prize in an extramural
contest

261
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,770
and the teacher keeps praising her these days.

262
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,630
Ye Zhenhan?

263
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,310
Ye Weimian?

264
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,339
Could they be…

265
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,700
- Twins?
- Twins?

266
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,579
Yao!

267
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,339
Yao, come over here.

268
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,339
What are you doing?

269
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,910
Yao, I’m here to make amends.

270
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,060
Look.

271
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,990
It’s OK if you don’t look.

272
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,910
I’ve brought it to you myself.

273
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,270
Psycho.

274
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,300
Yao, Yao.

275
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,510
Yao,

276
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,790
you are talking to me at last.

277
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,990
You know, my world gets dark

278
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,570
during the days you are blacklisting me.

279
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,030
Yao, I’ll see what I can do about your
motorbike.

280
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,910
Look, I’ve specially bought a new one for you.

281
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,300
Although it’s somewhat not good enough
for you,

282
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,180
it is still a symbol of my apology.

283
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,750
Why do you need a repair shop if apology
works?

284
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,860
I’m sorry.

285
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,390
I just wanted to spend more time with you.

286
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,030
I didn’t expect there’d be such serious
damage.

287
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,060
Mu Ze,

288
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,990
you keep talking about what you want for
everything.

289
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,750
Do I have to play this love game with you

290
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,980
just to satisfy your desire of courtship?

291
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,220
No, it’s not a game.

292
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,100
Say no more.

293
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,790
I don’t want to hear your sweet talk

294
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,140
and your philanderer’s set plays.

295
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,300
Stay away from me.

296
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,700
Yao…

297
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,700
Don’t follow me!

298
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,580
You are right.

299
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,030
Too many set plays

300
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,910
can really trap myself.

301
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,460
I’m a real-life version of stewing in my own
juice.

302
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,220
At first,

303
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,460
I just thought it was an interesting challenge.

304
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,820
What about now?

305
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,670
Now?

306
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,220
Now I think I’m a downright nasty jerk.

307
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,300
An out-and-out nasty jerk.

308
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,820
If I were her,

309
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,550
I would cold-shoulder myself as well.

310
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,270
It’s not too late to come to your senses now.

311
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,790
Is it?

312
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,220
Women

313
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,510
women are really unfathomable abysses.

314
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,940
Didn’t we agree to trust each other?

315
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,670
Melancholy is not something for you.

316
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,580
Go home early.

317
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,550
Don’t drink too much.

318
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,940
I’m rarely disappointed in love.
Don’t be such a wet blanket.

319
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,820
Is it really not too late?

320
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,990
It’s getting late.

321
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,030
Why hasn’t he come back yet?

322
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,630
Sorry to keep you waiting. Sorry.

323
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,220
Cute Bean, ask your queen to come out for
dinner.

324
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,750
Your Royal Highness, it’s time for dinner.

326
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,750
Tell His Majesty
that his concern is unsolicited.

327
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,630
Your Majesty, your concern of the queen is
unsolicited.

328
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,020
Tell that drama queen

329
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,580
to come out quickly, stop putting on a show.

330
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,580
Tell that drama queen

331
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,940
to stop putting on a show, come out quickly.

332
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,820
Tell that naughty dude

333
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,150
to shut up.

334
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,790
Your Majesty,

335
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,420
tell that naughty dude to shut up.

336
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,340
You shut up.

337
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,820
Your Royal Highness, shut up.

338
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,990
You… You shut up!

339
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,750
Sorry,

340
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,790
your little cutie is low on battery and
is ready to shut up.

341
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,100
Time for dinner.

342
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,870
I’ve told you for the umpteenth time

343
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,300
that I can’t sell it to you.

344
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,270
Do you know why I put it there as an ornament?

345
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,790
Because it’s broken.

346
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,270
Do you know? It’s broken.

347
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,670
Broken?

348
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,820
Yes, that’s why I won’t sell it to you.

349
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,270
Do you think I don’t want to make money?

350
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,940
I’ll take it even if it’s broken.

351
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,990
You want it even if it’s broken.

352
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,340
What do you buy a broken thing for?

353
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,630
I find you are such a stubborn brat.

354
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,670
You can’t use it, you know?

355
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,670
Do you remember the girl last time?

356
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,670
Which girl?

357
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,940
The one you saw last time.

358
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,100
The girl who came with you last time

359
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,180
and whose motorbike you had broken?

360
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,220
What happened?

361
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,630
She broke up with me because of it.

362
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,460
Broke up with you.

363
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,870
I think break-up is a light punishment,

364
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,510
you know?

365
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,940
I’d slash at you if I were her.

366
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,940
you know?

367
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,570
Bro, I’ve ended up like this,

368
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,750
and you still laugh at me?

369
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,700
I’m really very much in love with her.

370
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,550
I don’t ask her to forgive me,

371
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,870
but I want to do my best to make it up to her.

372
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,940
We are both men. You know what I’m saying?

373
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,660
Yes.

374
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,670
All right, I give in.

375
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,820
I’ll sell it to you.

376
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,100
But my engine

377
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,100
is not worthless.

378
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,030
You should still pay, you know?

379
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,340
Yes, yes, yes.

380
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,990
If by selling this to you

381
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,940
I can help you guys patch things up,

382
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,550
I’ll be doing a good thing.

383
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,140
Thank you, handsome uncle.

384
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,870
All right, all right.

385
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,510
I’ll ask someone to collect the money later.

386
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,870
I have a buddy nearby

387
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,220
who’s running a repair shop.

388
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,870
He’s the most experienced of us here.

389
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,940
I think you can try your luck with him.

390
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,300
Maybe you can get it fixed.

391
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,580
Go for it.

392
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,580
Thank you.

393
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,940
You’ll do great.

394
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,990
Weimian, I’ll be there in a while.

395
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,700
The coffee there is quite good.

396
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,300
Can you order a cup for me first?

397
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,750
This little greedy foodie…

398
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,790
I’m sorry.

399
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,550
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

400
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,220
You…

401
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,060
Why is it you?

402
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,180
What brings you here?

403
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,990
Yan Jiuyue asked me to come.

404
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,630
Zhenhan asked me to come.

405
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,580
Are they ganging up to trick us?

406
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,220
Why are you following me?

407
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,060
I can’t let their kindness go to waste.

408
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,550
Sir, you’ve come again.

409
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,030
This time you’ve brought your girlfriend.

410
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,670
We are offering 30% off for all products
in store now.

411
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,990
Would you guys like to pick some other styles?

412
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,460
What did you say?

413
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,100
The bracelet you are wearing

414
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,670
was made by this gentleman

415
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,700
in our shop.

416
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,820
He spent the whole afternoon making it.

417
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,220
This gentleman is so handsome that

418
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,030
we were guessing secretly back then

419
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,300
the girl receiving this bracelet

420
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,060
must be an absolute stunner.

421
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,990
I thought it was made to order.

422
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,390
Turns out you made it by yourself.

423
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,670
Not today, thanks.

424
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,180
Are you thirsty?

425
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,450
Want anything to drink? I’ll go get it.

426
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,670
I’ll drink whatever you pick.

427
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,420
It was from Zuo Sichen.

428
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,260
[Snotty]

429
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,100
He wanted to say sorry for what happened
when he was drunk last time,

430
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,100
also say thanks.

431
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,670
Here you are.

432
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,750
Thanks.

433
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,700
He likes to play cool
and diss people sometimes.

434
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,340
But don’t fuss about it with him.

435
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,030
That’s just his camouflage.

436
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,220
When he was a child, his parents were busy
with working,

437
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,630
so they left him in the village.

438
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,340
My grandma felt sorry for him

439
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,090
and let him come to our house to play.

440
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,460
Actually I see how he felt very well.

441
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,050
With little care from his parents,

442
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,060
he lacked a sense of security with a desire
to be loved.

443
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,460
He was unsociable and timid
when he was a child,

444
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,510
so I often took him to play around.

445
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,180
Maybe that’s why

446
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,460
he places a kind of

447
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,990
special trust and reliance on me.

448
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,300
I’m really happy that

449
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,180
he can become what he is today.

450
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,670
Can you understand?

451
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,870
To understand is different from to accept.

452
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,630
It’s good that you understand.

453
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,980
My Prince Charming Gu

454
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,550
is the most broad-minded and considerate.

455
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,750
Then… I’ll go and see him.

456
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,180
Wait for me at home.

457
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,390
I’ll take your silence as a yes.

458
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:09,980
Sir.

459
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,030
- Well…
- Replace the parts for him first.

460
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Can it be fixed?

461
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,270
You’d better replace it with a new engine.

462
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,750
The type of engine you have

463
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,940
has long been out of production.

464
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,510
The parts don’t match.

465
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,700
I can’t fix it.

466
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,510
Do you think the parts can be made by hand?

467
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,750
I don’t have the leisure to.

468
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,100
Please find someone else who’s better at it.

469
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,670
As long as it can be fixed.

470
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,670
You don’t have to do it yourself.

471
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,220
Do you hire apprentices here? For free.

472
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,390
Do you mean you are gonna make the parts
by hand?

473
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,000
Uh.

474
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,940
It’s not that I look down on you, young man.

475
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,090
Your tender skin shows

476
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,910
you are a pampered dandy at the first glance.

477
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,940
The job here is both dirty and tiring.

478
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,030
You won’t be able to stand it.

479
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,460
Go quickly. Don’t waste my time.

480
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,180
This is an album of top foreign designs
I collected.

481
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,990
It has a lot of ideas worthy of reference.

482
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,420
It’s a gift of apology to you.

483
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,100
I got drunk that day and brought you trouble.

484
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,270
Don’t mention it.

485
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,100
Besides, it is Gu Yanluo who took care of you
that day.

486
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,150
I should apologize to you instead.

487
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,270
That dude hadn’t taken care of others before.

488
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,940
If there’s anything he didn’t do well,

489
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,510
don’t take it to heart.

490
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,060
By the way, don’t always diss him
intentionally.

491
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,630
He’s my boyfriend after all.

492
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,630
What are you doing?

493
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,790
Weimian!

494
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,510
Why are you here?

495
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,510
Are you done talking? Let’s go if you are.

496
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,790
We are not done yet.

497
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,910
Please wait a moment, Gu.

498
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,580
Can’t you guys knock it off?

499
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,180
As a flower on a high ridge,

500
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,100
why do you always jump off the altar and
make a fuss with him?

501
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,460
Good point, Xingxing.

502
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
And you.

503
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,940
You always have a sharp tongue

504
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,420
and can’t bear to see someone who’s better
than you.

505
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,150
Can’t you be nicer

506
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,550
to your friend’s boyfriend?

507
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,670
You are right.

508
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,860
All right, go on.

509
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,940
Just don’t make me the referee.

510
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,580
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

511
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,580
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

512
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,050
Bravo!

513
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,750
- Stop.
- Bravo!

514
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,390
Now I declare Finance Department the winner.

515
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,300
Great!

516
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,870
Students on duty stay here to do the cleaning.

517
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,750
Don’t forget to go back

518
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,630
to practice the movements you’ve learnt today.

519
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,100
Did you see that?

520
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,870
Gu was doing a good job just now.

521
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,030
He’s been so outstanding all the time.

522
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,460
How handsome Gu is!

523
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,340
There’s no sport he’s not good at.

524
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,340
Be quick to go over to give your warmth.

525
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,030
There’s some misunderstanding between us.

526
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,290
It’s not convenient for me to do so.

527
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,750
As you said, it’s a misunderstanding.

528
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,340
Why don’t you take this opportunity
to clarify it?

529
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,870
You guys are my Charlotte couple.

530
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,150
You must try hard.

531
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,580
Gu Yanluo,

532
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,630
I didn’t stand firm for the last move.

533
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,750
Dare you have another one-on-one in the
next class?

534
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,030
Didn’t you lose badly enough?

535
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,100
Just say whether you dare or not.

536
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,670
The loser will clean the fencing hall

537
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,820
and wipe everybody’s swords.

538
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,390
Why do I have to take your bet?

539
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,990
I just can’t bear to see your haughty,

540
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,150
self-righteous look

541
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,870
as if you are the best in the world.

542
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,340
Hong Yu, what are you talking about?

543
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,180
Indeed.

544
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,670
Don’t think you are really charming

545
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,550
by being the hunk of the
Mechanical Engineering Department.

546
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,030
It’s not your turn to take care of

547
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,390
what’s happening
at the Mechanical Engineering Department.

548
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,870
Why?
You think you’re because of your popularity?

549
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,700
Didn’t you get dumped in a relationship
as well?

550
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,270
But then again,

551
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,990
we have more or less

552
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,630
the same number of votes for the
Student’s Union election.

553
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,510
It remains to be seen who will win.

554
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,620
OK, I’ll take you up on it.

555
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,550
OK.

556
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,790
It’s a deal.

557
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,060
Gu Yanluo!

558
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,580
I’ll never lose to you again

559
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,270
in both the contest
and the election this time!

560
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,820
Are you ready?

561
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,100
I’m all set.

562
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,700
Choose one of the three cards,

563
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,550
and it will be your love card.

564
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,150
What does this mean? Have a look for me.

565
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,180
I’ve been having bad luck these days.

566
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,990
Something bad happens every time
I chase after Yao.

567
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,780
As I see it,

568
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,270
you’d better take care of this very moment
first.

569
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,090
Why?

570
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,150
This card says

571
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,510
the next person coming in

572
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,550
will be your good match.

573
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,150
Sorceress Ye, that’s spot-on.

574
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,510
Of course.

575
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,910
Hi.

576
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,180
You guys are here too.

577
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,390
Let’s order something to eat.

578
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,150
How can I buy into your story?

579
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,340
Those who break up my sister and her date
will be punished.
