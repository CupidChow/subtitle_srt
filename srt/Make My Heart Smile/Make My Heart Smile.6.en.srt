Unexpected first kiss

4
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,820
Hello, Zhenhan?

5
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,590
I’m almost at the crossing. What about you?

6
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,250
Weimian, I’ll be right there.

7
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,230
My teacher just called me.

8
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,740
There’s an exchange student opportunity

9
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,070
at an Ivy League school.

10
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,390
It’s free of charge.

11
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,590
This is what I’ve been dreaming of.

12
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,260
I want to apply for it.

13
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,150
You’re indeed my clever sister!

14
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,950
In fact,

15
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,150
if it weren’t for the full scholarship,

16
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,100
you could have gone to a better college.

17
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,180
Here comes your chance.

18
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,460
You must seize it!

19
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,510
My clever sister will be ever triumphant!

20
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,990
I also feel happy

21
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,810
to study in the same college with you.

22
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,740
But you’re working so hard.

23
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,020
You study and make money to raise me.

24
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,820
We’re sisters.

25
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,950
Don’t mention it.

26
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,150
When you succeed,

27
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,150
I’ll feel proud, too.

28
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,580
After I graduate, I’ll make money

29
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,510
and help you realize your designer dream.

30
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,220
Hello?

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,250
What happened? What happened?

32
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,180
Zhenhan!

33
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,380
That day, Zhenhan came to me happily,

34
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,460
trying to tell me some good news.

35
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,180
But she was hit by a car.

36
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,950
After emergency treatment,

37
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,460
she was out of danger.

38
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,750
But the doctor said
her head was badly wounded.

39
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,750
It would take a long time

40
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,020
before she wakes up.

41
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,210
Here it is.

42
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,310
Later,

43
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,260
a message was sent to her phone,

44
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,600
asking her to fill in the application form.

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,890
[Application Form for Charlotte’s
Exchange Student Project]

46
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,909
Full attendance is needed
for an exchange student?

47
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,040
She can’t be absent?

48
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,909
Yeah.

49
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,710
Next year’s exchange student
for the Ivy League school

50
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,370
will have a full scholarship.

51
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,600
Many students have applied for that.

52
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,710
This was her last wish
before she fell into a coma.

53
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,880
It’s also her future and dream.

54
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,630
I must protect it

55
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,840
until she wakes up.

56
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,600
I’ve made up my mind!

57
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,280
I’ll take classes at the Finance Department.

58
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,190
Ye,

59
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,990
this isn’t for fun.

60
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,030
You must think carefully about it.

61
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,090
This is the only way

62
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,940
can she strive for the quota.

63
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,410
Zhenhan works so hard.

64
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
She will succeed.

65
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,060
I must protect this chance for her

66
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,440
until she wakes up.

67
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,930
Zhenhan,

68
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,750
I imagined many times
how I would hold your hands.

69
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,340
This is the last way I thought of.

70
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,590
I was too stupid

71
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,630
and dull.

72
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,870
I took your company

73
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,630
for granted.

74
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,909
Sorry, Zhenhan.

75
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,460
I’ll come and keep you company,

76
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,380
all right?

77
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,150
You always come to me.

78
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,140
Are you having too much time?

79
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,350
No more running away?

80
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,940
Are you moved by me,

81
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,830
and going to agree to be my date?

82
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,340
I’m going

83
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,660
to be generous

84
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,390
and take you to hospital!

85
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,310
Be generous?

86
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Sounds adorable.

87
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,750
I’m loving it.

88
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,630
Hello?

89
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,190
Come to me right away.

90
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,310
But I’m in the middle of something.

91
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,190
Hello?

92
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,870
What does he want?

93
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,940
My lady.

94
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,940
It’s windy today.

95
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,880
If it blows me to someone else,

96
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,230
I’m afraid you won’t get me back.

97
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,060
Brother, it’s windy today.

98
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,150
Remember to close your mouth,

99
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,070
in case you lose your tongue.

100
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,880
Thank you, My lady.

101
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,780
Zhenhan, after you wake up,

102
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,440
let’s go to the library
and study together, huh?

103
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,540
Hello.

104
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,210
Are you her family?

105
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,260
Yes.

106
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,060
Not yet.

107
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,750
Her family just walked out.

108
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,780
Fine.

109
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,750
The doctor asked me to see you.

110
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,260
There’s some good news for you.

111
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,660
What is it?

112
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,020
My sister is getting better?

113
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,340
No. But almost.

114
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,830
There’s a new kind of medicine

115
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,750
that will help a lot with your sister’s condition.

116
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,980
Would you like to try it?

117
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,830
Really?

118
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,470
Yes, yes, we’ll try that!

119
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,309
It has great results,

120
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,920
but there’s also a rare ingredient in it.

121
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,540
The price is high.

122
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,950
About three times as expensive
as the existing medicine.

123
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,190
Three times?

124
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,340
I know something about your family situation.

125
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,630
You can think about it.

126
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,870
If you decide to use it,

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,730
ask Dr. Liu for the prescription.

128
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,220
Thank you.

129
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,700
Three times?

130
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,630
My dear Lu Yao.

131
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,100
She looks gorgeous, huh?

132
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,030
And she has fair skin.

133
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,160
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

134
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,580
Dude.

135
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,020
Her phone is powered off.

136
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,350
But you keep calling...

137
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,700
What’s the point?

138
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,960
What if she turns it on?

139
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,820
You left her a message.

140
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,830
When she turns it on, she’ll call you back.

141
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,890
She sounded anxious when she called.

142
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,650
I’m worried she’s in trouble.

143
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,580
A mere phone call made you so nervous?

144
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,900
♫ If it is not love ♫

145
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,580
She’s coming out.

146
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,020
Wait. Wait. Wait.

147
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,870
Isn’t that the guy the one

148
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,540
who had a meal with Ye Zhenhan?

149
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,950
Your contract girlfriend is dating another man

150
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,430
and they’re caught in the act.

151
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,870
I love this.

152
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,630
Little Luo,

153
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,870
can you fight him alone?

154
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,780
Shall I go ask what happened?

155
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,660
Don’t go.

156
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,950
What?

157
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,080
Don’t make trouble.

158
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,070
What do we do?

159
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,780
Don’t worry.

160
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,630
Zhenhan will get better.

161
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,140
Jiuyue, I’m sorry.

162
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,020
I’ve cheated you for a long time.

163
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
It doesn’t matter.

164
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,780
I know you did that for Zhenhan.

165
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,750
She’s lucky

166
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,070
to have a sister like you.

167
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,390
It’s also her luck

168
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,590
to meet a boy like you.

169
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,390
But now...

170
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,090
I’ll get my pay soon.

171
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,540
Let’s work together for her medical expenses

172
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,700
and take care of her.

173
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,220
Yan Jiuyue, thank you.

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,550
What can you argue?

346
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,940
That was a misunderstanding.

347
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,300
It was an accident.

348
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,700
Bah!

349
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,730
Why can’t I have such an accident?

350
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,750
You seduced Mr. Gu on purpose!

351
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,340
You get me wrong!

352
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,570
You instruct me every day.

353
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,510
How dare I seduce him!

354
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,420
His kiss was exactly an accident.

355
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,010
That ugly girl’s boyfriend is someone else.

356
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,510
I knew it.

357
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,920
How could Mr. Gu like someone like you?

358
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,470
[His kiss was an accident.]

359
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,790
Why do I

360
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,940
have a boyfriend within one day?

361
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,920
[That ugly girl’s boyfriend is someone else.]

362
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,580
What a drama!

363
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,940
I’ll go see a cool man and calm down.

364
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,580
You!

365
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,330
Have steady hands.

366
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,160
Aim at the basketball hoop

367
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,800
and let your arms hang naturally.

368
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,580
Let me try.

369
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,940
I know.

370
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,700
The coordinate of my hands is X0Y0,

371
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,580
while that of the basketball hoop is X1Y1.

372
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,150
I can figure out
the coordinate of parabola top

373
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,010
according to the speed and angle.

374
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,590
The windage is a big problem.

375
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,150
Yan Jiuyue, good for you!

376
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,820
A straight-A student needs sports, too.

377
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,290
You’re wrong. You’re wrong.

378
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,420
You’re too nervous.

379
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,140
Bend your knees when you shoot.

380
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,420
Raise your heels

381
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,570
and shoot immediately.

382
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,670
Fine, I’ll have a second try.

383
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,390
Do it again.

384
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,320
I’ve got his information for you.

385
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,390
Yan Jiuyue is

386
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,790
a standard student

387
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,750
from Mechanical Engineering Department.

388
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,780
He has good marks and a good character.

389
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,870
He’s also honest.

390
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,460
He’s popular among students and teachers.

391
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,220
As for he and Ye Zhenhan...

392
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,650
Let me check it.

393
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,990
[Gu Yanluo: Where are you?]

394
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,950
Where are you?

395
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,080
[Ye Weimian: At the basketball court.]

396
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,200
He knew Ye Zhenhan long ago.

397
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,180
They often stayed with each other.

398
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,460
Looks like you’re the other man.

399
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,300
Shut up!

400
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,670
Yanluo.

401
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,910
Yanluo, what happened in the ecological park

402
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,390
may bring trouble to you.

403
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,700
Do you need me to ask someone

404
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,790
to handle that?

405
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,910
No, thanks.

406
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,940
I’m going to the basketball court.

407
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,550
Go ahead.

408
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,270
You keep trying after repeated failures.

409
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,390
Just like me.

410
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,060
Hello, Meimei.

411
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,460
I asked Yanluo for confirmation.

412
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,450
What happened today was an accident.

413
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,870
The clarification...

414
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,550
Girls do have a good idea

415
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,900
to chase men.

416
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,150
It’s a drama

417
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,510
where she cheers for him
while he’s doing sports.

418
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,910
Come on! Come on! Come on!

419
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,270
No,

420
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,020
it’s a drama where a demure man shows off

421
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,700
and fights for a girl!

422
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,910
Let’s play.

423
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,270
I... I don’t play it well.

424
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,270
Isn’t that Mr. Gu?

425
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,420
He’s going to play basketball?

426
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,880
Boyfriend versus rumored boyfriend.

427
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,900
- So cool!
- What’s the matter with Ye Zhenhan?

428
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,860
Go tell others.

429
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,910
Yes. Yes.

430
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,570
She’s attracting boys again.

431
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,160
One-to-one battle or a group one?

432
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,360
You have the final say.

433
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,420
Isn’t this our popular chairman

434
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,820
of the Students’ Union?

435
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,100
Jiuyue, compete with him.

436
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,390
I support you.

437
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,260
Are you out of your mind?

438
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,140
According to our performances

439
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,220
and my poor ability,

440
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,550
we stand no chance to win.

441
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,150
It doesn’t matter.

442
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,820
Forget it.

443
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,630
What... What brings you here?

444
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,340
Will you do it or not?

445
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,300
Jiuyue, do it!

446
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,180
Do it! Do it!

447
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,060
We aren’t scared of him!

448
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,550
Stop fighting! Stop!

449
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,100
Nothing happened. Why do you fight?

450
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,220
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

451
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,940
All right. Whatever you want!

452
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,580
Hope you’ll enjoy it.

453
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,400
Will you play with me alone

454
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,060
or with your friends?

455
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,510
You think he’s alone, huh?

456
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,030
Come on.

457
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,820
Come on! Come on! Come on!

458
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,510
Come on!

459
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,340
Come on! Come on!

460
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,580
Come on!

461
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,210
Pass the ball! Hurry! Pass it!

462
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,910
Come on! Come on! Come on!

463
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,180
Come on!

464
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,580
Come on! Come on!

465
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,940
Come on! Come on!

466
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,300
Good shot!

467
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,750
Good shot! Bravo!

468
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,670
Another goal!

469
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,340
Come on! Come on!

470
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,060
Bravo!

471
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,460
Come on, Yan Jiuyue!

472
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,670
Jiuyue, you can do it!

473
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,740
Come on! Come on! Come on!

474
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,670
Come on! Come on! Come on!

475
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,460
Come on! Come on! Come on!

476
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,870
Come on, Yan Jiuyue!

477
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,670
Come on, Yan Jiuyue!

478
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,510
You, come with me.

479
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,250
Come on!

480
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,950
Come on!

481
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,350
Come on!

482
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,770
Come on! Come on!

483
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,550
Here!

484
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,020
Brilliant!

485
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,800
Awesome!

486
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,930
Your basketball coach is just so-so.

487
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,750
Shall I teach you to shoot?

488
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,750
Boy,

489
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,700
your English is so-so, too.

490
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,900
Shall I teach you?

491
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,280
Don’t change the subject.

492
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,180
Hope you won’t lose badly.

493
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,520
Ye Zhenhan, tell me.

494
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,750
Are you cheating on my cousin?

495
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,630
I...

496
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,460
What do you mean?

497
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,790
Ye Zhenhan,

498
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,300
what do you think my cousin is?

499
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,510
A back-up boyfriend

500
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,060
that you can use as you wish?

501
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,270
He’s a school hunk.

502
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,510
For you, he depreciated himself

503
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,920
and challenged that

504
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,510
ordinary man!

505
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,990
But you’re still denying it?

506
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,750
What ordinary man?

507
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,180
Ye Zhenhan,

508
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,390
I thought you were kind

509
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,940
and straightforward.

510
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,300
I even drank with you.

511
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,280
I never expected you to be so disloyal!

512
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,030
Anyway,

513
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,560
if you don’t explain to me,

514
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,950
I won’t let you leave!

515
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,990
Siwan, it’s not what you think it is.

516
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,990
Your cousin and I...

517
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,900
Good shot!

518
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,730
Here’s some water.

519
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,270
You did a very good shot.

520
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
That was awesome.

521
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,270
Yanluo.

522
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,280
Thanks, but I’ve got mine.

523
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,150
It’s mine.

524
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,300
Isn’t it bad

525
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,610
when people are watching?

526
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,090
Cousin, come with me.

527
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,030
What for?

528
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,820
Come with me! Hurry!

529
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,030
Thanks.

530
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,060
What?

531
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,150
Cousin, you’re a big liar!

532
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,220
What do you mean?

533
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,460
You lied to your mother and me.

534
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,610
What goes between you and Ye Zhenhan is fake.

535
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,150
Who told you?

536
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,150
She did, of course.

537
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,030
She told me everything.

538
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,220
She said you and her had a contract.

539
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,220
What did you do today?

540
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,340
Challenged your rival in love

541
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,550
and became jealous?

542
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,910
Why did you do that?

543
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,120
Was that necessary?

544
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,580
At last,

545
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,250
you have unrequited love,

546
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,030
like I do.

547
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,340
Go away.

548
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,070
Don’t tell my mother.

549
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,700
Everything is fake? Fake boyfriend?

550
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,790
I’ll quit.

551
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,340
Why?

552
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,270
Why can you start it and quit it

553
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,510
simply as you wish?

554
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,060
You’re afraid to lose the second half, huh?

555
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,030
Yeah.

556
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,390
Afraid to lose the game?

557
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,680
Even if you have more time,

558
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,880
you can’t defeat me.

559
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,070
So cool!

560
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,120
So cool! So cool!

561
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,460
Sociolinguistics?

562
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,150
Are you alright?

563
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,830
What brings you here?

564
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,150
The game is over?

565
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,300
You,

566
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,510
come with me!

567
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:55,770
[Debtor]

568
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,670
Demure, arrogant, and unsympathetic?

569
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,460
Want me to forgive you? Not that easy.

570
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,090
If you ring a bit longer,

571
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,170
I might possibly answer it.

572
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,270
She’s showing no sincerity at all!

573
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,270
The coolest and the best Mr. Gu in the world,

574
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,270
thank you for helping me out today.

575
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,750
I’m so grateful to you.

576
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,790
Little fraud.
