00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,990
Sir, may I have a try?

174
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,680
Why doesn’t she answer the phone?

175
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,990
I’m finished.

176
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,390
I’ve thought about it for a long time,

177
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,510
and I felt something was missing.

178
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
So,

179
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,700
the flower is what is missing.

180
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,100
I never expected you to paint so well.

181
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,340
Looks wonderful!

182
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,190
Could you make a painting for me?

183
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,460
Gu Yanluo,

184
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,340
when did you come?

185
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,700
Just now.

186
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,220
I didn’t know you were artistic.

187
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,340
Life is hard, and I need more skills.

188
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,630
Don’t you know I’m a talented girl?

189
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,290
Stop being narcissistic.

190
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,750
I’ll go pick up Auntie.

191
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,990
Let’s meet in the restaurant.

192
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,700
Okay.

193
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,380
You’re born to be conflicting.

194
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,020
Get on well with each other.

195
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,270
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

196
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,420
I didn’t mean that.

197
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,880
Let me clean it.

198
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,010
You really like

199
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,070
to ruin my shirts.

200
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,070
Because your mother asked to see me.

201
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,630
It makes me so nervous.

202
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Don’t move.

203
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,220
Wait a second. It’ll be finished soon.

204
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,020
It’s done.

205
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,540
Does it look better?

206
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,350
It’s a little heart.

207
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,970
You always wear white shirts.

208
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,730
It looks good with some color.

209
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
You’ve got ideas.

210
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,530
Your mother is waiting for us.

211
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,960
Don’t keep her waiting.

212
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,870
Let’s go.

213
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,390
His handsome face touches me so much.

214
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,660
You must calm down before him.

215
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,140
Auntie, look.

216
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,130
My cousin has good taste.

217
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,430
His girlfriend is beautiful and talented.

218
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,630
She’s also so lovely.

219
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,580
Sure.

220
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,020
Look at Zhenhan.

221
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,340
She’s not only beautiful,

222
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,700
but also has a good character.

223
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,340
I grow to love her more.

224
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,720
Ask Yanluo to bring you home

225
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,880
and I’ll make you something to eat.

226
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,340
Thank you, Mrs. Gu.

227
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,260
You’re welcome.

228
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,020
You’ll be part of our family, sooner or later.

229
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,010
Don’t be shy.

230
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,830
Yeah, yeah.

231
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,530
Mrs. Gu,

232
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,120
Yanluo and I talked about that.

233
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,380
At this time,

234
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,290
we want to focus on our education,

235
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
and aren’t hurry to settle down now.

236
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,830
Right, Yanluo?

237
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,900
Yes.

238
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,750
Silly boy, why are you eating alone?

239
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,190
Share some food with her!

240
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,540
You know what?

241
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,890
You must be nice to Zhenhan.

242
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,870
If you don’t,

243
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,310
I won’t let you go!

244
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,030
Don’t think you can be bold with me,

245
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,340
simply because my mother supports you.

246
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,390
Try messing with me again,

247
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,340
See if I’ll tell Mrs. Gu about it.

248
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,070
Have more of it to make you smarter.

249
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,310
In a relationship,

250
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,990
a couple should be sweet

251
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,510
like them, right?

252
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,390
Precisely.

253
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,020
This is right.

254
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,670
Well,

255
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,210
why don’t you get engaged now?

256
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,339
Sorry, sorry.

257
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,940
Mom, Zhenhan and I

258
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,740
will discuss about that.

259
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,220
Right?

260
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,820
It doesn’t matter. Enjoy the food.

261
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,390
Then we can negotiate.

262
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,580
Enjoy it.

263
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,820
[Girls’ Dormitory]

264
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,200
What was the matter with me today?

265
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,660
I knew I was pretending to be his girlfriend.

266
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,390
But why was I so shy?

267
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,790
Shame on me.

268
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,790
Zhenhan!

269
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,580
Trouble is really everywhere.

270
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,630
Jiuyue?

271
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,550
I received your message.

272
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,420
I come,

273
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,100
to work together with you.

274
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,300
Jiuyue,

275
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,790
I think there’s some misunderstanding.

276
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,930
What?

277
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,990
Didn’t you accept my gift

278
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,150
and weren’t you going to

279
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,390
fight for a bright future with me?

280
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,390
Yes. But I don’t mean

281
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,700
what you mean.

282
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,340
What do you mean, then?

283
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,740
You don’t like that gift?

284
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,820
It doesn’t look good,

285
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,390
but I made it myself.

286
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,420
No.

287
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,630
Did I do anything wrong?

288
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,670
No.

289
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,220
You’re different from what I imagined.

290
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,350
But you’re a good man. I’m serious.

291
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,350
We’ve been together for so long.

292
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,390
I was used to having you around,

293
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,460
but you’re standing off me lately.

294
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,820
Zhenhan, I like you.

295
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,580
Stop!

296
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,100
Yan Jiuyue, I’m sorry.

297
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,580
You’re going too far.

298
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,070
I can hardly catch up.

299
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,700
I want to calm down.

300
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,270
I gotta go.

301
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,420
But...

302
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,420
Zhenhan!

303
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,790
How come?

304
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,170
We were close before the vacation.

305
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,670
Why are all indexes declining sharply

306
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,180
after the vacation?

307
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,220
Is she...

308
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
From twelve to one every noon,

309
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,580
you used to practice English
in the lakeside corridor.

310
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,440
Why are you coming so early today?

311
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,560
No wonder I didn’t find you there.

312
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,340
I read about it that,

313
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,460
reciting English words when hungry
can be inefficient.

314
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,940
So, I plan to have something to eat

315
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,180
before I study.

316
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,210
You didn’t like to do this.

317
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,100
You said it was a waste of time.

318
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,870
You only came to study alone.

319
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,270
I'm now in the junior year.

320
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,860
I should take part in some social practice.

321
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,940
No way! No way!

322
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,400
It doesn’t make any sense.

323
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,510
You look very abnormal.

324
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,670
Have a crush on someone?

325
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,240
What makes you think so?

326
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,860
Well, I haven’t tried

327
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,000
a straight-A girl.

328
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,170
If you don’t like her,

329
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,030
I’d like to try.

330
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,100
How dare you!

331
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,060
See? Stop denying.

332
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,190
If you don’t want me to chase her,

333
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,900
play games with me over night

334
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,100
and make me happy.

335
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,150
You’re so angry.

336
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,610
Looks like you’re very territorial.

337
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,650
Don’t touch it!

338
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,060
You can’t use it.

339
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,270
I don’t think such a cheap thing is yours.

340
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,270
Why can’t I use it?

341
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,890
You just can’t!

342
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,510
You look weird.

343
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,580
Six major elements for accountancy

344
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,030
are assets, liabilities

345
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,870
equity,

346
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,830
income, expense and...

347
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,000
- I just come to take classes.
- Profit.

348
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,830
Why did I become

349
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,750
- Gu Yanluo’s girlfriend?
- These six elements are reflected

350
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,860
through report forms,

351
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,420
namely three financial sheets

352
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,380
we usually mention.

353
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,870
They are

354
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,580
Balance Sheet,

355
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,460
Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement.

356
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,150
These three sheets are closely related.

357
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,390
They reflect each other and make a balance.

358
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,510
In this class, we’ll...

359
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,420
What are you doing?

360
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,030
Learn basic principles.

361
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,340
Everybody, hope you’ll listen carefully

362
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,060
and make notes.

363
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,650
None of your business!

364
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,800
Only with enough basic principles

365
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,320
can you use what you learnt

366
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,340
to benefit society.

367
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,630
Sure.

368
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,790
I encourage you to do social practice

369
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,390
- during vocations.
- Item 4 of our agreements.

370
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,420
- I need you. Reply quickly.
- You should combine

371
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,820
the theories you learnt in classes

372
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,550
with the actual situations

373
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,870
you meet in society.

374
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,220
I’m in class!

375
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,950
What exactly do you want?

376
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,790
Do you have time tomorrow?

377
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,940
No.

378
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,270
Zhenhan, tomorrow is the weekend.

379
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,990
I want to take you to a place.

380
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,180
Do you have time?

381
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,820
When can they stop bothering me?

382
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,270
I’m afraid I’m busy tomorrow.

383
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,190
Tomorrow is my birthday.

384
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,190
I can ask someone
to take your place in the library.

385
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,340
Is that okay?

386
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,870
All right, then.

387
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,670
My mom said she would cook for you.

388
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,750
Let’s go tomorrow.

389
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,880
Sorry, but I don’t have time tomorrow.

390
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,270
You’re not sick.

391
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,860
You’re sick!

392
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,420
Since you’re not sick,

393
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,680
why do you turn me down?

394
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,880
Shall I remind you of Item 4 of the agreement?

395
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,340
Dude, we’re on the campus.

396
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,580
Shall I remind you of Item 3?

397
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,820
Yanluo!

398
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,940
Yanluo,

399
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,910
the Publicity Department organized a trip
to the suburban hot spring.

400
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,270
You’re the president of Students’ Union.

401
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,790
Would you like to go with us?

402
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,850
Sorry, but I don’t have time for that.

403
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,260
Jiuyue,

404
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,570
isn’t it your birthday today?

405
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,820
Why are you taking me to the amusement park?

406
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,910
Zhenhan, you love the amusement park most.

407
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,040
Don’t you remember?

408
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,220
Right.

409
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,180
It’s the most romantic place
a straightforward man can go.

410
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,060
Much better than that icy man.

411
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,960
Let’s go and see what we’ll enjoy.

412
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,750
Okay.

413
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,910
Life is full of tests.

414
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,020
It’s not written in the book.

415
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,050
Zhenhan, have you decided which to ride?

416
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,670
Uh, I...

417
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,330
How about this one?

418
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,060
It looks lovely.

419
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,990
Zhenhan, don’t you love roller coasters the most?

420
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,910
Shall we go ride one?

421
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,960
It’s over there.

422
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,790
Yes, yes. Let’s go ride it.

423
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,420
Zhenhan,

424
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,860
Don't be scared.

425
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,390
I won't be scared.

426
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,300
Are you?

427
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,670
I’m not scared.

428
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,840
Even if you are, you can’t run away.

429
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,470
You look a bit nervous.

430
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,030
I don’t.

431
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,390
I’m not nervous.

432
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,270
Here it goes!

433
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,940
Jiuyue, how... How are you feeling?

434
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,150
Are you alright?

435
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,870
Yes.

436
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,540
Shall we sit down?

437
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,790
No, no, no.

438
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,940
Zhenhan,

439
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,100
when we took the roller coaster
for the first time,

440
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,230
you didn’t enjoy it.

441
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,360
Now you’re so excited.

442
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,180
What a surprise!

443
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,230
You... You have such a good memory.

444
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,260
What... What are we going to do next?

445
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,750
Next...

446
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,330
Shall we try the Ferris wheel?

447
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,150
You said

448
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,290
you loved to enjoy the scenery up high.

449
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,270
Up high?

450
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,910
Fine.

451
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,220
Jiuyue,

452
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,030
I’m suddenly a bit tired and hot.

453
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,580
Shall we sit and have a rest?

454
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,510
Fine.

455
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,060
The Ferris wheel is so high.

456
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,030
God, what should I do?

457
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,300
Jiuyue.

458
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,870
Jiuyue!

459
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,300
I suddenly feel a bit thirsty.

460
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,260
There’s a vending machine.

461
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,510
Could you go buy me a bottle of water?

462
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,700
- Okay.
- Ice water, please.

463
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,830
Wait a minute, then.

464
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,750
Thank you.

465
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,630
Pick up the phone, Lu Yao!

466
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,270
You stalked me?

467
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,220
You look beautiful,

468
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,670
and you’re my cup of tea.

469
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,870
And I don’t need

470
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,100
to stalk anyone.

471
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,900
If I like you,

472
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,050
I’ll confess to you directly.

473
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,460
I’m sorry,

474
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,300
but you don’t look handsome enough.

475
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,670
You’re not my cup of tea, either.

476
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,750
I don’t like

477
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,790
to play around.

478
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,060
I don’t like you.

479
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,700
So, I’ll turn you down directly.

480
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,300
Farewell.

481
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:24,910
All right.

482
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,580
Girls like to refuse men before saying yes.

483
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,230
Well, I don’t have many shortcomings.

484
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,870
I’m mostly short

485
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,820
of you.

486
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,910
Could you stop being narcissistic?

487
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,490
No.

488
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,680
Go to hell, then.

489
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,700
Can God stop torturing me
for even a single day?

490
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,790
I’m afraid of nothing, but height.

491
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,350
What should I do?

492
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,790
I’ll be dead up there.

493
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,680
Being humiliated is better than being dead.

Hello? Where are you?

516
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,750
Answer me.

517
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,030
President,

518
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,710
you want me to go back?

519
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,340
But I’m not on the campus.

520
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,160
It’s not very convenient.

521
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,630
Something urgent? I must go back immediately?

522
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,100
Okay, I see.

523
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,990
See you later. See you later.

524
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,200
What happened?

525
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,210
You heard that.

526
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,820
President of Students’ Union summoned me.

527
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,580
Listen.

528
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,270
There’s an urgent mission.

529
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,390
Within half an hour,

530
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,870
Ye Zhenhan must come back.

531
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,100
Are you leaving now?

532
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,700
A man’s voice?

533
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,990
Hello? Hello?

534
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,510
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

535
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,540
Why powered off?

536
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,510
I’m leaving, then.

537
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,550
Why don’t you leave after having the water?

538
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,700
All right.

539
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,060
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

540
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,260
- Uh, it doesn’t matter.
- Let me wipe it.

541
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,110
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

542
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,450
It doesn’t matter.

543
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,300
Jiuyue,

544
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,630
I’m very sorry.

545
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,880
I really have something urgent to do.

546
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,790
Next time...

547
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,930
Let’s come out and have fun next time!

548
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,620
I gotta go.

549
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,880
You’re not Ye Zhenhan!

550
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

551
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,160
You’re not Ye Zhenhan!

552
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,630
Zhenhan has never forgotten my birthday.

553
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,940
Today isn’t my birthday.

554
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,500
She doesn’t dare to take roller coaster.

555
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,820
She loves to enjoy the scenery

556
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,080
up in the Ferris wheel.

557
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,340
Mostly importantly,

558
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,510
there’s a crescent scar on her leg.

559
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,780
But you don’t have it.

560
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,580
Who are you?

561
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,150
Why are you pretending?

562
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,370
[Outpatient]

563
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,050
[Inpatient Department]

564
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,270
Here we are.

565
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,890
[Push]

566
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,030
Zhenhan.

567
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,390
Mom, Zhenhan and I

568
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,060
will discuss that.

569
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,580
Right?

570
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,680
Your cousin said
they would talk about that.

571
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,790
There’s hope.

572
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,030
Do you think we need to talk about it?

573
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,820
No. Don’t even think about it.

574
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,870
My cousin is handsome, rich, and intelligent.

575
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,239
Ye Zhenhan will like him for certain!

576
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,070
Zhenhan is a kind, lovely and gallant girl.

577
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,030
Yanluo will like her for certain!

578
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,310
You’re an arrogant, proud, and brash man.

579
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,659
I won’t like you.

580
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,239
You’re an odd and irascible girl
who loves to lie.

581
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,219
I couldn’t love you, either.

582
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,060
It’s so sweet of them!

583
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,830
Their eyes are full of love.
