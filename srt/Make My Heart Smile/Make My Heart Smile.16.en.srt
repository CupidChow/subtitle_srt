00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,100
Then can’t you help her?

174
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,990
Don’t you even care for her?

175
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,070
Yeah.

176
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,620
She’s taking part
in GS Fashion Competition you hold.

177
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,070
A more professional man is helping her.

178
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,700
Does that matter?

179
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,540
No.

180
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,540
Your feelings matter most.

181
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,340
What a silly son you are!

182
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,750
I can’t even teach you.

183
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,700
Now that we hold the competition,

184
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,230
what a perfect chance it is!

185
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,890
Mom,

186
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,160
since we hold the competition,

187
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,070
can we change the judge?

188
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,340
Cousin, the audition, primary election
and quarter-final

189
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,570
have been over.

190
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,700
The final is coming.

191
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,310
You want to change the judge now？

192
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,860
What are you thinking of?

193
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,190
No way!

194
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,830
What’s the matter with you?

195
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,580
Why are you interested in this?

196
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,830
Nothing.

197
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,020
I gotta go.

198
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,740
Stop!

199
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,870
Don’t come back alone again.

200
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,270
You can’t be back unless you come
with your girlfriend. Understand?

201
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,020
Fine.

202
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,340
- What a son!
- Bye-bye.

203
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,300
Ye,

204
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,780
are you really going to abandon Gu Yanluo

205
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,310
and run away with your childhood sweetheart?

206
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,830
What run away?

207
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,890
I’m simply going to visit my grandma.

208
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,870
What about Gu Yanluo?

209
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,780
You can’t always ignore him.

210
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Let me remind you.

211
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,900
If you go on like this,
there’ll be more misunderstanding.

212
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,950
I... I just want to calm down.

213
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,870
All right, I’m done.

214
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,310
I gotta go.

215
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,830
Naughty girl.

216
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,720
Be careful on your trip.

217
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,260
Weimian,

218
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,310
where are you going?

219
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,510
Personal trip. I don’t want to tell you.

220
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,170
You shouldn’t leave in anger.

221
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,700
How narcissistic you are!

222
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,100
I’m just taking a trip with a friend.

223
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,630
Zuo Sichen?

224
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,330
None of your business!

225
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,310
Xingxing!

226
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,500
I’m sorry I’m late.

227
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,270
It doesn’t matter. I just came out.

228
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,460
Well...

229
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,330
- Let’s go then.
- Let’s go.

230
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,870
Don’t you worry

231
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,940
when such a good man
is around your girlfriend?

232
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,980
♫ Everyone experienced frustration ♫

233
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,710
♫ And doubted the unknown future ♫

234
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,560
♫ Some chose to give up ♫

235
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,290
♫ Some enjoyed it ♫

236

♫ Still look elegant in darkness ♫

♫ Don’t mind and keep being proud ♫

239
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,690
♫ Face the future bravely ♫

240
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,590
♫ Everything is worth expecting ♫

241
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,430
He’s still after us. What a stalker!

242
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,190
Drive safe and be careful!

243
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,100
I see.

244
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:19,130
♫ One day I’ll live a wonderful life ♫

245
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,430

251
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,190
♫ Experience joy and sorrow

252
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,140
We’re back.

253
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,750
Look at the fermented bean curd.

254
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,750
It’s still there.

255
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,010
Feels so familiar.

256
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,510
Hello, Grandma.

257
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,390
Is she home?

258
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,190
Grandma! Grandma!

259
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,830
We’re back!

260
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,360
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

261
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,460
At last you’re back!

262
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,900
Isn’t Zhenhan with you?

263
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,430
She’s busy with her study.

264
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,099
Study?

265
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,910
Grandma, I missed you so much!

266
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,819
Give me a hug.

267
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,010
You don’t remember me?

268
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,050
You are?

269
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,910
Snotty.

270
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,510
Sichen?

271
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,550
You’ve grown so tall.

272
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,150
You look more handsome.

273
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,060
Grandma, I’m your granddaughter.

274
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,150
Don’t hug the wrong guy.

275
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,950
Look at her. She’s joking again.

276
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,670
Are you tired on your way back?

277
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,000
No, I’m not tired at all.

278
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,180
Come in for some rest.

279
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,940
Okay.

280
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,060
Grandma.

281
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,150
Another young man?

282
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,620
You are?

283
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,310
Hello, Grandma. I’m Gu Yanluo.

284
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,090
I’m Weimian’s boyfriend.

285
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,180
Boyfriend?

286
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,700
Good, good!

287
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,280
What a handsome young man!

288
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,270
Grandma, don’t trust him.

289
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,270
He always makes Xingxing angry.

290
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,130
He may not be her boyfriend later.

291
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,870
I don’t believe that.

292
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,510
This young man looks polite.

293
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,870
My granddaughter is naughty.

294
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,270
Hope she doesn’t mess with him.

295
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,180
Grandma!

296
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,910
I remember when you were little,

297
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,510
you pulled her hair

298
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,180
and she even pulled off your trousers!

299
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,180
Grandma, Grandma.

300
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,060
Grandma, Grandma,

301
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,820
let’s get in and talk.

302
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,030
Let’s go. Let’s go.

303
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,540
Come on, young man. Come in, too.

304
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,300
Come on. Come up.

305
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,620
All right.

306
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,030
What are you doing?

307
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,350
Looking for Xingxing?

308
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,380
Didn’t she tell you she went out?

309
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,900
Don’t you want to know where she’s gone?

310
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,940
Where’s she gone?

311
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,910
Want to know?

312
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,870
Beg me.

313
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,810
I thought you were eager to find her!

314
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,790
Looks like you weren’t.

315
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,670
Since so,

316
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,030
why does a rich man like you

317
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,070
come to experience the hard life?

318
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,510
I can do anything,

319
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,420
if it’s related to Weimian.

320
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,350
All right, then.

321
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,600
Do you dare to compete with me?

322
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,580
Why not?

323
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,730
Weimian, look.

324
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,170
What good vegetables!

325
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,750
Xingxing!

326
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,740
Grandma!

327
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,420
There you are.

328
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,480
We come to help you.

329
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,870
Weimian.

330
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,270
Zuo Sichen!

331
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,870
What are you doing?

332
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,750
Grandma, this works very well.

333
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,510
It’s the nutrient solution.

334
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,970
Be careful. You got me wet.

335
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,670
You should help us,

336
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,130
instead of disturbing us.

337
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,390
Young man, why are you holding a sickle?

338
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,870
Grandma,

339
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,220
he does no farm work
and can’t distinguish grains.

340
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,870
He can do nothing,

341
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,870
but make trouble.

342
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,220
Grandma, look.

343
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,840
He dropped our sickle!

344
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,180
In normal times,

345
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,220
he also loses his temper

346
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,480
and bullies Xingxing.

347
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,270
He does?

348
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,390
You do it on purpose, don’t you?

349
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,060
See? He’s getting angry again.

350
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,630
Look how impatient he is,

351
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,180
when he does a little work!

352
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,270
How childish!

353
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,300
Grandma, let’s go pick the peaches.

354
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,460
Okay. Stop making trouble, boys.

355
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,550
Gu Yanluo,

356
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,750
since you come, shall we compete?

357
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,300
Whoever picks the fewer
shall leave right away.

358
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,100
How childish!

359
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,340
Fine, you’re not childish.

360
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,270
Compete with me if you dare.

361
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,560
I’m warning you. My patience is running out.

362
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,030
Stop nagging.

363
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,720
Will you compete or not?

364
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,670
Why don’t you pick some?

365
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,090
I’ll wait a minute.

366
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,270
I’m faster. I’ll let you do it first.

367
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,820
There, there.

368
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,060
There, there. Yes.

369
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,240
Are you kidding me?

370
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,940
I’m not.

371
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,730
What are you doing?

372
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,630
You’re shooting yourself in the foot.

373
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,630
Don’t be stupid!

374
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,710
Don’t be stupid!

375
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,630
Grandma,

376
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,270
you made wonderful fried eggs!

377
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,100
I did?

378
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,460
Have some more, then.

379
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,100
I will.

380
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,060
You’re back?

381
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,030
I want a bath.

382
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,860
I want it, too.

383
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,790
Have a bath together?

384
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,620
- No!
- No!

385
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,030
Here’s only one bathroom.

386
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,460
Decide if you’ll have a bath together.

387
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,390
I thought you would come back alone.

388
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,140
I simply tided up the room you used to live.

389
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,700
Grandma, I’ll sleep with you tonight.

390
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,750
They’ll share one room, then.

391
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,670
Yeah.

392
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,910
I don’t want that.

393
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,820
Neither do I!

394
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,040
I’m sorry, Grandma.

395
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,210
I’m not used to living with a stranger.

396
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,510
Neither am I.

397
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,300
I don’t want to live with you, either.

398
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,670
There’s a hostel five kilometers away.

399
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,500
Please go.

400
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,510
I’ll pay ten times of the hostel
and you can go.

401
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,910
I’ll give you twenty times.

402
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,750
You’d better go together.

403
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,870
Fine, you’ll both stay.

404
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,340
I remember there’re spare quilts.

405
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
Where are they?

406
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,700
Grandma, you have a waist problem.

407
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,830
Let me look for them.

408
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,550
Here’s a quilt.

409
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,270
Let them share it.

410
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,100
It’s what you used when you were little.

411
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,420
They’re young men.

412
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,240
It’s too small for them.

413
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,150
- I’m okay with it.
- I’m okay with it.

414
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,180
Grandma, they’re okay with it.

415
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,670
Here it is.

416
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,550
Grandma, let’s go to bed.

417
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,300
Good night, Grandma.

418
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,500
Good night, Grandma.

419
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,060
Let go of it!

420
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,150
Are you trying to ruin Xingxing’s quilt?

421
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,410
You should let go of it.

422
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,680
You let go of it!

423
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,670
Let go of it!

424
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,020
Are you trying ruin Weimian’s quilt?

425
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,150
You let go of it!

426
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,270
You... You let go of it!

427
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,330
Let... Let go of it!

428
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,810
Gu Yanluo, there’s no point

429
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,220
even if we remain deadlocked till daybreak.

430
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,390
How about making a deal?

431
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,220
Who pays more gets the quilt.

432
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,420
Fine. What do you offer?

433
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,510
Double.

434
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,900
I’ll pay with a secret
of Xingxing’s childhood.

435
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,390
What? You offered double, didn’t you?

436
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,390
Be quick. Quilt or secret?

437
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,270
Pick one.

438
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,220
It’s yours.

439
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,100
That’s right.

440
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,940
Listen, her secret is that

441
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,840
she doesn’t have a secret.

442
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,310
You fooled me!

443
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,060
I just told you the truth.

444
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,790
Ask her if you don’t believe me.

445
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,290
You lose. Understand?

446
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,940
The air is so fresh!

447
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,160
How is your painting going?

448
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,750
You can paint with flower juice?

449
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,270
That’s creative!

450
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,980
Art is everywhere.

451
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,410
Don’t stick to forms.

452
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,270
The painter’s true feelings must be put in.

453
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,710
That’s the key point.

454
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,990
You’re indeed a genius painter.

455
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,340
I understand now.

456
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,100
I’ve painted the flowers.

457
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,860
Time to paint the girl.

458
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,700
Xingxing!

459
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,580
What?

460
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,600
- Grandma, let’s go to bed.
- Good night, Grandma.

461
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,870
Don’t worry.

462
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,340
Let go of it!

463
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,580
Let... Let go of it!

464
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,360
Let go of it!

465
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,340
You let go of it!

466
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,550
What are they doing?

467
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,100
Some sports before sleep, I guess.

468
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,700
Give it to me!

469
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,430
Give it to me!

470
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,340
You give it to me!

471
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,180
Let go of it, will you?
