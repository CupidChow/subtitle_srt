You didn’t answer my phone. Where were you?

38
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,900
I did a spy and detective job.

Hong Yu didn’t hurt his leg.

This is the evidence.

Mu Ze was there, too.

43
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,790

But...

53
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,260
I don’t want you to post it.

Why?

Everyone gets on impulse.

If you post the video,

57
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,030
Hong Yu might do something extreme,

58
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,230

What about the president election?

Anyone capable can be it.

Even if I want to be the president,

64
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,060
do you think I’ll hurt my rivals?

65

That’s good, then.

Precisely.

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,470
he looked super cool.

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,380
It looks fine.

176
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,280
It doesn’t look as energetic
as college students should be.

177
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,710
Paint it yourself, then.

178
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,310
Stop it. Stop it.

179
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,630
We need to work.

180
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,070
Sit down and paint.

181
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:50,850
Let’s work.

182
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,630
I can also paint as well as that.

183
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,510
Looks great!

184
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,140
Mr. Zuo,

185
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,900
what can I help you?

186
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,750
Yes. Here.

187
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,860
Okay.

188
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,900
Here. Here. Here.

189
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,430
Friends,

190
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,510
come over. Come.

191
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,430
Be quick.

192
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,780
I do charity. I’m proud.

193
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,950
Let’s be the heroes!

194
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,700
Fighting, everybody!

195
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,870
Fighting!

196
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,860
Fighting!

197
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,950
Three, two, one.

198
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,340
Fighting!

199
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,460
Let’s get started.

200
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,260
Sell them out!

201
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,760
Come and have a look.

202
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,700
Come and have a look.

203
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,950
Gu Yanluo,

204
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,220
let’s see who sells more.

205
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,700
Naive game.

206
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,310
Come on.

207
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,210
- Girls.
- Isn’t he Zuo Sichen?

208
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,140
Girls, look.

209
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,140
I designed the pattern.

210
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,350
Do you know how much my painting costs?

211
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,740
It must be expensive.

212
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,390
If you buy this T-shirt,

213
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,630
you’ll have a great bargain.

214
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,250
I’ll take one.

215
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:16,870
I’ll take one.

216
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,930
We’ll scan and pay.

217
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,700
Thank you.

218
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,300
Thank you for your donation.

219
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,750
So, she works every day

220
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,690
and studies.

221
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,020
At last, she was admitted to our college.

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,150
Come and have a look.

223
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,750
How is she now?

224
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,840
Which department is she in?

225
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,830
Come and have a look.

226
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,890
It doesn’t matter.

227
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,160
Every poor student

228
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,580
has his own story.

229
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,690
It’s just like buying clothes.

230
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,550
You’re not only buying a T-shirt,

231
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,770
but also a story

232
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,090
and a dream.

233
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,390
Come and scan it.

234
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,340
Okay.

235
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,670
How is it going, Yanluo?

236
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,580
Thank you.

237
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,270
Bye-bye.

238
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,830
Are you tired?

239
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,660
No.

240
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,820
How much is it?

241
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,570
A hundred yuan for a T-shirt.

242
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,870
You can scan the QR code.

243
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,700
I’ll take one.

244
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,950
Thank you.

245
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,500
What are you doing here?

246
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,900
Playing freezing game?

247
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,510
I don’t know how to sell them.

248
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,830
You can’t do this.

249
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,530
Come and learn from me.

250
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,780
Okay.

251
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,190
Girl,

252
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,700
may I have a word with you?

253
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,310
Boy,

254
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,020
you’re so honey-lipped.

255
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,780
What girl? Call me madam.

256
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
You look so young. You must be a girl.

257
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,400
A kind girl like you

258
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,950
will support our charity, right?

259
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,140
Sure, I will.

260
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,660
This is your T-shirt.

261
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,270
Okay, thank you.

262
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,270
Fine, thank you.

263
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,240
Have you learnt?

264
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,660
Almost.

265
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,590
Remember what I told you.

266
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,680
Here she comes. Have a try.

267
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,270
Hello, Miss.

268
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,650
You called me Miss?

269
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,870
You look so young.

270
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,430
You must be a young girl.

271
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,990
What?

272
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,520
What are you doing?

273
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,610
What did you do?

274
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,750
I called her Miss.

275
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,390
You look even older than her.

276
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,780
Charity sale. You’ll have a great bargain.

277
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,580
Miss,

278
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,660
how do you like this one?

279
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,790
[Charity Donation of Charlotte College]

280
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,140
T-shirts have been sold out.

281
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,100
Gu Yanluo will donate

282
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,690
all the money from the sale

283
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,450
to the poor students of our college.

284
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,390
The list will be posted

285
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,630
on the forum.

286
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,070
On behalf of all the less fortunate students

287
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,270
I’d like to thank you.

288
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,830
But I also like Zuo Sichen’s painting.

289
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,460
I was too late to buy any.

290
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,340
I like it, too.

291
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,510
I want it, too.

292
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,580
Me, too.

293
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,510
It’s a charity sale.

294
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,950
Come and have a look.

295
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,460
All kinds of shapes.

296
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,340
It’s all-matching.

297
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,020
- Yao! Yao!
- Thank you.

298
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,020
A balloon for you.

♫ Hearing your heart jumping ♫

300

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,220
Thank you.

302
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,270
You had a hard day.

303
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,940
So did you.

309
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,510
Thank you for making me
president of the Students’ Union.

310
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,950
I won’t let you down.

311
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,780
I’ll lead the Union to build a bridge
between teachers and students.

312
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,190
As young men of new era,

313
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,660
we shouldn’t only study passively

314
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,430
in the college.

315
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,980
We should also get prepared
for creating a new age.

316
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,430
We’ll work with you,
to embrace multiple challenges,

317
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,830
explore new areas,

318
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,390
share happy lives

319
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,020
and achieve new selves.

320
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,750
Prince Charming, congratulations

321
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,180
on winning the election!

322
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,530
Surprise!

323
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,340
Come on.

324
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,130
I’ve got a gift for you.

325
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,190
What’s that?

326
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,540
It’s...

327
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
A clothing store?

328
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,100
You always want your own brand, don’t you?

329
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,230
Your online shop begins to take shape.

330
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,700
So, it’s time to run a clothing store.

331
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,340
I accept your concern for me.

332
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,870
But I haven’t graduated yet.

333
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,520
I can handle an online shop,

334
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,390
but I don’t think I can handle a real store.

335
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,700
I can help you.

336
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,900
No way!

337
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,510
It’s my own business.

338
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,540
And you’re so intelligent.

339
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,280
How can I afford to hire you?

340
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,310
Anyway,

341
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,630
I’ll sell myself to you all my life.

342
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,220
Are you alright?

343
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,950
Yes.

344
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,400
Were you on purpose?

345
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,270
Wait.

346
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,600
What are you going to do?

Today, he was so excited
because he fixed the motor

and then he had an accident during the test.

515
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,730
I have nothing, but instant noodles.

516
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,070
It doesn’t matter.
Yanluo is coming to pick me up.

517
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,550
Good job, Mr. Zuo.

518
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,820
It looks like

519
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,460
you’re fully prepared for the exhibition.

520
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,270
Do you still have a stomach ache?

521
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,550
I said I would take you to eat something,

522
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,580
but you refused.

523
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,930
I feel much better.

524
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,260
Weimian.

525
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,340
There you are.

526
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,080
Why are you here?

527
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,820
This is my studio.

528
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,390
Thank you for taking care of her.

529
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,150
Gu Yanluo,

530
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,120
I’ve got something to tell you.

531
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,660
Get in the car and wait for me.

532
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,990
I simply have some questions to ask Mr. Gu.

533
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,910
Well, talk politely

534
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,520
and don’t quarrel.

535
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,990
Go ahead. I’ll catch up.

536
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,180
Gu Yanluo,

537
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,340
as Xingxing’s boyfriend,

538
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,990
you should have taken good care of her.

539
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,340
Do you know she nearly passed out

540
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,990
when she had a stomach ache today?

541
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,630
Thanks for reminding. I’ll be more careful.

542
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,390
If you fail to be a good boyfriend,

543
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,940
give up the position

544
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,520
so that others can fill in.

545
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,470
Are you trying to steal her?

546
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,980
Yes, I like her,

547
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,600
since I was a little boy.

548
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,810
If you fail to take care of her,

549
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,750
I’ll steal her from you.

550
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,780
You grew up together, but she isn’t yours.

551
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,510
What’s the odd that you can win?

552
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,820
You don’t feel well. Don’t get in a draught.

553
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,470
Why didn’t you get in the car?

554
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,440
It’s too hot in the car.

555
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,790
You’re angry?

556
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,060
I’m sorry.

557
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,510
I had a stomach ache,

558
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,170
and he was passing by... I...

559
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,300
Don’t do that again.

560
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,220
Yes, sir.

561
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,660
I mean don’t have a stomach ache again in future

562
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,630
Yes, sir!

563
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,470
Let’s go home.

564
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,100
Be careful.

565
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,750
Sit firmly.

566
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,240
[Doctor Wang]

567
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,970
[Doctor Wang]

568
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,750
I feel something wrong.

569
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,770
Pay more attention to Ye Zhenhan lately.

570
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,670
If you find out anything suspicious,

571
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,070
let me know immediately.

572
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,550
Hello?

573
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,790
Hello, is that Ye Zhenhan?

574
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,870
You haven’t had your check this month.

575
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,820
Come this weekend if you have time.

576
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,460
You’re still in recovery.

577
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,460
You must get checked every month.

578
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,630
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

579
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,150
Fine, when you come,

580
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,300
bring the previous medical records.

581
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,300
[Doctor Wang Delete]

582
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,820
Check up?

583
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,940
Is Ye Zhenhan sick?

584
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,140
Don’t rush. Everyone will have it.

585
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,750
Everyone will have it.

586
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,150
I’ll take one. I want one.

587
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,150
Here.

588
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,770
Everyone will have it.

589
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,240
- Here.
- Thank you.

590
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,580
This.

591
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:23,940
Come on.

592
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,750
Any more?

593
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,090
There’s still one.

594
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,300
Leave this to me. I need it.

595
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,310
- I’m sorry.
- It doesn’t matter.

596
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,270
I’m sorry.

597
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,580
You!

598
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,980
[Xing]

599
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,430
There’s a love legend in foreign colleges.

600
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,300
If you give a girl the gift

601
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,580
with her name on it,

602
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,220
you’ll have a happy ending with her.

603
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,200
[Xingxing]

604
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,080
All right. This is for you.

605
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,550
I must carefully keep your autograph.

606
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,180
And put it somewhere

607
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,100
you can always see.

608
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,240
It doesn’t matter.

609
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,750
I’ll paint more for you.

610
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,020
Thanks, my good friend.
