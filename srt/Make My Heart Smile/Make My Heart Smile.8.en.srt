00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,110
Make My Heart Smile

3
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,100
Episode 8
Chaotic Cohabitation

4
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,150
There’s a quota of exchange student

5
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,480
at an Ivy League school.

6
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,790
It’s free of charge.

7
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,150
This is what I’ve been dreaming of.

8
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,820
I want to strive for it.

9
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,590
You must get better.

10
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,760
How is she today? Getting better?

11
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,740
The doctor said after she used new medicine,

12
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,430
she was having better indicators

13
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,630
and it was a good omen.

14
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,990
That’s great.

15
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,180
I’ve brought some of her favorite books

16
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,180
to read to her.

17
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,990
You don’t need to come every day.

18
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,460
You have a lot of classes.

19
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
I checked that.

20
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,640
Talking to patients will help them recover.

21
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,980
Besides,

22
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,860
when I studied and worked,

23
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,900
Zhenhan kept me company.

24
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,230
I was simply too dull to understand.

25
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,950
You made the soup,

26
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,100
but Zhenhan can’t have any.

27
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,170
I’ll moisten her lips anyway.

28
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
I think

29
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,100
the soup is at least nutritious.

30
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,710
You can have some, too.

31
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,590
You work hard every day.

32
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,180
Weimian,

33
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,890
in the college,

34
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,450
I heard a lot about you and Gu Yanluo.

35
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,260
Even an indifferent man like you

36
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,300
has heard of it?

37
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,850
Looks like I must be careful.

38
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,459
You told me

39
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,540
you served as his housekeeper?

40
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,930
In Charlotte College,

41
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,250
anything concerning Gu Yanluo

42
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,930
will definitely be magnified.

43
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,020
I think

44
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,260
it’s too risky to hide your identity.

45
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:33,780
Yeah,

46
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,700
I’m like walking on an expensive bomb

47
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,990
and there’s no turning back.

48
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,370
But when I behave carefully

49
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,980
and detain a low profile,

50
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,620
I don’t think it’ll explode.

51
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,870
Where’s he?

52
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,030
Mr. Gu, I’m back!

53
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,930
What else would you like me to do,
except for shoe-polishing?

54
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,020
Go get the antipyretic for me.

55
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,820
You’re sick?

56
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,830
Are you alright?

57
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,530
39℃?

58
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,580
You got your boss sick,

59
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,780
and now you’re back at last?

60
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,150
Did you get a cold during your bath?

61
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,870
You tricked me,

62
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,900
and then I tried to fight back.

63
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,860
I never expected you to be so weak

64
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,620
when you do sport every day.

65
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,000
You mean it’s my fault?

66
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,140
It’s my bad! My bad!

67
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,560
You’re sick already. You’re the boss.

68
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,210
I’ll go get the medicine for you.

69
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,140
I want some soup.

70
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,060
What you made this morning.

71
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,040
Soup for patients?

72
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,330
Fine, I’ll go cook it for you.

73
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,760
Here comes the soup.

74
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,900
It’s hot. Be careful.

75
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
You don’t need me to feed you, do you?

76
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
How does it taste?

77
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,930
Just so-so.

78
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,580
It can’t be!

79
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,390
I put a lot of ingredients.

80
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,090
Enjoy more if you like it.

81
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,690
There’s much more in the pot.

82
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,180
By the way,

83
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,380
I made it by working extra hours.

84
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,620
It’s worth 200 yuan.

85
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,920
Isn’t it a robbery?

86
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,300
Shouldn’t you compensate for me?

87
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,810
I have a day off today.

88
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,980
On the agreement,

89
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,200
I should take extra charge

90
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,020
for extra work or extra services.

91
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,740
Today, I stayed up late and took care of you.

92
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,110
It’s not expensive.

93
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,020
Blood!

94
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,470
You’ve got a nosebleed!

95
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,430
Hurry! Hurry! Plug your nose.

96
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,140
Hurry!

97
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,650
What did you feed me?

98
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:15,980
Ice!

99
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,050
I’ll go get some ice!

100
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,460
Wait for me.

101
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,250
Go!

102
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,620
Here it is.

103
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,630
Here’s the ice.

104
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,000
You... You look weak.

105
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,450
So, I tried to make something nutritious.

106
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,380
I put caterpillar fungus
and gastrodia tuber...

107
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,039
A dozen ingredients in total.

108
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,690
200 isn’t a high price.

109
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,890
Weak?

110
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,850
Nutritious?

111
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,720
Didn’t you feed me poison?

112
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,490
Don’t get angry.

113
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,700
You’re suffering from internal heat.

114
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,480
This... This isn’t right.

115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,740
Come on. Raise your head.

116
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,640
Raise it!

117
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,130
Like this.

118
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,060
Feeling better?

119
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,640
Your fever is gone!

120
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,100
Use some ice
and your fever will be gone, too.

121
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,300
Smells so good.

122
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,530
No running today?

123
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,420
I’m sick. I won’t torture myself.

124
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,450
Soup again?

125
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,730
It’s duck soup.

126
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,050
It removes heat,

127
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,980
and it’s free of charge.

128
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,170
Try some.

129
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,050
How does it taste?

130
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,680
Uh,

131
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,120
the bill for last night.

132
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,740
Please pay it.

133
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,250
You even found this way?

134
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,000
For your convenience, Boss.

135
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,300
I’ll put it on the tea table.

136
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,560
Welcome to scan it at any time.

137
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,730
You made the soup

138
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,970
to poison your boss.

139
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,020
And you dare to charge for that?

140
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,920
[Pay]

141
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,780
Simply 200 yuan.

142
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,380
Do you need to be so happy?

143
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,080
Every penny I made from work

144
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,620
can make me happy!

145
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,290
A rich man like you

146
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,450
can’t enjoy the pleasure of life.

147
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,050
I don’t have classes in the morning.

148
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,490
I’ll do the food delivery for two hours.

149
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,690
Leave the dishes here after you finish.

150
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,410
How forgetful!

151
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,940
So many take-out bills today.

152
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,440
Here I go.

153
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,010
Something’s wrong.

154
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,850
Ye Zhenhan,

155
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,760
it’s not safe to ride without a helmet.

156
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,730
Let me drive you.

157
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:21,880
What?

158
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,960
Do the food delivery.

159
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,610
Food delivery in a limo?

160
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,590
Are you out of your mind or am I?

161
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,100
It’ll be faster.

162
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,680
Not really.

163
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,170
I can go across alleys with this.

164
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,170
Can you?

165
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,810
Don’t stand in my way. I’m going to work.

166
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,820
Why is he following me?

167
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,920
How annoying!

168
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,550
I’ll get rid of him at a crossing.

169
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,100
Can’t catch up, huh?

170
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,610
I ride fast, don’t I?

171
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,680
How is he catching up with me?

172
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,660
♫ This little sweet secret ♫

173
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,810
♫ I wonder if I should tell you ♫

174
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,840
♫ I’m stuck in ♫

175
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,770
♫ The forest of unrequited love ♫

176
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,860
♫ Our own memories ♫

177
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,950
♫ Grow densely ♫

178
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,300
♫ I cherish them all ♫

179
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,750
♫ This little sweet relationship ♫

180
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,740
♫ Gradually becomes close ♫

181
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,810
♫ Everything feels good ♫

182
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,140
♫ We understand each other ♫

183
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,870
♫ Having you makes me happy every day ♫

184
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,370
Let’s see if you can catch up with me now.

185
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,440
I’m doomed!

186
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,030
Girl, you were speeding.

187
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,680
Why are you riding so fast? To escape?

188
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,480
No, how come?

189
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,250
I’m just happy to see you.

190
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,750
Where’s your helmet?

191
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,930
I forgot it.

192
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,560
I’ll detain your electric bicycle.

193
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,820
Pay the fine and get it back at our office.

194
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,440
Wait, Officer,

195
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,070
I promise I won’t do it again.

196
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,840
I’ll wear the helmet next time.

197
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,190
Uh...

198
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,650
I’ll detain your bicycle.

199
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,120
Wait!

200
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,850
What a hard day I have!

201
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,190
What I earn isn’t enough for the fine.

202
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,520
Luckily, I’m behind you.

203
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,040
Without you, I wouldn’t have sped.

204
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,970
It’s the most shameless apology I’ve heard.

205
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,060
I chased you, to give you your helmet.

206
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,880
You had it, but didn’t give it to me?

207
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,730
Gu Yanluo, you’re a bug in my life!

208
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,910
Well, let’s go.

209
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,050
You’ll do the food delivery, right?

210
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,770
Why are you holding it?

211
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,250
The milk tea isn’t sealed
and will easily get spill

212
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,850
If it does, I’ll pay for that.

213
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,320
Drive faster.

214
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,750
Gu Yanluo!

215
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,190
I...

216
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,120
Tissue. Tissue.

217
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,810
There’s... There’s no tissue.

218
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,980
Do you think I’ll believe you?

219
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,670
Do the food delivery in a car?

220
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,330
Why didn’t you drive a rocket?

221
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,810
Miss, I’m serious.

222
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,750
There’s remaining milk tea in the car.

223
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,000
Check it, if you don’t believe.

224
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,420
It was my fault.

225
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,320
How much is the milk tea? I’ll pay.

226
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,410
I can pay a bit more.

227
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,750
What’s going on?

228
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,370
A macho boss loves me?

229
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,630
No, I mean you?

230
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,080
Sir, it’s not about money.

231
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,310
I have milk tea at half past two
every afternoon.

232
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,610
Look what time it is.

233
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,310
Shall I go buy it for you now,

234
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,240
so that...

235
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,770
Do you have milk and tea?

236
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,910
What? You’ll make me some?

237
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,190
I’ll try.

238
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,069
Gu Yanluo, can you do that?

239
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,560
I have to admit,

240
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,360
he looks cool when he cooks.

241
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,580
Tasty, isn’t it?

242
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,000
Awesome!

243
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,960
Have a try.

244
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,030
Twenty-nine past two, just in time.

245
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,030
Man, you did a good job.

246
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,360
I didn’t.

247
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,360
But you simply have good ingredients.

248
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Most milk tea is made of powder.

249
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,120
So,

250
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,040
homemade milk tea is healthier.

251
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,310
All right, I’ll let you go.

252
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,310
Thank you. Thank you so much.

253
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,320
See? You’re glad to have me, huh?

254
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,920
Gu Yanluo, have you lost your memories?

255
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,520
First, without you, my bicycle wouldn’t
have been detained.

256
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,190
Second, the milk tea wouldn’t have spilled.

257
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,270
Third, I wouldn’t have been complained.

258
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,520
A customer complained that
our milk tea was made of powder.

259
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,720
A deliveryman told her.

260
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,240
How come?

261
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,550
Gu Yanluo,

262
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,760
pay for my wage and scooter.

263
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,820
And the complaint!

264
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,440
It’s time for lunch.

265
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,670
I’m in no mood for lunch!

266
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,020
That way.

267
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,350
Don’t bother where I go.

268
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,110
I can easily make you have lunch.

269
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,230
Hello,

270
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,110
congratulations.

271
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,520
After you had a meal

272
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,910
in our restaurant,

273
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,440
you won a double free lunch.

274
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,670
Me?

275
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,590
Yes.

276
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,120
We randomly pick customers

277
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,030
whose number of consumer coupon
and phone number is 77.

278
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,780
But,

279
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,360
it’s a lunch for two.

280
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,670
What?

281
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,320
Come in, please.

282
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,640
You said you weren’t in mood for lunch.

283
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,350
A wise girl submits to food.

284
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,070
You don’t like it?

285
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,660
You can come here for my sake.

286
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,270
Who begged me to come in?

287
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,470
Hello, Miss.

288
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,660
Excuse me,

289
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,720
may I have another free steak?

290
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,060
No problem.

291
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,390
We’ve got new steak for free taste.

292
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,640
Thank you.

293
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,240
Go, go, go.

294
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,880
What?

295
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,430
This must be a trap.

296
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,830
Luckily, I found it out early.

297
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,670
Go, go, go.

298
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Don’t look at me. I don’t have money.

299
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,390
I know.

300
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,600
Don’t look at him. He has no money, either.

301
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,060
Sir, you said you would pay

302
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,060
and pretend it was a free lunch.

303
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,430
But you have no money, either?

304
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,000
I do.

305
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,600
I have money.

306
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,540
The bill is 799.

307
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,950
Would you like to pay it now?

308
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,670
Cash or credit card?

309
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,670
Can...

310
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,240
Can I wash dishes for you?

311
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,780
Uh...

312
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,900
I’ll scan and pay later.

313
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,640
Okay.

314
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,750
I had a lunch with one month’s living cost?

315
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,140
I feel so bad.

316
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,470
It’s my treat,

317
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,070
as an apology for ruining your food delivery.

318
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,870
But you could have apologized

319
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,630
by giving me cash.

320
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,430
Stop humiliating yourself.

321
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,690
Go. Let’s go back home.

322
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,630
Wait a second.

323
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,350
I’ll pack the food.

324
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,540
Pack?

325
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,880
You pack when having lunch with me?

326
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,590
I’m being thrifty.

327
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,520
The waitress said

328
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,110
I got a rich boyfriend.

329
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,000
Why did you roll your eyes?

330
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,300
Dear Boss, you get it wrong.

331
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,140
That’s my romantic love for you.

332
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Did you get it?

333
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,830
You don’t look lovely at all.

334
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,760
Don’t humiliate yourself.

335
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,630
My trick works all the time.

336
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,140
Even if it’s not lovely,
it can’t be horrible.

337
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,880
Wait for me.

338
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,380
Even cheap T-shirts

339
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,000
can make the old man and lady

340
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,660
feel happy and sweet.

341
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,540
The food doesn’t matter,

342
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,230
but the partner matters.

343
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,380
I’m leaving.

344
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,490
Remember to wash the clothes left yesterday.

345
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,030
I see.

346
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,350
I don’t have classes in the morning.

347
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,020
I’m also was suspended from food delivery.

348
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,260
Boss, let me calm down.

349
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,970
Don’t make dinner.
I’ll have it before coming back.

350
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,620
Which one do you like?

351
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,660
How about this one?

352
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,990
It looks nice.

353
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,380
Many girls like it.

354
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,430
You want it for your girlfriend?

355
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,630
At last.

356
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,210
What do you want me for?

357
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,720
You’re having a lovely style?

358
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,990
Why does the T-shirt look so familiar?

359
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,150
Isn’t it the one I used as the rag?

360
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,590
I’ll leave if you’ve got nothing to say.

361
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,420
Don’t.

362
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,440
Don’t leave.

363
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,220
Yao and I had a breakthrough.

364
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,260
To celebrate my success,

365
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,950
I’m going to give her a gift.

366
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,080
Help me choose one.

367
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,470
Success?

368
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,900
The second level.

369
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,420
I got to the second level.

370
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,260
I mean

371
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,530
we kissed.

372
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,940
It was an accident, though.

373
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,230
But since there was an accident,

374
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,760
there would be more kisses.

375
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,750
Second level?

376
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,470
Accident?

377
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,470
Be... Bee!

378
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,590
My feet!

379
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,150
What’s on your mind?

380
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,900
Are you sure girls like this?

381
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,580
You don’t understand.

382
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,060
Girls want to be slim,

383
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,590
but they love food.

384
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,320
Look. Look at this.

385
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,530
Red rose.

386
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,290
It looks enthusiastic

387
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,100
and represents my true love.

388
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,460
Gaudy.

389
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,660
Miss, pack this for me.

390
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,060
Okay. Wait a second.

391
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,650
Girls will certainly like

392
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,960
what you don’t like.

393
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,820
Would you like one for you little girlfriend?

394
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,500
No.

395
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,870
Don’t blame me for not reminding you.

396
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,990
If you take no action when you have a crush,

397
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,350
some other men

398
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,230
may get your girl before you.

399
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,170
Sir, here’s your cake.

400
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,030
Please take it.

401
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,780
Thank you.

402
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,700
See you.

403
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,290
Think carefully about it.

404
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,130
Sir, what else

405
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,220
would you like?

406
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,630
I’d like

407
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,010
the most popular cake.

408
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,900
Sir, this cake sells best

409
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,420
in our shop.

410
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,370
Many girls love it.

411
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,750
But it must be finished in six hours,

412
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,890
or it’ll taste bad.

413
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,650
I’ll take this one.

414
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,290
Okay.

415
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,090
Isn’t that Gu Yanluo?

416
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,290
Yanluo never wears T-shirts.

417
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,620
It must be a famous brand

418
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,750
or a brand of an independent designer.

419
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,750
Let me check.

420
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,930
He’s having a new style?

421
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,750
I know. I know.

422
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,290
It’s the latest style

423
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,350
and its price is...

424
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,500
50?

425
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,050
What?

426
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,230
It’s sold in only one online shop.

427
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,770
The price is 50!

428
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,020
How come?

429
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,130
He wears a cheap T-shirt?

430
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,780
A real handsome

431
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,950
looks great in all clothes,

432
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,300
expensive or cheap.

433
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,740
Meimei, send me the shopping link.

434
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,530
You’ll sleep after you just woke up?

435
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,530
What else can I do?

436
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,170
Sleeping is the best way
to mourn my lost job.

437
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,810
Aren’t you hungry?

438
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,650
I am.

439
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,380
But I’ll think about how I’ll die,

440
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,990
of hunger or sleepiness.

441
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,820
I’m thirsty. Get me some water.

442
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:56,740
Hurry!

443
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,060
cold water

444
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,370
You ask for a lot.

445
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,050
Hello?

446
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,700
I have no bag for band cards.

447
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,890
I have no money for apartments.

448
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,820
I’m strong enough and I don’t need insurance.

449
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,280
Don’t sell anything to me.

450
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,290
Ye Weimian, Mr. He is sick.

451
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,590
Come and work. You’ll get a double pay.

452
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,580
Yes, Boss.

453
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,510
I’ll be there within half an hour.

454
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
Ye Zhenhan, stop!

455
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,100
What?

456
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,160
Stop following me!

457
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,700
You haven’t got me the water.

458
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,290
If you can wait,

459
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,010
have some water after I’m back.

460
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,540
You ruined my delivery job.

461
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,180
Don’t try to ruin my double pay.

462
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,740
Yao.

463
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,250
How dare you come again!

464
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,370
I come to thank you, my lifesaver!

465
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,820
To save me, you sacrificed a lot.

466
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,220
You even...

467
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,000
Stop!

468
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,220
Don’t pay me back with yourself!

469
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,010
That’s what I should say.

470
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:27,820
You!

471
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,460
Look, the cake.

472
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
Rose Sand.

473
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,610
The most popular cake.

474
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,580
It represents your enthusiasm

475
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,910
and my true love for you.

476
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,460
The cake helps a lot!

477
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,100
Mr. Gu,

478
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,620
haven’t you even moved?

479
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,060
I’m hungry. Go make dinner.

480
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,330
Cake?

481
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,660
You bought it?

482
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,290
Mu Ze bought it. Buy one and get one free.

483
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,100
I’ll go make dinner.

484
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,570
Don’t bother.

485
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,740
How long shall I wait?

486
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,220
Well, let’s eat the cake, then.

487
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,100
But the calories...

488
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,860
I’ll eat a little.

489
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,760
You can finish the rest.

490
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,090
Aye, Boss.

491
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,860
Looks like you’re prepared.

492
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,720
Why do you use a candle?

493
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,010
A sense of ceremony.

494
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,130
Cute Bean, turn off the light.

495
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,890
Aye, Your Majesty.

496
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,690
What are you doing?

497
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,740
Pretend it’s my birthday.

498
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,860
Birthday?

499
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,170
On my previous birthdays,

500
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,340
I was either working,

501
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,160
or on my way to work.

502
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,250
I didn’t have money or time to celebrate.

503
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,340
But today,

504
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,240
here’s a cake and candles.

505
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,500
I’ll pretend it’s my birthday.

506
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,740
Since it’s your birthday,

507
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,340
make a wish.

508
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,350
If you want a cake for every birthday,

509
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,850
I can satisfy you.

510
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,820
I hope Zhenhan can wake up soon

511
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,250
and we can get back to our own lives.

512
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,240
Done.

513
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,400
Enjoy it.

514
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,470
Aren’t you hungry? Why don’t you eat any?

515
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,410
It’s too sweet. I’ll take in excessive sugar.

516
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,960
Don’t waste it.

517
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,780
I’ll eat it.

518
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,880
I’ll eat it.

519
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,160
The Challenge Cup Knowledge Contest
is coming next weekend.

520
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,330
You can do less work lately

521
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,950
and get prepared for that.

522
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,460
Challenge Cup? Knowledge Contest?

523
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,340
What?

524
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,330
You don’t remember after taking my place?

525
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,940
I was too busy to remember.

526
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,120
What a life I’m living!

527
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,860
There’re endless things to do

528
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,690
and countless traps to go.

529
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,280
I’ve got review files of last year.

530
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,140
If you need, I’ll give them to you.

531
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,810
Okay.

532
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,800
Tell me whenever you want a cake.

533
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,630
Don’t eat in a terrible hurry.

534
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,710
Come with me. I’ll get the files to you.

535
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,420
These are quizzes of previous contests.

536
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,320
This is my review material of last year.

537
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,800
Our college has been the champion
for five consecutive years.

538
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,090
To you,

539
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,400
this is honor, but also pressure.

540
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,489
It’s not only pressure,

541
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
but also a threat!

542
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,840
You always have good marks.

543
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,159
But it’s your first time in a contest.

544
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,489
Do you need me to highlight the key points?

545
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,530
Wait, I may not understand the key points.

546
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:51,400
I can’t give myself away in front of him.

547
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,650
Uh...

548
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
My notes are in the files.

549
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,880
Ask me if you need anything.

550
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,830
Don’t bother.

551
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,610
I’ll review them myself.

552
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,830
I’ll work hard.

553
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,960
What... What’s going on?

554
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,290
Ye, the T-shirts you asked me
to buy from the night market

555
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,490
sell so good!

556
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,730
I purchased some from the factory.

557
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,120
Really?

558
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,880
Who bought them?

559
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,770
Oh, students from Charlotte College

560
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,000
and nearby colleges.

561
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,150
It saves me the delivery expense.

562
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,490
What’s going on?

563
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,150
Excuse me,

564
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,120
your T-shirt looks nice.

565
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,770
I saw many people wearing it.

566
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,320
Is it your uniform?

567
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,840
How can it be the uniform?

568
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,120
It’s the same style of Gu Yanluo.

569
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,730
Gu Yanluo?

570
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,380
You’re not his fan?

571
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,050
Then you can’t wear it.

572
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,790
Lu Yao, purchase more T-shirts

573
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,490
from the factory.

574
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,080
We’ll make a fortune!

575
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,420
What happened?

576
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,220
Let’s go and study.

577
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,970
Hurry up, then!

578
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,050
You must read all these books.

579
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,600
So many?

580
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,220
Book return.

581
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,210
Looks handsome.

582
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,250
He’s so cool!

583
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,080
The 10% ROI is important point.

584
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,200
Gu Yanluo?

585
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,450
You, come with me!

586
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,970
Now? But I’m studying.

587
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,860
What are you doing?

588
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,120
I’ll wait for you at the door.

589
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,600
He’s going crazy again!

590
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,960
I’ll go have a look.

591
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,480
I’d like to leave...

592
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Wait.

593
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,000
Five wrong questions out of eight.

594
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,520
What a straight-A student are you?

595
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,070
How can you do the Challenge Cup?

596
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,480
It’s the draft.

597
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,450
Draft...

598
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,830
Ye Zhenhan,

599
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,680
the Challenge Cup isn’t your own problem.

600
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,840
It’s concerning the honor of our college.

601
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,360
If you take part like this,

602
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,920
you’ll bring the biggest failure
to our college.

603
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,120
In the following week,

604
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,640
you must stop all work,

605
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,700
and go home on time
to prepare for the Challenge.

606
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,350
But I must work!

607
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,390
I...

608
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,590
I’ll help you prepare for it.

609
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,190
If you come back home on time,

610
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,370
you’ll get a double pay.

611
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,550
Really?

612
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,160
Otherwise,

613
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,330
a double deduction.

614
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,560
Fine! I’ll go back home!

615
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,040
But, you’re only my boss

616
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,630
who doesn’t get on well with me.

617
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,720
Why do you help me?

618
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,810
I don’t mean to help you,

619
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,180
but to help with the honor of our college.

620
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,000
He’s arrogant, overbearing, and narcissistic.

621
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,630
But he’s caring for me.

622
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,370
Let’s get started.

623
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,890
♫ You are like an angel in my heart ♫

624
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,660
♫ Gentle kind and beautiful ♫

625
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,900

00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,050

631
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,310
♫ Why do you keep watching me ♫

♫ Can’t help but miss everything about you ♫

633
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,600
♫ Hearing your heart jumping ♫

634

♫ I just want to tell you loud ♫

635

639
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,480

640
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,920

00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,960

00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,280
♫ I adore you ♫

643
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,910
Don’t go to bed until you give correct answers.

644
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,540
♫ I adore you ♫

645
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,690
♫ The misty city is getting cold ♫

646
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,720
♫ I’d like to cover my longing for you ♫

647
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:47,600
♫ You bear it alone,
with your tears running ♫

648
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:53,140
♫ Your innocent smile is replaced by tiredness ♫

649
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:00,620
♫ I miss you again when the wind blows ♫

650
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,470
♫ But I’m not willing to tell you ♫

651
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,520
I want some more.

652
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:14,130
♫ In the dark night, I pray for dawn ♫

653
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,330
♫ Stretching out my hand ♫

654
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:21,340
♫ I want to touch you, but fail ♫

655
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:27,720
♫ My happiness is meeting you
in a sea of people ♫

656
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:34,450
♫ Missing is a falling star
in the corner of my eye ♫

657
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:41,620
♫ Memories are filled with the secret of youth ♫

658
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:47,520
♫ You and I meet at the best age ♫

659
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,900
♫ The rain drops
I am looking for you in loneliness ♫

660
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,220
Do you receive it?

661
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,540
The cute expression is worthless.

662
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,070
Don’t embarrass yourself.

663
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:05,750
Stop.

664
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,700
Today, I have to show you

665
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,890
a worthy one.
