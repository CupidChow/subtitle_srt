Episode 22
Prince charming on a horse

4
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,340
Mrs. Gu?

5
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,710
Mom?

6
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,540
What... What brings you here?

7
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,950
A bear called me Mom?

8
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,380
Who... Who’s he?

9
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,430
Yeah.

10
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,950
Mrs. Gu, what brings you here?

11
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,230
Can’t I come?

12
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,710
Isn’t it my store?

13
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,950
Am I coming too unexpectedly?

14
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,710
Mrs. Gu, how are you doing lately?

15
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,350
It’s been a long time.

16
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,810
Little Luo looks nervous.

17
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,710
According to my sharp sixth sense,

18
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,990
there’s something fishy.

19
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,870
I never expected my son

20
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,020
to have learned so quickly

21
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,730
to make his girlfriend happy!

22
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,340
It’s...

23
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,350
It’s Weimian’s store...

24
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,150
Yanluo told me

25
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,260
you ran a store.

26
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,310
What a coincidence!

27
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,660
I was just passing by.

28
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,870
What a perfect store!

29
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,310
In such a busy street,

30
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,780
you’ve decorated the store so nicely.

31
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,350
Weimian,

32
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,320
you must have spent a lot on it.

33
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,200
[Coming Soon]

34
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,310
Not really, Mrs. Gu.

35
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,790
The owner quarreled with his wife
for the decoration

36
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,540
and got divorced.

37
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,540
Then he rented it to me at a low price.

38
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,070
What an odd reason!

39
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,590
I also think he’s a poor man.

40
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,460
Miss President,

41
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,150
what brings you here?

42
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,310
Let me explain... The store...

43
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,710
Pre...

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,430
President?

45
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,350
Screwed. She knew it.

46
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,020
What are you laughing at?

47
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,220
Get back to your work.

48
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,740
Mu Ze!

49
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,900
I’ll leave you alone.

50
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,460
I’ll go for the promotion work.

51
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,260
Bye-bye.

52
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,590
Weimian, don’t blame him.

53
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,090
It’s my fault.

54
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,180
My bad.

55
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,540
Mrs. Gu, thank you for your kindness

56
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,870
and thank you for covering Yanluo.

57
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,820
But I can’t accept this store.

58
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,630
I’m not covering Yanluo.

59
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,100
He wanted to give you a platform

60
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,540
where you could use your talents.

61
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,350
In case you didn’t feel good,

62
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,909
he used such an excuse.

63
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,310
Please understand him.

64
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,340
I do, Mrs. Gu.

65
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,540
I’m not angry with him.

66
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,030
I just think

67
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,540
Yanluo has done so much for me.

68
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,909
This is my own dream

69
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,270
and I should strive for it personally.

70
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,770
Good girl!

71
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,659
Yanluo, you have quite a good girlfriend.

72
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,659
The store is fixed, but your talent isn’t.

73
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,780
Now that you’re confident in yourself,

74
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,630
I won’t give the store to others.

75
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,510
I’m a businesswoman.

76
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,910
The rent is 70,000 yuan.

77
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,340
A 2,000 yuan monthly charge

78
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,280
for water and electricity.

79
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,540
The net profit can be...

80
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,340
Well,

81
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,040
give me 30% of your profits as the rent.

82
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
What do you think?

83
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,310
You mean you’ll become a shareholder?

84
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,100
What?

85
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,850
Can’t I invest in your talent?

86
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,380
Many people support college students
for entrepreneur.

87
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,100
We must help, too.

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,560
Thank you, Mrs. Gu.

89
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,780
I won’t let you down.

90
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,710
All right. I think highly of you!

91
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,870
Mom, thank you.

92
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,470
Get back to work.

93
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,909
I’ll leave you alone.

94
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,260
I’ll take a walk somewhere else.

95
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,810
See you.

96
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,800
Get to your work.
Don’t bother to walk me out.

97
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,770
Silly son,

98
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,380
learn from your mother.

99
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,520
Get to your work.

100
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,150
Zuo Sichen likes Ye Weimian.

101
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,310
I adore you.

102
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,910
I’m sorry.

103
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,420
Looks like Snotty has grown up.

104
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,710
I can see no one, but her.

105
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,730
Why isn’t anyone home?

106
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,380
Weimian?

107
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,710
Sorry,

108
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,680
the subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected.

109
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,020
Please redial later.

110
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,150
Hello, where’s your girlfriend?

111
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,030
How dare you ask, Little Luo!

112
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,220
I’ve just become a boyfriend

113
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,500
who is so eager

114
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,870
to show off himself

115
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,030
and wait to get close to his girlfriend.

116
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,870
But I can’t even see her.

117
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,400
Do you find it reasonable?

118
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,380
Cut the crap. Where are they?

119
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,600
I just took my girl out of their studio.

120
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,539
How poor!

121
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,539
She’s getting thinner

122
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,539
because she’s tortured by your girlfriend

123
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,799
who is looking for inspiration crazily.

124
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,390
Restrain her, Little Luo!

Why didn’t you answer?

131

Where’s he?

132
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,270
Weird.

133
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,850
Did I order any take-out food?

Ye Zhenhan was in a coma in hospital.

why Yanluo suddenly changed his attitude

Ten minutes ago,

508
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,030
Gu Yanluo changed the list for you

509
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,790
without permission.

510
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,700
Here’s the screenshot of two lists.

511
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,420
I have a sound recording, too.

512
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,820
Would you like to listen?

513
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,550
What... What do you want?

514
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,030
I want nothing,

515
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,670
but ask you to make a choice.

516
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,220
In the white envelope is your secret.

517
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,060
In the yellow envelop is Gu Yanluo’s.

518
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,460
Choose one and expose it on the forum.

519
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,910
You can choose only one, of course.

520
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,820
Otherwise, I’ll post both your secrets

521
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,030
on the forum.

522
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,970
I just want to know.

523
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,060
The future of you and your sister
or Yanluo’s reputation,

524
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,190
which will you pick?

525
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,100
Xia Yuanqing,

526
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,870
I understand why you hate me.

527
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,480
But you even want to get Yanluo involved.

528
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,130
What good does it do to you?

529
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Ye Zhenhan,

530
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,100
oh, I should call you Ye Weimian.

531
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,880
Ye Weimian, make it clear.

532
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,860
I’m never a burden to Yanluo.

533
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,420
The future of you and your sister
or Yanluo’s reputation,

534
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,550
which will you pick?

535
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,930
My Genius Painter.

536
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,940
You look cool!

537
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,100
Come on. Tell me.

538
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,940
Overbearing boss or caring boy...

539
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,880
Which do you think I look like?

540
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,870
Come on, dude.

541
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,180
You look like neither.

542
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,930
I’m serious.

543
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,220
I’ll think about it seriously, too.

544
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,420
Caring boy.

545
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,580
I’ll be the overbearing boss, then!

546
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,550
How do I look? Overbearing enough?

547
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,340
Yes.

548
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,150
Very overbearing.
