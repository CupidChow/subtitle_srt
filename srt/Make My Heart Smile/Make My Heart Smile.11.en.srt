174
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,020
Weimian.

175
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,870
Do we have to stop talking with each other?

176
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,020
Or

177
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,260
do you want to keep like this?

178
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,460
What else can I do?

179
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,540
And, silence is golden.

180
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,950
I can use it to keep silent.

181
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,620
Do you have a better idea?

182
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,580
No.

183
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,140
Come on.

184
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,870
Keep it up.

185
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,020
Go back to your work.

186
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,510
Who’s it?

187
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,070
Ye Zhenhan, I have a feeling that

188
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,990
you want to talk to me.

189
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,750
Let’s meet after school tonight

190
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,100
at the front gate.

191
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,530
Who’s this? Gu Yanluo?

192
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,270
Is he out of his mind?

193
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,780
Will it work?

194
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,140
Why don’t we use money as the bait?

195
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,470
She will surely show up.

196
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,430
Such a waste you have a face of a leading man.

197
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,190
Why do you steal the lines of a villain?

198
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,100
Have you seen anyone in love with whom she

199
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,660
owes money to? A maid in love with her lord?

200
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,020
Take my word for it.

201
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,220
I’ve been in the love games for years.

202
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,870
There are girls I don’t want to be with,

203
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,600
but never the girls I can’t get.

204
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,060
Really?

205
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,580
Once she reads the words I wrote,

206
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,140
I’m sure her heart will be racing.

207
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,270
After she says “OK”,

208
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,070
you ask her to wait at the gate.

209
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,080
When she comes out,

210
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
you get her to the car in front of all.

211
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,690
The moment she sees the flowers and gift,

212
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,750
her heart will absolutely

213
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,540
be melted.

214
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,170
[Maid: Busy, need to work!]

215
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,950
Come on.

216
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,240
I shouldn’t have trusted you.

217
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,790
She is not free, but you are.

218
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,510
I can ask where

219
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,630
she works at.

220
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,090
Then you just go to her workplace.

221
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:07,980
No need.

222
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,460
Why not?

223
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,110
Did I just waste my time giving you advice?

224
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,070
Gu Yanluo.

225
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,070
When chasing a girl,

226
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,070
you have to swallow your pride.

227
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,780
Or you just wait to see your girl

228
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,320
become the girlfriend of another guy.

229
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,390
How could I?

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,660
I want one.

237
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Thank you.

238
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,700
Give me one.

239
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,580
Take a few more.

240
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,950
Welcome!

Welcome to try it!

243
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,460
- Don’t miss it.
- Hi.

244
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,540
Please give me one.

245
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,490
And one each to my wife and son.

246
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,780
He’s going to love it.

247
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,060
New shop opening. Don’t miss it.

248
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,510
Hello.

249
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,670
- Hi.
- Hello.

250
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,150
Looks like my good days are coming!

251
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,270
Hey, we have three flyers

252
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,990
All right.

253
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,619
Tell us next time

254
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,910
when you have such a nice work to offer!

255
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,670
No problem.

256
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,060
Hey,

257
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,750
is that your girlfriend?

258
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,990
Boss, I finished my task.

259
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,420
Any rewards for me?

260
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,510
It doesn’t count.

261
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,820
Why?

262
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,870
Look around.

263
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,390
Someone bought the flyers for you.

264
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
You were not doing promotion at all.

265
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,220
Who did this to me?

266
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,990
I mean you kiddos are

267
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,390
just interesting.

268
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,230
Why not return me the flyers,

269
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,750
so I can trade them for money

270
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,990
from him?

271
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,910
Boss, I...

272
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,670
Who’s that?

273
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,220
Here are the flyers.

274
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,790
Gu Yanluo.

275
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,900
Ye Zhenhan.

276
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,660
You must have time right now.

277
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,860
I’m busy. I don’t have time.

278
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,230
I need to talk to you.

279
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,990
I made it very clear that night.

280
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,700
Let’s get back to where we were.

281
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
It’s good for both of us.

282
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,580
No.

283
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,290
We can’t get back like nothing happened.

284
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,270
I really need to go now.

285
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,420
Let me give you a ride.

286
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,670
We can talk in the car.

287
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,990
I...

288
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,350
I have nothing to say.

289
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,600
Just let go of me.

290
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,670
I have things to say.

291
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,790
Gu Yanluo, you’re crazy.

292
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,850
You drove me crazy.

293
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,710
I...

294
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,450
Gu Yanluo, how can you be like this?

295
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,940
Let go of me. Let go!

296
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,990
You’re hurting me.

297
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,430
Get in there.

298
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,820
Let me out.

299
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,960
How do I open it?

300
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,810
Gu Yanluo, you....

301
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,700
Gu Yanluo.

302
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,060
I don’t believe you can do anything you want

303
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,390
because you have a nice face.

304
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,950
I...

305
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,890
Fasten the seat belt by yourself.

306
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,210
Don’t disturb me. I need to work.

307
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,150
What do you want? Let go of me.

308
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,420
Where is it?

309
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,060
Let go!

310
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,220
Do you hear me?

311
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,150
Gu Yanluo.

312
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,790
Ye Zhenhan.

313
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,700
I really thought about it these days.

314
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,100
I was too tough on you.

315
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,210
I will do better.

316
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:33,990
In fact…

317
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,670
In fact we can get to know

318
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,940
each other in another way.

319
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,170
Don’t treat me like your boss.

320
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,270
Treat me like a normal guy.

321
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,000
Now I’m asking you just as a normal guy.

322
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,210
Ye Zhenhan,

323
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,620
do you like me?

324
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,870
[Doctor Wang]

325
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,360
Did you hear what I said?

326
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,820
I’m sorry.

327
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,870
It’s a special ringing sound

328
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,690
I set for an important number.

329
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,060
Hello?

330
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,130
Is it Ye Zhenhan’s family?

331
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,550
Please come here as soon as possible.

332
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,100
We observed improvement of her condition.

333
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,460
Her fingers moved just now.

334
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,910
It’s the signal of waking up from coma.

335
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,150
The doctor is doing a full exam for her.

336
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,350
That’s great! I’ll be right there.

337
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,150
I’m sorry.

338
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,390
I am in a hurry. I got to go.

339
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,550
Ye Zhenhan.

340
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,550
I’m sorry. I really need to go.

341
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,990
Gu Yanluo.

342
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,630
I like you.

343
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,660
I really like you so much.

344
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,790
But...

345
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,940
I’m sorry.

346
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,990
I’m not the girl you imagined.

347
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,060
How’s it? Look at the timing.

348
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,820
Where is she?

349
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,940
[Inpatient Department]

350
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,180
How’s it, doctor?

351
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,390
What happened?

352
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,550
Did she really move her fingers?

353
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,290
When?

354
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,530
Would it be the same as before?

355
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,360
Don’t worry.

356
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,750
We checked all the figures.

357
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,630
Her condition is improving.

358
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,670
And she has body reactions

359
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,390
to particular things.

360
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,270
Does it mean she will wake up?

361
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,790
It is a good thing.

362
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,460
If nothing wrong happens,

363
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,550
she will wake up finally.

364
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,410
It’s true. I saw her finger moved.

365
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,420
I was reading a novel to her.

366
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,760
I saw it with my eyes.

367
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,510
All right. You two stay here.

368
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,300
I got to go.

369
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,670
She must know we’re waiting for her.

370
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,550
She is trying her best too.

371
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,570
Yeah, she must know it.

372
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,670
So,

373
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,790
am I doing the right thing?

374
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,460
What?

375
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,140
Nothing.

376
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,150
I was saying I hope she can wake up

377
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,300
and get back to her life.

378
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,990
Gu Yanluo.

379
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,870
It might be the best for both of us.

380
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,510
Before we start, I need to tell you that

381
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,580
I have put Mechanical Engineering Department

382
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,340
and Finance Department

383
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,060
in one class

384
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,670
to learn dodgeball together.

385
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,940
I have introduced

386
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,900
the theory of dodgeball before.

387
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,580
I have also simplified the rules.

388
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,150
The player who is hit by the ball

389
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,910
but fails to catch it is out.

390
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,510
When time is up, the team with

391
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,990
more players remaining on the court wins.

392
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,700
Now it’s time for practice.

393
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,550
Sir, it’s a teamwork game.

394
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,870
I suggest our two departments

395
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,630
have a group training together.

396
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,870
It will help with our spirit of cooperation

397
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,030
and team morale.

398
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,460
Sir.

399
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,750
We’re not afraid of any challenges.

400
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,820
All right.

401
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,060
Any volunteers from both departments?

402
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,700
Yes, sir.

403
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,000
You’re all in uniforms.

404
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,630
Seems like you are prepared.

405
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,580
What about you?

406
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,580
We are!

407
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,550
We need one more player.

408
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,380
Any volunteers?

409
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,220
Ye Zhenhan.

410
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,940
You’re in yellow shirt too. Go up there.

411
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,030
Am I right?

412
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,480
Yeah, they need one more player.

413
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,030
Right.

414
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,830
- Right.
- Go ahead.

415
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,610
Sir.

416
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,870
I’m not good at sports.

417
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,820
I will bring shame to my class.

418
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,790
Do it for the team. What’s the big deal?

419
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,920
Take it. Go up there.

420
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,940
All right. We have all the players now.

421
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,270
Go get ready for the match.

422
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,420
OK. Dismiss!

423
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,700
Jiuyue.

424
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,990
Come on.

425
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,870
The match starts now.

426
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,150
It should be OK when Gu Yanluo is here.

427
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,330
I just need to try not to lose scores.

428
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,910
Gu Yanluo, I don’t believe

429
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,760
you’re perfect at everything,

430
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,930
with no weak points.

431
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,220
Come on!

432
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,190
Mechanical Engineering Department!

433
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,280
Here you are!

434
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,990
Come on!

435
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,050
Mechanical Engineering Department

436
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,870
Come on!

437
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,680
Mechanical Engineering Department!

438
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,220
Gu Yanluo, come on!

439
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,220
Come on!

440
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,060
Nice!

441
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,790
Come on!

442
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,270
Come on!

443
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,180
Come on!

444
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,910
It’s 2 vs 2 now.

445
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,670
What to do now?

446
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,520
It’s just me and Gu Yanluo left.

447
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,440
We can’t win if I don’t play at all.

448
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,460
Zhenhan is not good at sports.

449
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,220
I was dodging the ball all the time.

450
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,910
But it’s already beyond her limits.

451
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,070
I’ll be exposed if I hit the ball.

452
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,790
But everyone fought so hard.

453
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,990
What if they lose the game because of me?

454
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,940
Ye Zhenhan.

455
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,270
Focus on the game.

456
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,760
Don’t drop the ball at the last minute.

457
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,270
- Don’t worry. I’m here.
- Gu Yanluo, come on!

458
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:43,990
Come on!

459
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,030
Gu Yanluo, come on!

460
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,150
Come on!

461
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,910
Come on!

462
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,510
Come on!

463
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,940
Come on!

464
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,670
Come on!

465
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,030
Come on!

466
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,510
Gu Yanluo, come on!

467
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,820
Come on!

468
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,030
Be careful!

469
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,130
Yanluo, are you all right?

470
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,150
Is everything OK?

471
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:25,990
I’m fine.

472
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,030
What about you?

473
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,390
Why did you try so hard to protect me?

474
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,150
Come on! Come on! Come on!

475
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,820
Come on!

476
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,600
The ball didn’t fall on the ground!

477
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,230
The winner is Finance Department!

478
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,410
Ye Zhenhan, you’re awesome!

479
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,580
What’s wrong? Are you injured?

480
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,100
By the way,

481
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,010
I didn’t know you can play so well.

482
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,790
I underestimated you before.

483
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,340
That’s right.

484
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,770
You didn’t catch the ball at all before.

485
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,180
If you play so well, why didn’t

486
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,060
you catch the ball from the beginning?

487
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,790
Were you just muddling before?

488
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,050
Indeed!

489
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,300
Except the last one,

490
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,700
you didn’t catch any one.

491
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,390
Were you slacking?

492
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,030
Have you heard the rumor that

493
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,700
she approached Gu Yanluo on purpose…

494
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,630
Excuse me!

495
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,050
Where are you hurt?

496
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,550
I... I’m fine.

497
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,580
Don’t move.

498
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,840
You always talk about the honor of group.

499
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,180
Ye Zhenhan did her best and

500
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,390
even got injured for the honor today.

501
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,460
Why do you still

502
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,580
defame her at her back?

503
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,300
She...

504
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,470
She did her best at the last minute.

505
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,630
But if she wasn’t muddling before,

506
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,100
we would not be caught in that situation.

507
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,990
So

508
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,060
when she outdid herself once,

509
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,580
it becomes the standard for her performance?

510
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,980
Don’t forget who got injured

511
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,220
to make us the winner.

512
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,700
Is it you?

513
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,150
Is it you?

514
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,120
I told you not to overexert yourself.

515
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,700
Doctor.

516
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,480
Doctor is not here.

517
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,390
It’s fine. You don’t have to be here.

518
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,590
I can wait by myself.

519
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,140
Wait a minute.

520
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,030
What… What are you doing?

521
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,430
Applying the medicine.

522
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,870
No, thanks. I can do it myself.

523
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,300
Don’t move.

524
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,420
It’s permeable.

525
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,560
It doesn’t work when applied on surface only.

526
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,830
If capillaries are broken when you move,

527
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,790
it will be more swollen.

528
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,100
I’m not badly injured.

529
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,670
You spray.

530
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,080
Let me rub it by myself.

531
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,900
Ye Zhenhan

532
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,390
If you want to protect her from gossips.

533
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,020
Just tell the whole world

534
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,340
she is your girlfriend.

535
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,360
Who can defame her after that?

536
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,550
First trick of chasing a girl.

537
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:44,220
Ye Zhenhan, the fishpond is contracted by me.

538
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,060
It’s too exaggerated.

539
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,990
Get another one.

540
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,180
Ye, I’m sorry.

541
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,030
It’s my fault.

542
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,300
It’s all my fault.

543
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,050
It’s my bad that
you became the target of my fans.

544
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:55,990
It’s my bad.

545
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,060
Get away.

546
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,300
It’s too menial.

547
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,970
You’re so dillydallying.

548
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,560
Let me help you.

549
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,900
What are you doing?

550
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,310
My dear, I have a feeling that

551
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,170
I want to meet you after class.

552
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,699
See you then.

553
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,270
Don’t touch my phone.

554
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,679
When did you tap the "send" button?

555
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,270
How could I know?

556
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,699
I’ve no idea.

557
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,520
It has nothing to do with me.

558
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,030
Are you all right?

559
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,940
Not now.

560
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,000
So the tricks I taught you are wasted.

561
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,510
Come on.

562
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,900
It’s different now.

563
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,380
All right.
