Episode 15
Rival in love versus secret couple

4
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,820
The man who bumped you...

5
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,260
You know him?

6
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,150
Yes,

7
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,620
since we were little.

8
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,579
He looks arrogant now.

9
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,710
When he was little, however,

10
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,510
he was a snotty boy behind me.

11
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,860
You grew up with him?

12
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,260
Not really.

13
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
He moved away after primary school.

14
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,870
We didn’t keep in touch.

15
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,070
Let’s go.

16
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,820
Let’s go.

17
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,070
Yao,

18
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,350
shall we have lunch?

19
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,270
No, thanks. I’m on a diet.

20
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,950
I left my helmet in the cafe.

21
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,820
Wait for me.

22
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,710
How time flies!

23
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,920
It’s all your fault.

24
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,510
Because of you, I can’t drive her home.

25
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,180
How can I break it down?

26
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,310
Oh, I know.

27
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,510
take a seat.

28
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,940
Thanks.

29

The trailer is coming soon.

30
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,320
Don’t worry.

31
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,990
I’ll get you and your motorcycle
back to school safely.

32
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,060
Leave the repair thing to me.

33
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,060
The motorcycle can be repaired.

34
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,909
What makes you unhappy?

35
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,430
It’s a limited edition?

36
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,220
It’s a birthday gift from my father.

37
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
I’ve been protecting it carefully.

38
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,980
I haven’t even scratched it.

39
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,260
It’s my fault.

40
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,870
Screwed! I destroyed it!

41
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,030
From your father?

42
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,360
It should be cherished.

43
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,790
Don’t worry. I’ll get it fixed as soon as possible

44
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,720
in case your father gets angry.

45
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,310
He won’t.

46
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,190
He passed away.

47
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,940
I’m sorry.

48
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,430
Oh, playboy,

49
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,030
look what you’ve done!

50
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,750
Sichen.

51
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,770
Well,

52
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,659
could you listen carefully to me?

53
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,220
We’ve signed the contract

54
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,659
to be a judge for the fashion competition.

55
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,470
If you don’t cooperate,

56
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,560
we’ll pay for breach of contract.

57
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,820
Whose problem is it?

58
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,940
Why didn’t you ask me when you signed?

59
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,000
Now you’re asking?

60
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,730
You signed the contract and you shall go.

62

63

I meant good!

64
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,260
I did that for you!

65
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,190
I want you

66
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,190
to be more popular

67
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,260
and more famous

68
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,740
in China!

69
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,180
I don’t need to get popular
through a competition.

70
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,340
Why don’t you?

71
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,710
Think about it.

72
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,380
The more competitions, the better.

73
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,710
Look at the competitors.

74
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,040
- I’m in the game.
- Look.

75
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,660
Come on. Just have a look.

76
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,990
They’re excellent.

77
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,430

as the judge,

83
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,470
you’ll look cool.

84
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,590
Just go.

85
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,540
No.

86
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,340
Sichen, listen to me, all right?

87

See? Game over.

88
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,150

I’ll go.

Did... Did I hear it right?

97
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,060
I mean I’ll be the judge.

Birthday?

He’ll like anything you give him.

You have no idea.

When I was in the first year,

I went abroad as an exchange student.

So,

158

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,220
As your buddy,

176
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,070
I’ve got the latest news

177
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,430
about that man.

178
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,620
Come on.

179
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,870
You know what?

180
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,960
You’ve got a strong rival in love.

181
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,000
He’s Zuo Sichen.

182
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,780
He has great talent for arts.

183
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,100
After half a year’s learning,

184
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,560
a famous foreign college took a fancy to him.

185
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,430
He became the youngest
international exchange student.

186
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,270
in our college.

187
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,960
Are you listening to me?

188
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,220
You know what? In the past three years,

189
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,950
he has held personal exhibitions.

190
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,610
He was also on arts magazines.

191
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,310
Lately, he’s been invited to be the judge
at GS Fashion Competition

192
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,910
your company is sponsoring.

193
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,830
You’re the honor of Charlotte.

194
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,630
But as the saying goes,

195
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,140
there’s always a better person than you.

196
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,390
He’s an international school hunk.

197
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,580
Are you done?

198
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,060
You!

199
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,230
Why don’t you have any sense of crisis?

200
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,700
Look. Look.

201
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,160
Look! Look carefully!

202
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,430
Look at the photo.

203
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,900
They looked so sweet.

204
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,330
You just didn’t see it.

205
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,980
They knew each other when they were little.

206
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,540
You knew that?

207
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,510
Screwed!

208
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,330
You... You fell behind at the starting line.

209
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,540
Make way. Make way.

210
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,390
When you have time to frighten me,

211
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,660
why don’t you solve your own problem?

212
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,220
Yanluo, Yanluo!

213
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,280
I’m caring for you.

214
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,220
He looks cool and fashionable.

215
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,020
All girls will have a crush on him.

216
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,350
You should be cautious.

217
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,480
See you at the night market.

218
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,430
Wait a second.

219
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,190
come on eat

220
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,930
Does it taste good?

221
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,950
How lovely!

222
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,270
You want it?

223
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,480
Let me get it.

224
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,780
First.

225
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,870
Put it down.

226
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,660
It’s okay. Try again.

227
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,580
Come on. Let’s try this one.

228
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,430
Okay.

229
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,580
Do it.

230
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,460
You’re indeed my cool boyfriend!

231
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,390
You’re amazing!

232
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,220
How will you award me?

233
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,020
Award for a claw game?

234
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,430
What do you want? I’ll think about it.

235
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,990
Fine.

236
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,900
Here comes the lightning round.

237
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,700
What did you do today?

238
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,350
I took classes,

239
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,020
designed new clothes

240
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,420
and had a meal with Lu Yao.

241
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,340
What else?

242
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,190
I met Zuo Sichen.

243
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,450
The man we met in the cafe.

244
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,310
He went there for you?

245
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,270
No.

246
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,860
What a coincidence!

247
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,900
He studies in the Art Department
of our college.

248
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,220
He used to be very timid.

249
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,460
Now, he’s brilliant.

250
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,160
He even won a prize
at La Biennale di Venezia.

251
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,020
That’s the dream of all artists.

252
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,990
I’m not interested in anyone else.

253
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,120
Where are you going?

254
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,140
Home.

255
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,870
You asked me to come and now you leave.

256
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,540
It’s so hard to make a young man happy.

257
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,660
You wait for me!

258
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,990
I didn’t have enough to eat for dinner.

259
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,870
I made some midnight snacks.

260
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,000
Would you like some?

261
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,590
Let’s have the lightning round again.

262
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,680
Face-saving Gu,

263
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,160
what’s the matter?

264
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,900
Why are you suddenly so curious?

265
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,630
What advantages

266
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,120
do you think I have?

267
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,510
Advantages?

268
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,510
What? None?

269
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,260
You have too many advantages

270
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,140
for me to think of any now.

271
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,660
Say something important, then.

272
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,430
Advantages?

273
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,870
You look more handsome than stars.

274
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,300
You have a perfect figure as super models have.

275
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,140
But, if you can smile more,

276
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,660
you’ll look more handsome.

277
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,100
You study well and do well in sports, too.

278
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,310
You’re good at all subjects.

279
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,700
Go on.

280
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,190
But you make life hard for people around you.

281
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,990
As your girlfriend, for example,

282
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,120
I’m under great pressure.

283
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,580
However much pressure you have,

284
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
you’re mine only.

285
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,430
Also, I’m yours only.

286
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,070
What...

287
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,540
What do you want?

288
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,020
I’m thinking

289
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,540
I must reaffirm my position

290
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,600
as your boyfriend.

291
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,580
Wait, someone’s coming.

292
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,140
Ignore that.

293
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,950
I’d rather hide myself.

294
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,670
Xia Yuanqing?

295
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,700
Yanluo,

296
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,869
I made a cake for you.

297
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,420
Cake?

298
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,750
Thank you, but...

299
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,950
It’s too hot out here.

300
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,390
May I come in?

301
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,310
I don’t eat dessert.

302
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,520
Take the cake back.

303
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,620
I don’t know you don’t eat dessert.

304
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,700
Don’t make it anymore.

305
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,390
Yanluo,

306
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,100
I just fear you feel bad after breaking up.

307
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,480
Then I come for a visit.

308
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,840
It’s too hot out there.

309
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,450
May I have some water?

310
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,100
Here.

311
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,790
Yanluo, I can’t have cold water these days.

312
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,430
May I have some hot water?

313
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,540
What are you doing here?

314
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,220
Yanluo, I was just walking around.

315
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,170
Sorry, but you can’t go there.

316
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,930
If you’ve got nothing else to say,

317
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,870
please leave.

318
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,030
I...

319
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,270
The cake will taste bad after a long time.

320
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,790
Enjoy it, Prince Charming.

321
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,030
I’ll throw it away, then.

322
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,940
We were going to kiss

323
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,060
when my rival in love suddenly came.

324
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,390
What a complicated story!

325
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,790
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

326
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,220
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

327
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,790
I’ve made my wish.

328
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,550
Well, blow the candle.

329
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,620
Three, two, one.

330
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,130
♫ And realize we love each other ♫

331
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,900
Zhenhan,

332
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,060
could you realize the wish

333
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,410
I just made?

334
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Sure, if I can.

335
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,510
What wish did you make?

336
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,270
I... I wished

337
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,700
you could be my girlfriend!

338
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,770
♫ You smile so sweetly ♫

339
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,820
I swear

340
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,340
I’ll protect you and take care of you.

341
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,300
I...

342
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,030
Do you remember this?

343
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,220
It’s...

344
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,270
My sister gave this to me.

345
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,630
She said you gave it to her

346
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,200

Let’s travel together, despite difficulties.

Happy birthday, Jiuyue.

I’d like to celebrate

352
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,740

Little Luo, you’re romantic at last.

360
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,140
Weimian said Yan Jiuyue confessed his love
to Ye Zhenhan.

361
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,820
She also mentioned a token of love.

362
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,340
I thought your rival in love stung you.

363

Shut up and tell me what to do!

364

Don’t rush.

I’ll instruct you soon.

367
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,140
Sir,

368
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,070
if you fail to pick the one you like,

369
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,420
you can design it by yourself.

370

Yes. We’ll instruct you.

Okay.

373

Why can’t I start it?

374

375

Here, sir.

380
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,870
Sir, I’ve checked the spark plugs.

381
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,180
There’s no problem with high voltage
or cylinder pressure.

382

Please check it

383

and see what the problem is.

384
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,910
Okay.

385
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,470
The engine is aging.

386
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,060
And there’s water in it.

387
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,920
It’s scrapped.

388
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,700

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,100
How come?

390
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,910
Sir,

391
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,180
I didn’t even ride it on rainy days.

392
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,510
Why is there water in it?

393
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,170
I opened the nozzle and checked it.

394
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,670
The oil quality has changed.

395
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,060
The engine is aging, too.

396
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,630
There’s lack of oil,
but you shouldn’t have added water.

397
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,750
I didn’t add water.

398
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,180
I would never do that.

399
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,510
Is it because of the wet weather?

400
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,390
Please check if you got it wrong.

401
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,750
Yeah, sir.

402
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,030
Can it be repaired?

403
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,630
The engine is so aging

404
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,470
that it’s no more produced.

405
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,010
We can hardly buy a new one.

00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,600
Get another one!

516
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,150
You...

517
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,340
You set all this?

518
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,250
You’ll get back to her?

519
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,180
Why?

520
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,100
What makes me worse than Ye Zhenhan?

521
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,790
I don’t need to explain to you.

522
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,220
Yanluo,
she isn’t in the same world as you are.

523
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,030
If you like such a girl,

524
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,980
I can stop wearing expensive clothes.

525
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,300
I can stop being fastidious.

526
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,150
I can turn into the girl you like.

527
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,790
Yanluo!

528
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,910
I don’t need that!

529
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,670
Take off my T-shirt!

530
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,390
Yanluo!

531
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,550
Yanluo!

532
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,940
Yanluo, you...

533
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,820
Let me finish, Yanluo!

534
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,400
Yanluo, it’s the last time!

535
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,390
I’ll let you go after I finish.

536
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,030
Yanluo, I love you for the longest time

537
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,750
and I’m the best girl for you.

538
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,460
Yanluo,

539
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,220
we have fans who support our relationship,

540
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,170
don’t we?

541
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,180
Speaking of the family background,

542
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,990
we make a perfect couple.

543
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,460
Yanluo,

544
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,940
did you hear me? Yanluo?

545
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,340
Yanluo, we make the perfect couple!

546
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,460
Yanluo, did you hear me?

547
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,510
I know it,

548
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,820
but it doesn’t know me.

549
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,170
I would have picked
the Mechanical Department.

550
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,670
Little Luo, come and look at it.

551
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,180
Look at me, first.

552
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,040
Don’t we stay with each other,

553
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,800
but hate to look at each other?

554
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,100
Your face looks the same.

555
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,060
I mean the T-shirt!

556
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,930
Sure enough,

557
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,420
love makes a cool guy odd.

558
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,550
You’re my beloved young man?

559
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,910
Sounds so romantic.

560
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,480
Read it backwards.

561
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,350
My beloved young man is you?

562
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,790
Sounds so sweet.

563
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,469
What a secret lovey-dovey thing!

564
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,750
It must be the sweetest art.
