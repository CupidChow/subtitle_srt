Episode 21
Unexpected love confess at Christmas

4
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,390
Cute Bean, turn on the light.

5
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,870
I have a stomach ache, not a leg ache.

6
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,460
I can do it myself.

7
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,310
Get in the quilt.

8
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,250
I’ll go get you some water.

9
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,310
Sorry I sat on you, sweetheart.

10
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,230
Let me tuck you in.

11
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,150
Still hurt?

12
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,279
It’s because you don’t have meals regularly.

13
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,800
You should learn a lesson.

14
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,660
If you have a stomach ache again...

15
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,060
You won’t take care of me?

16
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,780
I’ll show more people

17
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,910
how I carry you back.

18
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,990
Gu Yanluo, it’s so heartless of you!

19
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,190
You leave no ice cream to me at all.

20
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,910
You’re back?

21
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,340
So quick?

22
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,500
You want ice creams secretly again?

23
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,780
Do I look like I would do that?

24
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,050
Stop guessing.

25
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,310
Mu Ze took away

26
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,580
the ice creams and instant food.

27
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,460
It’s so...

28
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,780
It’s so wise of you!

29
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,750
Turns out all intelligent men

30
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,909
are nimble.

31
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,630
Well, tell Mu Ze

32
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,770
to treat my snacks nicely.

33
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,400
I’ve bought you some drink. Wait.

34
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,470
Clove tea.

35
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,160
Drink it when it’s hot.
It’s good for stomach.

36
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,100
Yes, sir.

37
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,860
♫ It’s clear after a heavy rain ♫

38
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,710
Don’t only say yes.

39
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
You must remember

40
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,350
to drink hot water instead of cold drink.

41
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,550
♫ There are beautiful scenery front ♫

42
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,900
Look at you.

43
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,820
You cook well and study well.

44
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,860
What a perfect man!

45
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,370
Who can handle such a wonderful boyfriend?

46
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,909
♫ You suddenly got upgraded ♫

47
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,310
No one, but you.

48
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,630
You’re so honey-lipped.

49
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,120
Have you eaten all the ice creams?

50
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,190
Want to know?

51
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,940
♫ I want to keep it to my own
A whole forest of secret love ♫

52
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,910
Am I sweet?

53
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,710
Haven’t felt it.

54
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,510
♫ I treasure everything ♫

55
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,910
♫ The sweet you and me ♫

56
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,950
♫ No more ice in our relationship ♫

57
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,310
Hello?

58
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,470
Hello?

59
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,720
You consulted about our store, right?

60
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,100
Our rent is cheap.

61
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,540
Why don’t you come and have a look?

62
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,310
Really?

63
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,590
If you want to run a clothing store,

64
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,710
look, the store is big and bright.

65
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,100
It’s perfect.

66
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,220
Also,

67
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,500
it’s in the prime location
along the commercial street.

68
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,260
But sir,

69
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,990
it’s such a good store.

70
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,430
Its rent isn’t even half the price
of other stores.

71
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,830
Won’t you lose money?

72
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,260
In fact,

73
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,210
I bought this store with my wife.

74
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,780
We quarreled because of the decoration
and then got divorced.

75
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,530
I don’t want to run the store.

76
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,310
So, I’m eager to rent it out.

77
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,490
Divorced for decoration?

78
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,150
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.

79
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,940
Sir, I’m very satisfied with this store.

80
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,340
May I bring the contract home

81
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,150
and discuss with my partner?

82
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,530
No problem.

83
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,660
Sure you can.

84
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,710
This is my name card.

85
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,430
Thank you.

86
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,710
When you make a decision, call me.

87
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,100
Okay.

88
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,380
All right.

89
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,260
See you.

90
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,539
Hello, Xingxing?

91
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,210
You finally answered.

92
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,870
I’ve been busy with the store thing.

93
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,950
I’m sorry.

94
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,870
You’re so busy?

95
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,470
Shall I treat you a big dinner

96
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
to make you happy?

97
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,100
I can also give you the VIP invitation

98
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,850
to my graduation exhibition.

99
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,980
Forget about the big dinner.

100
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,090
I’m too busy to go.

101
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,390
But I’ll certainly

102
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,140
go to your exhibition.

103
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,630
Well, I’ll go

104
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,560
with Gu Yanluo.

105
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,630
See you at the exhibition.

106
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,750
But...

107
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,140
Sichen!

108
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,140
Oh, God.

109
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,630
Why does it suddenly rain?

110
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,310
Sichen,

111
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,830
here’s some good news for you.

112
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,460
What good news can I have?

113
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,410
The Royal College of Art
you always wanted to go.

114
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,740
The application has been accepted!

115
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,460
Really?

116
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,270
Sure.

117
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Aren’t you happy?

118
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,830
Aren’t you excited?

119
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,460
Here’s my plan.

120
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,870
After the exhibition is over

121
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,020
and you finish the graduation procedure,

122
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
you can get ready

123
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,870
before we leave for the college.

124
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,780
But...

125
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,270
So quick?

126
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,900
Quick? This is already...

127
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,440
What do you mean?

128
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,780
Don’t tell me you won’t go!

129
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,990
No. I’ll think about it.

130
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,380
Wait, wait.

131
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,270
What will you think about?

132
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,340
Come on.

133
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,430
I’m going to reply the email.

134
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,090
But you still want to think...

135
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,000
Think about it?

136
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,870
Well, it’s okay to think about it.

137
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,660
But,

138
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,870
I must remind you of something.

139
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,280
This is very important

140
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,130
for your bright future.

141
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,020
You must think carefully about it, okay?

142
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,830
Don’t.

143
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,220
Fine, I see.

144
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,510
Good.

145
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,870
Good boy.

146
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,660
Don’t do it yourself.

147
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,870
Let me do it.

148
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,190
Let me do it.

149
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,990
Don’t do it yourself.

150
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,270
May I help you?

151
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,430
No, thanks.

152
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,220
Come on. I’ll be gentle.

153
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,540
Sit down.

154
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,870
Here we go.

155
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,540
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

156
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,190
I was lost

157
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,990
by your handsome face.

158
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,200
You’d better put down your weapon

159
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,460
and surrender.

160
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,870
Let me do it.

161
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,150
I know how to do it now.

162
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,400
Stop flattering me.

163
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,340
Tell me. What do you want?

164
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,140
Fine.

165
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,660
Listen.

166
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,740
I like this new store.

167
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,220
But the price isn’t reasonable.

168
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,020
Could you help me to check

169
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,420
if there’s any traps?

170
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,020
I drafted the contract personally.

171
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,620
How would there be any traps?

172
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,020
Sir, I’ve done what you asked me to.

173
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,390
What?

174
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,840
The contract is clear.

175
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,270
I can rent such a good store

176
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,540
with such a low price.

177
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,540
How lucky I am!

178
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,070
Hello, Ye?

179
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,940
Did you see my motorcycle key?

180
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,450
It was here yesterday.

181
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,950
No.

182
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,330
Was it stolen?

183
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,870
Lock the door and windows tightly.

184
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,130
What kind of thief would only steal a key?

185
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,900
To a broken motorcycle?

186
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,310
Could it be Mu Ze?

187
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,630
My boyfriend is calling me.

188
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,750
I gotta go.

189
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,310
I knew

190
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,190
you colluded with Ye.

191
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,460
I didn’t.

192
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,750
Let me explain.

193
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,430
Wait. Wait.

194
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,780
I just wanted to bring the motorcycle back

195
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,110
and give you a surprise.

196
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,390
I’m sorry, Yao.

197
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,890
First,

198
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,390
don’t do anything without permission.

199
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,070
You mustn’t make a final decision

200
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,600
before discussing with me.

201
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,020
Second,

202
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,480
don’t do silly things.

203
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,630
Don’t do anything I banned.

204
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,010
Third,

205
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
stop trapping me.

206
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,020
Otherwise,

207
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,840
I would punish you with family rules.

208
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,100
Yao,

209
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,570
you are...?

210
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,990
Make rules for you.

211
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,270
Now that they’re family rules,

212
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,400
it means I’m your boyfriend, aren’t I?

213
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,540
Guess.

214
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,940
I am, I guess!

215
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,070
Yao,

216
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,950
I’ll strictly obey these rules

217
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,270
and do better.

218
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,560
I can give you only one chance.

219
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,100
Yao,

220
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,650
what do you mean?

221
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,070
I mean

222
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,580
you have one chance to chase me.

223
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,470
But I can take it back

224
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,990
at any time.

225
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,950
Is it true?

226
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,250
♫ You smile so sweetly ♫

227
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,000
♫ I want to always hug you ♫

228
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,500
♫ Loving you will never get me tired ♫

229
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,180
♫ When you’re with me I forget everything ♫

230
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,240
This is your award.

231
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,540
♫ Thank you Thank you I like you ♫

232
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,130
♫ I just want to tell you ♫

233
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,960
♫ Thank you Thank for meeting you ♫

234
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,650
Don’t forget.

235
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,580
Today, you come here

236
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,620
as my boyfriend.

237
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,100
It’s my duty

238
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,460
to show off our relationship.

239
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,070
Why do you still look

240
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,510
so proud?

241
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,260
Are you going
to compete with Zuo Sichen again?

242
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,090
Don’t worry.

243
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,940
He gave you the VIP invitation.

244
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,070
I’ll stay as elegant

245
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,670
as a boyfriend should be.

246
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,310
Let’s go, my VIP boyfriend.

247
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,820
By the way,

248
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,660
Zuo Sichen does a great job

249
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,310
in his professional field.

250
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,750
Indeed, he is.

251
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,990
Hello?

252
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,020
Little Luo,

253
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,510
I’ve got breaking news

254
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,310
to share with you immediately!

255
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,630
I’ll go answer the phone.

256
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,540
I’ll enjoy the paintings first.

257
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,660
Wait for me.

258
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,690
[Good Time for Love]

259
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,510
Good Time for Love.

260
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,540
All the past is prologue.

261
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,100
In our eyes are all paintings.

262
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,580
Sounds literary.

263
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,460
Trampoline gym?

264
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,990
Orange tree?

265
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,430
Fields at Grandma’s?

266
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,590
this resembles to our childhood right?

267
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,920
Power failure?

268
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,420
Xingxing, I’m glad you found this place

269
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,790
and you found me.

270
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,270
To me, the graduation exhibition is a way

271
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,700
to look back on the youth.

272
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,670
In my youth,

273
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,670
you played a significant role.

274
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,030
In this painting are you and me
who grew up together.

275
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,340
In my heart

276
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,390
are you and me in the past and future.

277
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,100
I know

278
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,990
you always treat me as a childhood buddy

279
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,190
and a friend of yours.

280
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,700
But I also want to tell you.

281
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,270
I like you, Ye Weimian.

282
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
I like you.

283
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,460
Be with him! Be with him!

284
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,870
I’m sorry, Zuo Sichen.

285
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,090
It doesn’t matter.

286
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,460
I imagined this kind of ending.

287
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,420
I just thought I could have some hope.

288
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,210
So...

289
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,100
I’m sorry

290
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,810
to have embarrassed you.

291
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,150
Thank you for liking me.

292
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,150
But...

293
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
I...

294
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,410
I really...

295
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,000
Why is the light off?

296
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,220
Leave with me.

297
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,430
Where’s she?

298
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,590
Where’s she?

299
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,150
Where’s the girl?

300
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,220
Where has she gone?

301
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,280
Where has she gone?

302
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,630
Yanluo,

303
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,220
I... I have something to tell you.

304
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,510
I never expected him to confess to me.

305
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,100
I never expected him to like me, either.

306
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,750
Listen.

307
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,670
I always treated Zuo Sichen

308
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,060
as a young boy.

309
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,180
I didn’t realize we had grown up

310
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,100
and we needed to keep a distance.

311
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,220
I even went angry with you about him.

312
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,990
Unexpectedly...

313
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,870
Anyway, what happened today

314
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,910
is totally my fault.

315
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,630
Punish me as you wish.

316
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,060
I won’t fight back

317
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,510
or talk back.

318
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,420
I’m sorry.

319
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,800
You don’t need to say sorry.

320
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,940
It’s your luck to be adored,

321
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,790
not your problem.

322
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,460
Besides,

323
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,030
I trust you.

324
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,750
Thank you.

325
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,700
Why do you still

326
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,900
look so unhappy?

327
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,540
I don’t. I’m thinking about something.

328
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,940
Are you going to have a fight
with Zuo Sichen?

329
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,870
No way. You’ll be disgraced.

330
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,380
Zuo Sichen is more famous

331
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,500
and more popular than me.

332
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,750
I remember you said that

333
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,350
when you were with me,

334
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,270
you felt like carrying a searchlight.

335
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,600
If I were a searchlight,

336
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,670
Zuo Sichen would be a microscope.

337
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,790
If people pay attention to you,

338
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,580
I’m afraid

339
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,740
they’ll find out your identity.

340
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,210
You’re right.

341
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,510
It’s my fault.

342
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,690
Don’t worry. I’m with you.

343
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,390
I’ll always protect you.

344
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,580
Since I became your girlfriend,

345
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,750
no matter what happened,

346
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,420
you faced it with me.

347
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,330
