1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,110
Make My Heart Smile

3
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,100
Episode 4
Experience the life of being my girlfriend?

4
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,260
Which one would you like?
I’ll buy it for you.

5
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,090
All right?

6
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,990
I want the same one.

7
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,740
Do you always wear shirts

8
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,560
simply because you look bad in other styles?

9
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,590
I’ve never heard of this before.

10
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,420
Don’t brag.

11
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,120
This one looks good.

12
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,020
But you may look like a vulgar tycoon.

13
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,150
A macho boss?

14
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,450
This style decides
whether you’re caring or sissy.

15
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,420
A gentle young man?

16
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,380
I don’t believe

17
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,050
even the beggar’s clothes
can’t cover your charming face.

18
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:23,910
Here.

19
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,590
Oh, my God.

20
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,750
A bad man isn’t horrible,

21
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,620
but a handsome bad man is.

22
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,380
I want the same shirt as mine.

23
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,870
What a waste of your fit body!

24
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,790
Hello, this shirt is of the same style.

25
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,120
The size suits you, too.

26
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,010
All right. We’ll take it.

27
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,150
I’ll go pay for it.

28
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,540
Bill, please.

29
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,510
629? So expensive?

30
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,510
Wait a second!

31
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Prince Charming.

32
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,950
Don’t stick to a simple dressing style.

33
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,610
Shall we try some other shops?

34
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,080
But I’m used to shirts.

35
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,540
You’re such a handsome man

36
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,870
with a perfect face.

37
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,660
Why don’t you try another style?

38
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,520
Speak  clearly!

39
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,960
I don’t have enough money.

40
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,500
I know a shop

41
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,870
whose style suits you greatly.

42
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,930
Let’s go have a try.

43
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,920
If you do what I ask you,

44
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,280
I’ll not blame you for the shirt thing.

45
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,190
Let’s have a try first.

46
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,260
If you don’t like that, let’s negotiate.

47
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
What do you think?

48
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,500
Silence means a yes.

49
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,990
Wait a second.

50
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,310
Excuse me,

51
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,580
do you have pins or tacks?

52
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,030
No, we don’t.

53
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,930
That sunflower looks adorable.

54
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,250
May I...?

55
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,710
Thank you, Miss.

56
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,940
Put your arm down. Aren’t you tired?

57
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,100
What?

58
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,820
I can’t have you hold your arm all the time.

59
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,659
Don’t move.

60
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,890
You pricked me on purpose?

61
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,140
Why do you always think the worst of me?

62
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,430
Be more optimistic!

63
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,430
Done.

64
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,990
Let’s go.

65
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,150
Zhenhan,

66
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:53,090
shall we go to the English corner tonight?

67
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,260
Why hasn’t she replied yet?

68
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,220
This is a great T-shirt.

69
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,580
I’ll take another look.

70
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,430
Fine. Welcome back.

71
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,990
Okay.

72
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,910
This one looks great.

73
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,820
It makes you look close to life.

74
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,020
You want me to wear this?

75
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,710
Yeah.

76
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,380
Try it on.

77
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,570
In your dream!

78
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,430
So, you look handsome

79
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,560
simply with the help of famous brands?

80
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,900
In this, you may no longer look handsome.

81
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,160
How do I look?

82
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,260
You indeed look like average cute boy.

83
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,060
Far more handsome!

84
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,440
I seriously doubt your taste.

85
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,750
Could we trust each other more

86
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,210
and doubt each other less?

87
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,770
That’s the trust you mean?

88
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,539
Your boyfriend looks so cool in this T-shirt!

89
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,140
- He’s not my boyfriend!
- Who’s her boyfriend?

90
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,659
Such a pity to waste his handsome face!

91
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,140
Miss.

92
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,580
Here’s a high flow of customers.

93
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,990
Do you need a shop assistant?

94
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,340
With a model?

95
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Okay. I’ll give you the commission.

96
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
It’s a deal, then!

97
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,220
Who allowed you to make the decision?

98
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,280
Since you’ve come,

99
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,220
why not experience the fun of common life?

100
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,140
Couple T-shirts on sale!

101
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,130

represent the pureness and sweetness of love!

106
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,660
Cool man, would you like one?

107
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,320
I’d like one.

108
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,880
Come on. Pack it up.

- Honey.

112
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,530
- Would you like one?
- Look at the couple T-shirts.

113
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,020
They’re of different styles,
but the same series.

114
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,780
They look good.

115
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,020
You have good taste, Miss.

116
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,950
Look, a cartoon figure on the back.

117
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,070
Lovely, isn’t it?

118
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,650
Everyone looks good in it,

119
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,170
no matter he looks lovely or cool.

120
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,020
Would you like one?

121
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,820
You like this?

122
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,820
- Pack two T-shirts.
- Let’s try them on.

123
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,580
Pack two T-shirts for them.

124
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,310
Welcome.

125
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,770
Come back if you want more!

126
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,870
Here aren’t enough people.

127
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,020
At last I can use

128
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,480
what I learned from Lu Yao!

129
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,310
I’ll do it louder.

130
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,220
One, two, three, start!

131
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,020
Welcome!

132
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,580
Come and help me.

133
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,190
If you agree,

134
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,990
I’ll go have dinner at your home.

135
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,600
Well, whenever I need you,

136
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,710
you must turn up.

137
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,070
It’s a deal, then!

138
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,540
He looks so cool!

139
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,490
So cool!

140
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,460
Go on.

141
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,510
Come and buy one.

142
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,810
Would you like one?

143
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,220
Do you like this one? 50 yuan only.

144
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,870
50?

145
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,160
Would you like one?

146
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,510
It looks good.

147
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,020
- It suits you, Miss.
- How much?

148
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,070
- 50 yuan.
- Come and buy one.

149
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,730
We’d like to have a look. Come.

150
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,760
Come on.

151
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,020
It’s fashion.

152
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,480
Let’s follow the fashion.

153
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,570
We’ve been with each other for years.

154
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,700
- Yeah.
- But we’ve never tried any couple T-shirts.

155
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,630
Look.

156
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,060
- Young couples look so good in it.
- Yes.

157
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,950
The back looks nicer.

158
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,880
Have a look, sir.

159
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,610
Cute, isn’t it?

160
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,060
Looks good.

161
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,300
- Looks nice.
- Young man,

162
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,210
can we wear such T-shirts?

163
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,070
Sure, you can.

164
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,770
Well, I’ll give you 15% off.

165
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,990
Wish you good health and happiness.

166
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,670
Thank you.

167
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,780
- Girl.
- Thank you, girl.

168
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,700
You’re welcome.

169
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,540
Thank you.

170
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,270
You look like a perfect couple.

171
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,270
- You get us wrong.
- I’m not close to her.

172
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,530

we can be a couple?

Another problem in your study of probability?

350
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,820
A problem in my life, I guess.

Is... Is he confessing his love to me?

continual work to do

I checked about him.

490
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,340
Unexpectedly,

491

he’s the school hunk of the main campus.

492

Stay away from him.

511

in our college.

512

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,700
I’ll protect you.

517
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,060
Lu Yao, it’s so nice of you!

518
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
Fine.

519
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,060
But you still need to take classes carefully.

520
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,750
Go.

521
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,270
People are watching you.

522
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,510
Go.

523
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,220
Tell me if you need anything else.

524
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,940
Okay!

525
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:11,990
What?

526
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,770
I have something to tell you.

527
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,140
The third agreement we made.

528
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,340
Do not contact each other on the campus.

529
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,150
Ye Zhenhan,

530
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,410
you look quite strange in different places.

531
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,380
You always break your own rules.

532
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,990
Isn’t it a slap in your face?

533
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,990
You made the agreements, understand?

534
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,820
What a double standard!

535
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,630
We’ll have dinner

536
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,760
with my mother soon.

537
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,060
Let me tell you the rules.

538
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,870
Shall we think more about it?

539
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,270
Ye Zhenhan,

540
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,270
are you going to break your promise?

541
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,580
Gu Yanluo, let me go, all right?

542
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,180
Shall we go

543
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,150
our own ways?

544
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,990
Fine.

545
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,820
If you want it,

546
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,150
give me another 5% interest for installments.

547
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,880
Gu Yanluo, that's daylight robbery!

548
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,540
Don’t always think it works for me.

549
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,300
Turns out it always works for you.

550
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,260
Anyway, I won’t go.

551
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,860
There’s no such thing as free lunch.

552
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,550
You’re indeed a clever

553
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,610
and farsighted straight-A student.

554
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,120
For the sake of Little Luo,

555
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,170
give me Lu Yao’s WeChat number

556
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,310
and phone number.

557
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,860
For her  sake?

558
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,510
No way!

559
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,220
Zhenhan,

560
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,080
have you had breakfast?

561
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,230
Here.

562
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,700
Cupid?

563
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,840
Matchmaker?

564
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,200
Goddess of love?

565
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,460
For the sake that I helped you,

566
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,880
give them to me.

567
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,790
Hey, why did you snatch my breakfast?

568
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,510
Then why are you

569
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,840
pestering our kind and gentle Ye Zhenhan?

570
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,460
Must... Must you know?

571
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,700
Yes.

572
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,050
Here it is. Don’t bother to say thank you.

573
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,940
Why would I thank you?
