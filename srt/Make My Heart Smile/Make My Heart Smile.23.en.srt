[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,110
Make My Heart Smile

3
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,100
Episode 23
I won't be your Achilles' heel.

4
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,579
Ye Zhenhan.

5
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,510
No, I mean Ye Weimian.

6
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,540
Ye Weimian, make it clear.

7
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,380
I'm never a burden to Yanluo.

8
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,950
The future of you and your sister
or Yanluo's reputation,

9
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,079
which will you pick?

10
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,620
Don't bother!

11
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,560
I'll pick it myself.

12
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,950
Yanluo,

13
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,930
it's my own business.

14
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,460
I can handle it.

15
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,460
Your business is mine.

16
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,820
Yanluo,

17
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,530
you'll risk your pride, honor

18
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,100
and even your future

19
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,790
simply for her?

20
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,020
Why do you do this for her?

21
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,070
Many things don't depend on

22
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,100
if it's worth it,

23
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,510
but if I want it.

24
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,380
No matter what happens,

25
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,070
let's face it together.

26
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,710
Ye Weimian, is this what you want?

27
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,590
In people's eyes,

28
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,220
Yanluo used to be perfect and unreachable.

29
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,680
But since you turned up,

30
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,370
he's been criticized, encumbered,
and condemned.

31
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,510
Now he's even risking his future for you!

32
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,820
You don't deserve to be his girlfriend!

33
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
Xia Yuanqing!

34
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,100
That's enough.

35
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,579
You don't know anything.

36
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,170
Don't be self-righteous.

37
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,690
There's nothing in it.

38
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,230
In your eyes,

39
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,140
I may be a girl who always tries to hurt her.

40
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,100
But I hate her,

41
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,910
simply because I like you.

42
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,029
Yanluo, I have never meant

43
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,630
to hurt you.

44
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,990
When you hurt her, you hurt me.

45
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,220
Yeah, in your heart,

46
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,710
my care for you isn't as much
as you care for her.

47
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,990
Don't mind what she said.

48
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,100
Yanluo,

49
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,060
if there's some more trouble,

50
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,380
don't risk your future for me again.

51
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,340
I've carefully thought about

52
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,940
what consequences I would bear.

53
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,380
After changing the list without permission,

54
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,700
I might no longer be the president
of the Students' Union.

55
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,750
But if people know

56
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,100
you took classes for your sister,

57
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,470
you'll have unbearable consequences.

58
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,340
I took classes in the Finance Department
for Zhenhan.

59
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,260
Xia Yuanqing is right.

60
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,380
You shouldn't take
such responsibilities for me.

61
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,659
These things

62
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,930
don't matter to me.

63
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,430
What... What matters?

64
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,190
You.

65
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,940
Luckily, the list was changed.

66
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,100
Lu Yao, thank you for coming

67
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,060
and taking the place of my sister.

68
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,030
You're welcome.

69
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,770
Gu Yanluo asked me to come.

70
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,030
He feared if you showed up together,

71
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,660
people would gossip about you

72
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,380
and even find out what you did.

73
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,070
Little Luo is always rigorous.

74
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,990
As soon as he saw the list,

75
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,520
he asked to me pick Yao here.

76
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,260
What? Can I get extra points

77
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,000
for the boyfriend probation?

78
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,010
You finally did something right.

79
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
People are watching. Behave yourself.

80
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,030
So what?

81
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,400
I just want everyone to know

82
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,680
a popular young man like me

83
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,430
has already got a girlfriend.

84
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,500
Others should stop dreaming!

85
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,000
You stop dreaming!

86
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,980
- I'll pull your hand.
- Zhenhan,

87
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,780
are you still worried?

88
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,100
I still feel uneasy.

89
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,150
Uneasy?

90
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,710
What happened?

91
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,030
Weimian said that
Xia Qingyuan figured out our secret.

92
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,030
What?

93
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,660
I'm fine.

94
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,040
There's some ending work of the forum.

95
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,190
Get back to work.

96
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,760
I'll take you to a place.

97
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,260
Let's go.

98
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,260
It's where you want me to see?

99
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,820
So many DIY works!

100
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,430
There're real masters in ordinary places.

101
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,310
Look at the cup.

102
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,940
It's broken.

103
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,780
But it has a beauty of regret, doesn't it?

104
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,430
And this vase.

105
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,660
What a special pattern!

106
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,660
I love this place!

107
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,870
Would you like to make one?

108
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,870
♫ It's clear after a heavy rain ♫

109
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,900

124
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,020
Thank you

125
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,430
for doing everything for me quietly.

126
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,070
You make me braver

127
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,020
to face everything.

128
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,630
You're so concentrated

129
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,480
on designing the patterns.

130
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,890
This is our featured series.

131
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,280
There's not much time before it's issued.

132
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,100
I must finish the drafts soon.

133
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,950
If I don't have enough time,

134
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,990
you can paint the patterns
with your poor skills,

135
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,780
all right?

136
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,990
Since when did I say no to you?

137
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,270
But wait...

138
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,390
Why don't you have enough time?

139
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,940
I...

140
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,430
We both have our own boyfriend.

141
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,430
You can't always enjoy your love

142
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,030
while I'm busy with working.

143
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,390
After I finish this series,

144
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,020
you can design the new series.

145
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,190
Just make a sweet series about you and Mu Ze.

146
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,700
Forget it.

147
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,660
You and Gu Yanluo make a perfect couple.

148
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,630
Mu Ze and I

149
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,660
make a worst one.

150
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,100
Lu Yao,

151
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,140
Mu Ze turned into a loyal man,

152
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,220
simply for you!

153
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,330
What else do you want?

154
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,630
Don't tease me.

155
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,190
Look who I am.

156
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,630
Oh, I've got something serious to tell you.

157
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,950
You can discuss with Mu Ze

158
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,750
for future promotion.

159
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,890
He has a quick mind.

160
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,950
Ye,

161
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,310
you sound very weird.

162
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,390
Did anything happen?

163
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,430
I...

164
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,680
There's something very important

165
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,580
that I must do it personally.

166
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,240
You can read this book.

167
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,510
Jiuyue...

168
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,010
I...

169
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,080
What's the matter?

170
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,870
I want to give up the quota
for exchange student.

171
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,270
Weimian is having a rise in career and love,

172
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,870
but she's stuck in trouble because of me.

173
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,070
Since we were little,

174
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,270
Weimian's been sacrificing for me.

175
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,060
Everything happened because of me.

176
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,900
I want to do something for her, too.

177
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,190
Do whatever you want
and I'll always support you.

178
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,270
Zhenhan.

179
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,190
Mr. Ma.

180
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,140
What's wrong?

181
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,900
I come to confess something to you.

182
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,460
In fact, I'm not Ye Zhenhan.

183
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm her twin sister Ye Weimian.

184
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,100
Are you kidding me?

185
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,700
You...

186
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,780
You mean you're not Ye Zhenhan?

187
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
But you look the same.

188
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,780
Then what do you come for?

189
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,660
Mr. Ma, well, it's a long story.

190
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,630
I'm a third-year student

191
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,580
of the Fashion Department.

192
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,270
Then I came to the main campus

193
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,390
and made a very big mistake.

194
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,190
I...

195
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,510
Excuse me.

196
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,990
Hello?

197
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,060
Okay.

198
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,460
Okay. Bye.

199
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,950
What a coincidence!

200
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,020
Go to the headmaster's office with me.

201
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,340
Come this way.

202
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,100
I've got everything ready.

203
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,140
The flight tickets are ready, too.

204
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,800
However...

205
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,780
Even though you passed the exam of
the foreign college,

206
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,700
you still need to prepare a lot
for the interview.

207
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,750
You've said that a million times.
Stop nagging!

208
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,870
I won't run away.

209
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,630
You did that many times!

210
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,100
Fatty,

211
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,340
follow him.

212
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,830
Don't move.

213
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,660
Go have some tea around.

214
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,410
I'll say goodbye to my friend.

215
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,340
Go ahead. Go.

216
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,670
Give me the certificate.

217
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,870
Yes, here it is.

218
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,540
[Certificate]

219
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,780
It's the proof of your brilliance.

220
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,710
I'm going, then.

221
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,870
Come back early.

222
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,900
I'll be waiting for you.

223
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,460
Come in.

224
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,220
Sister

225
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,650
Zhenhan?

226
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,270
Headmaster, if you don't need me,

227
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,580
I'll get back to my work.

228
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,540
Go ahead.

229
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
I received

230
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,980
an anonymous report letter.

231
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,940
There's some evidence in it,

232
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,990
together with a flash drive.

233
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,140
I took classes in the Finance Department
for Zhenhan.

234
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,470
Xia Yuanqing is right.

235
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,820
You shouldn't take
such responsibilities for me.

236
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,900
Who's it in the video?

237
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,010
He's there. There.

238
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,780
Little Luo, something's come up!

239
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,270
- Something terrible!
- What's the rush?

240
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,830
Zhenhan, she...

241
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,690
Let me explain.

242
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,780
Ye Zhenhan was summoned by the headmaster.

243
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
I called Yao.

244
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,070
She told me that

245
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,630
Ye Weimian came to confess herself.

246
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,870
Wait for me!

247
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,660
And me!

248
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,050
Be right there.

249
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,580
Lu Yao,

250
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,160
I come to see Xingxing.

251
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,520
I kept calling her, but she didn't answer.

252
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,100
She's not in.

253
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,580
I just want to say goodbye to her.

254
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,390
I'm leaving.

255
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,630
She isn't in.

256
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,310
Before she left,

257
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,140
she said there was something important

258
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,870
that she must do it personally.

259
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,340
It's me.

260
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,460
I took classes in the Finance Department
in my sister's name.

261
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,460
It was also me

262
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,240
who instigated Gu Yanluo to change the list.

263
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,870
They're both innocent.

264
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,110
It's not true, headmaster.

265
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,870
I fell in a coma several months ago.

266
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,190
My sister didn't want me
to fall behind in study

267
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,520
or lose the quota as the exchange student.

268
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,310
Then she took classes for me.

269
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,100
It was my fault.

270
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,020
Headmaster,

271
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,340
Zhenhan was in a coma

272
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,510
and she didn't know anything!

273
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,840
I did everything alone.

274
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,100
No, that's not true!

275
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,260
Headmaster, it was because of me.

276
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,460
All right. Stop.

277
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,540
It means

278
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,460
you admit you pretended to be her?

279
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,430
I'm sorry, headmaster.

280
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,690
I'll accept any punishment.

281
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,390
But my sister Zhenhan and Gu Yanluo...

282
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,600
They're innocent.

283
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,510
We'll figure it out.

284
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,430
We won't wrong anyone innocent,

285
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,510
or ignore anything against school rules.

286
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,700
Come in.

287
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,270
You're just in time.

288
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,950
Gu Yanluo, stay.

289
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,740
The rest of you can leave.

290
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,930
Go back to classes.

291
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,460
Gu Yanluo, look what you've done!

292
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,140
I'm sorry, headmaster.

293
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,200
I made the mistake.

294
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,060
You're the president of the Students' Union,

295
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,390
and an excellent cadre.

296
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,900
Instead of telling us, you helped them.

297
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,800
Do you ever respect school rules?

298
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,150
Headmaster, I did that,

299
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,319
because I knew what they suffered

300
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,880
and I was touched by them

301
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,579
who defended each other.

302
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,099
So, you abused your authority

303
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,720
and played favoritism?

304
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,990
It was my fault.

305
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,060
I'll quit my job and accept any punishment.

306
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,510
Do you think this is over

307
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,700
when you simply quit your job?

308
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,940
I hear

309
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,910
Ye Weimian is your girlfriend.

310
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,940
You made mistakes deliberately for her!

311
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,420
What's wrong with you?

312
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,700
Why did a girl make you lose your mind?

313
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
Yes, you'll graduate next year.

314
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,390
You can quit the job
as the president of the Students' Union.

315
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,670
But don't you care for your future?

316
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,870
Why must you get stuck in such a dilemma

317
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,630
at this important moment?

318
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,510
You make me so disappointed!

319
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,180
Headmaster, sorry to have let you down.

320
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,940
But I still hope

321
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,820
you can show some mercy

322
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,790
in the investigation,

323
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,100
given that they have a reason

324
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,270
and Ye Zhenhan corrected after she woke up.

325
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,100
We know what to do.

326
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,100
But you should also think carefully about it.

327
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,060
Love relationship isn't forbidden in college.

328
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,390
A good relationship

329
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,580
will make the couple better.

330
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,300
You should also

331
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,790
reflect on yourself for this!

332
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,750
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
I shouldn't have left things to luck

334
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,870
and got you in such a dilemma.

335
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,820
Is this what you want?

336
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,700
In people's eyes,

337
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,620
Yanluo used to be perfect and unreachable.

338
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,630
But since you turned up,

339
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,990
he's been criticized, encumbered,
and condemned.

340

Don't only care about your own feelings.

don't bring her so much trouble,

Hello, everybody.

00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,150
I'm Ye Weimian,

442
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,220
from the Fashion Department of Art College.

443
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,270
Art College? What's going on?

444
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,460
Today,

445
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,420
I want to confess a mistake to all of you.

446
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,820
Must we read the self-criticism
in front of everyone

447
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,210
if we make a mistake?

448
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,150
How humiliating!

449
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,820
My twin sister Ye Zhenhan,

450
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,700
is a third-year student

451
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,390
of the Finance Department.

452
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,910
Several months ago,

453
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,620
she fell in a coma because of a car accident.

454
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,780
To maintain her quota
as the exchange student,

455
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,990
I made a wrong decision.

456
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,460
I pretended to be her
and took classes in the Finance Department.

457
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,990
That's Ye Zhenhan?

458
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,170
No, it's her twin sister.

459
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,180
So, here,

460
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,450
I'd like

461
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,270
to say sorry

462
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,670
to all teachers and students

463
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,400
I contacted and deceived.

464
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,460
I will drop out of school willingly

465
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,630
and bear the responsibility for my mistake.

466
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,210
But I earnestly request our school

467
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,550
to forgive my sister Ye Zhenhan

468
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,510
and Gu Yanluo who helped me.

469
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,580
They shouldn't be punished
for my impulsive decision.

470
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,790
Leaders and teachers,

471
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,240
hope you can give them a chance.

472

Thank you.

473
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,630
She sounds poor.

474
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,800
She did that to protect her sister.

475
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,630

00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,340
I trust you so much

508
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,300
that I did that.

509
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,800
Open the door, then.

510
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,060
Open the door!

511
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,510
Leave.

512
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,910
I'll handle my own problem.

513
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,220
You'll no longer

514
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,870
be involved.

515
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,180
Handle it?

516
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,350
You mean dropping out of school?

517
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,510
As your boyfriend,

518
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,040
I don't allow you to do that!

519
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,790
You're

520
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,150
no longer my boyfriend.

521
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,820
I thought carefully about it.

522
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,460
Let's...

523
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,890
Let's break up.

524
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,550
No.

525
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,990
I don't agree!

526
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,570
It doesn't matter.

527
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,870
Two persons are needed in love.

528
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,420
But one person is needed

529
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,100
for breaking up.

530
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,420
Now I'm already at the bottom.

531
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,100
I'd like to suffer alone.

532
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,790
You...

533
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,510
You can have a better choice.

534
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,180
At such an important moment,

535
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,950
I can't help with anything.

536
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,150
Neither can I.

537
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,180
Boys,

538
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,910
the bell rang.

539
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,140
Didn't you hear that?

540
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,510
Go to your class.

541
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,390
Sir, we don't have a class.

542
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,990
You don't?

543
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,060
Then do some self-study.

544
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,770
Ah?

545
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,580
What?

546
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,030
Want me to find you a room for self-study?

547
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,140
Do you mean that?

548
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,630
No, sir. I've finished my self-study.

549
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,490
What about you?

550
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,150
Sir, I never do any self-study.

551
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,990
Fine, fine.

552
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,510
Since you're free,

553
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,550
do me a favor.

554
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,270
I remember you're both
from the Finance Department.

555
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,990
Right?

556
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,780
Contact numbers of two thousand schoolmates

557
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,790
from the Finance Department

558
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,000
need to be upgraded.

559
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,270
Help me sort them out

560
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,170
and upgrade them.

561
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,630
What are you waiting for? Go.

562
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,150
Jiuyue,

563
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,100
I'll leave the job to you.

564
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,220
I don't want it. It's your own job.

565
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,850
Don't. Don't.

566
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,790
Handle it yourself.

567
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,100
- Take care of it.
- I won't...

568
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,430
Take care of it. Hold it.

569
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,940
Good boy.
