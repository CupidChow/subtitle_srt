Don’t have wild desires toward me!

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,680
What happened?

6
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,260
You look angry. Lost the game?

7
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,090
Did you forget our agreement?

8
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,230
Why did you

9
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,020
get close to another man?

10
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,150
Who did I get close to?

11
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,350
Wait,

12
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,870
I only agreed

13
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,460
to pretend to be your girlfriend
in front of your families.

14
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,100
On the campus, we need to keep distance.

15
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,910
Why are you questioning me?

16
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,230
That’s why you told Siwan
we weren’t a real couple?

17
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,260
That was an accident.

18
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,820
She asked me. I couldn’t lie to her.

19
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,020
She asked you,

20
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,260
simply because you were so close

21
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,180
to another man.

22
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,430
You mean

23
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,900
I can’t have any male friends on the campus?

24
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,590
No, you can’t.

25
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,520
Gu Yanluo, it’s an arbitrary item!

26
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,990
You have no right to interfere
with me making friends!

27
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,230
When you’re close to another man
during our agreement,

28
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,820
you’re disturbing its implementation.

29
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,350
Gu Yanluo, don’t go too far!

30
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,220
Siwan promised she wouldn’t tell your mother.

31
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,260
So, except what we agreed in the contract,

32
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,060
don’t bother me anymore.

33

Yanluo.

37
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,320
It’s not time to celebrate yet.

38
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,310
Yanluo, rumors on the forum

39

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,870
Class,

44
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,650
we’ve finished the books.

45
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,910
But I must remind you.

46
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,890
What matters most for sociology?

47
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,940
What matters most

48
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,590
isn’t to learn in classrooms

49
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,470
or compare the data.

50
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,190
What matters most

51
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,780
is survey and practice.

52
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,820
Without survey, you have no right to speak.

53
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,680
Without enough sleep,
you can’t listen carefully.

54
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,970
I’m glad you’re awake.

55
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,190
We just mentioned norms for teachers.

56
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,190
As an old saying goes,

57
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,260
one stands in one place,
but actually thinks of another.

58
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,430
For example,

59
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,190
I’m giving you a class.

60
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,260
But in fact...

61
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,340
3,000 from Yan Jiuyue.

62
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,220
3,500 from Lu Yao.

63
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,940
1,000 from the library.

64
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,590
800 from the supermarket.

65
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,250
1,000 from the food delivery.

66
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,100
It’s still not enough.

67
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,190
Besides medical expenses,

68
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,790
there’re expenses
for checkup, hospitalization, and nursing.

69
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,190
I must try harder.

70
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,820
Oh, let me remind you.

71
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,710
The marks for the last practice class

72
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,710

Gu Yanluo and Ye Zhenhan.

75

When you have time,

78
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,909
you should learn from them carefully

79
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:37,590
and have a look

80
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,630
so that you can improve your ability
of social practice.

He only has a handsome face.

95
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,580
He’s very cold to girls.

96
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,420
He isn’t gentle or romantic.

00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,630
Why did he ask?

105
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,790
Is he suspecting something?

106
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,710
I’m kind of close to her.

107
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,340

We don’t keep in contact lately.

109

110
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,100
Is she in trouble lately?

111
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,990
She’s busy all the time,

112
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,310
and she looks bad.

113
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,190
Oh, that’s why he asked.

114
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,060
I heard she has some family problems.

115
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,910
Maybe she’s tired from work,

116
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,570
because she’s short of money.

117
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,060
I’ll leave you alone, then.

118
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,630

If his room is as messy as a pigsty,

172
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,870
and he wants to embarrass you...

173
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,610
I’m not afraid.

174
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,140
I’ll take actions accordingly.

175
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,390
If he wants to travel in the sea of knowledge

176
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,220
the whole night...

177
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,220
That’s too far.

178
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,140
I’ll then get exposed immediately

179
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,400
and come back to earth.

180
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,710
What are you waiting for?

181
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,580
Horrible!

182
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,540
Will I really die

183
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,990
in the sea of knowledge?

184
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,800
Make yourself at home.

185
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,350
Thank you.

186
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,750
Looks like he won’t embarrass me.

187
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,420
These are housekeeping rules for you.

188
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,150
Keep them in mind and obey them.

189
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,510
So many?

190
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,190
What a crazy man for lists!

191
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,100
Clean rooms completely
at least three times a week.

192
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,750
Wash bowls and chopsticks after meals.

193
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,080
He indeed has a fetish about cleanliness.

194
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,830
Besides,

195
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,730
I’m strict in figure management.

196
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,140
High sugar, salt or oil is forbidden.

197
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,900
Carbohydrates, protein, and fat

198
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,190
should be strictly collocated at 5:3:2.

199
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,190
Is he having meals or ingredient lists?

200
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,550
Any problems?

201
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,430
No.

202
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,220
You’re rich enough to do anything you want.

203
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,270
Go on.

204
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,510
Except the diet,

205
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,020
you must remember my schedule.

206
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,310
I usually get up at six,

207
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,830
jog for twenty minutes,

208
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,020
and have a ten-minute bath.

209
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,510
So, you must get the breakfast ready

210
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,710
before half past six.

211
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,630
Half past six?

212
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,780
But I usually get up at seven...

213
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,440
I often get back home at seven.

214
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,020
You should get dinner ready before that.

215
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,420
If I have it too late, I can hardly digest it.

216
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,670
Not today. I had dinner already.

217
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,830
From eight to eleven p.m.,

218
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,870
I usually study.

219
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,830
Except for singing, running, or jumping,

220
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,140
you’re free to do anything else.

221
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,940
Understand?

222
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,070
Yes.

223
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,580
Other rules are less important.

224
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,080
You can read them alone.

225
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,580
Sure,

226
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,580
young men are getting more delicate.

227
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,110
Narcissism is the hotbed for being dramatic.

228
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,240
By the way...

229
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,270
Come on? He heard my off-screen words?

230
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,090
Remember to put the list up above your bed

231
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,660
to remind yourself.

232
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,100
I never expected Gu Yanluo

233
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,870
to be so different at home.

234
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,070
Feels so good.

235
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,700
So many rules?

236
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,020
No way.

237
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,970
It’s my first day to work.

238
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,360
I must leave him a good impression.

239
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,260
I’ll find some work to do.

240
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,390
Let me have a look.

241
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,700
Your little rabbit has come.

242
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,460
Forget it. It’s so adorable.

243
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,610
What if he’s obsessed with me?

244
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,190
I’ll pick you, then.

245
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,870
Work hard, cute baby!

246
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,750
Courtesy is never to blame.

247
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,090
I’ll get on good relations with him.

248
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,900
Mr. Owner,

249
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,780
would you like some fresh fruits?

250
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,730
No, thanks.

251
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,880
Get to your work. Don’t bother me.

252
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,990
Try some.

253
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,270
So clean.

254
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,750
How can I do my work?

255
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,100
Why isn’t there a pole?

256
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,510
One.

257
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,220
Silly girl.

258
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,920
What happened?

259
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,700
Sorry, but I don’t mean to bother you.

260
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,940
I wanted to fold your clothes.

261
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,150
I didn’t know it could come down automatically.

262
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,420
I didn’t see it.

263
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,000
I’ll keep working.

264
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,170
Diligence can be your advantage.

265
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,550
I’ve got more advantages.

266
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,420
For example, I’m lovely,

267
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,870
I’m optimistic,

268
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,180
and I’m energetic.

269
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,270
I can do all kinds of housework.

270
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,630
Don’t bother about underwear.

271
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,320
Put the rest of clothes

272
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,150
on the sofa.

273
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,540
Fine.

274
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,780
Why is the water cold?

275
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,510
Why is it suddenly so hot?

276
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,670
What the hell!

277
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,700
You... You!

278
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,440
Move inside. Move inside.

279
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:16,900
You!

280
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,510
The heater is broken. I forgot that.

281
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,870
Get out!

282
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,460
[Retarded Him]

283
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,510
Hello?

284
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,800
How was it going?

285
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,790
Was your first day with your girlfriend

286
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,720
romantic enough

287
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,750
or sexy enough?

288
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,060
I can’t help gossiping

289
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,690
about that.

290
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,150
It was chaotic and annoying.

291
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,990
You mean she annoyed you?

292
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,030
Did she flirt with you

293
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,750
with sexy poses?

294
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,700
You have no brain for love at all.

295
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,910
She was hinting you

296
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,240
and giving you a signal.

297
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,150
Signal?

298
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,300
I’m not as clever as you in other things.

299
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,640
But in terms of love,

300
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,210
I’m an encyclopedia.

301
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,940
Trust me, and you’ll no longer be single.

302
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,750
Boring.

303
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,060
Go downstairs right away

304
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,390
and run on the running machine.

305
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,630
You’d better sweat

306
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,370
and take off your clothes,

307
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,740
to show her your original charm.

308
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,500
I assure you that she’ll be shy

309
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,200
and jump into your arms.

310
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,220
I’ll hang up.

311
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,300
Why did I trust his nonsense?

312
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,670
I’m so crazy.

313
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,580
He indeed loves to bare himself!

314
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,520
But his figure is so good...

315
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,300
Putting it on now? Funny.

316
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,750
What?

317
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,620
Nothing.

318
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,150
I just want to ask

319
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,060
if you need anything else.

320
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,180
No.

321
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,940
Great. The day is finally over.

322
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,160
Don’t.

323
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,250
Aye, Your Majesty.

324
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,050
Turning off the light for you.

325
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,550
You!

326
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,840
Wait, my vest...

327
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,130
What happened?

328
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,480
What’s this?

329
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,150
My eyes...

330
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,270
I didn’t do that.

331
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,750
Cute Bean, turn on the light.

332
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,340
Aye, Your Majesty.

333
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,510
Are... Are you alright?

334
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,610
You’re holding it?

335
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,700
You pressed it, not me.

336
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,630
Why do you still ask? Get me up!

337
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,910
How can I get up before you?

338
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,050
You sat on my towel.

339
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,510
Wait a second.

340
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,050
You used your feet?

341
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,700
I have no choice. Get up slowly.

342
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,180
Are... Are you alright?

343
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,460

Are you alright?

357
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,820
I’m sorry. That was an accident.

358

You thought I would harass you?

359

It’s not your fault?

You brought such a thing to my home?

and low-fat yogurt.

Such a complicated breakfast?

It’s the first breakfast.

So, I made more kinds.

I don’t eat white pepper. Don’t use any.

Sit down and have breakfast with me.

Can I?

399
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,910
If I eat more, I’ll have too many calories.

If you’re full, throw it away.

401

I’ll play tennis with a friend
in the afternoon.

After breakfast, pack the sport bag for me.

I’m leaving in eight minutes.

404
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,910
What should I put in the sports bag?

the Debate Club invited us

00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,219
I’m going immediately. All right, Mr. Gu?

517
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,659
Why do you have so many packages?

518
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:42,940
Open them.

519
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,460
Wow!

520
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,620
Hello kitty!

521
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,510
So many toys.

522
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,830
One...

523
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,510
Wow.

524
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,310
These are all from your fans?

525
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,830
Throw them away.

526
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,620
What a pity!

527
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,990
How about I put them

528
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,350
in my own room?

529
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,370

530
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,460
Hello kitty?

531
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,460
Dear Mr. Owner, come and have dinner.

532
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,300
Hello, Jiuyue?

533
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:09,900
No problem.

534
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,310
See you at the hospital at seven.

535
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,650
Tastes too bland.

536
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,930
Didn’t you say
too much salt made you unhealthy?

537
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,000
Let me have a try.

538
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,720
It’s not bland.

539
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,460
Okay, I see.

540
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,890
Try some again.

541
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,510
Leave the dishes after you finish.
I’ll wash them when I’m back.

542
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,310
Wait a second.

543
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,680
The rice is too hard. I want some porridge.

544
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,180
Come on?

545
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,850
You complain after you start dinner?

546
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,850
Fine, I’ll go make some porridge.

547
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,460
Don’t bother.

548
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,590
I can eat this.

549
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,860
That’s soup.

550
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,620
No way!

551
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,510
I made it for a patient.

552
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,180
If you want some, I’ll go make it for you.

553
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,680
You can’t have the soup.

554
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,110
Polish all the shoes in the shoe cabinet.

555
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,860
I’ll wear them tomorrow.

556
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,380
Can you wear so many shoes?
You’re a centipede?

557
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,440
Do what I ask you to!

558
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,380
I’ll polish them after I’m back.

559
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,110
No way.

560
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,420
Today isn’t a day off.

561
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,620
I apply for a day off.

562
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,490
You need to tell me in advance.

563
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,390
Or you must complete your work.

564
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,790
Also,

565
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,080
polish them in front of me.

566
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,940
Are you having too much time?

567
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Supervising me on polishing shoes?

568
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,950
It feels good to sit here.

569
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,760
Look if they’re polished perfectly.

570
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,140
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

571
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,550
Sorry, I’m sorry.

572
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,550
Sorry, I’m sorry.

573
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,750
Sorry, I’m sorry.

574
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,940
Don’t think you can stop the work

575
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,990
in this way.

576
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,630
I’ll go have a bath. You must continue.

577
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,060
He’s having the bath.

578
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,940
Trick me?

579
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,220
I’ll show you

580
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,930
how to make you calm down.

581
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,550
Ye Zhenhan,

582
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,210
go check why there’s no hot water.

583
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,900
Ye Zhenhan!

584
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,590
Are... Are you alright?

585
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,180
Shall I give you some eye drops?

586
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,310
Or shall I

587
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,990
take you to the hospital?

588
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,130
No!

589
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,030
Cute Bean,

590
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,510
who gave you such a cute name?

591
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,900
His Majesty.

592
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,560
He’s so narcissistic.

593
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,610
Do you like him?

594
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,750
Yes, but not about love.

595
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,420
You’re honey-lipped

596
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,750
and very sensible.

597
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,510
Can you sing?

598
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,550
I talk better than I sing.

599
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,350
Tell me.

600
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,890
Who’s the most beautiful girl in the world?

601
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,620
Snow White.

602
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,550
I’ll punch you.

603
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,660
You! Say it again!

604
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,510
You are.

605
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,620
Cute Bean,

606
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,980
you’re the cleverest AI I’ve ever seen.

607
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,860
Cute Bean!

608
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,700
First-level red alert detected.

609
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,070
Survival mode activated.
