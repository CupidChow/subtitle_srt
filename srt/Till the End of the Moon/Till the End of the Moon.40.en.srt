00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫ <i>Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood</i> ♫

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,380
♫ <i>Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light</i> ♫

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,700
♫ <i>Is it bright and warm?</i> ♫

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,100
♫ <i>I can only guess based on intuition</i> ♫

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:47,220
♫ <i>Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck</i> ♫

7
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,700
♫ <i>Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me</i> ♫

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:03,160
♫ <i>I am not afraid of how the world treats me</i> ♫

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,160
♫ <i>Breaking through, struggling to escape</i> ♫

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,580
♫ <i>How to differentiate between good and bad</i> ♫

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:19,240
♫ <i>There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love</i> ♫

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,080
<i>[Episode 40]</i>

16
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,760
Li Susu, pick up your cup.

17
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,550
Do you demons and devils also make toasts to Heaven and Earth?

18
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,530
No.

19
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,400
This cup of wine...

20
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,950
is for all the sins in the world.

21
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,600
This one is for all the death.

22
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,610
Indeed worthy of respect.

23
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,590
This last cup of cross-cupped wine

24
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,600
is to wish us to be together forever.

25
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,650
Spirit-nurtured Female Immortal, today is our wedding day.

26
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,560
Are you dissatisfied with it?

27
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,210
Should I be overjoyed to stay in this dark and sunless hellhole?

28
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,520
That was negligent of me.

29
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,930
Mount Changze has towering terrain,

30
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,000
and this Devil Palace is gloomy and dark.

31
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,840
You would certainly not get used to living here.

32
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,370
However...

33
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,360
it's easy to fix this problem.

34
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,790
It's time to restore this Devil Palace to its former appearance.

35
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,750
<i>Return of the Devil Lord, chaos to Heaven and Earth! Return of the Devil Lord, chaos to Heaven and Earth!</i>

36
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,170
The moment that I became the Devil Lord,

37
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,270
all kinds of karma appeared before my eyes.

38
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,990
I only understood that right and wrong or good and evil are all caused by karma.

39
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,110
As long as the sins in the world do not stop,

40
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,580
the Devil Lord...

41
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,950
will never perish.

42
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,630
Only when the All-in-Distress Path is opened,

43
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,580
the world is in chaos,

44
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,770
and all living beings

45
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,960
can truly return to where they belong.

46
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,510
What's that?

47
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,820
- It's the Devil Palace! It's in the air!
- What?

48
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,600
- Hurry up, everybody.
- Yes.
- Okay.

49
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
- Yes.
- Let's go.

50
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,970
Hurry.

51
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,700
My wife,

52
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,920
are you satisfied with the gift I have given you?

53
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,480
It seems that the Four Continents and Three Realms all belong to you now.

54
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,230
Exactly.

55
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,700
When the All-in-Distress Path completely swallows the world,

56
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,940
the Four Continents and Three Realms will all belong to me.

57
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:26,820
And you will be my caged bird in this life,

58
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,580
and the most interesting decoration in this Devil Palace.

59
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,970
Indeed, you gave me a generous gift.

60
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,870
I should give you a big gift in return.

61
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,720
Chongyu Harp.

62
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,560
Li Susu, you should know that with your current spiritual cultivation,

63
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
you can't hurt me in the slightest.

64
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,460
Although I can't deal with you,

65
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,150
the Chongyu Harp is a divine instrument with divine power contained in it.

66
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,100
You want to burn the Chongyu Harp and release the divine power?

67
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,630
Yes. It has accompanied me for many years.

68
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,290
When the divine power is exhausted, it's time to say goodbye.

69
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,600
You are quite generous with this.

70
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,610
I won't need to use it anyway.

71
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,040
The Devil Lord is in the air. What's that red light?

72
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,660
It's the Great Self-Sacrifice Array.

73
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,520
Susu initiated the Great Self-Sacrifice Array.

74
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,770
The Great Self-Sacrifice Array?

75
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,120
You know it?

76
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,410
Li Susu, would you rather die

77
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,390
than be my wife?

78
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,710
No, if it's possible, I will take you to die with me.

79
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,900
Senior Brother Gongye, what should we do?

80
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,270
Li Susu has trapped the Devil Lord. It's a great time for us to start the array.

81
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,340
Susu can't escape from the array.

82
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,440
Today, all sects are throwing caution to the wind

83
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,020
in order to eliminate devils at all costs, not to save Li Susu.

84
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,440
Fine, what a statement to take me to die with you.

85
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,560
Li Susu, you should indeed hate me,

86
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,990
but you should hate yourself more.

87
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,770
If you could have awakened earlier that love to me was nothing but a delusion.

88
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,100
How could the Four Continents and Three Realms become like this today?

89
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,140
- Yes.
- All immortal sects,

90
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,740
- It was too foolish of me.
- follow my orders! Get in formation!

91
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,600
<i>- Yes!</i>
- It was my vain attempt to lead you into the light

92
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,200
that brought such heavy darkness to the Three Realms.

93
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,450
Now I can only make up for it with my life

94
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,040
and try my best to remedy it.

95
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,390
Even if you start the Great Self-Sacrifice Array, you cannot kill me.

96
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,920
Whatever you do will be in vain.

97
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,880
Back then, the twelve gods sacrificed themselves.

98
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,500
Although they failed to kill the Devil Lord in one fell swoop, they severely injured him.

99
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,420
Only then did the God of War execute the devils and purify the Three Realms.

100
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,480
I am a disciple of Hengyang Sect and the daughter of Qu Xuanzi.

101
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,890
Sacrificing my life to eliminate the devil is my duty.

102
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,810
Even if I die today, my fellow immortals

103
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,740
will do the same until you are killed someday.

104
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,870
Tantai Jin, farewell forever.

105
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,800
Go, stop them.

106
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,850
Guard the array!

107
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,850
<i>Looks like everything has started.</i>

108
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,770
<i>Please, hurry up!</i>

109
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,220
Li Susu, your fellow immortals are all here.

110
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,790
Since you are so persistent,

111
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,650
then...

112
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,820
I will send you and them to be buried together for the All-in-Distress Path.

113
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,690
Li Susu, come here.

114
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,350
Let's witness the destruction of the immortal sects.

115
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,730
Senior Brother, all sects are ready.

116
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,040
<i>Tantai Jin, today is your date to perish.</i>

117
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,540
Celestial Punishment Array, open!

118
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,470
It's the Celestial Punishment.

119
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,800
Looks like your fellows from the immortal sects

120
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,590
are giving up on you.

121
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,100
As long as the Devil Lord can be killed, I will die for a just cause.

122
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,050
In this Celestial Punishment, there are eighty-one thunderbolts.

123
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,660
Even with my Devil Lord's body,

124
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,010
it is difficult to retreat unscathed.

125
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,200
Abandoning you in exchange for severely injuring me,

126
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,170
your immortal sects are really calculating.

127
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,120
But you? You still want to trap me for them

128
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,990
and perish with me.

129
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,270
Being hit by the Celestial Punishment hurts greatly. I don't want to take it.

130
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,110
Since you are bent on dying,

131
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,420
take it for me.

132
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,620
Tantai Jin!

133
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,400
Li Susu, goodbye.

134
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,600
<i>These eighty-one thunderbolts are what you deserve.</i>

135
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,550
Enjoy them, and regard them as your compensation to me!

136
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,630
What? Tantai Jin escaped!

137
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,100
- What should we do, Sect Leader Gongye?
- Yeah.

138
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,590
Tantai Jin!

139
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,510
Sect Leader Gongye,

140
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,010
you really don't care about details or old feelings when you started the array.

141
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,240
You even have the heart to harm Susu.

142
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,990
As long as we get rid of you, Susu's death is worth it.

143
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,800
<i>Xiaoyao Swordplay, break!</i>

144
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,200
Who are these kids?

145
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,680
<i>We are disciples of Immortal Zhaoyou</i>

146
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,200
<i>in the Xiaoyao Sect!</i>

147
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,000
Gongye Jiwu, with your power,

148
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
you wouldn't have such abilities.

149
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,280
What have you done?

150
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,720
Everything I did...

151
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,270
is just to kill you.

152
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,620
Gongye Jiwu, you used a forbidden spell to absorb the power of your fellow disciples.

153
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,810
Now you have completely changed.

154
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,060
Do you even know who you are now?

155
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,020
So what?

156
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,900
As long as I can kill you,

157
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,900
what's wrong with borrowing a little of their power?

158
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,290
<i>Once he is devilized,</i>

159
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,060
<i>he will be completely beyond salvation.</i>

160
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,960
Gongye Jiwu, stop it.

161
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Gongye Jiwu, you have gone awry.

162
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,250
That was how you treated me, too.

163
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,270
Gongye Jiwu, you shouldn't be like this,

164
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,570
not violent, filthy,

165
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,200
nor twisted.

166
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,830
I will repay...

167
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,820
all my various debts to you.

168
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,410
Gongye Jiwu, don't fall into evilness anymore.

169
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,690
Jiwu, don't let evil thoughts control you.

170
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,770
This is the sin that has accumulated since the beginning of the world,

171
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,720
and also the reason why you want to destroy the Four Continents and Three Realms.

172
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:24,950
I am the Devil Lord. My life and death are connected with you,

173
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,850
as well as my prosperity and decline.

174
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,340
<i>The evil bone has left my body...</i>

175
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,510
<i>and empowered the All-in-Distress Path.</i>

176
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,800
<i>It is only one step away,</i>

177
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,350
<i>just like the great battle between gods and devils.</i>

178
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,060
<i>Run quickly!</i>

179
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,090
<i>Get out of here quickly!</i>

180
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:50,090
<i>Li Susu, hate me from the bottom of your heart.</i>

181
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,350
<i>Tantai Jin, what are you doing?</i>

182
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,110
The God-Slaying Crossbow?

183
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,400
How can we give up without fighting till the end?

184
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,080
Yeah. Our immortal sects lasted 10,000 years.

185
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,100
Today, we'd rather die than retreat in the Barren Abyss!

186
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,990
Everyone, Flying-Sword Formation!

187
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,350
We do need to finish this.

188
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,100
<i>Is this 10,000 years ago</i>

189
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,580
<i>or later?</i>

190
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,900
<i>If it's before the war of gods,</i>

191
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,830
<i>why is there already the Heaven Lake?</i>

192
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
<i>If it's after the war,</i>

193
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,150
<i>why are the celestial pillars still here?</i>

194
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,510
<i>I never knew that there was such a world in my heart.</i>

195
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,400
<i>That's because...</i>

196
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,430
<i>it only exists when you look at it.</i>

197
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,060
<i>Mother.</i>

198
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,480
<i>We've been waiting for you for too long…</i>

199
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,510
<i>Too long…</i>

200
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,310
Li Susu.

201
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,690
Come with me.

202
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,820
Where is this place?

203
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,720
I don't know.

204
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,290
But this is the last place that hasn't been devoured by All-in-Distress Path.

205
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,860
It's going to disappear soon.

206
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,160
Tantai Jin, the reason why it hasn't been devoured

207
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,640
is because it's the place farthest from All-in-Distress Path.

208
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,400
Farthest from the Devil Palace and killing.

209
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,820
Farthest from the devil realm where there's bloodshed.

210
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,810
Li Susu, what are you trying to say?

211
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:49,120
So... in the last moment,

212
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,650
we still have some time to talk.

213
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:58,150
Li Susu, you've broke through the Heartless Path and immortalized.

214
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,380
Now, you're the only god in this world...

215
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,680
and the only one who can kill the Devil Lord.

216
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,740
Do you actually have time to talk with me?

217
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,520
So,

218
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,100
this is what you want.

219
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,690
To let me kill you?

220
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,200
You figured it out.

221
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,370
Yeah, Tantai Jin.

222
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,900
So, you don't have to wear this false shell anymore.

223
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,570
The moment when I broke through the Heartless Path,

224
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,900
I saw every corner of this world

225
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,700
and heard every sound between Heaven and Earth.

226
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,180
I can sense everything in the world,

227
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,490
including your heart.

228
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,610
You've absorbed the power of the Devil Lord,

229
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,270
but you were never controlled by him.

230
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,110
But you still chose to show up in front of me as the Devil Lord.

231
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,480
You forced me to sever my love and desire,

232
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,750
go through tribulations, and achieve nirvana.

233
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,870
You wanted to watch me end all this.

234
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,750
I'm sorry.

235
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,710
This is the only way.

236
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,480
It should also be the end of the Devil Lord.

237
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,220
♫ <i>Take a look at the world that you and I are reluctant to leave</i> ♫

238
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,340
♫ <i>Flip through the fabulous years written in books</i> ♫

239
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,760
♫ <i>Dream in circles the remaining flashy and vivid regret</i> ♫

241
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Tantai Jin,

242
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,740
I wanted to protect you,

243
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,240
but I fooled you time after time.

244
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,890
I wanted to save you,

245
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,940
but I shot six Soul-slaying Spikes

246
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,490
into your heart.

247
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,900
I used to...

248
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,090
wish to live a full life with you...

249
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,930
until we grew old.

250
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,890
But now we can't grow old anyway.

251
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,580
♫ <i>I only wish to exchange this life with eternity</i> ♫

252
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,650
I didn't expect that

253
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,660
the my existence was destined...

254
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,210
for your death.

257

It's fine.

258
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,510
Susu,

259
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,670
this life of mine was full of hardship.

260
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,120
I'll let you end it for me.

261
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,600
♫ <i>My heartlessness ebbed and flowed like seasons</i> ♫

262

♫ <i>I only ask if the world won't change</i> ♫

264
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,360
Let me take you somewhere.

265
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,180
♫ <i>I don't want to change the world, only your heart</i> ♫

266
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,960
♫ <i>The longing never ends</i> ♫

267
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,330
Why do you bring me here?

268
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,410
I just wanted to show you the views here.

269
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,340
This world looks so small.

270
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,710
But what a shame.

271
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,380
Only you and I can see such views.

272
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,240
Yeah. Look.

273
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,650
The mountains are like peas.

274
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,980
The rivers are like lines.

275
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,050
Even the All-in-Distress Path looks just like a tiny speck of stain.

276
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,430
Every living soul is too small to be visible.

277
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,100
This is what the gods see.

278
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,800
The mortals living in it

279
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,080
will never see such scenery

280
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,690
even after exhausting their whole lives.

281
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,600
That's why they can never see through.

282
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,510
That's why they can never break free.

283
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,140
You are different.

284
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,920
You can.

285
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,180
You can save all from disasters.

286
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,030
You can change the fate of the Four Continents and Three Realms.

287
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,910
The purpose of the Devil Lord...

288
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,380
was never uniting the Three Realms.

289
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:02,730
What he truly wanted to do was destroy everything

290
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,480
and let it return to chaos.

291
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,710
Susu, I've connected myself with the All-in-Distress Path.

292
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,320
The All-in-Distress Path and the Devil Lord...

293
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,130
live and die together.

294
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,730
Kill me, and the All-in-Distress Path will be destroyed, too.

295
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,980
The conflicts and fate of the 10,000 years will eventually come to an end.

296
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,740
Tantai Jin,

297
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,630
I still have a lot…

298
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,610
a lot of words…

299
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,910
that I want to say to you.

300
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,980

let it go.

327
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,340
No.

328
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,900
Just this time, let me hold you tight.

329
