Ye Xiwu.

20
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,883
Ye Xiwu.

21
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,743
You're awake.

22
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,973
What?

23
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm thirsty.

24
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,923
Wait for me.

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,493
Come on.

26
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,263
Ye Xiwu.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
From now on, whatever you want,

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,810
just tell me.

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,270
I'll grant your every wish.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,933
Tantai Jin,

31
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,910
marry me.

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,680
I want to be your queen.

33
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,753
Okay.

34
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,543
Okay.

35
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,580
It's like she's possessed after coming back.

36
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,310
We sent men to ask her to go home to pay respects, but she drove them away.

37
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,170
I barely even know her now.

38
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,830
General Ye, I'd like to ask a favor from you.

39
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,660
It's my pleasure, Your Majesty. Please just say it.

40
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,870
I'd like to ask you not to mention this in front of her again.

41
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,800
At least not before our wedding.

42
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
Let no one agitate her.

43
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,660
But Grandma…

44
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,000
Xiwu loves her no less than you.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,390
You can't imagine how sad she is.

46
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,270
Besides, she loved Xiao Lin for years.

47
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,090
But she watched him die.

48
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,210
These things came one after another.

49
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,500
How can she take it?

50
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,000
But whether Father will forgive her or not,

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
she has to come back to meet us.

52
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,490
Last night, Xiwu told me that she wanted to cut all ties with the Ye family.

53
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,190
General Ye, please erase her name from your genealogy book when you return.

54
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,190
Your Majesty, the one she wanted to murder was you.

55
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,260
Why do you still make her queen?

56
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,240
Do you really have no ill feelings?

57
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,160
Now, in this world, only she hasn't abandoned me.

58
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,330
Only she's willing to return to me.

59
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,950
Willing to keep me company.

60
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,290
Willing to love me.

61
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,170
I can ask for nothing more.

62
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,600
Your Majesty, I've calculated.

63
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,460
The 10th of next month will be an auspicious day.

64
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,510
Nonsense.

65
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,530
It's clearly the last day of this month!

66
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,160
How dare you talk nonsense?

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,340
How dare you accuse me of talking nonsense before His Majesty?

68
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,970
What proof have you got?

69
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,380
I derived it from the observation of stars and from the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams.

70
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,950
So what if you derive from that?

71
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,530
I've even looked into the records of history!

72
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,600
Enough. Stop fighting.

73
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
The earlier, the better.

74
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,850
I don't want to keep her waiting.

75
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,510
- Your Majesty, but…
- No buts.

76
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,950
How soon can we complete it?

77
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,370
Your Majesty, three days at most to arrange everything.

78
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,140
It's August 24, three days later.

79
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,930
It's settled then.

83
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,653
<i>Watch it.</i>

84
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,783
<i>Move faster.</i>

85
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,343
<i>Faster.</i>

86
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>Ye Xiwu! Ye Xiwu, come out!</i>

87
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,220
Ye Xiwu! Come out! You!

88
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,800
<i>Ye Xiwu!</i>

89
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,530
<i>Let me go!</i>

90
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,480
<i>Ye Xiwu, you come out to make it clear.</i>

91
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,241
<i>- You left the Ye family when things went wrong.
- Ye Xiwu... </i>

92
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,780
<i>Do you even have a conscience?</i>

93
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,100
<i>- ...don't be soft-hearted.
- Let me go!</i>

94
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,060
<i>- Don't be soft-hearted.
- Ye Xiwu! Come out!</i>

95
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,310
Ye Xiwu! Come out!

96
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,480
Ye Xiwu!

97
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Drag him away.

98
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,320
You! Are you even a human?

99
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,860
Of all juniors, Grandma loved you the most!

100
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,080
Are you still a human?

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,370
Ye Xiwu, you bastard… Ye Xiwu…

102
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,103
Stop.

103
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,440
Sister, what's this all about?

104
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,630
You've been hiding from us since you returned.

105
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,770
What exactly is this for?

106
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,730
Ye Qingyu, you think you can talk to me like this

107
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,240
because you're a general?

108
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,960
If I go talk to Tantai Jin and ask him to relieve you of your post,

109
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,240
do you think he'll listen to me?

110
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,540
You're not Ye Xiwu.

111
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,640
You're nothing like my elder sister.

112
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,620
Perfect. I've officially disowned the Ye family.

113
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,610
Is there anything else?

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,040
and you are my wife.

173
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,260
You don't need to thank me.

174
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,410
I want to give you a gift.

175
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,313
What gift?

176
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,150
World-Alluring Jade.

177
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,323
Ye Xiwu, what are you doing?

178
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,383
Ye Xiwu.

179
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,510
Ye Xiwu…

180
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,400
Why?

181
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,183
Tantai Jin,

182
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,590
my purpose in the first place

183
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,030
was to kill you.

184
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,703
Don't tell me...

185
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,680
that you came back to me just to kill me?

186
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,183
Yes.

187
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,713
So,

188
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,690
all the things you said to me were lies.

189
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,340
♫ <i>Take a look at the world that you and I are reluctant to leave</i> ♫

190
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:21,280

193
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,800
But I still...

194
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,040
♫ <i>To smooth the frivolous face</i> ♫

195
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,160
♫ <i>I was already tired of bidding farewell</i> ♫

196

197
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:53,140
♫ <i>I would send ashes and brightness to the moon</i> ♫

198

Do you?

202
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,010
Tantai Jin, I have never loved you.

Great.

208
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,743
Great.

Tantai Jin.

Dad...

237
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,913
<i>Go.</i>

238
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,010
Eldest Senior Brother,

239
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,070
Dad, my eye hurts.

240
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,370
<i>What happened to your eye?</i>

241
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,360
Daddy, my eye is in so much pain.

242
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,550
It hurts.

243
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,720
<i>Sorry.</i>

244
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,900
<i>I failed.</i>

245
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,140
<i>The energy concealed in this jade may be comparable to that of a god </i>

246
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,790
<i>but making this jade was an evil deed. That is why its users were doomed to end badly.</i>

247
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,940
<i>They will be short-lived and die violently.</i>

248
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,890
<i>Dad, Eldest Senior Brother, and Uncle Zhaoyou,</i>

249
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,370
<i>I have tried my best.</i>

250
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,180
I have tried my best.

251
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,490
I'm truly sorry.

252
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,613
Ye Qingyu, your sister did that out of nowhere.

253
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:29,430
Do you really have no idea?

254
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,720
If I knew, I would've stopped her.

255
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,430
I wonder if His Majesty will blame the Ye family when he wakes up.

256
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,270
<i>Last night, Xiwu told me that</i>

257
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,830
<i>she wanted to cut all ties with the Ye family.</i>

258
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,620
<i>General Ye, please erase her name from your genealogy book</i>

259
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,130
<i>when you return.</i>

260
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,730
That's what she was doing!

261
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,740
Second Elder Sister had planned the assassination long ago,

262
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,570
so that's why she wanted to cut all ties with us. I didn't realize this sooner.

263
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,270
But what is she doing this for?

264
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,160
Is it for Xiao Lin?

265
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,080
I don't know. The news of His Majesty's injury has been blocked

266
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,200
both inside and outside the palace.

267
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,960
I have to go home and inform my father and the others to get prepared.

268
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,480
<i>The incident of Ye Xiwu drugging His Majesty has been glossed over so easily.</i>

269
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,110
<i>She is indeed lucky.</i>

270
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,460
<i>But Tantai Jin clearly knows everything, and still kept her alive.</i>

271
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,783
<i>No,</i>

272
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,440
<i>I can't give Ye Xiwu the chance to tell the truth.</i>

273
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,940
Qingyu, it's so late. Why are you suddenly back?

274
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,240
It's good that you are here, Eldest Sister. Let's go to see Father together.

275
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,750
- Get Eldest Brother here, too.
- Yes.

276
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,410
What?

277
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,240
Xiwu tried to assassin Tantai Jin?

278
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,510
The crime of assassinating the king is punishable by death.

279
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,790
Once the killing order is made, Second Elder Sister will certainly die.

280
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,070
Well, Qingyu, what should we do?

281
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,140
I will try to convince His Majesty

282
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,230
to turn her over to the Three Judicial Departments for questioning before the trial.

283
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,710
<i>What if she tells them about the drugging when she was inquired by the Three Judicial Departments?</i>

284
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,600
Now Second Elder Sister's life is at stake. I came back today to persuade you to leave home to avoid trouble.

285
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,790
Although Second Elder Sister has severed ties with the Ye family,

286
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,440
His Majesty may take his anger on us.

287
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,643
Take his anger on us?

288
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:32,220
So what?

289
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,900
Xiwu is the daughter of the Ye family.

290
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,770
As her father, although I cannot exonerate her,

291
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,680
I can't abandon her at this time.

292
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,210
Father, I…

293
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,400
Life and death are decreed by fate.

294
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,100
This time, I won't escape.

295
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,300
Great General Ye.

296
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,300
Please.

297
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,240
Father, you…

298
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,860
Since you have made up your mind, I will not persuade you.

299
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,510
Please take care of your health, Father.

300
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,183
Eldest Brother, please take care of our family.

301
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,440
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

302
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,100
<i>since you didn't cherish it and signed your own death warrant, don't blame me.</i>

303
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,253
Your Majesty.

304
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:12,283
Your Majesty.

305
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:14,870
Hurry up. His Majesty is awake.

306
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,720
Your Majesty, you are awake.

307
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,920
Get out, all of you!

308
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,613
Yes.

309
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:23,430
- Get out, all of you!
- Yes.

310
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,883
You Majesty.

311
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,750
What did the doctor say?

312
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,200
He said he had never seen such a strange concealed weapon before.

313
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,893
It grows in the veins of your heart within a moment and...

314
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,860
it cannot be removed by external force.

315
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,633
Really?

316
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,270
It's fine to keep it in my body.

317
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,120
But, Your Majesty, these nails growing in the flesh will be extremely painful.

318
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,070
Then let it be painful.

319
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,943
Your Majesty.

320
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,590
How long will I live?

321
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,100
As long as Your Majesty recuperates well,

322
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,410
you will definitely get better.

323
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,060
Nian Baiyu.

324
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,400
You are not good at lying.

325
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,840
The doctor said

326
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,200
Your Majesty's heart is damaged.

327
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Even if you recuperate well,

328
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,490
you will not live more than three years.

329
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,063
So long.

330
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:21,570
It's really unbearable.

331
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,930
- Where is Ye Xiwu?
- She's in the dungeon.

332
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:35,360
The jailer came to report that from yesterday to now,

333
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,710
she did not eat nor drink.

334
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,150
Dress for me.

335
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,010
But, Your Majesty, your injuries are still fresh.

336
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,943
Dress for me.

337
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,113
Yes.

338
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,150
<i>Because I like you, all right?</i>

339
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,610
<i> Love lingers even after only being married for a day.</i>

340
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,980
<i>Saving you is what I am supposed to do, huh?</i>

341
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,980
<i>So you've been lying to me since then.</i>

342
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,210
<i>What is love exactly?</i>

343
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,630
<i> Love is... Love is you don't want him to die. You want to stay with him.</i>

344
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,690
<i>You will be worried if you don't see him. You will be happy if you do.</i>

345
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,050
<i>Everything was fake.</i>

346
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,380
<i>Everything was my wishful thinking.</i>

347
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,110
<i>I was blind</i>

348
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,640
<i>to fall in love with you!</i>

349
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,143
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

350
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:05,890
<i>My purpose in the first place was to kill you.</i>

351
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,830
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

352
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:14,130
<i>you are really the most heartless person in the world.</i>

353
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,210
<i>I can barely see.</i>

354
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,230
<i>This is also the backlash of the World-Alluring Jade.</i>

355
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:57,500
Ye Xiwu, do you think I'm stupid and ridiculous?

356
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,110
You are locked in here.

357
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,900
You can only see a beam of light when you look up.

358
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,780
You feel very scared, right?

359
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:13,550
My days and nights...

360
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,810
were all like this.

361
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:20,150
Even when I was embroidering that veil for you,

362
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,980
I was very scared.

363
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,410
When people stay in the dark for a long time,

364
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,920
they always hope to see the light tomorrow.

365
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,800
But once they see it,

366
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,150
they fear that they may lose it at any moment.

367
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,910
It's truly a self-fulfilling prophecy.

368
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,110
Now, in the world, nobody can save me.

369
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,190
Just like what you are in now,

370
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,400
nobody can save you.

371
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,230
Even if no one can save me, I don't regret it.

372
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,013
Tantai Jin, I once naively thought that...

373
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,320
maybe I could be that light in your darkness.

374
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,560
And I could make you a human.

375
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,190
But I was wrong after all.

376
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,100
Some people in darkness

377
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,620
do not deserve light.

378
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,460
Unworthy.

379
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,070
What a word, unworthy!

380
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,850
Ye Xiwu, have a look.

381
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,070
I, Tantai Jin, an idiot.

382
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,900
You used to beat him, scold him, torment him.

383
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,300
and you even wanted to kill him. But even so,

384
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,600
he still can't bear to kill you.

385
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,300
He was even full of joy to marry you as his queen.

386
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,820
He looked forward to joining hands and

387
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,470
growing old with you.

388
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,960
He is extremely stupid.

389
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,430
Until you nailed him with those six nails,

390
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,450
he first came to his senses.

391
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,530
He really has no dignity.

392
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,520
<i>There are no Soul-slaying spikes.</i>

393
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,990
<i>The only chance to change the fate of the Three Realms</i>

394
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,490
<i>was screwed up by me.</i>

395
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,610
<i>There is no point for me to live any longer</i>

396
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,990
<i>except to be humiliated.</i>

397
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,223
Yes.

398
00:39:38,223 --> 00:39:41,260
You have no dignity.

399
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,210
So I hate you.

400
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,290
Shut up!

401
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,410
I've done this to you!

402
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,700
Why don't you kill me immediately?

403
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,420
Do you not have dignity?

404
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,400
Ye Xiwu.

405
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,920
How do you feel, Ye Xiwu?

406
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,800
This heartbreaking feeling is very painful, right?

407
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,660
Let me tell you.

408
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,280
This is not even a fraction of the pain I feel.

409
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,213
Tantai Jin.

410
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,390
Kill me.

411
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,830
Kill me now.

412
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,380
Although it is interesting to toy with you, I'm tired of it.

413
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,623
Kill me, or…

414
00:40:44,623 --> 00:40:45,900
In your dreams.

415
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,080
Did you think I would let you off the hook so easily?

416
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,583
No.

417
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,900
I will keep your alive.

418
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,420
I will take you apart little by little

419
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,240
to have a good look

420
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,000
at what kind of heart you have in there.

421
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,360
Kill me.

422
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,433
Since...

423
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,700
you do not cherish my love,

424
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,170
then you can have a taste of my hatred.

425
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:53,990
<i>[Imperial Prison]</i>

426
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,200
Your Majesty, the doctors are outside.

427
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,570
Send them away.

428
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,183
Your Majesty.

429
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,880
No.

430
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,180
Send them to check if Ye Xiwu is dead in the prison.

431
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,040
If you really hate Second Young Miss so much,

432
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,680
why would you keep her in the palace?

433
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,940
I hate her.

434
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,590
So I won't let her get what she wants.

435
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,360
She wants to run away.

436
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,280
She wants to die.

437
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,060
<i>Kill me.</i>

438
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,000
<i>Kill me now.</i>

439
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,530
So I'll make sure she lives.

440
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,120
<i>I once naively thought that</i>

441
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,820
<i>maybe I could be the light in your darkness,</i>

442
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,760
<i>and I could make you a human.</i>

443
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,080
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

444
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,020
<i>Life is indeed tough, but you still have to live on.</i>

445
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,280
<i>You are not dead and I am not dead.</i>

446
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,090
<i>We both survived.</i>

447
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,290
<i>Your promise me to live on.</i>

448
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,630
<i>I won't let you die.</i>

449
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,710
<i>But I was wrong after all.</i>

450
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,110
<i>Some people in darkness do not deserve light.</i>

451
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,060
<i>Since I'm alive, she has to stay alive, too.</i>

452
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:59,270
<i>Why should I be left alone in such darkness?</i>

453
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,843
Nian Baiyu,

454
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:12,740
summon Ye Qingyu here.

455
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,890
I have things to instruct him.

456
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,413
Understood.

457
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,670
- How is His Majesty?
- How is he?

458
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,120
He's in great pain but has to bear with it.

459
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,220
What about Ye Xiwu?

460
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,350
His Majesty told me that he wouldn't kill her.

461
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,900
She is safe for now.

462
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,550
But the prison gets humid and suffocating with pests everywhere in summer.

463
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,000
If she stays there and refuses to have food or drinks, she won't make it.

464
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,880
This silly girl is determined to die.

465
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,710
Mr. Nian, can I visit her?

466
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,210
Since His Majesty wants her alive,

467
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,693
go ahead.

468
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,290
Thank you for your kindness.

469
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,810
With my little sister in jail, the whole family is worried.

470
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,680
That's why they sent me here. We'll just talk a bit.

471
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,480
It's fine if you're only here to talk.

472
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,580
As long as...

473
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,160
you didn't bring any prohibited items.

474
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,220
Sir, how can a flimsy young lady like me possibly help her break free?

475
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,820
Fine. Come with me.

476
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,120
Ye Bingchang.

477
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,083
Yes, it's me.

478
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,360
Why did you come?

479
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,093
Second Younger Sister,

480
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,930
you've suffered.

481
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,060
Of course, I have to visit you.

482
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,140
You know.

483
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,860
I've always hated you for being so condescending.

484
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:12,760
Since you don't want small talk, let's get down to business.

485
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,650
My sweet younger sister,

486
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,540
I would like to know

487
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,440
if Tantai Jin had tasted that bowl of porridge?

488
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,320
Why didn't he die?

489
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,100
You know the porridge…

490
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,380
That's right. You thought...

491
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,110
you were the only one who added things in there.

492
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,900
What did you put in there?

493
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,033
Dry mylabris.

494
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:46,120
One tiny sip...

495
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,510
is lethal.

496
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,673
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

497
00:47:52,673 --> 00:47:54,703
<i>did you</i>

498
00:47:54,703 --> 00:47:57,740
<i>cook this porridge for me specifically?</i>

499
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:03,460
<i>Tantai Jin thought I wanted to poison him to save Xiao Lin.</i>

500
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,100
Why would you do that?

501
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,910
Xiao Lin was doomed because of that, you know?

502
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,880
Don't mention that name.

503
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,010
You don't deserve it.

504
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,890
You know? I had all my hopes up that day.

505
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:24,150
I thought I would hear about Tantai Jin and that old woman getting poisoned.

506
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:29,610
But it never crossed my mind that Tantai Jin didn't have the porridge.

507
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,700
He didn't die.

508
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:39,340
You killed Grandma, too.

509
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,130
Ye Xiwu, you won't be sad for long.

510
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,590
I will do you a favor

511
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:53,230
and let you get reunited with her in the underworld.

512
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,630
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

513
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,110
<i>Do you want me to eat it?</i>

514
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,983
<i>What's the matter?</i>

515
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,600
<i>I guess I'll have some</i>

516
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,500
<i>if you feed me.</i>

517
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:24,770
<i>From now on, whatever you want,</i>

518
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,900
<i>just tell me.</i>

519
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,040
<i>What are you doing?</i>

520
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,473
Second Elder Sister.

521
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,633
Second Elder Sister.

522
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,720

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:34,980
♫ <i> The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm </i> ♫

526
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:42,900
♫ <i> Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain </i> ♫

527
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,780
♫ <i> Realization is washing away our memories in turbid water and rain </i> ♫

528
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:51,080
♫ <i> We'll never meet again </i> ♫

529
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,040
♫ <i> I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words </i> ♫

530
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,840
♫ <i> Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense </i> ♫

531
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,160
♫ <i> Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof </i> ♫

532
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,180
♫ <i> Embracing the endless lingering fear </i> ♫

533
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,520
♫ <i> I've admired you through the myriad of years </i> ♫

534
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,680
♫ <i> I believed I have been loved for a moment </i> ♫

535
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,200
♫ <i> I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil </i> ♫

536
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:27,860
♫ <i> And become devout like the flawless moonlight </i> ♫

537
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,880
♫ <i> Listen to the breathing of the flowers</i> ♫

538
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,680
♫ <i> and how they are just like any other creature </i> ♫

539
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,840
♫ <i> No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars </i> ♫

540
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,040
♫ <i> The moonlight is my armor </i> ♫

541
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,260
♫ <i> I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars </i> ♫

542
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,380
♫ <i> And willingness to live a life in peace </i> ♫

543
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,100
♫ <i> You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil </i> ♫

544
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:04,140
♫ <i> And learned to love what you used to resent </i> ♫

545
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:11,840
♫ <i> Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky </i> ♫

546
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:20,180
♫ <i> And we'll make it something to remember us by </i> ♫
