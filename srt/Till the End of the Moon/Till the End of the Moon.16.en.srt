00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,380
♫ <i>Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light</i> ♫

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,040
♫ <i>Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition</i> ♫

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,220
♫ <i>Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck</i> ♫

6
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,540
♫ <i>Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me</i> ♫

7
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:03,080
♫ <i>I am not afraid of how the world treats me</i> ♫

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,160
♫ <i>Breaking through, struggling to escape. </i> ♫

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,560

<i>[Episode 16]</i>

15
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,030
Here.

16
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,580
What's wrong?

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,920
Feeling unwell?

18
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,010
Mozhu, if a friend of yours left you and could never make it back,

19
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,530
what would you do?

20
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:07,010
What if he died instead of refusing to come back?

21
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,540
If you have a spare moment today,

22
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,590
could you buy some wine for me from the town?

23
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,180
You have not fully recovered. You can't drink.

24
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,190
It's not what you thought. I want it to commemorate my friends.

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,780
I heard when a mortal's relatives or friends died,

26
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,310
<i>they would evoke the dead with wine to commemorate and console their souls.</i>

27
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,710
<i>Some of my friends, who were very important to me,</i>

28
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,020
<i>passed away before me.</i>

29
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,420
<i>Where do you think mortals will end up after they die?</i>

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,530
<i>Their souls will wander</i>

31
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,640
<i>until they get to the Nether River</i>

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,070
<i>and float down the river to the end of the world.</i>

33
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,440
<i>What about gods?</i>

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,350
<i>Gods have no souls.</i>

35
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,280
<i>When gods fall,</i>

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,560
<i>they'll be completely gone in this world</i>

37
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,900
<i>and can't be seen anywhere.</i>

38
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,570
<i>But when they're remembered, they won't be completely gone.</i>

39
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,400
A new prescription?

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,250
Yes. Maybe this one will work.

41
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,330
If I can't recover, don't force it.

42
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,700
Just let it be.

43
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,590
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,170
Good medicine usually tastes bad. Just take it.

45
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,520
Or what? Never get back your sight and stay here forever for free food?

46
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,260
I don't know where else I can go.

47
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,060
I don't have relatives.

48
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,660
All my friends have died.

49
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,530
My wife…

50
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,760
No.

51
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,650
I have nothing to do with her now.

52
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,470
She hates me.

53
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,070
I'm afraid we won't ever meet again.

54
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,160
How…

55
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,800
How do you feel about her?

56
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,520
<i>I made it clear at the beginning</i>

57
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,220
<i>that we will go our own way. Do not disturb each other.</i>

58
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,270
Mingye, remember to tell me

59
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,740
when you feel any better with your eyes.

60
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,550
Even if you can see a little bit of light.

61
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,250
I have to be prepared.

62
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,220
Prepared for what?

63
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,260
<i>I must get ready</i>

64
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,310
<i>to leave here.</i>

65
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,870
Don't be so nosy.

66
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,970
Just let me know.

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,240
Will you always be living here?

68
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,770
Why do you ask?

69
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,660
Now, in this world, you're my only friend.

70
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,600
May I visit you occasionally?

71
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,580
You can't.

72
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,300
After you get your sight back, I'll leave immediately.

73
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,540
Where will you go?

74
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,790
I don't know yet. It could be anywhere.

75
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,700
I'll just travel around, leading a free and happy life.

76
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,490
<i>If you knew it was me,</i>

77
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,290
<i>I'm afraid you wouldn't want to visit me again.</i>

78
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,750
Be careful on the stairs. Come on.

79
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,940
It is a sunny day!

80
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,980
Sit down and let me comb your hair.

81
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,680
- What?
- Just sit down.

82
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,700
It's the jasmine fragrance I made yesterday.

83
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,590
You're lucky to have some.

84
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,620
What… What's wrong?

85
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,490
♫ <i>Flip through the written fabulous years in books</i> ♫

86
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,180
♫ <i>Dream in circles the remaining flashy and vivid regret</i> ♫

87
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,370
♫ <i>I would rather not wake up and dreams would not vanish</i> ♫

88
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,220
♫ <i>A bond of marriage entwined for thousands of years</i> ♫

89
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,090
I'm fine.

90
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,190
Why are your eyes red?

91
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,490
Nothing. Maybe the fragrance irritates my eyes.

92
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,770
You should have told me. Let me check.

93
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,020
♫ <i>My heartlessness ebbed and flowed like seasons</i> ♫

94
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,180
♫ <i>My affection ebbed and flowed like seasons</i> ♫

95
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,340
♫ <i>I couldn't experience endless sorrows or worries</i> ♫

96
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,640
♫ <i>A fair complexion was not afraid of being soaked in tears</i> ♫

97
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,860
♫ <i>I only wish to exchange this life with eternity</i> ♫

98
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,220
♫ <i>Ingenuine affection is also enough</i> ♫

99
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,170
♫ <i>Sincerity makes flirtation hard</i> ♫

100
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,500
♫ <i>I still believe in the touched feelings that you gave me</i> ♫

101
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,580
Do you feel better?

102
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,960
♫ <i>Although fireworks are short-lived, they are easily enjoyed</i> ♫

103
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,360
♫ <i>But this time, who will be the one</i> ♫

104
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,900
♫ <i>Waiting for a long while?</i> ♫

105
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,080
What?

106
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,470
Nothing.

107
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,270
I thought your eyes recovered.

108
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,160
Don't be too sad. Your eyes will recover.

109
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,890
These herbs are very efficacious.

110
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,840
<i>It turns out that the heaven treats me well.</i>

111
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,470
<i>I thought our paths would not cross again.</i>

112
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,050
<i>I did not expect that I could meet you again.</i>

113
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,190
<i>Sang Jiu, if I don't recover,</i>

114
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,620
<i>can we always stay together in this forest?</i>

115
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,960
<i>When I get the chance to tell Sang Jiu the truth,</i>

116
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,790
<i>I'll take her back to Shangqing God Realm.</i>

117
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,200
<i>I then will think of a way to purify her demonic energy and cleanse her essence.</i>

118
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,620
<i>I almost forgot.</i>

119
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,440
<i>My senior brother is coming in a few days.</i>

120
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,270
<i>I totally forgot my lessons lately.</i>

121
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,050
I've nearly recovered.

122
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,940
How about we switch places?

123
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,080
Come and sleep in the bed.

124
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,600
No way. Your eyes haven't recovered.

125
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,530
Then you come up on the bed.

126
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,150
We can squeeze up.

127
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,780
Don't worry. I'm a good sleeper.

128
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,770
I won't disturb you.

129
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,030
All right. Go to sleep.

130
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,620
Fine.

131
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,270
How come he hasn't got his sight back yet?

132
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,480
Tomorrow, I'll go up the mountain for another kind of herb.

133
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,780
It's said to be very efficacious.

134
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,900
<i>Sang Jiu, don't blame me for lying.</i>

135
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,810
<i>I just want us to stay together like this longer.</i>

136
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,850
<i>Even longer.</i>

137
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,930
Mingye.

138
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,650
Here. Take the decoction before it gets cold.

139
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,440
Open your mouth.

140
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,520
So sweet. Is it honey?

141
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,130
Yes. Because you hate the bitter decoction.

142
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,620
Come over.

143
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,030
You got a bee sting when stealing some honey?

144
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,790
Closer.

145
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,290
Even closer.

146
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,580
All right. It no longer hurts.

147
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,320
<i>Report. Goddess!</i>

148
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,780
In a bamboo forest, we found Lord Immortal's trace!

149
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,570
Come on.

150
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,820
Sit here in the sun.

151
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,510
I'll be back before noon.

152
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,220
I'll bring back some bamboo shoots for soup.

153
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,830
Okay.

154
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,240
Oh. If you're thirsty, the water is on the table in front of you.

155
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,650
There are some leftovers in the kitchen.

156
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,750
If the wind rises, you have to put on your cloak.

157
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,440
Yeah, right beside you.

158
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,930
Okay.

159
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,380
I should go.

160
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,130
Mingye!

161
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,800
What are you doing in this place?

162
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,360
You're safe.

163
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,440
But why didn't you return to Yuqing Palace and let me know you are well?

164
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,080
I was badly wounded.

165
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,940
I retreated here and recuperated for some peace.

166
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,680
I am sorry to keep you worried.

167
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,640
You've recovered, right?

168
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,580
Mingye, how much longer will you stay here?

169
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,900
You go back without me. The scenery here is great.

170
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,130
I want to stay longer.

171
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,110
But you've just recovered. You need someone to take care of you.

172
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,670
- How about I stay here?
- No need.

173
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,790
Someone takes care of me here.

174
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,990
If nothing else, I'm going back for some rest.

175
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,210
I have to tell you an urgent matter

176
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,340
concerning a lot of people.

177
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,010
What is it?

178
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,650
Yesterday, heavenly soldiers reported

179
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,220
they found the Devil Lord's Bone-refining Seal in a valley.

180
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,880
That's why I hurried to you.

181
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,710
If the devil's energy overflows, I'm afraid…

182
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,590
The Bone-refining Seal has great devil energy.

183
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,260
If the land or water is polluted,

184
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,650
the consequences can be catastrophic.

185
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,670
We must not delay a single moment.

186
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,450
Let's go.

187
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,030
You two lead the way.

188
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,750
- Yes.
- Yes.

189
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,640
Hold on a minute.

190
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,910
Here we go.

191
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,440
Mingye, you leave with heavenly soldiers first.

192
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,280
I'll fetch a weapon from Yuqing Palace and then catch up with you.

193
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,900
Fine.

194
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,760
<i>Sang Jiu, I'm hurrying to leave for an urgent matter.</i>

195
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,670
<i>Hearing that a devil artifact appeared, I have to go take care of it immediately.</i>

196
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,060
<i>In one to ten days, I will come back</i>

197
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,810
<i>and explain everything to you.</i>

198
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,390
<i>I am sorry to leave without saying goodbye.</i>

199
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,520
<i>I'll always miss you and think of you.</i>

200
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,350
<i>Mingye.</i>

201
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,740
The Bone-refining Seal is there in the center.

202
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,400
Even this crater was made by the Bone-refining Seal.

203
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,010
After the Devil Lord was gone,

204
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,930
I had our soldiers search everywhere

205
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,280
and finally, they found this devil artifact.

206
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,310
Thank you.

207
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,210
Finding the Bone-refining Seal consumed time and manpower only.

208
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,880
Mingye, your complete disappearance for days

209
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,520
was the matter that exhausted me.

210
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,010
Now, the Devil Lord is dead.

211
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,590
Without a master, the Three Devil Artifacts are less powerful.

212
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,740
But their devil energy still pervades for miles.

213
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,000
If we don't stop it,

214
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,020
I'm afraid soon this place will be a shelter for demons.

215
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,880
My father told me the Bone-refining Seal has the most inscrutable functions

216
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,260
among the Three Devil Artifacts.

217
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,080
It can enhance the devil energy

218
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,610
and also make a seal or barrier.

219
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,480
When the heavenly soldiers were captured,

220
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,400
they were deprived of their divine essence, infused with devil energy,

221
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,100
and then became demons.

222
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,520
I really didn't dare to act rashly.

223
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,030
I had our men guard here until I found you.

224
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,550
<i>Deprived of their divine essence?</i>

225
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,310
<i>Sang Jiu is my only daughter and the princess of the Mo River!</i>

226
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,430
<i>For you, she extracted her divine essence and can never become an immortal!</i>

227
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,670
<i>Now, you think you can move on just by saying thank you?</i>

228
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,480
<i>My demonic energy backlashes.</i>

229
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,740
<i>If it can deprive someone of his divine essence,</i>

230
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,380
<i>maybe it can also help Sang Jiu rebuild her divine essence.</i>

231
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,760
I'll go check it out.

232
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,060
Mingye!

233
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,980
<i>This artifact appears to be evil but is moderate inside.</i>

234
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,180
<i>If the artifact is cleansed without devil energy, maybe it can mend its ways</i>

235
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,550
<i>and it can be put into good use.</i>

236
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,690
<i>The devil energy is temporarily held back.</i>

237
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,160
<i>I have to get it out as soon as possible.</i>

238
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,320
<i>The Bone-Refining Seal has huge devil energy</i>

239
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,030
<i>and has gradually infiltrated into the earth.</i>

240
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,400
<i>Powerful as I am, I still can't easily get it out.</i>

241
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,240
<i>It seems that I can only do this.</i>

242
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,930
<i>Heart-guarding Scale.</i>

243
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,380
<i>This is the hardest scale of a flood dragon like me.</i>

244
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,720
<i>Once the scale is injected with my divine power, it can serve as a shield to temporarily isolate the devil energy in the seal.</i>

245
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,040
Mingye, how did it go?

246
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,230
The seal crashed against the earth here.

247
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,980
They're nearly integrating.

248
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,450
To get the Bone-refining Seal, I had to exchange something.

249
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,500
I then exchanged my Heart-guarding Scale for it.

250
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,910
The Heart-guarding Scale was in your flesh.

251
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,720
How could you just pull it out?

252
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,260
The bodily pain wasn't much of a thing.

253
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,470
My father died in the fight against the Devil Lord.

254
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,310
Now, you sacrificed your Heart-guarding Scale

255
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,270
to exchange the devil artifact to grace this region.

256
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,410
You deserve to be the God of War.

257
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,680
If Father knew about this,

258
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,100
he would be gratified, too.

259
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,990
I conjured heavenly rain.

260
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,750
With the protection of my Heart-guarding Scale,

261
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,850
it won't be long before this place has abundant spiritual energy.

262
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,100
Surrounded by mountains,

263
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,510
there's no light in the valley.

264
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,020
Let's call it Mount Buzhao.
<i> (Buzhao means no sun lights.)</i>

265
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,320
It's quite considerate of you, Mingye.

266
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,850
Father had many subordinates and disciples.

267
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,180
Only you followed in his steps

268
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,380
and knew his wishes best.

269
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,210
So, you would also protect

270
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,640
what my father had protected. Right?

271
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,310
Let's go.

272
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,690
Back to Shangqing God Realm first.

273
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,060
<i>So, this is the Sun Quadripod.</i>

274
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,310
<i>Before the world came into being, the Sun Quadripod's four legs represented four seasons.</i>

275
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,980
<i>The fire in it was the sun.</i>

276
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,330
<i>Burning fiercely.</i>

277
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,040
<i>When Tian Hao was alive, he used it to purify demons.</i>

278
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,200
<i>Unfortunately, it would cost the user's energy and shorten his life.</i>

279
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,650
Since then, it has been sealed here.

280
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,950
Purifying the Bone-refining Seal with the Sun Quadripod would really be perfect.

281
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,840
If it works, the purification can be done in four days and nights.

282
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,020
Then, I can use it to cure Sang Jiu.

283
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,690
<i>In the Sun Quadripod, there are spring, summer, fall, and winter.</i>

284
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,850
<i>The four seasons in the quadripod can purify everything.</i>

285
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,480
<i>When I burn my divine essence,</i>

286
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,850
<i>I can wash the devil energy off the seal.</i>

287
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,650
<i>In the future, nature may take its course and lead to something.</i>

288
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,450
<i>Sang Jiu and I can start all over again.</i>

289
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,500
<i>God of War, Mingye.</i>

290
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,720
<i>You can call me Mingye.</i>

291
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,970
<i>Why don't you try one?</i>

292
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,480
<i>Just try one. It's super sweet.</i>

293
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,980
♫ <i>I want to borrow the setting moon that hangs at the edge of the sky</i> ♫

294
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,920
♫ <i>Suspending the firefly and butterfly until the wind and snow arrive</i> ♫

295
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,270
♫ <i>I want to suspend them at an inappropriate time to forget everything that's occurred</i> ♫

296
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,550
<i>Look at the sword, not me.</i>

297
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,010
<i>Are you willing to try dual-cultivation with me?</i>

298
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,640
<i>What?</i>

299
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:01,840
♫ <i>Otherwise, we will spend ten thousand years like this</i> ♫

300
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,780
♫ <i>Let's stop time before we say farewell</i> ♫

301
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,880
♫ <i>Let the sweetness of your slight smile and the saltiness of my tears</i> ♫

302
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,930
<i>I will die and my soul will be destroyed on this journey.</i>
<i>[Divorce Letter]</i>

303
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,520
<i>Sang Jiu,</i>

304
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,640
<i>I will let you go.</i>

305
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,040
<i>It's better than being alone in Yuqing Palace for the rest of her life.</i>

306
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,760
<i>For so many days,</i>

307
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,130
<i>I dare not to say</i>

308
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,550
<i>or do anything.</i>

309
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,150
<i>I was even afraid to look at you and talk to you for a few moments.</i>

310
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,140
<i>Now, you don't even want to look at me.</i>

311
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,300
<i>Are you planning to use a piece of paper to drive me away?</i>

312
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,370
<i>Have you ever... even a little bit</i>

313
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,100
<i>for even one second,</i>

314
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,140
<i>had any feelings for me?</i>

315
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,970
<i>Never.</i>

316
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,250
<i>Sang Jiu.</i>

317
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,800
<i>Now, the Devil Lord has been killed.</i>

318
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,360
<i>Stability has been achieved in Three Realms.</i>

319
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,750
<i>Heaven grants mercy on me.</i>

320
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,610
<i>I will gradually make it up for...</i>

321
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,760
<i>what I owe you.</i>

322
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,340
<i>Wait for my return.</i>

323
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,570
<i>Even if I have to go all out,</i>

324
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,610
<i>I will purify the Bone-refining Seal</i>

325
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,250
<i>and remove the devil energy from you.</i>

326
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,640
<i>Mingye, how could you try to use the Bone-refining Seal</i>

327
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,290
<i>to cure that clam demon who lost her divine essence?</i>

328
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:42,580
<i>For her, you even take the risk of being possessed to use the Sun Quadripod.</i>

329
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,640
<i>Fine.</i>

330
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,670
Goddess, soldiers have assembled.

331
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,760
Thank you. I lost my parents and made no achievements in battles.

332
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,040
But you still take orders from me,

333
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,780
which scares me.

334
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,080
Don't say that, Goddess.

335
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,720
I and everyone else here followed

336
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,930
your father Tian Hao to settle in Shangqing God Realm.

337
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,870
Though you're young, you're the goddess of flying serpents

338
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,390
and owner of Yuqing Palace.

339
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,960
We don't dare to forget that.

340
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,150
Glad to hear that.

341
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,710
Mingye will have entered a strict meditation retreat for days.

342
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,430
To find the devil artifacts is concerned with people's lives.

343
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,360
It can't be suspended.

344
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,710
I just received the information

345
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,260
the Unionidae Tribe picked up a devil artifact.

346
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,040
Please go with me to search for it.

347
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,550
<i>Yes.</i>

348
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,010
<i>Try to fight with me for Mingye?</i>

349
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,540
<i>Sang Jiu, can you even survive?</i>

350
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,280
<i>Where on earth has Mingye gone?</i>

351
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,060
<i>I've been looking for him in the woods all day.</i>

352
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,300
<i>Without his vision, he couldn't have gone too far.</i>

353
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,650
<i>Did somebody take him?</i>

354
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,990
By order of Lord Immortal, you shall kill the clam demon on sight.

355
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,320
Search the place.

356
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,920
Yes.

357
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,570
<i>It's Tian Huan.</i>

358
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,600
<i>Mingye has already returned to the Shangqing God Realm.</i>

359
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,730
<i>Kill me on sight?</i>

360
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,780
<i>Mingye, is that you trying to kill me?</i>

361
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,490
Goddess Tian Huan, there's nobody here.

362
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,210
Goddess Tian Huan, there's no one outside, either.

363
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,140
Report, there's no trace of the clam demon.

364
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,030
Looks like she is one step ahead of me.

365
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,330
She escaped.

366
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,090
What a pity. She can run,

367
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,210
but she can't hide.

368
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,410
Let's go.

369
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,490
<i>No. I need to find out what that was all about.</i>

370
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,930
<i>What happened here?</i>

371
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,870
<i>These are new faces.</i>

372
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,010
Halt.

373
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,650
Who are you and why are you here?

374
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,070
I…

375
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,460
I'm a low-ranking immortal from the Lower Realm.

376
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,860
And I'm here to see Lord Immortal Mingye.

377
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,910
But you don't even have divine essence.

378
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,620
You are not so much an immortal as an imp.

379
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,870
What do you want to see the God of War about?

380
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,950
I have an urgent matter. Would you please get word to him?

381
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,660
Just give this to him…

382
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,580
What is this bead?

383
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,080
I'm not passing it on to the God of War.

384
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,000
You should just leave.

385
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,510
I wish I could help you, but the God of War is in a 4-day strict meditation retreat.

386
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,320
He's not taking any visitors.

387
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,970
A strict meditation retreat? Why?

388
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,810
Is he not feeling well?

389
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,480
It's an important matter about the Four Continents and Three Realms.

390
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,100
He carries the peace of the world on his shoulder.

391
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,440
If something happened to him in the meditation retreat, who could take responsibility?

392
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,860
What has Goddess Tian Huan been up to?

393
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,100
Being on the same page with the God of War,

394
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,480
Goddess Tian Huan is leading the hunt for devil weapons scattered around the universe.

395
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,860
and evil beings roaming the Four Continents and Three Realms.

396
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,090
If any one of you demons is connected to the Devil Lord,

397
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,130
well, you might want to watch your back.

398
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,130
Mm, be careful.

399
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,060
<i>Since Mingye is tied up with his cultivation these days,</i>

400
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,950
<i>I'll just wait for him.</i>

401
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,990
<i>I have to get to the bottom of it all.</i>

402
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,690
Charge.

403
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,900
If you want to hurt my people,

404
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,000
you'll have to go through me first.

405
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,610
How come this river produces troublemakers?

406
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,930
You should ask yourself if you can take me.

407
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,540
Who are you to fight with me?

408
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,330
Go. Protect Father.

409
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,070
Yes.

410
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,410
Seize him.

411
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,790
You old clam demon, with thousands of years of cultivating,

412
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,740
yet you couldn't even take 100 blows dealt from my Fog Silk Brocade.

413
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,480
And you even call yourself a king?

414
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,430
That's funny.

415
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,580
Your son, on the other hand, was a handful.

416
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,000
But he, too, was defeated by me.

417
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,250
Tian Huan, what do you want?

418
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,540
To wipe evil demons off the map.

419
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,480
I am told the Water Tribe of the Mo River

420
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,790
is in cahoots with the Devil Lord and possesses a devil artifact.

421
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,510
Do you know it's a crime punishable by the extermination of a tribe?

422
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:56,110
But if you hand over the devil artifact, only the culprit gets punished.

423
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,960
The rest of you will be off the hook.

424
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,580
Nonsense!

425
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,970
We people in Mo River have always lived in peace and stayed in our own lanes.

426
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,730
How can we collude with the Devil Lord?

427
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,360
Is this the way the Gods of the Shangqing God Realm do things?

428
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,000
Framing people for crimes they didn't commit?

429
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,040
We offer protection to the three realms.

430
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,220
I don't need some lowly demon like you to tell me what to do.

431
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,500
So keep your opinions to yourself.

432
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,770
Why are you doing this to us in Mo River?

433
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,410
Have you forgotten the kindness we once showed you and Mingye?

434
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,320
You're right.

435
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,440
I do not have bad blood with people in Mo River.

436
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,800
Do you think I covet your poverty,

437
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,300
your demonic energy,

438
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,800
or these

439
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,610
crappy pearls of yours?

440
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,560
Goddess, should we run this by the God of War?

441
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,510
What do you mean?

442
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:52,520
Well, he is… he's the son-in-law of the Mo River.

443
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,050
The son-in-law of the Mo River...

444
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:59,760
This bunch of clam demons forced Mingye into marrying that smelly little clam demon.

445
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,490
He doesn't even like her. He had already divorced her.

446
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:07,190
How shameless they are to claim kindship with Mingye?

447
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,770
But... But there's no sign of a devil artifact.

448
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,220
That's because you're stupid to find a devil artifact.

449
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,700
It doesn't mean they aren't the Devil Lord's allies.

450
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,900
What?

451
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,540
Found your conscience after killing so many of the Water Tribe members?

452
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,240
Listen to me. They are in league with the Devil Lord.

453
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,950
We may not have found the weapon, but they fought back, which was suspicious.

454
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,440
Anyway, this demon is cunning.

455
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,620
Our heavenly soldiers fought back in an act of self-defense.

456
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,290
Don't worry. Mingye won't blame me for this.

457
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,520
We do not possess any devil artifacts.

458
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,900
But one thing's for sure. You have your demon.

459
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,400
You're jealous because my daughter married Mingye.

460
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,070
That's why you set her up.

461
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,060
I'm jealous of her?

462
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,010
A flying serpent is born to be a spirit beast.

463
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,000
Why would I, the flying serpent goddess,

464
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,940
be envious of an annoying and unsophisticated clam demon?

465
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,180
Do you know?

466
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,930
When her demonic energy flared up, I pretended to look after her.

467
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:10,450
I added some Ruo Water to the spring.

468
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,230
And I told her that was Essence-Cleansing Spring.

469
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:18,340
That dumb woman took my word for it and soaked in the water despite the pain.

470
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,530
Tian Huan, how could you be so vicious?

471
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,490
Whatever you do will come back to you.

472
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,250
Old clam demon, you and your Water Tribe will be wiped out today.

473
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,310
All thanks to your good daughter.

474
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,440
Getting involved with my Mingye,

475
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,730
she's bitten off more than she can chew.

476
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,000
<i>Sang Jiu, this is what you get for being against me.</i>

477
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,780
<i>By order of Lord Immortal, you shall kill the clam demon on sight.</i>

478
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,750
<i>Search the place.</i>

479
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,280
<i>Yes.</i>

480
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,080
<i>Why isn't this Image Reflection Pearl working anymore?</i>

481
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,590
<i>It runs on Senior Brother's demonic power.</i>

482
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,940
<i>Is it possible...</i>

483
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,120
<i>Did something happen to Senior Brother?</i>

484
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,190
<i>You're still new to demonic cultivation.</i>

485
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,600
<i>Your demonic energy isn't stable yet.</i>

486
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,420
<i>You need to avoid mood swings,</i>

487
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,730
<i>or you could slip into madness.</i>

488
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:34,480
<i>No one else in the Mo River is fairer than you, Princess.</i>

489
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,430
<i>You'll surely marry the right man someday.</i>

490
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:53,640
<i>Oh, you. You have the nerve to say it.</i>

491
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,380
<i>Mingye has divine essence.</i>

492
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,570
<i>And you do, too.</i>

493
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,500
<i>He is the God of War.</i>

494
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,430
<i>But what about you? You follow your brother and me everywhere and do nothing all day.</i>

495
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,980
<i>Have you no shame?</i>

496
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:24,980
<i>Remember, as long as you are sincere,</i>

497
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,380
<i>Gods will be moved.</i>

498
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,540
<i>It will.</i>

499
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,240
<i>All right, it is time for bed.</i>

500
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,500
<i>I'll read you stories tomorrow.</i>

501
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,910
<i>I am told the Water Tribe of the Mo River</i>

502
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,160
<i>is in cahoots with the Devil Lord and possesses a devil artifact.</i>

503
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,680
<i>Do you know it's a crime punishable by the extermination of a tribe?</i>

504
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,020
<i>We do not possess any devil artifacts.</i>

505
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:24,140
<i>But one thing's for sure. You have your demon.</i>

506
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,820
<i>You're jealous because my daughter married Mingye.</i>

507
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,460
<i>That's why you set her up.</i>

508
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,300
<i>I'm jealous of her?</i>

509
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,660
<i>Do you know?</i>

510
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:36,320
<i>When her demonic energy flared up, I pretended to look after her.</i>

511
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,900
<i>I added some Ruo Water to the spring.</i>

512
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,610

<i>Old clam demon, you and your Water Tribe will be wiped out today.</i>

516
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,270
<i>All thanks to your good daughter.</i>

517
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,130
<i>Getting involved with my Mingye,</i>

518
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,330
<i>she's bitten off more than she can chew.</i>

519
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,180
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

520
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,380
I shouldn't have fallen for him.

521
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,550
I shouldn't have saved him

522
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:40,110
and then even married him.

523
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:48,760
It is all because of my big mistake.

524
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,820
I should've known better,

525
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,910
I regretted.

526
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,810
I'm unworthy to be called your daughter

527
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:02,980
or Princess of Mo River.

♫ <i>I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil</i> ♫

542
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:06,360
♫ <i>And become devout like the flawless moonlight</i> ♫

543

♫ <i>Listen to the breathing of the flowers</i> ♫

544

♫ <i>You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil</i> ♫

550
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:43,020
♫ <i>And learned to love what you used to resent</i> ♫

551
