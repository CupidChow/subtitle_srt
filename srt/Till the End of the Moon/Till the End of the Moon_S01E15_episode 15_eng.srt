♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,200
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,820
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:55,740
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:03,200
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,260
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

10
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,660
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,980
♫  There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

12
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,280
♫  My existence  ♫

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,560
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

16
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,660
Mingye.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,750
You can't take it away.

18
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,340
Is that so?

19
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,380
Chuhuang! You should be on my side.

20
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,130
You'd better think it through.

21
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,500
You keep getting in my way. I'm going to skin you alive!

22
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,790
Then bring it on.

23
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,030
In order to buy time and finish sealing the evil bone soon,

24
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,970
Mingye summoned the Venerable Twins.

25
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,520
This may boost his power for a short period of time,

26
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,330
but if we don't seal the evil bone soon, this world will

27
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,820
no longer have a God of War when his divine essence burns out.

28
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,190
 Almost there. I must hang on. 

29
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,650
 I must hang on. 

30
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,290
I can't let them go help the Devil Lord.

31
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,820
Chuhuang. Chuhuang.

32
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,870
I can't hold much longer.

33
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,870
Before the space completely closes,

34
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,920
let's combine our power

35
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,530
to implode the Demon Realm.

36
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,280
But what about you?

37
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,990
No.

38
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,620
Jize.

39
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,740
Being a god in this life,

40
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,890
I've fought against the demons and devils till the end.

41
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,490
Since there's nothing else I can do,

42
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,730
I don't mind falling into the endless abyss

43
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,410
with demons and the Devil Realm.

44
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,260
Jize.

45
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,300
Jize,

46
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,100
you may end your

47
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,140
devil-slaying journey first.

48
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,350
Chuhuang, stop!

♫  Ah, living heartlessly without love!  ♫

54
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,300
Old friends, I am going to leave first.

57

Seal!

♫  There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

59

The gods are trying to trap us here!

62
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Jize sealed the Barren Abyss with his divine essence.

63
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:03,340
♫  My dream and my confusion battled with this burning karma  ♫

64
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,640
Ming Ye, you failed.

65
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,470
The Navagraha Big Dipper Array  can't be activated twice.

66
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,230
Jize is dead. Your divine power is running out.

67
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,340
And I have made it to the Heavenly Pillar!

68
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,360
You can't stop me!

69
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,050
Don't even think about it!

70
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,610
Chuhuang, leave the battlefield now!

71
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,400
Your spirit is draining. Don't force yourself!

72
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,620
You still have time to worry about others?

73
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,830
Mingye, I have used my eye to create the God-Slaying Crossbow.

74
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,230
These devil arrows will shoot whoever I want to kill.

75
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,140
This time, you'll have no chance of survival!

76
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,550
 Once it locks on me, there's no way I can dodge. 

77
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,330
 If I can seal the evil bone with my life, 

78
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,570
 I will... 

79
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,370
 have no regrets. 

80
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,380
 Those devil arrows are too many. 

81
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,170
 This space prison can't withstand them. 

82
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,660
 Mingye, forgive me. 

83
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,910
Chuhuang!

84
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,470

How touching!

89
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,750
How many more companions do you have that can die for you?

90
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,340
 Your sacrifice won't be in vain.

 to die together with the Devil Lord.

A'Jiu, why are you so restless today?

135
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,580
Come.

136
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,350
I don't know why, but I'm quite unsettled.

137
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,470
Immortals are different from demons.

138
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,160
You'd been practicing immortal arts for hundreds of years.

139
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
Now you're a beginner in demonic cultivation.

140
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,870
It's normal that you can't change so soon.

141
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,160
There's no need to hurry.

142
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,990
 Mingye! 

143
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,540
 Jize. 

144
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,230
 Sang Jiu. 

145
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,020
 You must take care of yourself in the future. 

146
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,650
No one can resist me!

147
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,020
Not even you, God of War!

148
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,200
I said I wouldn't kill you, and I won't break my promise.

149
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,670
But I will turn you into a flood dragon devil for me to command.

150
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,400
And I'll let you slaughter the three worlds.

151
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,020
And kill all of your associates!

152
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,880
What a pity. Your wish won't be granted.

153
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,180
I said you couldn't escape.

154
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,300
Activate the array!

155
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,400
Is this all you can do with the gods' skills and celestial power?

156
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,450
Why do you betray me?

157
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,440
You promised me you'd spare her.

158
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,310
Now she's dead.

159
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,750
So you're just as foolish as them!

160
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,370
I will seal you for eternity!

161
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,080
The Devil Lord has finally been killed!

162
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,300
Worth exhausting all of our powers.

163
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,380
 Everything... 

164
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,920
 is over. 

165
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,740
 You stole my evil bone. 

166
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,440
 You used the Celestial Punishment to kill me! 

167
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,740
 I won't have mercy on you! 

168
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,850
 When Heaven and Earth collapse, 

169
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,480
 when the three realms return to chaos, 

170
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,260
 I wonder how your Shangqing Realm will become? 

171
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,050
The God of War has lost his power,

172
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,200
but the Devil Lord is still alive.

173
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,400
Now the Heavenly Pillars are collapsing and all lives are suffering and in misery.

174
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,110
Looks like...

175
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,750
we can only use the last resort.

176
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,780
 All gods return to the ruins to protect Heaven and Earth! 

177
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,410
 Fall! 

178
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,540
 Little Mingye, wake up! 

179
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,610
Everyone,

180
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,690
where is this place?

181
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,630
 Mingye, this is your nirvana realm. 

182
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,920
Have I fallen?

183
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,010
 No. We're going to fall. 

184
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,460
 As your comrades, we're here to say goodbye. 

185
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,270
What?

186
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,720
 Although we part from each other today, 

187
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,240
 one day we shall reunite, 

188
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
 in the form of snow on the mountaintops, 

189
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,110
 or pebbles in streams and willows by the water. 

190
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,770
 We'll leave the holy halberd, Yize, to you. 

191
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,520
 Yize. 

192
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,260
Thank you all.

193
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,240
 I will return. 

194
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,540
What's wrong?

195
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
Nothing.

196
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,260
 Report! 

197
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,590
Your Highness!

198
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,890
Brother, what happened?

199
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,250
Nothing. You stay in the bamboo forest to cultivate.

200
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,420
Don't go anywhere. I'll go back to Mo River to help Father.

201
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay.

202
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,990
Hold on!

203
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,620
Princess.

204
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,680
What's going on?

205
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,160
Well…

206
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Just say it.

207
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,180
Your Highness, news just came.

208
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,130
The gods and devils fought at Mount Changze.

209
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,800
They fought fiercely and neither would give in.

210
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,280
Then what about Mingye?

211
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,060
They fought quite a bloody war.

212
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,610
God of War must have been at the head of his men.

213
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,900
 The gods killed the Devil Lord and his army, but they have all fallen. 

214
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,640
 Mingye, the God of War, and Jize, the God of the Cosmos are both missing. 

215
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,080
 Where is Ming Ye now? 

216
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,580
 Even the war armor can't withstand it. 

217
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,310
 I'm afraid it's going to melt very soon. 

218
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,440
 Goddess Chuhuang. 

219
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,050
 This divine power can connect you and Mingye. 

220
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,630
 As long as you wish, you may see him across time and space. 

221
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,780
 But you can only use it once. 

222
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,710
 Chuhuang, help me. 

223
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,500
 Please send me to find Mingye. 

224
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,090
 Wherever he is, 

225
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,240
 I must bring him back. 

226
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,220
   

227
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,380
 Mingye, where exactly are you? 

228
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,500
♫  I want to borrow the setting moon that hangs at the edge of the sky  ♫

229
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,600
♫  Suspending the firefly and butterfly until the wind and snow arrive  ♫

230
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,000
 Mingye, I'll get you out of here. 

231
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,030
 Just hold on for a little more time. 

232
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,470
 We're going to leave together. 

233
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:47,980
♫  I want to suspend a scene from a dream together with what I owe  ♫

234
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:55,000
♫  Did you know even the wisest soul lightly hesitated before crossing into the territory of their enemy?  ♫

235
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,220
♫  A heart ravaged by love and hate refuses to fly away  ♫

236
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:09,540
♫  Did you know one glance from your hardened heart is like piercing my bone with a sword  ♫

237
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:19,220
♫  If fate is a calamity, I cannot help but want to resolve it  ♫

238
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,310
Mingye,

239
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,900
we're home.

240
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,440
 Report! 

241
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,860
Goddess, we still haven't found him.

242
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,780
How could it be?

243
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,940
So many celestial soldiers

244
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,890
searched the Four Continents and can't find Mingye?

245
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,140
 Mingye is badly injured. 

246
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,290
 Now he's back to his original form. 

247
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,820
 I have to take good care of him. 

248
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,980
 Will he be able to adjust to this place? 

249
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,690
 Oh, right! 

250
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,630
 I think the water of East Sea is salty. 

251
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,350
 Ming Ye, you're such a pain in the neck. 

252
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,440
 You're cuter like this. 

253
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,440
 According to books, these spirit herbs are good nourishment. 

254
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,160
 They can help you recover your human form. 

255
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,190
 Mingye, hurry and return back to your human form. 

256
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,320
 Curling in the shell like a little loach 

257
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,230
 doesn't feel like you at all. 

258
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,700
When you're back to human form, you'll leave. Right?

259
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,640
 You'll never forgive me for doing that to you that day. 

260
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,060
 Mingye, just wake up soon. 

261
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,100
 Don't worry. I won't badger you. 

262
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,610
 I'll leave once you've recovered. 

263
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,940
 We won't owe each other anything. 

264
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,720
 Oh no! I forgot Brother would come. 

265
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,580
Brother!

266
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,480
A'Jiu, you're back.

267
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,300
You went to pick herbs?

268
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,030
Are you feeling unwell?

269
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,980
No.

270
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,540
I've been reading medical books recently

271
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,690
and picked some tonics that are good for cultivation.

272
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,600
 Even if I don't say, 

273
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,590
 A'Jiu will hear about Mingye's death eventually. 

274
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,340
 But she's at a critical time in her cultivation. 

275
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,000
 What if she gets too emotional 

276
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,730
 and becomes a devil? 

277
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,750
 Never mind. 

278
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,730
 Instead of letting her hear about it from others, 

279
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,860
 I'll tell her discreetly. 

280
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,670
- Brother. 
 - A'Jiu.

281
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,400
Have you seen the pot I put on the table?

282
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,270
I saw that the ingredients and salt were already prepared.

283
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,630
So I cooked it in the kitchen for you.

284
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,380
If I was one minute late, I'm afraid you would have become tonic soup.

285
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,650
 A'Jiu, what happened? 

286
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,130
What's going on?

287
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,980
Nothing.

288
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,270
I suddenly remembered there were still ingredients that I didn't put in.

289
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,500
I planned to cook in a few more days.

290
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,080
Brother, let's go out.

291
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,980
Brother, what are you going to teach me today?

292
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,840
I haven't finished talking.

293
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,100
You're improving so fast.

294
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,410
Soon, I won't be qualified to teach you.

295
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,830
Then let me protect you, Brother.

296
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,360
Sure.

297
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,130
It's getting late.

298
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,780
If I leave any later, our father will find out.

299
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,840
I'll come to visit you ten days later.

300
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,280
Brother, now I can learn by myself.

301
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,610
It's a long trip. You don't have to come often.

302
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,080
You're getting independent so soon?

303
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,330
Fine then.

304
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,740
Then let's make it fifteen days. I'll be back to check your training.

305
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,410
 Mingye. 

306
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,680
 Mingye! 

307
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,580
 Have you ever had feelings for me? 

308
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,070
 Never. 

309
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,150
 I've never loved you. 

310
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,590
Oh, Sang Jiu, what were you thinking?

311
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,870
You even saved him.

312
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,720
Now he's transformed back.

313
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,180
When he wakes up and sees me,

314
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,550
he'll think that I'm badgering him again.

315
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,380
Why don't I take him back to Yuqing Palace?

316
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,360
Just leave him at the doorstep?

317
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,830
Forget it. I'll let you stay for a few more days.

318
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,210
When you wake up, you'll leave anyway.

319
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,610
 Why is it so dark? 

320
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,000
 Bed? 

321
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,520
 Did someone save me? 

322
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,810
 It's a human. 

323
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,100
Hey.

324
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,760
Hey. Wake up.

325
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,940
Don't be afraid. I'm not a bad guy.

326
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,760
Did you save me?

327
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,580
Are you there?

328
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,420
Wh… What are you doing?

329
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,980
 His eyeballs don't look injured. 

330
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,000
 Maybe his wounds haven't healed since he just transformed back to human form. 

331
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,580
 Let me take care of him for a little longer. 

332
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,030
That's right. I'm the one who saved you.

333
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,070
Where did you find me?

334
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,100
I…

335
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:40,150
I cast the net to catch fish, and caught a white loach.

336
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,660
I wanted to cook it with tofu, but you turned into a living person.

337
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,860
You even blew up my pot.

338
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,430
I'm sorry. I'll pay for your pot.

339
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,650
What are you doing?

340
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,010
Your wounds haven't healed yet. You're blind and limping.

341
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,070
Where are you going?

342
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,070
 Yeah, where should I go? 

343
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,860
 The Devil Lord is dead, and my soul is empty. 

344
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,890
 I couldn't fall together with them. 

345
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:16,040
 But this world no longer needs Mingye, the God of War 

346
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,340
Little loach, you still don't know, huh?

347
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,900
Now the Devil Lord has been killed.

348
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,700
The world has peace now.

349
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,000
We don't need to hide or run.

350
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,390
Why don't you stay and work for me

351
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,350
as payment for me saving your life?

352
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,210
I don't know how to work.

353
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,720
You can learn.

354
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,020
How about this?

355
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,690
You do odds and ends for me. And I'll help cure your eyes.

356
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,930
I'll let you go when your eyesight recovers.

357
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,580
How's that?

358
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,870
This is obviously a better deal for me.

359
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,480
Why do you have to let me stay?

360
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,290
♫   The more teardrops will fall when looking back   ♫

361
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,370
Because…

362
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,960
Because there's only me here.

363
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,830
I'm too lonely.

364
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:13,220
I just need someone to talk to.

365
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,760
Even if it's someone I don't know.

366
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,600
 Yeah. Now all of my comrades are gone. 

367
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,300
 Even Sang Jiu… 

368
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,570
 I'm also alone, aren't I? 

369
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,740
So?

370
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,580
Okay.

371
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,210
I promise you.

372
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,100
Then you go to bed now. When the day breaks, I'll try to find medicine for your eyes.

373
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,290
Wh… Where are you going?

374
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,710
I only have one bed.

375
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,380
I'll let you, the patient, sleep on it.

376
00:45:55,190 --> 00:46:00,140
By the way, you haven't told me what your name is.

377
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,710
My…

378
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,430
My name is Mozhu.

379
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,940
I'm a bamboo spirit in this forest.

380
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,930
Are you scared?

381
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,140
My name is Mingye.

382
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,450
I used to live in the East Sea.

383
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,550
Thank you for saving me.

384
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,910
 This is the last time. 

385
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,930
 When his eyes recover, we will... 

386
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,960
 never see each other again. 

387
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,300
I've changed your medicine. These are all skin traumas.

388
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,210
They'll recover in a few days.

389
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,940
Thanks.
