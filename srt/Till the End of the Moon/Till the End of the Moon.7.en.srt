- Cheers.
- Cheers, Second Young Master.

18
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,489
What's on your mind? Everyone's celebrating the new year.

19
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,200
You seem spaced out.

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,860
Father, cheers.

21
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,400
- How is it?
- Madam Ye, you can't beat this one.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,910
I'll play this one.

23
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,860
<i>Come on.</i>

24
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,510
<i>Again!</i>

25
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,490
<i>- Are you playing or not?
- Told you not to play it.</i>

26
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,370

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,769
<i>Look at mine.</i>

<i>- Madam Ye
- I can't follow.</i>

29
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,160
Red packages are here!

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,590
Come here.

31
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,400
Be patient. Everyone will get one.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,340
Okay. Here.

33
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,789
- No rush. Yours.
- Grandmother,

34
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,319
- Do I get one?
- This is yours.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,889
- Thank you, Grandmother.
- Take it.

36
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,660
- Yours.
- Thank you, Grandmother.

37
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,780
- Thank you.
- This is yours.

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,490
Here.

39
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:58,267
Grandmother, do I get a red package?

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,259
Take it. It's enough for your whole year's expenses.

41
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,790
Thank you, Grandmother.

42
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,220
You have clung to me since childhood,

43
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,360
playing and jumping in front of me. You were so lively.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,540
In the blink of an eye, my granddaughter has grown up.

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,770
Grandmother.

46
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:40,040
<i>Father. Eldest Senior Brother. Your spirits in heaven don't need to worry about me.</i>

47
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,440
<i>Now I have a grandmother, father, and brothers and sisters.</i>

48
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,910
<i>They are all nice to me.</i>

49
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,020
<i>And I think I can still save Tantai Jin.</i>

50
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,040
<i>I'm living a good life here.</i>

51
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,470
What?

52
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,570
Someone secretly helped Tantai Jin?

53
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,929
I didn't perform my duties well. None of the sent assassins returned.

54
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,419
How the hell did this happen?

55
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,239
Those people are very meticulous in their work, and I… I have no clue.

56
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,560
- Please punish me, Your Majesty.
- You…

57
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,850
You may rise.

58
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

59
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:41,139
I didn't expect for someone to live in seclusion to have such a mysterious force hiding behind him.

60
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,989
For so many years, I didn't even notice a hint.

61
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,990
It seems I really can't let him live.

62
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,670
Your Majesty, do you mean…

63
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,790
Find another chance.

64
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,660
He can't leave this Sheng Kingdom anyway.

65
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,259
Find out the people behind him, and then pull them up by the roots.

66
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,540
Get rid of all of them.

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,030
Come out.

68
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,220
You can transmit sounds with birds, so are you from the Yiyue tribe?

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,260
<i>Your Highness, you must take care of yourself.</i>

70
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,640
<i>Wait for Lan'an to come back.</i>

71
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Your Highness,

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,730
I'm finally back at your side.

73
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,020
Auntie Lan'an.

74
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,319
I failed the Princess's trust.

75
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,340
Your Highness, I failed you. But I didn't lie to you.

76
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,950
I promised you, and now I'm back.

77
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,319
Why did you leave back then?

78
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
And why are you back today?

79
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:29,530
Back then, the King of Jing left us alone in the palace.

80
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,970
But without anyone to rely on in the dangerous palace, it was hard to survive.

81
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,199
I had to take the chance when they dismissed the maids to escape from the palace.

82
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,199
I wanted to return to the Yiyue tribe and have the tribe's help to rescue you.

83
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,340
But there was an accident in the tribe, and the old chief was dead.

84
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,239
The current chief didn't want to offend the Jing Kingdom, so he didn't want to interfere.

85
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,080
And you stayed there.

86
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,110
Your Highness, I don't dare to disappoint the princess.

87
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:06,030
I lived in disgrace, trying to gain a foothold. I even had to marry the chief.

88
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,759
It took me 20 years to become the High Priestess.

89
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,510
Now the whole tribe follows my orders.

90
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,319
Finally, I can bring Moonshadow Guards from thousands of miles away to find you, Your Highness.

91
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,050
I'm back to save you, Your Highness.

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,330
Stand up to talk.

93
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

94
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,230
Your Highness, you've grown up.

95
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,180
Auntie,

96
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,550
I don't remember you having Yiyue's talents.

97
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,440
Who sent the nightingale?

98
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,030
Nian Baiyu, come out.

99
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,300
- Your Highness.
- He is the leader of the Moonshadow Guards.

100
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:32,799
The old chief once saved his father, so the Nian Clan will absolutely be loyal to you.

101
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,989
- You have that talent?
- Yes.

102
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,009
People from the Yiyue tribe can not only control birds but also communicate with their exclusive birds.

103
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:49,060
This nightingale is my exclusive bird.

104
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,779
Your Highness, after what happened in Prince Xuancheng's mansion,

105
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,320
I'm afraid that the King of Sheng has been suspecting you.

106
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,189
These days, Leader Nian and I have dealt with a few waves of assassins sent from the palace.

107
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:04,849
They will surely not give up easily.

108
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,279
I've brought a team of Moonshadow Guards and have a big boat ready at the ferry.

109
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,609
They are enough to escort you and send you back to the Yiyue tribe safely.

110
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:16,300
I never said I wanted to go back.

111
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,639
Are you willing to stay in the Sheng Kingdom and be the hostage prince?

112
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,999
I can't understand. Is there anything here that is worth you lingering over?

113
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,260
The Yiyue tribe is your home.

114
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,740
Only your tribe people care if you have enough food...

115
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,870
or warm clothes,

116
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,060
or if you are happy.

117
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,659
We can shield you from danger, guarding you and protecting your life.

118
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,859
Don't you want to have a life where you are respected and your commands are followed by everyone?

119
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,590
Auntie Lan'an,

120
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,100
tell me.

121
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,690
Shouldn't everyone have...

122
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,080
the feeling of homesickness?

123
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,320
Homesickness…

124
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,760
It is human nature.

125
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,700
Then I will return to the Jing Kingdom to relieve my homesickness.

126
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,339
No matter where you want to go, I will follow you, Your Highness.

127
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,830
When can your boat set sail?

128
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,399
It's anchored off the ferry.

129
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,040
We can get going tomorrow morning.

130
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,570
Okay. Wait for me at the ferry tomorrow.

131
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,810
I have one more thing to deal with.

132
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,320
Yes.

133
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,729
<i>Your Highness, they will surely not give up easily.</i>

134
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:24,159
<i>I've brought a team of Moonshadow Guards and have a big boat ready at the ferry.</i>

135
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,770
<i>They are enough to escort you and send you back to the Yiyue tribe safely.</i>

136
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,740
<i>I never said I wanted to go back.</i>

137
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,740
<i>Now both the King of Sheng and King of Jing want me killed.</i>

138
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:43,730
<i>In this case, even if I return to the Yiyue tribe, I will only bring disaster to my mother's tribe.</i>

139
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,150
<i>Only by returning to Jing Kingdom can I take back everything that should've belonged to me,</i>

140
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,680
<i>and have the strength to protect myself.</i>

141
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,929
<i>He is not my son. He's a monster!</i>

142
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:05,060
<i>Prince Minglang said a hostage prince should never leave the palace.</i>

143
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:14,300
<i>This journey is perilous, I cannot leave with Jing Lan'an with empty hands.</i>

144
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,450
<i>The demon woman hanging out with Ye Qingyu is a perfect supplement for my power.</i>

145
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,110
<i>I'm really going to leave this place which is like...</i>

146
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,390
<i>a prison to me.</i>

147
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,230
<i>But why am I feeling a bit strange?</i>

148
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,789
<i>I just want to check if you are dead. Lest I have to collect your corpse for you.</i>

149
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:50,607
<i>Nice weather today, huh?</i>

150
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,469
<i>You looked good when you smiled just now.</i>

151
00:12:57,469 --> 00:12:59,479
<i>There're so many people in the mansion.</i>

152
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,399
<i>I'm sure someone would like you and want to talk to you.</i>

153
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,740
<i>Ye Xiwu.</i>

154
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,390
- <i>Ye Xiwu! You…</i>
- <i>Be good.</i>

155
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,500
<i>Let's resume studying tomorrow.</i>

156
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,510
<i>Ye Xiwu, let go of me.</i>

157
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,530
<i>Be quiet.</i>

158
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,760
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

159
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,820
<i>after today, we won't see each other anymore.</i>

160
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,730
Are you silly?

161
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,699
It's so cold. Why are you standing outside?

162
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,568
No reason.

163
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,830
Tantai Jin, if you feel bored, you can chat with me.

164
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,550
Why are you standing out here without telling anyone?

165
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,430
Don't do this anymore. You hear me?

166
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,020
Yes.

167
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,020
Luckily, I brought these.

168
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,660
We've bought them, so let's set them off.

169
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,230
I'm not doing it.

170
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,656
Come on, try one.

171
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,230
They are indeed not that great.

172
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,370
I think they are okay.

173
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,980
Let me show you a prettier one.

174
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,000
A Sketch Charm?

175
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,900
It's the New Year. It's worth wasting one.

176
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,550
Go!

177
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,010
So pretty. I'm awesome.

178
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,490
Ye Xiwu,

179
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,180
do you have so much fun every Spring Festival Eve?

180
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,679
This year is not quite the same. But it's still fun.

181
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,619
Don't worry, I will be by your side from now on, and no one will dare to harm you anymore.

182
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:22,500
We can be this happy every year.

183
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,560
<i>As long as I can watch over you and you don't turn into a devil god.</i>

184
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,850
<i>There's no more "from now on".</i>

185
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,730
Tantai Jin, let's have a snowball fight!

186
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,270
Chuntao says they do this every winter.

187
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,209
♫ <i> When your gaze comes a little closer </i> ♫

188
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,749
♫ <i> My heart beats faster taking root in the void</i> ♫

189
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,269
♫ <i> The stars scattered in the sky quietly fall on your brow </i> ♫

190
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:14,709
How dare you sneak-attack me!

191
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,839
♫ <i> As my heart sets its direction, time passes and deepens </i> ♫

192
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,850
Ye Xiwu, I've put up with you for a long time!

193
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:27,989
♫ <i> I want to enter your dreams to explore the spring in your eyes </i> ♫

194
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:31,509
♫ <i> We are devoutly turning the gears of fate </i> ♫

195
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,989
♫ <i> Spending a lifetime just to see one person </i> ♫

196
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:38,789
♫ <i> From the first glance to being immersed in passion </i> ♫

197
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:42,149
♫ <i> I carefully trace the lines of your palm </i> ♫

198
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:45,749
♫ <i> We are devoutly opening the doors to our hearts </i> ♫

199
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:49,229
♫ <i> Wishing to see only one person in this lifetime </i> ♫

200
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,949
♫ <i> Only hoping to be moved </i> ♫

201
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,849
♫ <i> Not afraid to call each other's name </i> ♫

202
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:56,209
♫ <i> The mark on my heart, don't ask whether it's worth it </i> ♫

203
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,350
♫ <i> Just believe that it's the right time </i> ♫

204
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,570
♫ <i> Just believe that it's the right time </i> ♫

205
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,960
<i>Jiang Rao, where are you?</i>

206
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,410
Who is it?

207
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,690
Miss Pianran.

208
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,900
Are you drunk?

209
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,690
Jiang... Jiang Rao,

210
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,320
you are back.

211
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,990
You are back!

212
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,510
Where is Qingyu?

213
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,479
This is the first day of the New Year, but he missed breakfast and now lunch.

214
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,840
What are you waiting for? Go get him here.

215
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,700
Second Young Master went out last night.

216
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,080
What made him leave in such a hurry?

217
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,890
I think he might have gone to meet a girl.

218
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,559
How pretty can she be to make Qingyu so obsessed?

219
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,529
Oh, she must be gorgeous.

220
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:02,850
Even a prude like my brother fell for her.

221
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,389
I heard from Second Young Master's servant that he went somewhere near Orchid Alley.

222
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:11,869
Should we ask Second Young Master back?

223
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,530
Leave him alone.

224
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,549
Qingyu has always been focused on studying and martial arts since young.

225
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:22,689
He is smart and talented, but never good when it comes to romance.

226
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,600
This time,

227
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,980
you can say that the iron tree has finally blossomed.
<i>(Someone unmoved finally showing emotion)</i>

228
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,739
Let alone a pretty girl.

229
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:35,159
Even if she's a widow or demon, I will still accept her as my daughter-in-law.

230
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,150
Father just said that Qingyu didn't come home all night last night.

231
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,760
<i>This demon has some good tricks.</i>

232
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,760
<i>Do you smell something strange?</i>

233
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,950
<i>I can't tell what it is.</i>

234
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,149
I see.

235
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,559
I think Qingyu encountered a demon.

236
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,630
That's why he has that strange smell on him.

237
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,979
<i>When did Ye Xiwu become so smart?</i>

238
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,190
It's not good.

239
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,300
I need to go to Pang Yizhi and have him check Qingyu out.

240
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,120
I'll go, too.

241
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,679
I've been learning to draw charms for a while, so maybe I can help too.

242
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,359
<i>Young Devil Lord is willing to open up and return to good.</i>

243
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,490
<i>He is taking the initiative to help others.</i>

244
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,440
<i>Li Susu, you are achieving remarkable results.</i>

245
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,740
Okay, let's go together.

246
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,260
Miss Pian Ran.

247
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,109
Why are you here?

248
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:05,230
When did you come?

249
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,420
Last night.

250
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,310
Who allowed you to stay the night at my home?

251
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,149
Last night, I wanted to visit you and then leave.

252
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,800
But you were too drunk, and wouldn't let me leave whatsoever.

253
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,000
So did you sit all night on the ground?

254
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,109
Don't worry. I've been sitting here all night.

255
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:29,840
I never had any…

256
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,310
Why didn't you come to bed?

257
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,250
Are you that one-track minded?

258
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,680
Since you are here, have lunch before you leave.

259
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,159
- Okay.
- Look at your hesitant face,

260
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,349
as if I'm going to devour you alive.

261
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,350
You're joking.

262
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,700
I'm not joking.

263
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,850
All right. Since I owe you my life, you can do whatever you want to me.

264
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,620
What did you say?

265
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,250
Three months ago, after the Jia Pass battle,

266
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,840
on Mount Mituo.

267
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,390
We met there.

268
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,500
Am I right?

269
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,940
<i>So similar.</i>

270
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,400
It's you.

271
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,109
I recognized you yesterday at first sight.

272
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:03,360
But I didn't mention the past, not wanting to startle you.

273
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,410
Please forgive me.

274
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,110
Startle me?

275
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,260
Yes.

276
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,910
Ye Qingyu,

277
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,600
do you know what I am?

278
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,630
I do.

279
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,880
I was once a disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect on Mount Buzhao.

280
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,940
I can tell demonic energy.

281
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,150
So you knew I was a demon the moment we met.

282
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,290
Yet you pretended to be nice and walked me home.

283
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,550
I couldn't help myself. Sorry.

284
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,370
What if I don't forgive you?

285
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,390
I'm at your mercy.

286
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,440
That's what you said.

287
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,330
Regretting won't change anything.

288
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,179
To save you that day, it consumed a lot of my cultivation.

289
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:56,150
I want it back with interest today.

290
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,390
Second Young Miss, let's just forget about it.

291
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,349
It's New Year's Day and I've done the divination.

292
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,619
Today is not a good day to catch demons. Not a good day.

293
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,049
Then, what is good to do today?

294
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,300
Weddings, funerals, and family visits.

295
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:23,880
Even sleeping at home by the fireplace and petting cats would be better than going out to catch demons.

296
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,389
That's ignorant of me.

297
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:28,909
Scholar Pang, so this is how your Xiaoyao Sect teaches your disciples?

298
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:33,789
Do you have to tell your fortune before you catch demons to save people, and see if it's a good time?

299
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:35,570
We should hurry up and go.

300
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,559
If we delay any longer, Ye Qingyu would have been swallowed by the demon and nothing will be left.

301
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,889
Exactly. Just cut the crap and go.

302
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:43,890
Wait!

303
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,879
Take this. Take this.

304
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:52,119
Second Young Miss, you have to come back unscathed, or General Ye will rip my head off.

305
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,560
I got you. Let's go.

306
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,440
You'll get a stye from watching this.
<i>(Belief that people get styes for watching indecent things)</i>

307
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:35,490
<i>Is Young Devil Lord learning how to…</i>

308
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,510
What's that?

309
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,600
The spirit of a human.

310
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,910
Hurry up. Is Ye Qingyu going to be drained?

311
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,569
Not so serious. He will only lose some energy.

312
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,999
- Easy for you to say. Wait here.
- Ye Xiwu.

313
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:02,749
Second Young Miss, she's just teasing Ye Qingyu. In fact, she's not hurting him at all.

314
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,360
Qingyu…

315
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,029
Pretty Sister, please calm down and listen to me.

316
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,490
Let my second brother go.

317
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,150
Are you his sister?

318
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,489
Pretty Sister, I have heard some things about demons cultivating.

319
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:33,879
But sucking people's energy is not the righteous way.

320
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:36,599
You should cultivate on your own, and that is the right way.

321
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,980
- Shut up!
- I know there is a sect.

322
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,630
They never discriminate against disciples, whether they are humans or demons.

323
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,160
If you trust me, I can write you a reference letter.

324
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,360
Heptatail Fox Demon!

325
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,390
<i>Young Devil Lord is trying to save others.</i>

326
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,420
<i>This conciliation approach works.</i>

327
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,659
Go after her!

328
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,400
Hurry up!

329
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,830
<i>Ye Qingyu should be fine.</i>

330
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,769
<i>[Hanxuan Restaurant]</i>

331
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,669
I'll set up the array outside. Second Young Miss, please go in and look for her.

332
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:42,660
<i>[Hanxuan Restaurant]</i>
Let's cooperate from inside and outside.

333
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,729
Second Young Miss, I can't move a step, so I have to guard the door.

334
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:02,079
I'll hand you the job of catching her in this sealed building.

335
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,800
It's called the Ten-Thousand Thunder Tactic.

336
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,660
Once you touch it, your cultivation of a hundred years will be wasted.

337
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,560
You won't escape this.

338
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,359
- What the hell?
- Sorry.

339
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:47,930
I can tell, you have a tender heart for women.

340
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,310
You won't do such an unromantic thing.

341
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,330
I can spare your life, but how are you going to repay me?

342
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,070
Sir, you are asking...

343
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,000
while knowing the answer.

344
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,560
Who-Who on earth are you?

345
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,789
<i>Your blood can counter all demons in the world.</i>

346
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:43,170
<i>Go, devour them.</i>

347
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,360
Please spare me.

348
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,490
Please spare me.

349
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,730
Tantai Jin!

350
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,180
When did you learn these demonic arts?

351
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:51,470
Are you really responsible for the incident at Prince Xuancheng's mansion and Chief Wu's death?

352
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,020
You came at a bad time.

353
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,830
You've been lying to me this whole time.

354
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,999
Imperial order of the three divine gods, reveal evil spirits! Bind!

355
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:18,160
Ye Xiwu, you have no mercy toward me!

356
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,110
I merely wanted to enhance my power.

357
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,280
What's wrong with that?

358
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,500
I can't believe you were attacking me for a demon.

359
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,440
You want to escape?

360
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,280
What do you want?

361
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,540
My dear husband,

362
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,210
don't leave!

363
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,280
Don't forget we are a married couple.

364
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:35,000
If you leave, I'll feel sad.

365
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,610
<i>It's a demonic hex from that fox.</i>

366
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:59,490
Ye Xiwu, your life is in my hands this time.

367
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,870
Unexpectedly, things went so smoothly.

368
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,460
His Highness wants to go back to the Jing Kingdom to claim the throne.

369
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,049
Tantai Minglang has always hated the Yiyue tribe.

370
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,850
If he had the throne, the Yiyue tribe would be in danger.

371
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,060
We came all the way to find Tantai Jin.

372
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,840
Luckily, he is willing to join us.

373
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,410
Our hard work paid off.

374
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,619
High Priestess, why didn't you tell His Highness our actual purpose?

375
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:44,050
You don't know Tantai Jin well.

376
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,300
He is cold and aloof by nature, yet he desires care and attention.

377
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,439
The less we display selfishness, the smoother things will go.

378
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:55,770
It's good for both him and us.

379
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,820
But wouldn't that be using him?

380
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:03,169
He has the bloodline of the princess, so I think we should be loyal to him.

381
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:06,060
It's always been hard for the Yiyue tribe to survive.

382
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,700
Now we are doing our best to help him return to his home.

383
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,800
How is that using him?

384
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,390
You are still young.

385
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,650
Things in this world are not all black and white.

386
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,740
Even if you want to be loyal, you don't have to be candid about everything.

387
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,750
As long as we don't hurt him, what's wrong with achieving our goal?

388
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,120
- But…
- Enough. The agreed time is up.

389
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,369
He is still not here. Go check it out.

390
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:38,910
All right.

391
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,760
It's His Highness.

392
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,929
- Nian Baiyu, leading Moonshadow Guards, welcome Your Highness.
<i>-...welcome Your Highness.</i>

393
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,950
You may rise.

394
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,920
Your Highness, who is this?

395
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,130
Ye Xiwu.

396
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,640
Are you taking her with us?

397
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,830
Auntie Lan'an, do you think I shouldn't take her?

398
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:48,610
I don't dare to disobey you. It's just… I heard Second Young Miss Ye throws her weight about everywhere.

399
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,800
She has been disrespectful toward you for a long time.

400
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Your Highness, you are not only returning to claim the throne but to unify the world.

401
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,730
Why don't you kill this woman to boost our courage?

402
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,889
Ye Xiwu is utterly stupid, but her father holds the military power of the Sheng Kingdom.

403
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,500
It won't be late to kill her after I make use of her.

404
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,520
It's wise of you, Your Highness.

405
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,560
Xiwu is your biological sister.

406
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,959
She is now missing because of that demon.

407
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:45,410
You are killing me!

408
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,740
I'm willing to take any punishment for my misdeeds.

409
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,499
But the most important thing right now is Second Sister's safety.

410
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:55,319
That's right, Grandmother. Stop scolding Qingyu. It's urgent to find her.

411
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:01,870
How do you expect me to live if something happens to Xiwu?

412
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,200
Mother, don't be agitated.

413
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,370
<i>General Ye!</i>

414
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,820
General Ye! Scholar Pang had met Ye Xiwu.

415
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,229
General Ye, today, Second Young Miss took me to catch a demon.

416
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,100
It was my fault that I only guarded outside the door.

417
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,189
What did that demon do to Xiwu?

418
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:25,599
That Heptatail Fox Demon only escaped.

419
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,780
When I realized it, I barged into the building to search for her.

420
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,900
Then I found out it was Tantai Jin that took Second Young Miss away.

421
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,329
That's strange. Why did Tantai Jin take Second Sister away?

422
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,940
Zhong Tai!

423
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,100
- Here!
- Go to Chen Xian.

424
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,630
Send Secret Dragon Guards to seal the city gates and search the whole city.

425
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,959
The ferry on the east of the city leads to Jing Kingdom directly. Take a team over there now and stop all the boats.

426
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,500
Yes, Your Highness.

427
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:27,700
Your Highness, do you mean… Tantai Jin may escape the Sheng Kingdom…

428
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,810
Currently, the Jing Kingdom is in an unstable situation.

429
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,200
Now the hostage prince has run away from the Ye family.

430
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,420
My father will be suspicious.

431
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,070
- Seal the ferry. Search the boats one by one.
- Yes, sir.

432
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,049
- Have more eyes on the river.
- Yes, Sir.

433
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,089
- Check over there.
- Yes, Sir.

434
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,840
High Priestess.

435
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,649
Everything has been arranged.

436
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:17,910
Miss Ye is locked in the cabin, and I tied her with Ruo-River ropes, so she won't get away.

437
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,820
You've grown up in a flash.

438
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:30,200
Leader Nian, why are you loyal to the Yiyue tribe?

439
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,749
The old chief saved the Nian Clan…

440
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,200
That's the last generation's business.

441
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,300
I'm asking you.

442
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,779
I want to know your own thoughts.

443
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:43,759
As long as His Highness takes the throne and protects the Yiyue tribe, he will be my new master.

444
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:47,069
The Yiyue tribe is my home. I was born there and brought up there.

445
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:49,030
My family is there.

446
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,710
Family…

447
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,690
High Priestess, I'm sorry.

448
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:00,919
That year I left my post without permission, and lost Miss Fuya.

449
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,519
I told you, that's the past. Don't mention the past anymore.

450
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,439
I can't blame that on you. Luckily, we got His Highness back.

451
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:14,719
You and your Moonshadow Guards can take a break for now, but don't let your guard down.

452
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:19,130
If the Sheng people find out they've lost the hostage prince, they will take action.

453
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,550
Yes.

454
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,050
Go.

455
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,720
<i>Fuya, my daughter, I promise I will bring you home.</i>

456
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,040
<i>So cold.</i>

457
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,830
<i>What's this place…</i>

458
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,320
Stop struggling.

459
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,200
We took your charms away.

460
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:33,379
Also, this rope is made by the Yiyue tribe with Ruo River water.

461
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,000
You can't untie it even with your spells.

462
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,250
So, what are you doing here?

463
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,200
To laugh at me that I can't untie the rope? Or are you here to kill me?

464
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,790
The journey is long and boring, so I'm here to chat with you.

465
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:56,600
Didn't you say that I can come to you when I want to chat with someone?

466
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,960
I was stupid to trust you back then.

467
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,349
Doesn't matter.

468
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:10,320
Whether you want to or not, willing or not, you can only sit here and listen.

469
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:19,470
You must be wondering how come the weak me can devour a demon core,

470
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,239
why there would be a team of guards, and where and when all this started.

471
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:26,200
Does that matter?

472
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,170
I should have known earlier that you were born this way.

473
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:34,090
You are an ungrateful man like a man eating wolf that can never be raised.

474
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,140
Ye Xiwu, I don't think you are innocent. You are stupid.

475
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,880
You don't even know why you married me.

476
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,079
What do you mean?

477
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,620
Have you ever wondered the reason?

478
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,719
You clearly sent people to poison Ye Bingchang's dessert with Spring Silkworm Knot,

479
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:57,460
but why did you finally fall victim to it?

480
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,850
<i>The night before the Qixi Festival banquet, in the palace, </i>

481
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:10,369
<i>I noticed a servant tampering with the desserts of the banquet.</i>

482
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,620
<i>Well done.</i>

483
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:26,639
<i>After they both take Spring Silkworm Knot, they will surely have some fun together.</i>

484
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,900
<i>But she is your sister after all.</i>

485
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,510
<i>Are you going too far by doing this?</i>

486
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,560
<i>What's so good about Ye Bingchang?</i>

487
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,790
<i>She has been pretending to be pitiful and weak all day.</i>

488
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:49,690
<i>I want her to lose her virginity, particularly to that fat and greasy Prince Wuning.</i>

489
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:52,250
<i>I want everyone to laugh at her.</i>

490
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:57,280
<i>I want Xiao Lin to think of her as a dirty woman, and lose interest in her.</i>

491
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,920
<i>You can go back.</i>

492
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,029
<i>Wait and see tomorrow night's big show.</i>

493
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,580
<i>Yes.</i>

494
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:11,990
<i>I had a difficult life in the palace, cornered to a desperate state.</i>

495
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:17,739
<i>Because of your plot, I could get a great chance to leave the Palace of Sheng.</i>

496
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:20,450
It was you who swapped Ye Bingchang's and my desserts.

497
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:24,830
You also set up a scheme to consume Xiao Liang's dessert in the garden.

498
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:31,749
<i>I was planning on knocking over his dessert, but he took the initiative to give me a hard time.</i>

499
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,680
<i>It took me no effort to make my plan work.</i>

500
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,179
<i>Why didn't you choose my sister?</i>

501
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,139
The Spring Silkworm Knot was originally for her.

502
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,170
This was your evil plan. So, of course, you were the perfect choice to fulfill my plan.

503
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:46,069
Also, you are General Ye's favorite daughter.

504
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:51,909
If I want to escape from the palace to save my life, marrying you is the best option.

505
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,150
You schemed so much, yet you still pretend to be innocent and victimized in front of me,

506
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,720
making me feel pity and guilt toward you.

507
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:10,350
Ye Xiwu, as a hostage prince, I was living in degradation in the Sheng Kingdom

508
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,740
and my life and death were not in my own hands.

509
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,530
What else could I do but endure and make concessions?

510
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,300
Let me tell you one more thing.

511
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,680
That night, we were only lying next to each other.

512
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,020
Nothing happened between us.

513
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,160
You are evil and stupid.

514
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,619
I would rather endure the heart-wrenching pain from Spring Silkworm Knot, than be intimate with you for even a second.

515
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,890
That's great.

516
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,640
Thank you very much, Tantai Jin.

517
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,710
In the future, we will have nothing to do with each other.

518
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,550
Future?

519
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,980
Do you still think you have a future, a forthcoming future?

520
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,390
Dream on.

521
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,270
I won't keep anyone who knows too many of my secrets alive.

522
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:07,530
The people who know your secrets…

523
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,970
<i>This is Nanny Yingxin.</i>

524
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:13,159
<i>They want to harm His Highness.</i>

525
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,190
- <i>You guys want to harm His Highness. You want to harm His Highness!</i>
- <i>Are you talking about Tantai Jin?</i>

526
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,930
<i>Who wants to harm him?</i>

527
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,320
<i>I didn't harm His Highness.</i>

528
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,230
Why did Yingxin go crazy?

529
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,099
You made her go mad.

530
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,869
She colluded with Tantai Minglang and tried to kill me.

531
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,550
Can't I fight back?

532
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,290
<i>The food today is unexpectedly substantial.</i>

533
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:49,089
<i>Your Highness, you are about to wed Second Young Miss Ye, so the royal kitchen sent the dishes to show kindness.</i>

534
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:58,049
<i>Prince Minglang said the hostage prince should never leave the palace.</i>

535
00:49:58,049 --> 00:50:01,260
<i>Tantai Minglang wants me to kill him?</i>

536
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,349
<i>As long as you're willing to help us,</i>

537
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:08,549
<i>we'll think of a way to help you get out of the palace and return to your hometown.</i>

538
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:10,550
<i>Really?</i>

539
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:19,240
<i>Yingxin, do you remember a bottle of imperial wine was buried under the tree outside the gate?</i>

540
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:25,060
<i>It was given to us by the King of Sheng on his birthday one year, but you wanted to preserve it.</i>

541
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:31,500
<i>You said that if there was ever a day we could leave this damned place, we would open it to celebrate.</i>

542
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,809
<i>Now we can leave the Palace of Sheng.</i>

543
00:50:34,809 --> 00:50:38,670
<i>Why don't you go dig it up?</i>

544
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:57,990
<i>[Till The End of The Moon]</i>

545
