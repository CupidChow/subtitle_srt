♫ <i>Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood</i> ♫

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,360
♫ <i>Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light</i> ♫

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,650
♫ <i> Is it bright and warm? </i> ♫

5
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,140
♫ <i> I can only guess based on intuition</i> ♫

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>[Episode 37]</i>

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,010
<i>Cang Jiumin has returned to the Barren Abyss.</i>

17
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,680
<i>Devil Palace has been activated once again.</i>

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,950
<i>It won't be long</i>

19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,910
<i>before the Devil Lord's return.</i>

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,520
Hengyang and Xiaoyao Sects' harbored evildoers from the demon world, leading to the resurrection of the Devil Lord.

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,510
They have committed a heinous crime.

22
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,710
Now in the face of a very powerful enemy, the immortal sects cannot be without a leader.

23
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:10,700
In the current situation, only my Chixiao Sect can take the reins.

24
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,460
What do you guys think?

25
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,120
Um… You're absolutely right, Sect Leader Cen.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,930
The Yaowang Valley is at your service from here on.

27
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,680
The Qianji School is with you too, Sect Leader Cen.

28
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,303
Good.

29
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:30,400
Now, sect leaders,

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,470
return to your sects and gather your disciples at once.

31
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,580
I will lead you all to the Barren Abyss in three days.

32
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,300
We will kill Cang Jiumin!

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,460
<i>See? The immortal sects hate you to the core.</i>

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,340
There is no place for you in this world other than the Devil Palace.

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,500
<i>Sect Leader Qu was killed. This is bad.</i>

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,260
<i>Susu is in danger.</i>

37
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,973
What's wrong? What's on your mind?

38
00:02:56,973 --> 00:03:01,440
You must have been wondering who killed Sect Leader Qu.

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,810
Only three people were at the scene.

40
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,290
Sect Leader Qu is dead.

41
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,870
Li Susu is unconscious with serious injuries.

42
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,480
Only Dimian knows the whole story.

43
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,900
All the sects are convinced

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,980
that you were hiding the Sky-Slashing Sword.

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,900
and that it was you who killed the sect leader.

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,500
They thought you stole the evil bone trapped inside Li Susu

47
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,120
and returned to the Barren Abyss.

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,660
It was all you.

49
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,460
Why?

50
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,900
Take a guess.

51
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,810
You want to pin Sect Leader Qu's murder...

52
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,960
on me.

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,610
But why did you have to hurt Susu?

54
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,330
You have wronged us.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,520
We would've brought her here too,

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,280
if we knew that the evil bone was inside her body.

57
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,960
But it doesn't matter.

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,460
As long as we retrieve the evil bone

59
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:07,610
and insert it into your body, His Lordship will be revived.

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,890
The Sky-Slashing Sword… Dimian killed Sect Leader Qu with the sword

61
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,500
and stole the bone afterward.

62
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,300
You're smart. Cang Jiumin,

63
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,040
I suggest you let go of your past dreams.

64
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,500
It's time to wake up.

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,970
You wanted to be Cang Jiumin, but even after everything

66
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,610
you could not escape the fate of Tantai Jin.

67
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,870
The people you care about,

68
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,170
the people you love,

69
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,370
they are all going to die because of you.

70
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,360
Do you still remember what His Lordship said?

71
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,140
Cang Jiumin.

72
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,830
<i>I want to let him join an immortal sect.</i>

73
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,780
<i>He thinks he has taken the so-called right path.</i>

74
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,730
<i>He'll feel the warmth from his master and fellows</i>

75
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,500
<i>but he'll find it is an illusion.</i>

76
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,150
<i>Susu has suffered terribly on my behalf due to the evil bone.</i>

77
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,920
<i>Maybe Nian Baiyu was right.</i>

78
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,670
Stop.

79
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,710
What?

80
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,700
I see it now.

81
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,290
I will not be pushed around anymore.

82
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,210
Since you all keep telling me

83
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,900
becoming the Devil Lord is my fate.

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,750
I will accept this fate.

85
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,430
I'm glad you came around to your senses.

86
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,010
<i>With Qu Xuanzi dying without witnesses </i>

87
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,900
<i>and Cang Jiumin's sudden disappearance, </i>

88
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,930
<i>all the sects are focusing their attention on exterminating the demon fetus.</i>

89
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,290
<i>The heavens are helping me.</i>

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,530
<i>I have to lay low and take time to heal. </i>

91
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,800
<i>The evil bone has enormous power.</i>

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,330
<i>I can't forcefully fuse with it or it could backfire.</i>

93
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,160
<i>Now that I have the bone and the Sky-Slashing Sword, </i>

94
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,660
<i>I'll just have</i>

95
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,620
<i>to wait for the right time to retrieve...</i>

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,360
<i>the Bone-Refining Seal and the God-Slaying Crossbow.</i>

97
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,920
<i>Senior, Susu is awake.</i>

98
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,390
<i>She's heartbroken.</i>

99
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,390
<i>Would you please go check on her?</i>

100
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,600
<i>It would be greatly appreciated.</i>

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,630
<i>Right, I almost forgot about her.</i>

102
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,730
<i>Hopefully, she won't be able to piece it all together.</i>

103
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,163
Susu.

104
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,250
Apologies, Father. You came to see me.

105
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,990
It should have been the other way around.

106
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,520
Don't worry about it. You're still grieving over Sect Leader Qu's death.

107
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,470
I won't judge you for being too overwhelmed to visit me. It's perfectly understandable.

108
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,000
You already know what happened, don't you?

109
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,410
I did a terrible job

110
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,430
of protecting…

111
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,940
I, too, was stabbed by him.

112
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,920
Father, only you were there.

113
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Can you tell me what really happened?

114
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,480
We were very close to completing the array.

115
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,630
Both Sect Leader Qu and I had exerted most of our energy.

116
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,680
That was when Cang Jiumin showed up out of nowhere.

117
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,390
I recognized his weapon.

118
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,430
It was the Devil God's Sky-Slashing Sword.

119
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,950
He attacked Chief Qu. And right before I was knocked unconscious,

120
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:08,140
I saw him cast a spell on you and steal something black.

121
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,530
<i>Bone-Refining Seal isn't the first devil artifact I came into contact with.</i>

122
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,060
<i>There's also a devil crossbow. And I have both fused into my body</i>

123
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,420
<i>Tantai Jin once told me about the God-Slaying Crossbow himself.</i>

124
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,760
<i>If he had the Sky-Slashing Sword, he would have told me too.</i>

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,080
<i>And if he did have the sword and was truly determined to kill,</i>

126
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,340
<i>I don't think anyone could have survived it.</i>

127
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,170
Are you absolutely sure that it was the Sky-Slashing Sword?

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,600
I was once a leader of the demons.

129
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,240
I know the Sky-Slashing Sword when I see it.

130
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,220
I regret that I wasn't strong enough to protect Sect Leader Qu.

131
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,980
This helplessness reminds me of my days back in the Devil Realm.

132
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,300
The demon fetus is the root of the Devil Lord. Nothing is going to change that.

133
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,910
How could he have sincerely joined the immortal sects?

134
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,690
I was wrong...

135
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,640
about him.

136
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,910
Susu, you must cut the demon fetus out of your life and move on.

137
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,390
Don't repeat my mistake.

138
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,740
It's getting late. I should probably go.

139
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,070
Rest and recover well, Susu.

140
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,270
<i>This is the only way to get to the truth.</i>

141
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,120
Second Senior Sister, I need to see you.

142
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,600
This place looks even more lifeless than it did 10,000 years ago.

143
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,170
How do you know what the Barren Abyss looked like 10,000 years ago?

144
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,790
Are you questioning me?

145
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,733
<i>Susu, it's unsafe for you to be around Dimian.</i>

146
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:25,220
<i>I have to do this to keep you safe.</i>

147
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,140
Are you two...

148
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,340
all that I have?

149
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,270
What do you mean?

150
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,720
10,000 years ago, Dimian betrayed me

151
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,850
and worked in league with the gods to harm me.

152
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,410
I want the evil bone returned.

153
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,790
And I want him to welcome me on his knees in front of Devil Palace when I am restored.

154
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,690
- Yes, My Lord.
- Yes, My Lord.

155
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,720
Master, our scouts posted outside the Barren Abyss have reported back.

156
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,770
Junior Brother is indeed in the Barren Abyss.

157
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,750
How is he?

158
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,380
The two devils, Siying and Jingmie, were bowing to him

159
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,330
as if he were their master.

160
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,200
Those were their exact words.

161
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,630
Don't tell anybody about this.

162
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,830
Jiumin must have had his reasons.

163
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,510
But right now, those short-sighted fools from the Chixiao Sect

164
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,460
are calling the shots around here.

165
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,030
We are the only ones who trust Jiumin.

166
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,180
<i>[Uncle Zhaoyou From Li Susu]</i>

167
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,020
No, there's one more person.

168
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,303
Susu?

169
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,793
Father, how is your recovery coming along?

170
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:06,770
Senior Sister told me that you are taking care of your own injuries.

171
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,240
I know a thing or two about healing wounds.

172
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,160
I can examine yours.

173
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,110
I'm good. I've been a demon for over 10,000 years.

174
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,230
My blood will contaminate your divine body.

175
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,320
Well, I am your daughter. I'll be fine.

176
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,960
I've lost one of my fathers.

177
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,760
All the more reason to be there for you when you need me.

178
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,030
Are you sure you want to see the wound?

179
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,243
Yes.

180
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,353
All right. I won't prevent you from performing your filial duties.

181
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,803
Come on in.

182
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,690
I'm just worried that this mutilated wound will scare you.

183
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,300
Why? Is your wounds something you don't want to be seen?

184
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,283
Susu, I've been around for 10,000 years, yet our time spent together

185
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:25,620
was less than a tenth of your time spent with Sect Leader Qu.

186
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,290
I feel so guilty.

187
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,410
Actually, Dad was often busy.

188
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,080
I didn't always get his attention.

189
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,040
But he was noble and honest. And he had a big heart.

190
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,620
Growing up with such positive influences in my life,

191
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,320
it's truly the luckiest thing to ever happen to me.

192
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,900
<i>Senior Sister, did you examine my father's wound?</i>

193
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,550
<i>Was he really stabbed by the Sky-Slashing Sword?</i>

194
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,540
<i>Lord of Monsters said he's been a demon for over 10,000 years.</i>

195
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,490
<i>And that he would have to heal himself with his own demonic energy.</i>

196
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,140
<i>So, no, I did not see his wound.</i>

197
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,140
<i>The wound… It was caused by Dad.</i>

198
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,853
Susu, don't be scared.

199
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:39,070
They'll find you soon enough.

200
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,093
Dimian, where do you think you're going?

201
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,720
So it was a ploy by you

202
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,890
and my daughter, huh?

203
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,703
That's right.

204
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,380
Dimian, you're not leaving Hengyang Sect today.

205
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,080
Hand over the evil bone!

206
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,360
You've found the Devil Palace?

207
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,750
Cut the crap!

208
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,670
Hand the evil bone over, and I'll grant you an easy death.

209
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,920
Do you think you can get the evil bone?

210
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,770
Don't waste time on this old fart.

211
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,000
Dimian mustn't get away!

212
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,080
<i>This is bad.</i>

213
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,960
<i>I received another wound before my previous one was healed.</i>

214
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,510
<i>This won't do. They've found the Devil Palace.</i>

215
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,900
<i>I must absorb the evil bone's power right now</i>

216
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,370
<i>so that those two fools will get nothing.</i>

217
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,753
Uncle Zhaoyou!

218
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:20,383
Uncle Zhaoyou!

219
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,290
Are you all right?

220
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,543
Here.

221
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,423
Susu, just now,

222
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:32,520
Siying and Jingmie appeared.

223
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,400
Did they want to rescue Dimian?

224
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,140
They had the same goal as us,

225
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,120
which was to seize Dimian and take back the evil bone.

226
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,910
Since we failed,

227
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,160
I'm sure Dimian will absorb the evil bone at all costs.

228
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm afraid that'll be irrecoverable.

229
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,900
By the way, where is Jiwu?

230
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,550
Senior Brother heard that Sect Leader Cen and company had set out,

231
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,550
so he summoned the rest of the disciples to catch up with them.

232
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,350
Jiwu's emotions have been erratic lately.

233
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,470
He'll be digging his own grave by rushing to the Barren Abyss.

234
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,580
That's not an option. Someone must stop him now.

235
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,200
Then I'll go to stop Eldest Senior Brother right now.

236
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,160
All right. Let's split up.

237
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,780
I'll go after Dimian.

238
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,140
<i>Welcome back, Devil Lord.</i>

239
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,180
<i>Welcome back, Devil Lord.</i>

240
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,370
<i>Welcome back, Devil Lord.</i>

241
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,210
<i>Welcome back, Devil Lord.</i>

242
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,750
<i>Welcome back, Devil Lord.</i>

243
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,860
<i>My Lord, we were so close.</i>

244
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,100
<i>Dimian, that geezer, got away.</i>

245
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,350
<i>Shall we send all the demons after him?</i>

246
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,350
<i>No. Instead, I want them all called back.</i>

247
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,980
<i>I'll command all the demons and devils</i>

248
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,740
<i>and revive the Barren Abyss.</i>

249
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,790
<i>Dimian had left the immortal sects together with the evil bone, </i>

250
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,780
<i>which should keep Susu free from the turmoil.</i>

251
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,120
<i>She should be safe now. Master won't let Dimian escape.</i>

252
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,310
<i>This pair of devils and the Barren Abyss are the issues here.</i>

253
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,910
<i>If they get the evil bone back and fuse it with my body…</i>

254
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,480
<i>I cannot let the the advent of Devil Lord occur.</i>

255
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,060
This isn't right, Tantai Jin is up to something.

256
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,350
You two are my trusted aides.

257
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,600
Come with me into the palace.

258
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,580
<i>The demons and devils are gathering.</i>

259
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,960
<i>Something serious might happen.</i>

260
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,510
<i>The cloak that Chongyu Harp transforms into</i>

261
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,730
<i>can temporarily make me invisible to common demons and devils</i>

262
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,340
<i>and help me to get into the Barren Abyss.</i>

263
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,720
<i>I hope I'm not too late.</i>

264
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,500
<i>Demons and devils from all over the world have gathered in the Barren Abyss.</i>

265
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,430
<i>This is the right time.</i>

266
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,700
- My Lord.
- What's the matter?

267
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,620
You guys have been around for 10,000 years.

268
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,520
Have you ever heard of Xiaoyao Sect's Self-Sacrificing Array?

269
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,730
Cang Jiumin, what trick are you trying to pull?

270
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,420
Cang Jiumin!

271
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,240
<i>These runes only hurt demons and devils.</i>

272
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,580
<i>It seems like an immortal technique.</i>

273
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,920
<i>My feet are stuck!</i>

274
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,830
<i>Sacrifice my body and destroy the Devil Realm with it.</i>

275
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,520
If I die,

276
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,170
what else can you count on to welcome your Devil Lord back?

277
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,930
<i>Tantai Jin, what exactly are you afraid of?</i>

278
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,720
<i>You actually tried to take your own life like an idiot would do?</i>

279
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,540
I'm not afraid! You're the one who's afraid!

280
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,780
<i>What a joke.</i>

281
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,960
<i>You think destroying your body can prevent my return?</i>

282
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,730
<i>You think too highly of yourself.</i>

283
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,830
Is that so?

284
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,660
Since the Devil Lord has everything under control,

285
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,340
why bother advising me to stop?

286
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:54,390
<i>Tantai Jin, you choose to sacrifice your life so soon.</i>

287
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,213
<i>What a pity.</i>

288
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,823
<i>Tantai Jin, </i>

289
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,440
<i>why did you choose to die?</i>

290
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,113
Mingye?

291
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,200
So, the Heart-Guarding Scale

292
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,310
still retained a sliver of your divine consciousness.

293
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,943
<i>That's right.</i>

294
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:25,170
<i>You managed to awaken it again by using the divine soul to refine the Heart-guarding Scale.</i>

295
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,940
I see.

296
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,680
<i>The Self-Sacrificing Array is entering its last phase.</i>

297
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,380
<i>It's not too late for you to stop.</i>

298
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,950
My very birth comes from the Devil Lord's evil thoughts.

299
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,560
If my destruction can save the world and its beings,

300
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,650
my existence will not be in vain.

301
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,540
<i>All joys and sorrows of the world are no more than the appearance and disappearance of love.</i>

302
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,540
<i>Tantai Jin, you were born for the Devil Lord's sake.</i>

303
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,210
<i>If so, what do you die for?</i>

304
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,033
I know that life is priceless.

305
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,440
But since my single death can prevent more deaths,

306
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,660
I prefer to safeguard this place.

307
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,580
I want to safeguard everything behind me,

308
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,340
<i>just like how you wanted</i>

309
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,610
<i>to safeguard the Mo River.</i>

310
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,870
<i>Once, you asked me why I selected you to enter my Enlightened Life.</i>

311
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,490
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

312
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,280
<i>During that war, the evil bone, which was sealed away,</i>

313
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,270
<i>fell into the mortal world as the Pillar of Heaven shattered.</i>

314
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,990
<i>The Devil Lord will use the evil bone to select a demon fetus for his resurrection.</i>

315
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,870
<i>I'd used up all of my divine power.</i>

316
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,860
<i>All I could do was to leave my Enlightened Life at the bottom of the Mo River.</i>

317
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,860
♫ <i>Endless night</i> ♫

318
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,220
<i>Jize had seen phantoms of both of you in Sang Jiu and me.</i>

319
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,860
<i>I knew that you were certain to come.</i>

320
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,020
<i>Now,</i>

321
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,410
<i>I've done what I could.</i>

322
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,400
<i>Tantai Jin, it's time for you to make a choice.</i>

323
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,080
<i>Our 10,000-year affinity ends here.</i>

324
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,890
<i>Farewell.</i>

325
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,980
♫ <i>At a glance</i> ♫

326
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,003
Sister?

327
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:31,230
What happened?

328
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,970
Without that protective artifact,

329
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,490
I'm afraid we would have already been dead by now.

330
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,703
Sister, you were right.

331
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:44,020
Cang Jiumin is indeed full of tricks.

332
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,500
We must retrieve the evil bone and awaken the Devil Lord.

333
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,410
Nian Baiyu,

334
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,450
your master has been deprived of cultivation.

335
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,210
I don't think he can play any more tricks.

336
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,160
Watch him closely.

337
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,620
We'll insert the evil bone

338
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,930
into his body, and the Devil Lord will be resurrected when we return after a few days.

339
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,180
And your tribesmen

340
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,620
will be free.

341
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,520
Did you smell that? I think I smell humans.

342
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,260
Over there! After her!

343
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,840
The entrance of Barren Abyss is ahead of us.

344
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,960
Sect Leader Cen, should we keep going?

345
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,430
Barren Abyss is where demons and devils gather.

346
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,270
They know the terrain better than us.

347
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,780
If I send our disciples into the abyss rashly,

348
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,510
I'm afraid we'll suffer heavy casualties.

349
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,290
But the evil bone and the demon fetus have returned to the Devil Palace.

350
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,570
Demons and devils from all corners of the world are gathering here.

351
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,880
If this goes on, the Devil Lord will be resurrected in no time.

352
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,270
If he uses the opportunity to activate the All-in-Distress Path,

353
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,810
everything will be too late.

354
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,440
Leader Liuzhi, you're getting a little impatient, huh?

355
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,770
What about this? You can send your disciples

356
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,160
into the abyss and scout it out first.

357
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,010
- I thank you on behalf of all sects.
- You!

358
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,810
Back when we were at the Demon Subduing Peak,

359
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,880
Hengyang and Xiaoyao Sects vouched for the demon fetus.

360
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,430
Now the devil fetus has escaped, and it has led to a disaster.

361
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,890
I'm willing to lead the two sects to enter the abyss first.

362
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,270
We will locate the whereabouts of the demon fetus.

363
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,370
Sect Leader Gongye, I understand how eager you are

364
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,530
to make up for your mistake.

365
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,720
Although Hengyang Sect has made an irredeemable mistake,

366
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,640
we cultivators always try to be magnanimous.

367
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,560
I guess I'll have to give you this chance.

368
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,120
Thank you, Sect Leader Cen.

369
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,510
Notify us if you discover anything.

370
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,530
There are too few of you. Don't fight them head-on.

371
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,820
<i>Lord of Monsters.</i>

372
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,513
Devil Lord? Imposible.

373
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:03,700
I've already absorbed the evil bone.

374
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,690
It's mine now.

375
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,190
I'm the new Devil Lord now!

376
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,980
<i>Lord of Monsters, you didn't disappoint me after all.</i>

377
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,780
<i>You think you can replace me and steal my powers</i>

378
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,430
<i>after absorbing the evil bone?</i>

379
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,250
<i>All greedy beings in the world will end up as the vessel of the evil bone!</i>

380
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:29,020
<i>You're mine now!</i>

381
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,320
I'm not Siying.

382
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,560
I couldn't care less about reviving the Devil Lord.

383
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,190
Now that you've lost all of your powers and have no way to fight back,

384
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,320
why don't I just...

385
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,750
eat you?

386
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,040
<i>My Lord, it's all my fault.</i>

387
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,130
<i>If you'd rather die than be the Devil Lord, </i>

388
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,020
<i>I'll definitely get you out of here.</i>

389
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,760
<i>I wouldn't be here without Master.</i>

390
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,740
<i>But besides him, </i>

391
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,370
<i>there was another person I was greatly indebted to.</i>

392
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,220
<i>That person is you.</i>

393
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,760
<i>Back when I was still a hostage prince,</i>

394
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,930
<i>my brother plotted against me.</i>

395
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,600
<i>I was injured and stranded.</i>

396
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,750
<i>You risked your life to find me, helped me return to Jing Kingdom, </i>

397
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,200
<i>and helped me to ascend the throne.</i>

398
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,133
<i>Later, </i>

399
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,920
<i>when I lost all hope because of Ye Xiwu,</i>

400
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,650
<i>you risked your life again</i>

401
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,430
- <i>to save me from the fire.
- Your Majesty!</i>

402
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,600
<i>Without you, how could I have lived this long?</i>

403
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,960
<i>I also would not have been able to find her again without your help.</i>

404
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,060
<i>I can't take the credit.</i>

405
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,960
<i>It's the blessing that you're born with, My Lord.</i>

406
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,170
<i>Blessing?</i>

407
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,550
<i>I was born as the demon fetus with the evil bone.</i>

408
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,590
<i>You call that a blessing?</i>

409
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,240
<i>In this vast Mount Changze, there's no one else but you...</i>

410
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,590
<i>who can drink with me now.</i>

411
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,220
Who's sneaking around?

412
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,920
Your blood smells complex.

413
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,570
I haven't tasted this in quite a while.

414
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,400
It does taste special.

415
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,850
Loyalty,

416
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,350
naivety,

417
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,280
recklessness,

418
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,610
and a taste of bitter guilt.

419
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,690
So, are you here because of your loyalty

420
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,980
or your guilt?

421
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,370
I'm here to save My Lord.

422
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,360
He took me as a friend, but I betrayed him.

423
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,460
I must help him to escape even at the expense of my life!

424
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,600
Your blood contains the rich taste I love.

425
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,250
I shall grant you your wish then.

426
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,460
You are cunning indeed!

427
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,170
It's not easy to cultivate for 1,000 years.

428
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,300
Set him free and I'll set you free.

429
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,840
Set me free?

430
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,200
I'll suck your blood dry!

431
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,933
My Lord!

432
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,700
<i>[Jin]</i>

433
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,030
<i>You can only turn into me!</i>

434
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,680
<i>So, that was the life of the demon fetus?</i>

435
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,250
I said, let him go.

436
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,850
It tastes awful.

437
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,920
Your blood can absorb our demonic power.

438
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,110
Only Devil Lord is capable of this feat.

439
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,550
You are truly the Devil Lord.

440
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,183
Go.

441
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:41,920
But you're a little different from him.

442
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,440
Your blood contains a slight sweetness and a touch of sunshine.

443
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,140
Although it was a tiny bit, I could taste them.

444
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,700
What was that?

445
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,483
Let's go.

446
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,590
My Lord, they're finally engaging us head-on.

447
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,020
You better escape

448
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,430
while both Siying and Jingmie aren't around.

449
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,730
But they told you to keep an eye on me.

450
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,270
I shouldn't have believed what Siying and Jingmie said

451
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,830
and acted on my own initiative.

452
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,410
It's pointless to say this now.

453
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,430
Let's try to escape from this place first.

454
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,630
Okay.

455
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,150
You saved me behind Siying and Jingmie's backs.

456
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,550
They'll find out eventually.

457
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,950
What's your plan?

458
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,700
Worst-case scenario, I'll die here.

459
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,650
What about the people of Yiyue Tribe?

460
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,830
I can't just sit idly by

461
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,210
and let them kill you.

462
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,000
So, this is your plan.

463
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,880
You're putting the whole tribe at stake here just to save me?

464
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,430
I'll escort you out first.

465
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,130
After that, I'll think of something.

466
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,620
If I can't save them,

467
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,950
I'll die with them.

468
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,390
Let's figure out a solution together.

469
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,780
Thank you, My Lord.

470
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,533
They are also my tribesmen.

471
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,603
Let's go.

472
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,780
Be careful. You're hurt.

473
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,513
I'm fine.

474
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,810
We've almost arrived. The exit is right ahead.

475
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:36,450
<i>Demon fetus you're worrying indeed.</i>

476
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,580
<i>I can't let them know that Nian Baiyu tried to save me.</i>

477
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,070
- My Lord, what are you doing?
-Go to hell!

478
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,880
Why are you in such a rush to kick down the ladder before you even escaped?

479
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,050
Those who betray me will die.

480
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,510
Besides, he was willing to help me escape after I intimidated him.

481
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,670
I won't keep cowards like him by my side.

482
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,070
I was wondering if that brat had a bold change of heart

483
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,680
after obeying my command for so many years.

484
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,580
So, it was you. Now, I have one less obedient lackey.

485
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,730
Sorry about that.

486
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,760
How exactly did you get out?

487
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,040
The entire Devil Realm is my residence.

488
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,500
All demons and devils are my subjects.

489
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,650
You think you can trap me here?

490
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,900
Don't you think it's hilarious?

491
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,240
Siying spared your life for His Lordship's sake.

492
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,730
But you? You foil my plan time and time again.

493
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,820
Siying isn't here right now.

494
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,360
I'll leave your body intact after killing you.

495
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,510
This is more than enough.

496
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,293
Go.

497
00:38:58,293 --> 00:39:01,090
You killed plenty of our men.

498
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,300
Now, they will seek their revenge.

499
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,990
Suck him dry!

500
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:27,360
Cang Jiumin, we shouldn't have spared you.

501
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,050
<i>Good. You're finally willing to use the powers of the devil.</i>

502
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,280
<i>That's how the Devil Lord should behave.</i>

503
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,380
<i>I need to get out of here.</i>

504
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,030
What a pity. He's just a vessel after all.

505
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,050
Why don't we just kill him?

506
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,380
Why the rush?

507
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,250
We haven't retrieved the evil bone yet.

508
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,150
Let's go.

509
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,650
Let's bring that brat back.

510
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,730
Show yourself and beg for mercy!

511
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,950
Don't waste my time.

512
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,730
Otherwise, I'll break all your bones when I find you!

513
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,513
Show yourself!

514
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,930
<i>How can I escape?</i>

515
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,070
<i>Judging from the traces left behind by the devil energy, </i>

516
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,410
<i>Dimian may have already absorbed the evil bone.</i>

517
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,800
<i>If he returns to the Devil Palace with it, </i>

518
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,400
<i>it will be too late.</i>

519
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,963
Show yourself!

520
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,710
Give me your power.

521
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,990
His Lordship? That was His Lordship's voice.

522
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,380
<i>Dimian's here?</i>

523
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,090
<i>This is the scent of the evil bone.</i>

524
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,920
Help!

525
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,410
<i>Devil energy is surging within his body.</i>

526
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,820
<i>Did he absorb the evil bone?</i>

527
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,600
Run!

528
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,333
Jingmie!

529
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,020
This isn't enough.

530
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,213
Jingmie!

531
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,020
Run!

532
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,770
<i>It's the evil bone.</i>

533
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,050
<i>The evil bone is absorbing energy.</i>

534
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,230
Get out of here.

535
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,003
My Lord.

536
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,280
Siying, I still need more power to be resurrected.

537
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,070
<i>That's the Devil God's voice.</i>

538
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,170
<i>Dimian is under the Devil Lord's control.</i>

539
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,530
My Lord!

540
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,033
<i>Siying, are you not willing to sacrifice yourself for my sake?</i>

541
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:08,960
My Lord, ever since you brought me back,

542
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,980
I'd decided...

543
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,880
to live and die for your sake

544
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,580
for all eternity!

545
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,000
<i>My Lord, wait for me!</i>

546
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:05,650
<i>From now on, I am a part of you, My Lord.</i>

547
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,020
Siying!

548
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,290
<i>Dimian has the evil bone.</i>

549
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,020
<i>No one can stop him.</i>

550
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:55,980
<i>Is he heading to the Devil Palace?</i>

551
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,670
<i>Is he going to activate the All-in-Distress Path?</i>

552
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,460
<i>This is too dangerous.</i>

553
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,630
<i>No.</i>

554
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,680
<i>I have to figure out a way to inform the immortal sects immediately.</i>

555
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:38,220
<i>What should I do? I won't make it in time like this.</i>

556
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,410
<i>This warning bell was set up by Master.</i>

557
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,050
<i>If I trigger the Stone-Inscription Array with my devil energy, </i>

558
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,980
<i>the immortal sects will notice it immediately.</i>

559
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,340
<i>This is the fastest way.</i>

560
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,263
<i>Hurry!</i>

561
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,000
<i>Trigger the alarm!</i>

562
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,133
This is great.

563
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,210
It's from the warning bell by the Barren Abyss!

564
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,960
Devil energy had triggered the array.

565
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,780
Tantai Jin!

566
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,240
We finally found you.

567
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,640
The demon fetus has appeared.

568
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,710
The evil bone should not have fused with him yet.

569
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,890
Everyone, initiate the formation together with me!

570
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,580
<i>The Devil-Subduing Formation!</i>

571
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,463
Senior Brother Gongye…

572
00:50:51,463 --> 00:50:54,320
I mean, Sect Leader Gongye. I am willing to lead the disciples of Xiaoyao Sect

573
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,530
to capture Cang Jiumin alive.

574
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,050
Sect Leader Gongye!

575
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,483
No.

576
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,660
He is Tantai Jin. He's the demon fetus.

577
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,160
He killed Master and stole the evil bone.

578
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,460
He is not the Cang Jiumin you know anymore.

579
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Even today, you still feel pity for the demon fetus.

580
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,910
The immortal sects of the Four Continents wouldn't have been forced into such a predicament

581
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:22,150
if it weren't for your womanly benevolence.

582
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,013
Why?

583
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:27,220
Where are they?

584
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,770
Sect Leader Cen is right. We can't make the same mistake again.

585
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,130
The immortal sects mustn't show him any mercy.

586
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,790
If not, other immortal sects will be jeopardized.

587
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,170
Enough said.

588
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:47,630
This is the time to kill the demon fetus!

589
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:01,230
Tantai Jin, you won't get away this time!

590
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,620
<i>Why is no one coming here?</i>

591
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:11,050
<i>Stop Dimian before it's too late!</i>

592
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,000
Sect Leader Cen is launching a lethal attack!

593
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,530
I want him to perish and suffer a terrible fate!

594
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:22,940
I will avenge my son's death!

595
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,880
<i>Go and stop Dimian!</i>

596
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,360
Don't let him activate the All-in-Distress Path!

597
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,413
Sect Leader Gongye, you were close to Junior Brother Jiumin.

598
00:52:33,413 --> 00:52:35,580
How can you bear to do this…

599
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,940
Cang Jiumin never existed.

600
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,580
He has been the demon fetus all along.

601
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:45,200
He joined our immortal sect just to retrieve the evil bone.

602
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,240
<i>Kill him! Kill the demon fetus!</i>

603
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,633
<i>Tantai Jin, you will pay with your life!</i>

604
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,430
<i>Why?</i>

605
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:21,580
<i>Why is no one coming?</i>

606
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,400
<i>Why?</i>

607
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:41,140
I can't believe he got away!

608
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,630
He won't be able to get away.

609
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:45,380
Disciples of Hengyang Sect, follow my order!

610
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,280
Follow me into the Barren Abyss.

611
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,330
If you see Tantai Jin, kill him on sight.

612
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,713
Let's go.

613
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,560
<i>Get up.</i>

614
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,930
<i>Initiate it for me.</i>

615
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,550
<i>Open the door!</i>

616
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,210
<i>Initiate the All-in-Distress Path!</i>

617
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:35,780
<i>My plan will come to fruition after this step.</i>

618
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,193
Younger Sister!

619
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:40,583
Younger Sister! Who killed you?

620
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:45,150
Siying, wait for me.

621
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,660
10,000 years passed by in a flash.

622
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,350
<i>The evil bone has finally returned to where it belonged.</i>
