<i>[Episode 8]</i>

15
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,179
Why did Yingxin go crazy?

16
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:41,349
You made her go mad.

17
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,119
She colluded with Tantai Minglang and tried to kill me.

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,710
Can't I fight back?

19
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,899
<i>Prince Minglang said the hostage prince should never leave the palace.</i>

20
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,510
<i>Tantai Minglang wants me to kill him?</i>

21
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,249
<i>Yingxin,</i>

22
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:03,059
<i>do you remember a bottle of imperial wine was buried under the tree outside the gate?</i>

23
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:05,659
<i>Now we can leave the Palace of Sheng.</i>

24
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,710
<i>How about digging it up?</i>

25
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,820
She offered me drugged meals and planned to ask Tantai Minglang's man

26
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,219
to strangle me to death while I'm unconscious. And they would make it look like a suicide.

27
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,780
<i>I'm sorry, Your Highness.</i>

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,899
<i>I hurt you. I'm sorry, Your Highness.</i>

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,729
- I switched our bowls and chopsticks and pretended to be unconscious.
<i>- I'm sorry, Your Highness.</i>

30
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:42,399
When she went out to call her accomplice, the drug kicked in, and she fainted on the way.

31
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,650
Chief Wu always makes things difficult for us and humiliates us.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,759
That day, when he passed by with other chamberlains, he took Yingxin away and abused her.

33
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,160
Yingxin became crazy since then.

34
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,280
I only wanted to let her pay the piper.

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,370
It's all because of her petty kindness.

36
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,709
She would have died and wouldn't have suffered all of this if she drugged the meals with poison instead of sedatives.

37
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,629
<i>Yue Yingxin had an evil scheme.</i>

38
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,679
<i>But he treated her like a stranger with no compassion at all.</i>

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,130
<i>Could it be that Devil Lord is really heartless?</i>

40
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,640
<i>Is it hopeless to save him?</i>

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,190
Tantai Jin, I really regret saving you.

42
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,030
Ye Xiwu,

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,640
back then, I thought it was my fault.

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,710
But now I understand it's not me who is at fault,

45
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,980
but the world!

46
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:46,560
So, for those who abused me or wanted to kill me,

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,980
I will not let go of each one of them!

48
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,330
Including you.

49
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,240
<i>I can't just sit still and await my doom.</i>

50
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,840
What a Great General Ye!

51
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,289
It was your daughter who was shameless and consorted with the Prince of the Jing Kingdom.

52
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,379
For your sake, I agreed to let her marry Tantai Jin.

53
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,309
I let him leave the palace and live with your family.

54
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,289
It's been less than a year! And you are telling me that he ran away?

55
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,619
Your Majesty, please punish me.

56
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,360
Punish you?

57
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,070
After all,

58
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,830
Great General Ye, you fought dauntlessly on the battlefield and made Tantai Jin the hostage prince here.

59
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,159
Now you want to release him.

60
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,410
How dare I say anything?

61
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,159
Your Majesty, I know you are saying things in anger.

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,229
Tantai Jin has fled. And I didn't take precautions.

63
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:54,159
I am guilty of negligence in guarding him.

64
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,489
But I have never collaborated with Jing or released him on purpose.

65
00:04:58,489 --> 00:04:59,999
Your Majesty, please look into it.

66
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,219
Of course, I will. It's such a big incident.

67
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,820
Look. So many civil and military ministers have written memorials about what you have done!

68
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,820
I'm guilty!

69
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,820
Well. Go to the jail of Three Judicial Departments.

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

71
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,269
Your Majesty, my father is old.

72
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:24,989
His body has old wounds from fighting for our country. He can't bear the suffering in prison.

73
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:27,859
Your Majesty, if you want to punish him, please let me go for my father.

74
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:32,220
Wait, Junior General Ye. I will show solicitude with the meritorious officials.

75
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,749
The prison there is the cleanest and the most spacious.

76
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,119
If you don't want your father to suffer, bring back the hostage prince as soon as possible!

77
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:43,709
It will clear your family of suspicion, and I can explain it to my officials.

78
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,019
Listen! If you can't capture him alive, bring back his body!

79
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,770
Don't let Tantai Jin return to the Jing Kingdom alive!

80
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,930
We would rather kill all just for one!

81
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,530
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your mercy.

83
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,770
What a fishy smell!

84
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,130
What's in it?

85
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,989
Your Highness, the priestess has been asking us to hunt demons for you.

86
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:21,479
We just got this demon core.

87
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,270
Please enjoy it.

88
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,930
His Highness asked me to bring you a meal.

89
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,949
How do I know whether you poisoned the food or not?

90
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,740
His Highness is frank and forthright.

91
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,920
How could he poison you?

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,190
Yeah, he is really frank and forthright!

93
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,679
Why are you staring at me?

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,400
I have to watch you eat.

95
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,170
His Highness ordered me to.

96
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,269
Brother, my hands are tied! How can I eat?

97
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,510
Okay, I'll eat.

98
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,999
You!

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,100
I told you I am not capable of holding it.

100
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,290
I'm sorry, Brother.

101
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,050
<i>I need to find a way to get the lifeboat.</i>

102
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,249
<i>Something's wrong. Moonshadow Guards, assemble for orders.</i>

103
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:40,019
<i>Hurry! Gather for orders!</i>

104
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,590
<i>The female prisoner in the water dungeon has escaped.</i>

105
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,269
<i>Wasn't she tied with a Ruo-River rope?</i>

106
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,790
<i>How can she untie it without the spell?</i>

107
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,200
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

108
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,719
<i>This spell can untie the Ruo-River rope.</i>

109
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,419
<i>As for whether you can escape or not, it depends on your ability.</i>

110
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,240
<i>Why are you helping me?</i>

111
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,840
<i>Consider it as a favor for myself.</i>

112
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,020
<i>What is Jing Lan'an up to?</i>

113
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,890
<i>I can't let them find me.</i>

114
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,000
Your Highness.

115
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,029
I heard you had a demon core.

116
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,840
I'm here to check on you.

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,170
Your Highness, you're sweating a lot.

118
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,320
Do you feel uncomfortable?

119
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,510
I'm fine.

120
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,770
You came at the right time.

121
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,700
I want to give you a gift.

122
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,280
Your Highness, this is too precious.

123
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,270
The stairs are full of tawny daylily.

124
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,940
I've heard that people use this flower as a metaphor for mothers.

125
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,960
I lost my mother when I was young, and I have no one to give this hairpin to.

126
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,490
How about...

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,100
gifting this to you?

128
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,970
Here.

129
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,750
Lan'an, you did your best to bring me up and even made plans for me.

130
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,040
I will remember all of this.

131
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,500
I wonder if my elder brother will be surprised when he sees me.

132
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,350
<i>[Memorial Tablet of Holy Emperor of Great Jing]</i>

133
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,770
Congratulations, Your Highness.

134
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,879
Tantai Minghan and his party were bound by our spell before they could leave the palace.

135
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,620
They were all beheaded.

136
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,550
Well done.

137
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,750
Your Highness, it's my honor that you appreciate me.

138
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Now, my third younger brother is the only family I have left.

139
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,199
I miss him a bit, though.

140
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,509
Your Highness, I brought some cooks from the Yiyue tribe.

141
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,340
They cooked some of our hometown cuisines. I wonder if Your Highness likes them.

142
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,270
You are considerate.

143
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,990
I haven't been back for many years.

144
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,070
What's going on in Jing now?

145
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,979
Emperor Jing just passed away.

146
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:51,700
The new Emperor is Tantai Minglang.

147
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,509
There's one more thing.

148
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,710
I want to know what your opinion is.

149
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,680
Although Ye Xiwu is vulgar, she is your wife.

150
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,319
In the future, when you return to the Jing Kingdom…

151
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,670
She is not my wife.

152
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,080
I not only brought cooks from the Yiyue tribe but also brought some beauties with me.

153
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,299
They can all sing and dance well.

154
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,690
Your Highness, you may enjoy them.

155
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,030
Just kill time.

156
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,380
Sure.

157
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,840
<i>So beautiful.</i>

158
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,839
<i>What do you think of this?</i>

159
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,469
Ziling, your younger brother is the head of the Moonshadow Guards.

160
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:39,720
Did he tell you what His Highness looks like?

161
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,819
<i>- Tell us.
- Yes, tell us.</i>

162
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,460
<i>Please tell us.</i>

163
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,699
Baiyu is a dummy. He only cares about his duties.

164
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,600
He wouldn't tell me that.

165
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,599
But it doesn't matter what His Highness looks like.

166
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,789
I just want to know what girls he likes!

167
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,079
Isn't that right, girls?

168
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,100
<i>- Yeah!
- Yeah!</i>

169
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,030
<i>Well, let me tell you...</i>

170
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,119
<i>- Keep searching!
- What kind of girls does he like?</i>

171
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,480
<i>This woman cannot hide.</i>

172
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,119
What are you guys doing here?

173
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,330
Miss Nian, we're looking for someone.

174
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,230
I wonder if you've seen a young lady before.

175
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,770
Young? We're all young.

176
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,379
We're young ladies.

177
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:21,239
Well, can we go in and search?

178
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,820
All right, I won't make it hard for you.

179
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,389
Aunt Lan'an asks you all to perform.

180
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,869
Finally!

181
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,630
I'm sorry.

182
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,549
Girls, let's go.

183
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,620
- Let's go.
<i>- Let's go.</i>

184
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,740
<i>Perform? Dance?</i>

185
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,480
<i>I don't know how to dance!</i>

186
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,790
<i>I can play this.</i>

187
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,020
<i>Oh no!</i>

188
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,389
<i>The harp in the mortal realm is so different from Chongyu Harp.</i>

189
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,239
<i>Even the strings are loose.</i>

190
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,350
<i>Ye Xiwu. How did she escape?</i>

191
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,739
Your Highness, it's my fault. Ye Xiwu has escaped.

192
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:36,739
Is that so?

193
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,749
I've ordered someone to guard the dinghy closely.

194
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,199
Patrol of the Moonshadow Guards did not see anyone jumping into the river.

195
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,739
Ye Xiwu must be still on the boat.

196
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:45,359
Your Highness, please give the order to search cabin by cabin.

197
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:48,880
No need. Let's listen to the song first.

198
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,080
She can't escape.

199
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,220
<i>Ye Xiwu. I'll see how long you can hold out.</i>

200
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,440
<i>Why are they still dancing?</i>

201
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,100
<i>If I keep playing, I'm going to get caught.</i>

202
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,050
<i>Finally, I managed to muddle through.</i>

203
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,020
Your Highness, do you like the dance?

204
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,590
It's nice.

205
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,110
How about another solo dance?

206
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,350
I want to see that musician dance.

207
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,029
<i>- Who is it?
- Who?</i>

208
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,400
<i>Who does His Highness want to dance for him?</i>

209
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,349
<i>Who is it?</i>

210
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,520
Yes. The one with the harp.

211
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,660
I made a fortune-telling for them.

212
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,590
Guess what?

213
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,060
Water will bring them luck.

214
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,190
It is a close call.

215
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,479
It's highly auspicious!

216
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,440
Highly auspicious?

217
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,999
Don't worry about it.

218
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,790
Maybe Miss Xiwu was taken to the Jing Kingdom to be their queen and is enjoying her happiness!

219
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,870
If she becomes a queen in our enemy kingdom,

220
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,650
I'm afraid our family will be even more precarious in court.

221
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,349
<i>Why did His Highness choose her to dance?</i>

222
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,479
<i>- Why?
- Don't know.</i>

223
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,350
<i>Why her?</i>

224
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,159
<i>Tantai Jin! How dare you play me like this?</i>

225
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,429
What? Can you play the harp but not dance?

226
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,749
<i>I can't just sit and wait.</i>

227
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,130
<i>I must find a way to get out of here quickly.</i>

228
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,189
<i>Tantai Jin, you asked for it.</i>

229
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:22,030
<i>Don't regret it later!</i>

230
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,360
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

231
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,350
Stay back.

232
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,440
Come with me.

233
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,100
Don't move, or I'll strangle him to death.

234
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,350
Second Young Miss Ye, what the hell do you want?

235
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,869
Stop the boat! Let us go on the dinghy.

236
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:57,209
When we get to the shore safely, I'll let him come back here.

237
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,140
Do you want to run away so badly?

238
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,029
If you don't want to be strangled, let me get onto the dinghy.

239
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,269
Let's separate there.

240
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,280
Merry meet, merry part. All right?

241
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,999
You can't get away.

242
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,440
You are overconfident!

243
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,400
Ye Xiwu, I guess you have not seen how a beast hunts its prey. Right?

244
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,800
Some beasts do not kill their prey so easily.

245
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:30,920
They just tease and torment the prey until it takes its last breath.

246
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,150
Unfortunately, I am not your prey.

247
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,569
Since you gave me time to think during the dance, I'd make you regret your decision.

248
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:40,540
Let me get on the dinghy!

249
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,340
<i>Since you want to play, I'll play with you to the end!</i>

250
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,549
- Nian Baiyu!
- Here.

251
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,849
- Go to the dinghy.
- Yes.

252
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,030
Wise decision.

253
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,039
- Cut the rope.
- Don't you dare!

254
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,549
- Cut it!
- Yes!

255
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,160
Tell him to stop, or I'll strangle you!

256
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,239
Catch her!

257
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,609
Your Highness, do you want her dead or alive?

258
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:29,150
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes!

259
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,850
Wait!

260
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,249
- I want her alive.
- Yes.

261
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,440
Ye Xiwu, you have no other choice.

262
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,219
Just give up. Go back to the Jing Kingdom with me.

263
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:02,800
Who wants to go back with you!

264
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,369
Didn't you say you would kill me sooner or later?

265
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:06,830
You…

266
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,010
I am going to kill you.

267
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,779
But even the nonentities want to be alive.

268
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:16,540
Isn't it good to live for one or two more days?

269
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,360
Is that so?

270
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,510
Thank you so much, Your Highness.

271
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,450
It's a pity.

272
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,590
I don't want this kind of charity.

273
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,790
She jumped overboard!

274
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,540
She wanted to run away from me so much!

275
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,950
Lan'an, is she going to die?

276
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,970
- Qi Shuang.
- Here

277
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,659
Bring someone to look for Second Young Miss Ye.

278
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,400
Bring her back if she is alive.

279
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,680
Take her body back if she is dead.

280
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,120
Yes.

281
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,319
Imperial Father, I heard you ordered General Ye Qingyu to capture Tantai Jin.

282
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,030
I wonder… if you can let me do it instead.

283
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,779
Why?

284
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,459
Pardon my frankness. Tantai Jin has escaped back to his domain. It is difficult to stop him.

285
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:13,029
But there are many powerful forces in the states and counties along both sides of the river.

286
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,309
These forces are intertwined socially and politically.

287
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,240
It is difficult for us to collect taxes there every year.

288
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,509
If the Secret Dragon Guards can inspect the states and counties in the name of hunting the hostage prince

289
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:22,329
and check their repositories at the same time, we can punish someone as an example to others.

290
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:25,710
So, we can solve a big problem for the Sheng Kingdom.

291
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,590
My son is really smart.

292
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,239
You tried so hard.

293
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:37,469
You've thought out such a good idea for the Ye family, to let them atone for their faults.

294
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,699
The Ye family were negligent. They are indeed guilty.

295
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:44,979
But the two generals are both talented and useful for our country.

296
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,399
With the Ye family helping us, Jia Pass will be safe and the Great Sheng will be safe!

297
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,699
What's more, I've heard Tantai Minglang is cruel and sinister.

298
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:55,509
Even if we can't get Tantai Jin back, he has to fight with his brother after he returns.

299
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:58,850
For the Great Sheng, it might be a good thing.

300
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:06,530
That's what you really wanted to tell me today, am I right?

301
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:13,880
What? You've learned to say things you don't mean before me now.

302
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,680
I'm terrified.

303
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,720
All right. The Ye family is useful to us. A stumble may prevent a fall.

304
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,200
I'll give this favor to the Ye family for you.

305
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,849
Check the repositories while you're there.

306
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,330
I will reward you. Leave us.

307
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,430
Yes.

308
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,210
Tantai Jin has been a hostage in the Sheng Kingdom for many years.

309
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,180
His mother is of a different race. So, he has no foundation in the court at all.

310
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,970
He's nothing to be feared.

311
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,340
May I boldly ask why you always take him as an eyesore?

312
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,750
Because someone has been thinking about him all the time.

313
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,979
<i>[Memorial Tablet of Holy Emperor of Great Jing]</i>

314
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,750
<i>You are the eldest lineal son and my most capable son.</i>

315
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,310
<i>The Jing Kingdom is in your hands now.</i>

316
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,709
<i>Imperial Father, you entrust me with this. I'm really grateful.</i>

317
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:18,690
<i>Now, I only have one unfulfilled wish left.</i>

318
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,880
<i>Minglang, would you please fulfill my wish?</i>

319
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,409
<i>Your wish is the will of God. How dare I not fulfill it.</i>

320
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,210
<i>Please tell me.</i>

321
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,970
<i>I want to bring Tantai Jin back to the Jing Kingdom as soon as possible.</i>

322
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:46,490
<i>In this world… only his eyes look like Concubine Rou's.</i>

323
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,160
<i>I really want to see these eyes again.</i>

324
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,310
<i>Then I can rest in peace.</i>

325
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,010
<i>Is Concubine Rou the only regret you have in your life?</i>

326
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,150
<i>Have you forgotten why my mother died?</i>

327
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,709
<i>It was the first year after the temptress who could talk to animals entered the palace.</i>

328
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:15,430
<i>During the autumn hunt, you were attacked by a beast.</i>

329
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,300
<i>My mother died to save your life.</i>

330
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,889
<i>Everyone said it was the temptress who manipulated the beast to kill my mother.</i>

331
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:25,129
<i>But you are so partial and protective!</i>

332
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,389
<i>Don't bring up that old story again! It was only an accident.</i>

333
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:36,100
<i>There's a sharp question I've always wanted to ask you.</i>

334
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,990
<i>If Concubine Rou hadn't had a difficult delivery and Tantai Jin had been born safely,</i>

335
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,600
<i>would you still entrust me with the kingdom today?</i>

336
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,900
Jing kingdom will soon be mine.

337
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,899
<i>A man dies the way a lamp goes out. This is just your guess.</i>

338
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,620
<i>That's right.</i>

339
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,490
<i>A man dies...</i>

340
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,900
<i>the way a lamp goes out.</i>

341
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,420
Tantai Jin.

342
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,820
Your Highness.

343
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,190
Why is the boat slowing down?

344
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,260
I think we are approaching the confluence with the Mo River.

345
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,380
The Mo River is muddy and turbulent.

346
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,489
Every year, it breaks the dike. It's an unlucky river.

347
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,780
That's why the boat slows down when passing through it.

348
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,650
Oh. I came to tell Your Highness that Qi Shuang has sent a message back.

349
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,549
They have been searching the shore all night. Finally, they found Second Young Miss Ye.

350
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,189
I didn't dare to delay. So I asked them to wait for us at the ferry in the front.

351
00:31:36,189 --> 00:31:37,430
How is she?

352
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,260
Her life is not in danger. She choked on a lot of water.

353
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,880
I've said it. She won't get away.

354
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,540
Well done.

355
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,000
Let her take a break.

356
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,520
Take off the hood.

357
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,020
Yes.

358
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,120
- Your Highness!
- Protect His Highness.

359
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,159
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness!

360
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,999
- Are you okay, Your Highness?
- Your Highness!

361
00:33:54,999 --> 00:34:00,150
You took a poisonous demon core and were blinded by a poisoned needle.

362
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,960
How do you feel now?

363
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,430
Qi Shuang!

364
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,110
Why are you rebelling against our tribe?

365
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,620
Your Highness, let's retreat now.

366
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,820
<i>It is not good.</i>

367
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,460
Nian Baiyu, there are more enemies besides these scumbags.

368
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,489
- We don't have much time. Take the gangplank.
- Yes.

369
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,910
Stop!

370
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,019
- High Priestess.
- Tell them to surrender, or I will kill Tantai Jin right now!

371
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,970
Everyone, put down your weapons!

372
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,970
Excellent! Excellent indeed!

373
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,279
The High Priestess of the Yiyue tribe. You're very resourceful.

374
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,930
Somehow, you found a way to trick this idiot into docking.

375
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,430
It was a bloodless victory.

376
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,560
You've made a great achievement!

377
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,900
Your Highness, you're wise.

378
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,879
Your daughter has been set up for life. Her illness is almost cured.

379
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:12,900
You've done such a wonderful job. I'll send Fuya back to you when we return.

380
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,950
Thank you, Your Highness.

381
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,080
My third brother.

382
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,270
We meet again after so many years.

383
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,640
You do have the same eyes as that temptress.

384
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,760
What a pity. One is blinded.

385
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,490
Do you know?

386
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,930
When our old father died, he said he wanted to see these eyes again.

387
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,430
How about I grant him his wish today?

388
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,539
I'll dig out your eyes and put them in front of his memorial tablet.

389
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,200
What do you think?

390
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,980
You haven't changed since you were young.

391
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,560
You don't like to talk, but you like to bark like a dog.

392
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,830
Speak!

393
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,660
Say something!

394
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,010
Tantai Minglang,

395
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,950
why are you wasting time recalling past events?

396
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,850
I trusted the wrong person and fell for your trap.

397
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,230
I admit my loss.

398
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,480
Oh, my third brother. I'm not cruel by nature.

399
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,530
Even if you want to die soon, it depends on me to give you this grace.

400
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,519
Someone! Bring the gift.

401
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,580
Do you know how I got these scars on my body?

402
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,970
Whether I know is meaningless.

403
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,820
Apparently, it means a lot.

404
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,680
It's all thanks to you!

405
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,100
Me?

406
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,890
When I was six, Concubine Rou called wild beasts

407
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,430
to kill my mother during the autumn hunt.

408
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:59,640
Even though everyone knew no one other than Concubine Rou did it,
<i> [Memorial Tablet of Holy Empress of Jing]</i>

409
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,230
Imperial Father was partial to her and defended her.

410
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,790
He totally disregarded my mother's devotion and sacrifice.
<i>- Shut up!</i>

411
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,850
<i>Stop discussing this matter further. I have my own decision. </i>

412
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,990
My mother just passed away.

413
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,390
But Concubine Rou was pregnant.

414
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:22,110
Everyone in the palace said if she gave birth to a prince, she would definitely be the new queen.

415
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,200
Her son would become the future emperor of the Jing Kingdom.

416
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,620
<i>If Concubine Rou givesbirth to a prince…</i>

417
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,619
The servants who served me became more and more slack because of this.

418
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:38,360
One day in winter, a pot with no cover appeared in my chamber.

419
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,479
<i>- What happened?
- Something's wrong.</i>

420
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:45,130
I fell into the charcoal fire. My life was at stake.

421
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,770
<i>His Hignness…</i>

422
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,519
My imperial father, however, was coaxing Concubine Rou to take a nap. And he came very late.

423
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,200
I don't know how long I had been waiting.

424
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,680
He finally came. But he didn't even take a glance at me.

425
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,790
I only heard him say one sentence outside the room.

426
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:09,830
<i>Minglang has hurt his face and looks ominous now.</i>

427
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:14,870
<i>I'm afraid it will be difficult for him to inherit the throne.</i>

428
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,890
This is your and Concubine Rou's fault.

429
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,410
You must pay for it!

430
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,500
Try the coals' heat!

431
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:39,430
Your Highness! I promised to help you kill Tantai Jin,

432
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,430
but I didn't promise you I'd watch you torture him.

433
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:46,610
Shut up! See where you stand!

434
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,690
I know your story now, but your pain has nothing to do with me.

435
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:57,640
If you want revenge, you should go to Tantai Wuji! I don't owe you anything.

436
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,660
You do!

437
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,400
It's all your fault!

438
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,910
I'll make you suffer a thousand times more!

439
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,660
I will torture you until no one can recognize you.

440
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,380
I want you to get down on your knees and beg me to kill you!

441
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,700
Today, I can't escape.

442
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,230
But there is one thing I want to know.

443
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,160
Fine.

444
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:31,200
I will give you a chance and let you die after you get your answers.

445
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,140
Auntie.

446
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,310
Why did you betray me?

447
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,970
I shouldn't have betrayed you. It's my fault.

448
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,760
But… I have Fuya now.

449
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,870
She is my daughter.

450
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,600
It's just for your daughter.

451
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,560
You were not such a weak person.

452
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,470
Right.

453
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,850
I was not like this before.

454
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:58,040
But the love for someone becomes one's fetter.

455
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,850
I'm no longer indestructible.

456
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,750
A few years ago, Fuya got lost.

457
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,060
Prince Minglang helped me find her.

458
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,590
I want to be loyal to you, but I can't lose my daughter.

459
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,360
Before, I had no children.

460
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,320
I treated you as if you were my son.

461
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:27,120
But these years, God took pity on me and let me have a daughter.

462
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,130
You are gloomy and hard to understand.

463
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:34,910
But my daughter is pure and beautiful.

464
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:42,630
If I had to choose one person to save, nobody would select you.

465
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,590
Is that so?

466
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,690
What about the relationship between us?

467
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,710
- Can you bear to…
- Your Highness!

468
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:58,130
I already know the reason why Yingxin went crazy.

469
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:07,810
I don't believe you did it because of this traitor, Yingxin.

470
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,020
That was just the last straw.

471
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,450
It made me understand you cold-blooded,

472
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,610
heartless, and ungrateful.

473
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,710
She tried to kill me first.

474
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,350
Yingxin and I brought you up.

475
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:35,980
But for you, our betrayal

476
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,350
is no different than anyone else's!

477
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,640
We're not special. That's the worst part.

478
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:49,540
You take advantage of people who are good to you without burden.

479
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,609
For those who treat you badly, you can just kill them with no mercy. How can you do that?

480
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:57,850
- What's wrong with that?
- But this is inhuman!

481
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:05,030
I didn't expect I could use Ye Xiwu...

482
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:09,230
to set you up this time.

483
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,680
It was you who let Ye Xiwu go.

484
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,440
It was you who untied the Ruo-River rope for her.

485
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,200
And then, you lied that you found her to make the ship dock.

486
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:35,679
If you didn't go that way and if they boarded the boat by force, there would be more casualties. Am I right?

487
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,590
You see?

488
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:42,930
Once you fall for someone, you're not indestructible anymore.

489
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,540
You are wrong.

490
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:51,480
For me, Ye Xiwu isn't special at all.

491
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:57,470
Finally, you have little feelings for someone.

492
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:02,310
But I used her to kill you.

493
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,930
How ironic it is!

494
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,700
Auntie, let me ask you.

495
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,670
Do you regret betraying me?

496
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,250
My child,

497
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,110
I don't regret it.

498
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:50,050
Back then, in the deserted palace of the Jing Kingdom, I saved your life with the blood from my fingertips.

499
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,640
What goes around comes around.

500
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:04,070
Today, I will decide for you.

501
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,180
Okay.

502
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:14,480
Okay.

503
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,840
Great!

504
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Tantai Minglang.

505
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,590
Do it.

506
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,440
<i>There's something I want you to have.</i>

507
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,739
<i>I've heard people use this flower as a metaphor for mothers.</i>

508
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,040
<i>How about...</i>

509
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,860
<i>gifting this to you?</i>

510
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:40,139
Once the poison in your left eye spreads throughout your meridians, you'll spit blood three times and die.

511
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:42,819
There's no need to struggle.

512
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,450
This poison is so powerful.

513
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,300
Thanks for reminding me.

514
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,690
You're crazy!

515
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,070
How can you cut your wrist to release poisoned blood?

516
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,410
I'm not crazy.

517
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,530
I'm just curious.

518
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,810
Will I die of poison...

519
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,000
or die of excessive bleeding?

520
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,830
You're still resisting at the end of your life!

521
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,800
How pathetic!

522
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,670
Tantai Minglang.

523
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,570
Remember what you've done today.

524
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:40,770
From now on, you will never sleep in peace again.
