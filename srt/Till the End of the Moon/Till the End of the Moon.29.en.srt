18
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,510
Fortunately, you weren't hurt.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,080
General Ye, what are you doing?

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,170
His Majesty has gone crazy. Have you gone crazy, too?

21
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,870
If my sister sees what you've become now,

22
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,390
she will only be disgusted.

23
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,620
That's nonsense.

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,550
Why would she marry me...

25
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,270
if she found me disgusting?

26
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,510
And why would she treat me well?

27
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,500
In this world, only she treated me well.

28
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,920
Only she did…

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,370
I…

30
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,060
I…

31
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,290
Tantai Jin, I plead with you and with you on her behalf.

32
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,230
Please spare her and let her rest in peace with dignity.

33
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,950
What you gave her, she didn't want. And what she wanted from you, you always failed to fulfill.

34
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,590
She just wanted to leave you.

35
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,220
She was even willing to die for it.

36
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,570
Don't you understand?

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,500
<i>Heaven above!</i>

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,580
<i>I'm willing to give my body, my soul,</i>

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,480
<i>and my all.</i>

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,870
<i>In exchange, I only wish that you and I... </i>

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,920
<i>will never meet again forever.</i>

42
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,370
No…

43
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,000
No!

44
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
I don't want to…

45
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,010
I don't want to torture her.

46
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,830
I just want to be nice to her,

47
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,950
just like how she protected

48
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,540
and guarded me.

49
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,510
<i>It's awfully dirty. It'll make you sick.</i>

50
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,190
<i>I'm going to beat you up right now!</i>

51
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,740
<i>Why are you getting violent?</i>

52
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,460
<i>Love lingers even after only being married for a day.</i>

53
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,450
<i>Saving you is what I'm supposed to do, huh?</i>

54
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,580

59
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,540
<i>She wanted to leave so desperately...</i>

60
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,760

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,540
She did it.

64
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,920
Tantai Jin, your wife,

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,940
my sister, this woman called Ye Xiwu, is dead.

66
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,400
The deceased has passed. It's time to let her rest in peace.

67
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,700
I hope that you know how to do the right thing.

68
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,370
♫ <i>If fate is a calamity, I cannot help </i> ♫

69
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,660
♫ <i>But want to resolve it</i> ♫

70
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,580
General Ye, wait.

71
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,360
General!

72
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,710
His Majesty doesn't have many close confidants.

73
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,020
You are the only one who can advise him. You cannot leave like this.

74
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,620
My persuasion will be useless if he is stubbornly trapped in his own delusions.

75
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,050
I envy him, for he can be so crazy.

76
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,010
I also want to mourn my loved ones as he does.

77
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,440
But how many generals and civilians have died

78
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,340
in this war-torn country?

79
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,070
Jing is now in dire need of someone to revive the country,

80
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,360
but he is indulging in his own sorrow

81
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,670
and is unwilling to wake up.

82
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,970
Did my second sister, my father,

83
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,950
my eldest brother,

84
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,260
and Pianran all die in vain?

85
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,920
He wants to die with my second sister,

86
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,430
but what about me?

87
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,650
Why would I want to live miserably alone?

88
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,500
But I cannot let them die in vain.

89
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,840
The broken country and its people

90
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,270
need someone to carry it forward.

91
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,270
Can you understand how I feel?

92
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,210
Yes.

93
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,500
I may never be able to

94
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,950
be as crazy as His Majesty.

95
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,550
This is the consequence of those who have been through the horrors of war.

96
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,150
The first thing that comes to my mind is what to do with those who lived,

97
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,940
and who caused them...

98
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,520
to reach this point today.

99
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,360
The culprit, Tantai Minglang, was killed by His Majesty himself.

100
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,850
General Ye, who are you referring to?

101
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,890
Leader, they have found Ye Bingchang.

102
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,320
She wanted to leave the city in disguise but was recognized by the guards.

103
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,040
Should…

104
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,440
Should we lock her back up?

105
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,970
Leader Nian, can you bring Ye Bingchang here?

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,060
I have questions for her.

107
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,870
Why did you escape?

108
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,610
Qingyu, save me.

109
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,270
I don't want to be locked up again.

110
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,540
The dungeon is an abyss of darkness and I have had enough.

111
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
I also understand that I was wrong.

112
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,870
That day in the dungeon,

113
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,440
why did you try to kill my second sister?

114
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,250
If we were one moment late, she would have died there.

115
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,640
I told you, I was taking revenge.

116
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,380
Ye Xiwu caused Xiao Lin's death.

117
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,460
You're lying!

118
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,280
Ye Bingchang, later on, I thought about it over and over again.

119
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,070
You are her own sister.

120
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,830
If you wanted to kill her, you had many opportunities to do so.

121
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,180
There was no need to wait until she was thrown into prison.

122
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,810
Ye Qingyu, you are indeed the only smart person

123
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,850
in the entire Ye family, besides me.

124
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,240
I am also your sister.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,910
Are you really going to give me no way out

126
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,110
just because of Ye Xiwu?

127
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,310
Don't compare yourself with Second Sister.

128
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,920
What you've been doing has made you disqualified from being a member of the Ye family since long ago.

129
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,950
Is that so, Ye Qingyu?

130
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,310
What right do you have to criticize me from a high and mighty position?

131
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,340
Throughout history, the winners have always took it all.

132
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,540
If Xiao Lin had conquered the world,

133
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,000
it would be Ye Xiwu who would be kneeling here today, being spurned by you.

134
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,310
All right, since you want to know the truth so badly,

135
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,890
I will tell you.

136
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,210
I tried to kill Ye Xiwu

137
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,460
because I didn't want the truth

138
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,640
about the poisoned porridge to be exposed one day.

139
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,940
Poisoned porridge?

140
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,240
Yes. Ye Xiwu wanted to please Tantai Jin.

141
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,560
She couldn't cook but insisted on making porridge.

142
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,440
So I decided to

143
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,260
put some poison in the porridge.

144
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,940
What did you say?

145
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,550
What about Grandmother?

146
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,010
You knew the porridge was poisoned, and yet you still gave it to Grandmother!

147
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,890
That's right.

148
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,440
I wanted her to die with Tantai Jin

149
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
and Ye Xiwu.

150
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,110
Ye Bingchang,

151
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,590
you are out of your mind!

152
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,820
Not at all!

153
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,380
I was very clear-headed. I just didn't want to tolerate this anymore.

154
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,180
The old lady sided with Ye Xiwu and only loved her.

155
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,300
Since she liked Ye Xiwu so much,

156
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,000
I could just fulfill her wish.

157
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,100
Then, why did you want to fatally poison Tantai Jin?

158
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Tantai Jin!

159
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,990
It's all because of him that Xiao Lin was nothing.

160
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,870
I lost everything.

161
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,890
Later,

162
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,310
he even took away the love threads.

163
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,310
Yet he still wanted me to live,

164
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,070
but I could not accept it.

165
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,480
I wouldn't have fallen to this point if it weren't for him.

166
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,540
I see.

167
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,310
If it weren't for you, Xiao Lin wouldn't have died.

168
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,100
I thought Ye Xiwu wanted to kill me for Xiao Lin,

169
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,000
so that was why everything happened afterward.

170
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,830
<i>Open your mouth.</i>

171
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,900
You wanted to kill me,

172
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,240
but you had Xiao Lin killed.

173
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,240
Since then, Ye Xiwu hated me to the bone,

174
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,800
which led to where we are today.

175
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,780
Nonsense!

176
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,970
It wasn't me!

177
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,200
It was you!

178
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,680
You and Ye Xiwu had Xiao Lin killed!

179
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,040
Ye Bingchang,

180
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,600
Xiao Lin entrusted me to spare your life before his death,

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,660
so what should I do now?

182
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,970
I never liked this world,

183
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,220
but Ye Xiwu is different.

184
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,600
She loved this world.

185
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,420
She wanted to give love

186
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,790
even to widows and orphans,

187
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,160
to refugees and the common people.

188
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,920
That's why I wanted to try...

189
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,010
to love this world like she did.

190
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,530
But now that...

191
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,490
Ye Xiwu is dead,

192
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,260
my heart is dead, too.

193
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,030
I want to hate everything,

194
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,620
but Ye Xiwu won't be happy about it.

195
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,480
Ye Bingchang,

196
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,560
If you like porridge so much,

197
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,760
I'll let you have enough of it.

198
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,430
Yes!

199
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,980
Let me out!

200
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,770
Let me out!

201
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,650
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

202
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,180
<i>Tantai Jin!</i>

203
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,120
You're awake!

204
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,180
Don't sleep here. You'll catch a cold.

205
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,200
I know what I'm doing.

206
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,830
What are you doing?

207
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,020
Once you start reading memorials, you never take a break.

208
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,480
Even if you want to become a good king who works hard for the people,

209
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,230
you cannot harm your own body.

210
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

211
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,030
I won't run away all of a sudden.

212
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,410
Ye Xiwu,

213
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,620
what do you really want to do by coming to my side?

214
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,840
Yes,

215
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,540
I should have left.

216
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,860
Ye Xiwu!

217
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,660
Ye Xiwu!

218
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,630
Ye Xiwu!

219
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,720
Ye Xiwu!

220
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,060
Ye Xiwu!

221
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,710
<i>Xiao Lin, why did you die?</i>

222
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,080
<i>Why didn't you come and save me?</i>

223
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,980
<i>The one I wanted to kill was Tantai Jin!</i>

224
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,030
<i>Now you are dead.</i>

225
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,660
<i>What is the use of your dying wish?</i>

226
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,700
<i>Tantai Jin still wants to kill me.</i>

227
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,550
Pang Yizhi?

228
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,350
Ye Bingchang.

229
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,460
Why are you here?

230
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,510
Are you here to save me?

231
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,690
You deserve your punishment,

232
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,190
so I won't save you.

233
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,240
However, Xiao Lin left something with me

234
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,370
before his death

235
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,520
and asked me to find an opportunity to give it to you.

236
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,560
It's a letter from him.

237
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,210
Wife…

238
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,740
He still acknowledged me as his wife.

239
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,740
But it's a little late.

240
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,260
Xiao Lin was upright and loyal,

241
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,700
but how did you treat him?

242
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,570
Upright

243
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,650
and loyal…

244
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,140
What does that have to do with me?

245
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,210
That's all I can say.

246
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,560
<i>[To my wife, Bingchang]</i>

247
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,960
<i>Bingchang, things have come to this point.</i>

248
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,170
<i>I no longer care about the letter you wrote asking me to save you</i>

249
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,740
<i>or whether you ever plotted against me.</i>

250
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,890
<i>We are a married couple,</i>

251
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,890
<i>and there are some things I still want you to know.</i>

252
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,210
<i>It is said that the closest people can sometimes be the least close.</i>

253
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,520
<i>In the past, I was constantly distressed,</i>

254
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,710
<i>feeling that no matter how hard I tried,</i>

255
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,190
<i>I could not win your complete trust.</i>

256
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,400
<i>It was not until the day I learned about the Love Threads incident</i>

257
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,420
<i>that I finally understood</i>

258
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,210
<i>why you always seemed so uneasy.</i>

259
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,200
<i>You were worried that the love you received was all false, weren't you?</i>

260
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,260
<i>Bingchang, actually,</i>

261
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,650
<i>whether you had that strand of Love Threads or not,</i>

262
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,930

264
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,370
<i>In the late spring of that year,</i>

265
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,390
<i>you and the women of the Ye family went outside the city to worship ancestors,</i>

266
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,740
<i>and you got off the carriage alone to take a walk.</i>

267
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,060
<i>I still remember how happy you were</i>

268
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,170
<i>because of a cluster of blackberry roses...</i>

269
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,660
<i>and how beautiful your smile was.</i>

270
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,060
<i>Blackberry roses do not compete with other flowers during springtime</i>

271
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,190
<i>and bloom the latest in loneliness.</i>

272
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,560
<i>I will remember your look...</i>

He went to the royal tomb early this morning,

and he promised to bury Xiwu with the ceremony of a queen in a few days.

355
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,600
you belong only to me

356
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,750
and I belong only to you.

357
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,040
Despite the changes in the world,

358
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,300
we will remain steadfast.

359
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,030
We will keep our promise together this time,

360
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,820
so you will belong to me forever.

let's go home together.

<i>Get more water!</i>

378
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,300
<i>Hurry!</i>

379
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,060
Sir, we have searched through the ruins, but found nothing.

380
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,720
His Majesty must have had a plan and left the letter in the study in advance.

381
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,790
A country cannot be without a ruler for even a day.

382
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,500
His Majesty entrusted in the letter,

383
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,330
instructing you to find a capable member

384
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,020
from a branch of the Tantai family

385
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,860
to inherit the throne.

386
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,700
For the stability of the kingdom,

387
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,580
you must complete His Majesty's request.

388
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,930
Yes.

389
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,590
Too many people have died.

390
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,630
I can't believe it has been ten thousand years already.

391
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,370
I never thought that you and I

392
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,800
would have a chance to meet again.

393
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,700
Siying?

394
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,360
That's right.

395
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,050
We both lived.

396
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,510
But we never got to meet His Lordship.

397
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,070
Don't be sad. It has been ten thousand years.

398
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,300
It's time...

399
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,940
to welcome the new Devil Lord.

400
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,430
True.

401
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,800
As long as the evil bone remains,

402
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,900
His Lordship will never disappear.

403
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,310
Now that the Barren Abyss Barrier is unsealed,

404
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,880
from today onwards,

405
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,770
even if I have to travel across the Four Continents and Three Realms,

406
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,330
I will find a trail of the new Devil Lord.

407
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,530
But with such boundless crowds,

408
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,350
where should I start my search?

409
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,460
The bank of Ruo River.

410
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,950
I heard the bank of the Ruo River

411
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,900
is where the spirits of the dead gather.

412
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,320
But His Lordship is a devil god.

413
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,690
Would his spirit be there?

414
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,820
His Lordship certainly would not mingle with the ordinary.

415
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,970
However, I heard that back then,

416
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,520
His Lordship made a special agreement

417
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,000
with the Yiyue tribe at the bank of the Ruo River.

418
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,800
Why don't we start our search from there?

419
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,560
Good idea.

420
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,080
Now that we have been revived,

421
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,390
it's time for us to reunite and restore

422
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,980
the Devil Realm for His Lordship.

423
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,550
It's been ten thousand years. Do you still recognize us?

424
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,560
I am the Demon of Drought, Siying.

425
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,140
Today, under the command of the Devil Lord, I order you

426
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,690
to find the Devil Lord and restore Barren Abyss.

427
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,650
Those who refuse to obey shall be killed!

428
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,860
<i>Devil Lord!</i>

429
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,870
<i>Devil Lord!</i>

430
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,000
<i>Devil Lord!</i>

431
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,420
<i>Devil Lord!</i>

432
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,520
<i>Devil Lord!</i>

433
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,950
<i>The Ruo River, guarded by the Yiyue tribe, is also the Nether River.</i>

434
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,530
<i>When the moon turns into an underworld moon,</i>

435
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:52,250
<i>the Yiyue tribe can use their secret spells to open the Gate of Underworld Moon</i>

436
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,880
<i>and enter the place where souls gather.</i>

437
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,960
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

438
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,990
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

439
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,010
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

440
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,540
<i>Ye Xiwu.</i>

441
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,590
<i>Go away!</i>

442
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,430
<i>Your Majesty! You can't stay here.</i>

443
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,340
<i>Let go!</i>

444
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,300
<i>Your Majesty, I know that rescuing you is against your will.</i>

445
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,060
<i>However, I know of a way for you to see Ye Xiwu again.</i>

446
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,760
<i>Ye Xiwu is right here.</i>

447
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,670
<i>I'm not going anywhere. Go away!</i>

448
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,480
<i>- Your Majesty!</i>
<i>- Nian Baiyu!</i>

449
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,700
<i>The Ruo River, guarded by the Yiyue tribe, is also the Nether River.</i>

450
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,510
<i>I can tell you where to find Ye Xiwu's soul.</i>

451
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,630
<i>What did you say?</i>

452
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,130
<i>But, Lord, are you sure you want to go in?</i>

453
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,860
<i>The Gate of Underworld Moon has been opened a few times,</i>

454
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,940
<i>but the people who entered never came back.</i>

455
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,220
Brother, will you come back?

456
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,420
Lord, there is no end or way out in there.

457
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,530
How will you come back?

458
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,650
Nian Baiyu, thank you for your helping me this whole time.

459
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,530
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

460
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,100
<i>where are you?</i>

461
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,460
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

462
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
<i>where are you?</i>

463
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,670
Lord…

464
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,950
Here, freshly boiled milk tea.

465
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,870
Thanks, Sister.

466
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,180
Baiyu, stop feeling sad.

467
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,230
Every man has his destiny. You have done everything you can.

468
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,020
Sister. Mom.

469
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,110
Do you think the Lord can find who he wants to meet?

470
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,140
This type of thing is up to how sincere one's heart is.

471
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,680
Who knows? There are thousands of souls in there.

472
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,560
Even if he can resist the erosion of the Ruo Water,

473
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,350
how long will it take for him to recognize each soul one by one?

474
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,980
<i>Ye Xiwu, where are you?</i>

475
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,390
<i>Look. It's him again. He has been here for several months.</i>

476
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,980
<i>Who is he looking for?</i>

477
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,000
<i>I don't know.</i>

478
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,390
<i>Let's ask him. Who are you looking for?</i>

479
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,850
<i>Ye Xiwu. I'm looking for her.</i>

480
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,260
<i>Can you help me find Ye Xiwu?</i>

481
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,780
<i>Ye Xiwu? Is the one you are looking for called Ye Xiwu?</i>

482
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,880
<i>Yes. Ye Xiwu.</i>

483
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,000
<i>There are so many souls here, and we don't know them all.</i>

484
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,800
<i>But perhaps the one you're looking for is in the depths of the Nether River.</i>

485
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,160
<i>However…</i>

486
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,140
Ye Xiwu, where is she?

487
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,140
<i>Tantai Jin, you are here.</i>

488
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,380
<i>Ye Xiwu!</i>

489
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,480
<i>Tantai Jin, long time no see.</i>

490
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,720
Ye Xiwu, you are really here!

491
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,180
<i>You finally came.</i>

492
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,280
It's really you!

493
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,900
Ye Xiwu!

494
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,840
Where did you go? No!

495
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,830
Ye Xiwu!

496
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,700
Ye Xiwu!

497
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,140
Ye Xiwu!

498
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,830
Ye Xiwu!

499
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,530
Mortal bodies will be tempted by the Ruo Water and see illusions,

500
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,970
and in the end, they will be devoured.

501
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,520
Ye Xiwu, you must be in the Nether River.

502
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,310
I will find you!

503
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,340
Instead of letting you perish, let us take you to find her.

504
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,610
Get on the boat. You won't be hurt as long as you don't touch the water.

00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,980
<i>Yes.</i>

529
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,070
♫ <i>Being sober is too cruel</i> ♫

530
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,620
<i>I will...</i>

531
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,140
<i>keep looking,</i>

532
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,640
<i>and keep doing this,</i>

533
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,760
<i>until my life is over.</i>

534
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,000
♫ <i>You alone animated the whole mortal world</i> ♫

535
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,500
Baiyu,

536
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,820
where did you go?

537
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,320
Mom,

538
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,140
I just went to the bank of the Ruo River to check if Lord was back or not.

539
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,800
You know very well that

540
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,980
the Gate of Underworld Moon only opens once every 500 years.

541
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,120
Your lord entered it

542
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,980
and there's no way he will come back.

543
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,520
Baiyu, since you are already back here, just let go of the past,

544
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,700
and live your life well.

545
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,640
Yes, Baiyu.

546
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,000
The girl I talked to you about last time,

547
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,500
do you really not want to meet her?

548
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,360
Maybe I should really forget about His Lordship.

549
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,040
Yes, live your own life.

550
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,680
Mom and Sister, go home. I will go and check it out.

551
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,180
<i>- Run!</i>
- Be careful!

552
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,360
<i>Hurry up!</i>

553
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,960
It's not fun to kill him.

554
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,080
Why don't we just keep him alive,

555
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,420
in case he might come in handy in the future?

556
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,140
Let's go.

557
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,040
Let's look for the demonic fetus.

558
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,340
I don't know how long it will take

559
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,480
to look through them one by one.

560
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,280
<i>Lord,</i>

561
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,420
<i>I won't be able to wait for your return.</i>

562
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,180
<i>I found two dandelions in your precious Royal Garden.</i>

563
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,180
<i>Surprisingly, they have not been removed by the gardeners.</i>

564
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,140
<i>They are really fortunate.</i>

565
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,860
<i>I heard that you could make wishes on dandelions,</i>

566
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,120
<i>so I dug them up.</i>

567
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,040
<i>My hands…</i>

568
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,480
<i>Why?</i>

569
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:55,380
<i>Now I'm taking your evil bone...</i>

570
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,100
<i>and paying you back with the divine essence.</i>

571
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,780
<i>You won't become the Devil Lord anymore.</i>

572
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,900
Ye Xiwu,

573
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,740
is the divine essence you gave me healing me?

574
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,440
<i>You let me live,</i>

575
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,820
but also made me suffer...

576
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,100
the pain of shredding me in pieces again and again.

577
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,060
Is this your revenge on me?

578
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,280
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

579
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,000
<i>As long as it's from you,</i>

580
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,680
<i>I will accept it.</i>

581
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,140
<i>Why are you still not giving up?</i>

582
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,960
<i>No…</i>

583
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,020
<i>She is still somewhere in here.</i>

584
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,460
<i>I will definitely find her.</i>

585
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,820
<i>Who is he?</i>

586
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,160
<i>A pitiful person.</i>

587
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,260
<i>In order to find his deceased lover,</i>

588
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,320
<i>he has been searching in the Nether River for a hundred years,</i>

589
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,200
<i>but still hasn't found her.</i>

590
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,280
<i>World-Alluring Jade…</i>

591
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,400
<i>Can it help me find Ye Xiwu's soul?</i>

592
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,580
<i>She bore the curse of a violent death for me.</i>

593
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,420
<i>Please give me a chance to repay her.</i>

594
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,320
<i>Ye Xiwu, when can I find you?</i>

595
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,720
<i>[Four hundred years later]</i>

596
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,620
Today, I will tell you a secret story.

597
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,020
It is said that five hundred years ago,

598
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,740
the king was named Tantai Jin.

599
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,040
Legend has it that he was born by killing his mother,

600
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,460
which was extremely ominous,

601
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:37,560
but he unified Jing and Sheng and achieved greatness.

602
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,040
Nobody knows that he once burned down the Palace of Jing

603
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,500
for a woman,

604
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,540
and was burned so badly that his face was destroyed.

605
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,320
To commemorate him,

606
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,540
the Tantai family's generations of kings

607
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,160
have all worn masks

608
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,640
- <i>Tantai Jin…</i>
- to cover their faces.

609
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,300
There is another secret story

610
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,240
that said the Devil Lord would appear in the world again

611
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,220
in 500 years, which is now.

612
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,960
There are too many rumors about the world ending.

613
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,160
Someone also said that Devil Lord would end the world last year, but what happened?

614
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,700
Nothing.

615
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,220
<i>The healing power of divine essence is getting weaker and weaker.</i>

616
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,680
<i>I'm afraid my body has reached its limit.</i>

617
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,560
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

618
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,220
<i>even if I were to die today,</i>

619
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,840
<i>I will still search for you for another day.</i>

620
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,620
<i>After I die,</i>

621
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,660
<i>my soul can merge with this Nether Water,</i>

622
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,040
<i>and I will continue to seek you.</i>

623
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,940
<i>Are you still not giving up?</i>

624
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,900
<i>Sir, why are you still not giving up?</i>

625
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,600
<i>Don't waste your breath with him.</i>

626
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,980
<i>After being washed by the Ruo Water for 500 years,</i>

627
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,280
<i>he can no longer hear anything.</i>

628
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,180
<i>Tantai Jin.</i>

629
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,800
<i> Tantai Jin, go back with me.</i>

630
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,420
<i>Don't you get too carried away.</i>

631
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,640
<i>I never said I'd spend the rest of my life with you.</i>

632
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,140
<i>Ye Xiwu, I'm coming for you.</i>
