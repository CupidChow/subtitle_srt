<i>[Episode 24]</i>

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,430
Your Majesty, since I returned from the Sheng Kingdom,

19
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,850
Xiao Lin and I have already broken off our relationship completely.

20
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,790
Eldest Sister, you…

21
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,590
But your husband has deep feelings for you.

22
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,760
Xiao Lin risked his life to come and assassinate me tonight,

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,920
luring all the guards to me in order to help you escape.

24
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,500
Even I couldn't help but be moved by such affection.

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,040
I wonder, Mrs. Xuancheng, what are your thoughts on this?

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,880
No matter what Xiao Lin does,

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,830
I have nothing to do with it.

28
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,740
My heart is only devoted to you, Your Majesty,

29
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,850
and will remain unchanged throughout my life.

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,420
- Really?
- I swear on my life.

31
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,810
Haven't you been well with Eldest Sister?

32
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,050
Why did she say such words?

33
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,140
All right, you may stand up.

34
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,590
You are the heroine today, and I should reward you.

35
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,040
What's General Ye doing here?

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,290
To be a good guy?

37
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,520
Qingyu, speak.

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,730
When I was at the Vermilion Bird Gate, I saw Eldest Sister and Pianran

39
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,600
and heard them arguing.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,060
I stopped Pianran before she hit Eldest Sister.

41
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,060
Arguing for what?

42
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,760
About love threads.

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,800
Pianran, what are love threads?

44
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,400
<i>All intelligent beings have love threads.</i>

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,770
<i>Only with love threads can you love someone.</i>

46
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,000
<i>But my love threads are lost.</i>

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,140
<i>How did you lose your love threads?</i>

48
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,160
<i>Why would I tell you?</i>

49
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,100
Fine.

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,050
Then... you tell me.

51
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,810
I…

52
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,960
I don't know what they are talking about.

53
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,940
Is that so?

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,040
Baiyu, I heard

55
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,960
recently, the Moonshadow Guards have developed a new demonic poison.

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,170
It can cause a person to

57
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,200
die a painful death within ten days,

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,070
but it also makes them speak without reservation.

59
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,030
I heard that it is quite effective.

60
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,860
- Your Majesty.
- Mrs. Xuancheng, if you don't want to speak,

62
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,900
you shall try the new poison for me.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,060
Your Majesty, you just gave me credit and wanted to reward me.

64
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,980
They are not the same thing.

65
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,770
You can use the credit to offset your mistakes.

66
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,870
After you try the poison, I can consider keeping you alive.

67
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,460
Are you going to speak now,

68
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,060
or take the poison and then speak?

69
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,800
I will tell the truth.

70
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,980
It happened seven years ago.

71
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,260
At that time, I had just turned 16 years old

72
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,500
and was proud and arrogant.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,600
<i>Jiahui, am I similar to this wildflower?</i>

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,650
<i>So weak and invisible…</i>

75
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,310
<i>In the Pillar of the State General's flourishing mansion,</i>

76
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,900
<i>who would notice such an unremarkable wildflower?</i>

77
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,340
<i>Miss, don't say that.</i>

78
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,280
<i>You are beautiful and talented,</i>

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,020
<i>and you will surely marry the perfect man someday.</i>

80
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,730
<i>How could someone like me ever deserve a perfect husband?</i>

81
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,930
<i>Jiahui, go to the temple and ask for a safety charm on my behalf.</i>

82
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,010
<i>Hand it over to Grandma for me.</i>

83
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,320
<i>How about you, Miss?</i>

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,830
<i>It's not far from the city gate here.</i>

85
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,750
<i>I will walk back, considering it an excursion.</i>

86
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,190
<i>Miss, please hold on for a second.</i>

87
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,020
<i>Are you okay?</i>

88
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,380
<i>I'm going to die soon.</i>

89
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,750
<i>Miss, could you do me a favor?</i>

90
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,530
<i>Are you from the capital of Sheng?</i>

91
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,660
<i>The girl I love is also in the capital.</i>

92
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,900
<i>I want to see her one last time.</i>

93
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,090
<i>- Thanks.
- I want to return what belongs to her.</i>

94
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,150
<i>Unfortunately…</i>

95
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,540
<i>She lives in the innermost house of</i>

96
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,550
<i>Orchid Alley in the city.</i>

97
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,570
<i>Please tell Pianran that</i>

98
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,490
<i>I, Jiang Rao, am just an ordinary man.</i>

99
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,070
<i>I'm not lucky enough to grow old with her.</i>

100
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,410
<i>Receiving her love threads</i>

101
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,720
<i>was already a great fortune in my life. I now return them</i>

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,570
<i>and hope that she will find happiness and a wonderful relationship.</i>

103
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,900
<i>I wish her a life full of joy and happiness.</i>

104
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:46,430
<i>I'm sorry that I couldn't keep my promise.</i>

105
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,520
She looked so gorgeous

106
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,580
and had a lover who was so devoted to her,

107
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,770
yet I had nothing.

108
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,670
At that time, a wonderful power shrouded me,

109
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,500
and it felt amazing,

110
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,820
making me confused.

111
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,950
<i>Who is it? Who's out there?</i>

112
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,570
<i>Jiang Rao.</i>

113
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,240
<i>Was that you?</i>

114
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,340
I didn't know if it was because of the love threads.

115
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,040
Later on, my looks became more and more beautiful.

116
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,470
Men of all ages in the capital

117
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,860
were all captivated by me.

118
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,420
I only knew that those things were called love threads,

119
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,220
but I didn't know what they were.

120
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,150
Back then, I was greedy and foolish

121
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,700
and accidentally kept them for me.

122
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,400
You didn't even know what they were,

123
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,580
and you took them for your own.

124
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,530
You knew that Jiang Rao died with a heart full of regret,

125
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,450
but you were not even willing to tell Pianran about his death.

126
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,140
I never thought that

127
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,450
Eldest Sister was such a person.

128
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,020
<i>It wasn't an illusion.</i>

129
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,550
<i>What grew in my heart were love threads.</i>

130
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,800
Even wanting to take someone else's love threads for yourself.

131
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,790
You're truly despicable, Ye Bingchang.

132
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,840
Tantai Jin, don't kill her!

133
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,580
Second Elder Sister! Second Elder Sister!

134
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,390
She stole these, so she should give them back.

135
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,140
<i>So these are love threads.</i>

136
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,560
You said that women's misfortunes often come from their loved ones.

137
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,670
I did possess this female demon's love threads,

138
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:53,500
but I only received a little bit of attention and admiration from others.

139
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,300
The promises of eternal love and devotion that you gave me

140
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,570
were just because of the love threads.

141
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,340
Ye Qingyu and Ye Xiwu,

142
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,690
you were born with everything you wanted.

143
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,550
What did I own?

144
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,720
Now you are even taking these from me.

145
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,830
I have nothing left.

146
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,930
Are you satisfied?

147
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,360
<i>If it wasn't for Ye Xiwu enabling me to have love threads</i>

148
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,080
<i>and know the feeling of love,</i>

149
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,170
<i>I'm afraid I would never have been able to experience it.</i>

150
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,400
Keep what belongs to you.

151
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,450
Take Xiao Lin to the prison, strip Ye Bingchang of her title as Mrs. Xuancheng,

152
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,230
and from tomorrow, make her a slave in the palace prison.

153
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,860
Yes.

154
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,540
<i>[Chenming Hall]</i>

155
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,950
Are you here to persuade me or pity me?

156
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,480
When I was sad that day, you had dinner with me,

157
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,300
and today, when you are sad,

158
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,380
I can accompany you for a drink.

159
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,290
The river your elder sister mentioned,

160
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,450
back then,

161
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,720
I met Jiang Rao there.

162
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,440
He was watering his horse by the river,

163
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,710
but I thought he was a creep spying on me taking a bath.

164
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,430
Without allowing him to explain,

165
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,290
I slapped him many times,

166
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,670
and he was stunned.

167
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,440
That river is very close to the capital of Sheng.

168
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,520
It's so close that...

169
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,810
the slowest person...

170
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,750
can even walk home, although 30 minutes late.

171
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,020
He was so close,

172
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,920
just a little bit,

173
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,480
and he could go home.

174
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,530
I'd waited for him for so long.

175
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,310
Every day at home, I counted the days on my fingers.

176
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,260
I waited for him for more than a thousand days.

177
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,640
I know.

178
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,450
You must have waited for a long, long time.

179
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:04,520
♫ <i>For a short rendezvous</i> ♫

180
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,610
♫ <i>All dreams fall gracefully</i> ♫

181
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:16,270
Later, I went to the Jia Pass to look for his corpse.

182
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,750
I looked for him for years, but I heard nothing.

183
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,210
I had no idea that he just died like that,

184
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,240
outside the city, with no one knowing.

185
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,110
♫ <i>I wish I never disappointed you the moment we met</i> ♫

186
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,670
How ridiculous.

187
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,940
♫ <i>I have loved and suffered. Do not ridicule me for my infatuation</i> ♫

188
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,820
♫ <i>I have wept and smiled, living for one person</i> ♫

189
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,380
♫ <i>If I cannot entrust myself to you without regret in this life</i> ♫

190
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,500
♫ <i>Even if my heart follows the prosperity, it will be difficult to walk away</i> ♫

191
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,600
♫ <i>Thank the heavens for not looking down on God's will</i> ♫

192
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,560
♫ <i>I'm grateful that you never gave up our time together</i> ♫

193
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,840
♫ <i>I'm thankful for all your joy and sorrow, and for bestowing me with memories of you</i> ♫

194
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,380
♫ <i>Even if there is no return date, I am content</i> ♫

195
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,280
Can you stop moving, all right?

196
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,660
Or the bed will fall apart.

197
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,660
I thought you wanted to comfort me,

198
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,210
but why are you having a hard time going to sleep?

199
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,780
Tantai Jin, do you think if my eldest sister wasn't a daughter of a concubine

200
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,050
and was treated with more love and care at home,

201
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,430
would she have ended up differently?

202
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,830
Why aren't you thinking about sleeping but her this late at night?

203
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,290
Why are you asking me? Aren't you the same?

204
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,150
What are you thinking about?

205
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,130
I'm thinking...

206
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,550
perhaps the reason why I used to be emotionless and heartless...

207
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,370
was that I didn't have any love threads.

208
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,060
<i>Young Devil Lord guessed it right.</i>

209
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,720
Ye Xiwu,

210
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,690
what would it feel like

211
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,200
to have love threads?

212
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,140
It's probably this feeling.

213
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,620
Go to sleep.

214
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,330
<i>Fuyu,</i>

215
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,310
<i>how many more days until this formation is completed?</i>

216
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,310
<i>Your Highness, three days will do.</i>

217
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,540
<i>In three days, </i>

218
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,060
<i>there will be no living creature left within the southern border.</i>

219
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,640
<i>How is the preparation for the Puppet Soldiers going?</i>

220
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,810
Your Highness,

221
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,050
the warlocks have been working day and night to refine them,

222
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,250
and now there are more than ten thousand Nether Puppet Soldiers for you to command.

223
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,040
Too few.

224
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,170
From today on, ask them to accelerate the refining of the demon soldiers.

225
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,160
I can't wait too long.

226
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,880
I will think of some solutions.

227
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,300
<i>[Chenming Hall]</i>

228
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,110
That's all. It's all done.

229
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,450
By the way, I want to go out to relax in a few days.

230
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,370
Approved.

231
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,780
Tantai Jin, you've got a conscience now.

232
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,540
If you keep babbling, no more days off.

233
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,580
All right, all right.

234
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,350
What is it?

235
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,780
Your Majesty, I want to take a day off.

236
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,940
General Ye, since you became a court official, you have never rested for a day.

237
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,380
You can take a break.

238
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,610
It is right and proper that officials have a day off every five days.

239
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,010
Thanks. You can put the food there.

240
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,690
Second Young Miss, what are you doing here?

241
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,740
Take this.

242
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm not short of food and clothing here.

243
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,840
Tantai Jin does not mistreat me.

244
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,530
Dad and Grandma asked me to bring you this.

245
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,810
They care about you, so just take it.

246
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,650
Thanks.

247
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,930
Does Tantai Jin know that you are here?

248
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:08,370
I will leave quickly after visiting you, so I don't need to tell him.

249
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,860
I have nothing to do here all day,

250
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,180
and it's even more comfortable than being in the barracks.

251
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,830
Go back quickly.

252
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,380
What are you planning to do?

253
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,000
What do you mean?

254
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,340
Where is Pang Yizhi?

255
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,550
Where are Sheng's remaining troops?

256
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,780
I knew something was up with you.

257
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,080
Xiao Lin, you can trust me.

258
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,630
What do you really want to do? I can definitely help you.

259
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,480
You don't need to help.

260
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,540
At this point, I can only resign myself to my fate and await death.

261
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,170
Tantai Jin won't kill you.

262
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,890
I know he won't.

263
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,930
But he will never release me from the Jing prison, either.

264
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,680
What on earth do you want?

265
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,120
Pang Yizhi will take at least six days to return to the remaining troops.

266
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,190
If I could escape after the assassination,

267
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,910
I would lead the remaining troops to recapture Jing's prisoners of war

268
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,000
and take them south across the sea in six days.

269
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,060
If I can't escape,

270
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,320
Pang Yizhi will lead the remnant troops and refugees to leave.

271
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,900
No need to wait for me.

272
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,540
What about you?

273
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,450
Sheng Kingdom can have generals who die in battles but not a crown prince who defects.

274
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,730
When Sheng was breached,

275
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,510
I should have been buried with the kingdom.

276
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,350
Come back here!

277
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,420
How can you be so stubborn?

278
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Second Young Miss, as long as I'm alive,

279
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,060
this last elite army will fight to the death for me.

280
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,690
But now,

281
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,680
Sheng is nearing its end.

282
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,170
Tantai Jin is a great leader.

283
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:00,200
With him, the people of Sheng can still enjoy peace.

284
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,270
Only when I am dead,

285
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,600
and the hope of Sheng Kingdom's revival is shattered,

286
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,980
can this war truly end

287
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,350
and the bloodshed stop.

288
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,250
So this time, you came

289
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,820
with the intention to die.

290
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,190
Yeah. We all have our own aspirations.

291
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,690
Don't feel sad for me, Second Young Miss.

292
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,250
Just wait here.

293
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,670
Within six days, I'll figure out a way

294
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,410
to let you leave with the Sheng Army.

295
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,740
This is too risky. Please don't take any chances.

296
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,440
Wait for my news.

297
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,160
Second Young Miss.

298
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,740
Actually,

299
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,870
you're not Ye Xiwu. Right?

300
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,780
Why do you say that?

301
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,090
I've known Ye Xiwu since little.

302
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,350
She wouldn't fight for others

303
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,530
or go on a mission alone.

304
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,990
Not to mention risking her life to save me.

305
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,840
After Enlightened Life,

306
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,780
when we were parting by the Mo River,

307
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,680
I was already certain of it.

308
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,200
Sixth Prince, I…

309
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,380
No need to explain.

310
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,580
This must be a most mysterious thing

311
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,090
not to be told to others.

312
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,480
Rest assured. I won't mention it to anyone,

313
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,850
whether I live or die this time.

314
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,640
Just go.

315
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,270
Wait for me to save you.

316
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,220
For how long?

317
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,640
A quarter of an hour at most.

318
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,850
What did they talk about?

319
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:17,300
I was too far away to hear clearly.

320
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,650
At least you could see clearly.

321
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,350
They…

322
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,660
What? Was it so hard to describe?

323
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,390
First, Xiao Lin put his hand on Miss Ye's face.

324
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,510
Miss Ye dragged his clothes vigorously.

325
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,120
And then Miss Ye left.

326
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,700
That's all.

327
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,040
Nian Baiyu, if this happens again,

328
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,100
send someone more articulated to shadow.

329
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,830
You're dismissed.

330
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,490
Yes.

331
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,470
Ye Xiwu, you bitch.

332
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,690
Who's Ye Bingchang?

333
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,290
I am.

334
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,170
Your family is here. Come with me.

335
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,720
<i>[Palace Prison]</i>

336
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,180
Grandma?

337
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,850
Grandma.

338
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,900
Bingchang, you've suffered.

339
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,680
Grandma, how can you come here to see me?

340
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,500
I asked Xiwu for help.

341
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,360
She is quite favored by His Majesty, Tantai Jin.

342
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,580
That's why I can come to see you.

343
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,660
We've all heard about what you did.

344
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,300
It's fair to be punished for your mistakes.

345
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,620
But blood is thicker than water.

346
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,100
You're one of our family, after all.

347
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,350
We won't abandon you.

348
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,300
Don't worry.

349
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,940
Grandma.

350
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,930
Actually, I shouldn't have gotten greedy for the love threads.

351
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,670
These days in the palace prison,

352
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,080
I've finally come around.

353
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,860
To correct a mistake is the greatest good.

354
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,970
All right, enough of these.

355
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,870
Come, look.

356
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:13,490
Take the food and clothes.

357
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,820
Thanks, Grandma.

358
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,580
Oh… I almost forgot.

359
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,150
Come, take this.

360
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,860
It's a hand ointment.

361
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,390
Xiwu told me to bring it to you.

362
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,640
She said that it's cold in Jing Kingdom.

363
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,790
So Tantai Jin told the imperial doctors

364
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,130
to make up this ointment

365
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,120
for treating chilblains.

366
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,470
You can't buy this anywhere else.

367
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,100
She specially spared some and told me to bring it to you.

368
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,980
Remember to apply it often every day.

369
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,550
Xiwu, that child,

370
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:59,280
still cares about her elder sister.

371
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,100
Yeah.

372
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,980
That's why they all say she's got a kind heart.

373
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,950
The palace gate is about to be closed.

374
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,650
We will head home.

375
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,210
Grandma, I just remembered that

376
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,330
it's my mother's death anniversary in a few days.

377
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,080
Although I've failed to be filial,

378
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,580
I still wish to go home to pay respects to her.

379
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,330
Grandma, could you discuss this with Second Younger Sister?

380
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,990
See if she can beg for mercy from His Majesty.

381
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,780
Begging for mercy?

382
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,080
Second Young Miss can't help you with everything.

383
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,930
Grandma, I really regret what I did.

384
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,100
Bingchang, I'll talk to Xiwu about it.

385
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,070
We'll try to beg for His Majesty's mercy.

386
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,010

Ye Qingyu asked for leave again.

389
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,510
He has gone outside behind my back quite frequently these days.

390
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,350
And he tried to hide it from me.

391
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,370
Was he secretly doing something behind my back?

392
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,240
This is the road to the Sheng Kingdom.

393
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,840
Ye Qingyu, what exactly are you up to?

394
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,900
Although we were born in the same kingdom, and we're both soldiers,

395
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,220
we didn't have the chance to see each other.

396
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,440
You're a good son of Sheng.
<i>[Tomb of Jiang Rao]</i>

397
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,890
You died here,

398
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,770
but you died for your kingdom.

399
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,250
This cup is me paying my respect.

400
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,500
The second cup...

401
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,280
is my envy for you.

402
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,680
Though you were killed in the war,

403
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,770
your soul lives on.

404
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,020
Not just in your homeland...

405
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,490
but also in people's hearts.

406
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,260
In her heart, she will always love you,

407
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,840
think of you, and miss you.

408
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,090
She'll be sad and happy for you.

409
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,900
Whatever happens in the future,

410
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,100
she'll never be able to forget you in her life.

411
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,730
That's why I admire her, too.

412
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,230
Although she's a demon with a very long life,

413
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,880
she's willing to love a mortal

414
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,700
and not change her feelings for him ever.

415
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,770
Sometimes I'll think,

416
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,080
if someday I also died in battle,

417
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,500
I could be like you.

418
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,840
I'd always have a place in her heart.

419
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,760
But...

420
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,800
that was just a thought.

421
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,910
I wouldn't want her to be alone.

422
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,230
I want to be alive

423
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,550
and stay by her side

424
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,930
to love her

425
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,610
and protect her.

426
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,870
I want to spend this short life with her.

427
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,880
If your soul's down there, please don't worry.

428
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,760
I'll take good care of her.

429
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,980
I, Ye Qingyu, will only love this woman in my entire life.

Chuntao, do me a favor.

Second Young Miss, why do you always tolerate her?

508
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,830
Think about the things she did.

Besides, she's a slave in the palace prison now.

I'm not hungry.

529
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,570

00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,770

Bingchang, why are you still up?

534
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,250
I'm here to deliver a supper for you.

535
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,940
Did you cook this?

536
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,010
I'm not so dutiful as to

537
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,330
do such a good thing.

538
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:40,510
It's cooked by your good granddaughter Ye Xiwu.

539
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,650
Bingchang, why are you talking like this?

540
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,600
She told me to let you finish it all,

541
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,630
so don't waste her efforts.

542
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,610
All right.

I'm going to lie down for a while.
