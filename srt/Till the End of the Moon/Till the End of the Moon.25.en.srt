<i>Remember to finish it while it's hot after approving your documents.</i>

20
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,660
Ye Xiwu, have you fallen asleep?

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,740
Did you cook this porridge for me specifically?

22
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,900
I'm asking you whether you made this porridge especially for me.

23
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,713
That's right.

24
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,410
Have you eaten it?

25
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,660
Do you want me to eat it?

26
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,910
What's the matter?

27
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,090
I guess I'll have some

28
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,120
if you feed me.

29
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,670
I want you to feed me.

30
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,130
<i>Tantai Jin, you're scaring me.</i>

31
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,310
Why are you being so mushy out of the blue?

32
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,483
Open your mouth.

33
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,763
Scholar Pang,

34
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:35,450
do we still wait?

35
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,310
Yes.

36
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,480
His Highness ordered us to lead the main army down south

37
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,140
if he didn't return on time.

38
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,600
I will go against his order.

39
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,920
At most, I'll receive military punishment when Xiao Lin comes back.

40
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,160
Head to the camp and ask the soldiers.

41
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,920
Those who are willing to stay and wait for Sixth Prince can stay here.

42
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,580
As for the rest, you can escape to the South with them.

43
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,210
Second Young Miss, do you feel unwell?

44
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,840
Xiao Lin?

45
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,040
Have we managed to escape?

46
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,473
That's right.

47
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,360
Second Young Miss, you don't look too good.

48
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,510
Please hang in there.

49
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,510
Let's find a place and rest there before dawn.

50
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,760
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

51
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,160
<i>do you have the result?</i>

52
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,920
<i>Traces of dry mylabris were found in the porridge.</i>

53
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,600
<i>It's a type of deadly poison from the Sheng Kingdom.</i>

54
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,200
<i>What will happen if I take it?</i>

55
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,020
<i>It will kill you instantly.</i>

56
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,753
<i>And...</i>

57
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
<i>there is no antidote for it.</i>

58
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,180
<i>Ye Xiwu, did you try to poison me?</i>

59
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,700
<i>So, you wish to assassinate me?</i>

60
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,240
<i>Didn't you say that you loved me</i>

61
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,290
<i>and wanted to stay beside me?</i>

62
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,840
<i>Why?</i>

63
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,360
<i>Why did you do so?</i>

64
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,150
<i>Nian Baiyu, get me some Ruo Water.</i>

65
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,650
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

66
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,220
<i>Mighty Ruo Water,</i>

67
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,750
<i>control her soul.</i>

68
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,033
<i>Ye Xiwu, wake up.</i>

69
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,440
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

70
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,840
<i>You can do whatever you want now.</i>

71
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,473
<i>Yes.</i>

72
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,443
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

73
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,850
<i>were you looking for this?</i>

74
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,813
<i>Tell me.</i>

75
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,300
<i>What do you want to do with it?</i>

76
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,220
<i>To save Xiao Lin.</i>

77
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,103
<i>Ye Xiwu,</i>

78
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,530
<i>did you poison the porridge?</i>

79
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,213
<i>Yes.</i>

80
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,750
<i>So, you did everything for Xiao Lin's sake?</i>

81
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,043
<i>That's right.</i>

82
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,550
<i>Do you love him?</i>

83
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,260
<i>You're actually willing to go this far for him?</i>

84
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,370
<i>You're willing to kill me for his sake?</i>

85
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,523
<i>Go now.</i>

86
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,540
<i>Tail her.</i>

87
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,760
<i>Let her achieve her goal.</i>

88
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,240
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

89
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,830
Ye Xiwu,

90
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,010
you said you wouldn't leave me.

91
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,060
It's too late for you to regret it.

92
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,440
Put it on. It can keep you warm more or less.

93
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,383
Thanks.

94
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,533
Here.

95
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,880
I'm afraid Tantai Jin's soldiers will leave town soon.

96
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,610
We can't afford to take official routes along the way.

97
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,363
Xiao Lin, how did we manage to escape?

98
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,750
My mind feels a little blurry.

99
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,950
Miss Xiwu, sorry for this.

100
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,760
You have a fever.

101
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,540
Maybe it's because you were frightened and caught a cold during the night.

102
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,630
You poisoned Tantai Jin and stole the Tiger Tally.

103
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,380
Due to that, we had access to all city gates. That was how we made it out.

104
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,720
Everything was proceeding so smoothly

105
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,390
that I felt something was off.

106
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,220
<i>There are no pursuers or stalkers on our tail.</i>

107
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,160
<i>Tantai Jin, what exactly are you up to?</i>

108
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,490
<i>I want you to feed me.</i>

109
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,323
<i>Open your mouth.</i>

110
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,350
That's right. I remember now.

111
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,980
This is great. I finally got you out of there.

112
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,650
Second Young Miss, you saved my life.

113
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
No words can express my gratitude.

114
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,390
I feel much better now. You should leave.

115
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,840
Tantai Jin will wake up after dawn.

116
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,980
We should leave together. You stole the Tiger Tally.

117
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,450
Tantai Jin won't let you off. You mustn't head back.

118
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,840
Second Young Miss, we should head to the army camp first.

119
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,380
We need to plan things out.

120
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,310
I have to go back.

121
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,630
I haven't accomplished my mission. I have to return to his side.

122
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,150
But you're right. Tantai Jin will be infuriated if I return now.

123
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,700
I will lay low for a while. I'll head back once he cools off.

124
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,860
So, where are we heading now?

125
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,693
The South.

126
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,950
The South?

127
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,490
Do you two intend to leave the Jing Kingdom together?

128
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,380
What a shame. You can never

129
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,100
escape from me for the rest of your life.

130
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,650
What's the matter?

131
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,630
Your Majesty, we received a message outside of the palace.

132
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,730
Something has happened to the Ye family!

133
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,870
Hurry! The imperial physician is here!

134
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,460
Hurry!

135
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
How is it?

136
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,100
Her Ladyship was struck by lethal poison.

137
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,333
I'm afraid there's no cure for it…

138
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,610
Aren't you an imperial physician?

139
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,710
You have to do something!

140
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,760
Her Ladyship was poisoned by dry mylabris. This is…

141
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,520
Grandmother!

142
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,790
Grandmother, please wake up!

143
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,190
<i>How is he still alive?</i>

144
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,230
Grandmother!

145
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,293
Your Majesty.

146
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,790
Your Majesty, why have you graced us with your presence?

147
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,980
Mother! What do you want to say?

148
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,380
Xiwu!

149
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,090
Xiwu!

150
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,103
Mother, what do you want to say?

151
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,243
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

152
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:44,240
I'll surely take care of Ye Xiwu

153
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,470
and not let her suffer any grievances.

154
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,890
I promise.

155
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,210
Grandmother!

156
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,550
Grandmother!

157
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,080
- Grandmother!
- Mother!

158
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,980
- Grandmother!
- Mother!

159
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,313
Mother!

160
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:23,550
- Grandmother, wake up!
- Mother!

161
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,610
Grandmother!

162
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,160
Grandmother!

163
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,270
Mother!

164
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,020
Grandmother!

165
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,450
Grandmother!

166
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,320
Ye Bingchang, tragedy has befallen your family.

167
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,100
You don't need to return to the concubine house.

168
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,090
Stay here and take care of your family.

169
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,240
- Grandmother!
- Your Majesty.

170
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,670
- Mother!
- Your Majesty.

171
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,530
The porridge Grandmther took this evening was drugged.

172
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,500
The imperial physician concluded that it was dry mylabris.

173
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,690
Eldest Sister said the porridge was made by Second Sister herself.

174
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,241
- Grandmother.
- She served Grandmother a bowl of it.

175
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:18,500
<i>Ye Xiwu, did you make this porridge especially for me?</i>

176
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,260
<i>Traces of dry mylabris were found in the porridge.</i>

177
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,860
<i>It's a type of deadly poison from the Sheng Kingdom.</i>

178
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,993
<i>Open your mouth.</i>

179
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,843
Your Majesty, Second Sister would never poison Grandmother.

180
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:38,730
Grandmother must have taken the poisoned porridge by accident and died as a result.

181
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,370
I'm afraid we need to find out...

182
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,900
who the poisoned porridge was prepared for.

183
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,930
There's no need for that.

184
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,470
It was me.

185
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,740
Why? Father, that's impossible!

186
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,760
It couldn't be Second Sister!

187
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,790
Grandmother!

188
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,123
Your Majesty!

189
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:23,351
- Your Majesty!
- Grandmother!

190
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:25,050
<i>Ye Xiwu, </i>

191
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,320
<i>now, you'll know what it feels like to be abandoned by your kin.</i>

192
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,240
We've finally arrived.

193
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,073
We've arrived?

194
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,070
But there's not a single soul here.

195
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,550
We are four days late. Maybe they've already left.

196
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,490
Let's go and take a look first.

197
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,033
Your Highness!

198
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,120
Junior Martial Uncle?

199
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,350
This is great! You're still alive.

200
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,000
I knew you could make it back!

201
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,450
So, you defied my order and made everyone wait for another four days?

202
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,550
That's right. I knew this would happen.

203
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,340
<i>Welcome back, Your Highness.</i>

204
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Second Young Miss is here, too?

205
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,580
Don't tell me you escaped and brought her along with you?

206
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,130
Tantai Jin is going to be so mad about this.

207
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,470
Enough chatter. I was able to escape successfully,

208
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,750
all thanks to Second Young Miss's assistance.

209
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,770
You should thank her instead, Junior Martial Uncle.

210
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,400
Second Young Miss, what's wrong?

211
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,880
Second Young Miss?

212
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,720
<i>Ye Xiwu, wake up.</i>

213
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,920
<i>Wake up.</i>

214
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,900
<i>Ye Xiwu, you'll return to me soon.</i>

215
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,750
<i>I'll be waiting for you.</i>

216
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,570
<i>The only place you can stay is by my side.</i>

217
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,930
Your Highness!

218
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,310
Second Young Miss, why did you do this?

219
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,400
Could it be that you followed His Highness

220
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,970
all the way here just to assassinate him for Tantai Jin's sake?

221
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,933
Second Young Miss, how could you do this?

222
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,593
Your Highness!

223
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,250
Ye Xiwu, even if you will hate me

224
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,600
and never forgive me for this,

225
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,360
I'll make you stay by my side and keep me company.

226
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,560
Your Majesty, you clearly knew what Miss Xiwu's goal was.

227
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,590
Why did you make her stab Xiao Lin

228
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,540
after the two of them reunited with the remnants of Sheng Kingdom?

229
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,400
Only by letting her betray Xiao Lin

230
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,180
in front of everybody's eyes will she be discarded by all

231
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,210
and have nowhere to go. They will hate her.

232
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,920
Pang Yizhi will hate her.

233
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,740
Xiao Lin will hate her more.

234
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,000
But no one can hurt her under the protection of the puppetry spell's barrier.

235
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,670
Her only choice is to return to Jing Kingdom and return to my side.

236
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,690
I'm the only one who can protect her,

237
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,740
keep her company, and love her.

238
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,250
Relay my order to the troops. Capture both Xiao Lin and Ye Xiwu.

239
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,340
Remember, keep them alive.

240
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

241
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,820
<i>Ye Xiwu, I'll wait for your return.</i>

242
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,283
Let her go.

243
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,461
Your Highness!

244
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:54,880
I said, let Second Young Miss go!

245
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,650
I'm sorry.

246
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,940
I didn't do it on purpose. I didn't know why I did so, either!

247
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,540
I didn't mean it!

248
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,850
Second Young Miss, don't be afraid. It's not fatal.

249
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,690
I won't die for now.

250
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,880
Junior Martial Uncle, help me up.

251
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,643
Listen. I was hurt by the soldiers of Jing.

252
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:07,540
I'm fine now. It has nothing to do with Second Young Miss.

253
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,600
No one shall talk about this again! Remember that?

254
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,640
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

255
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,383
Let's go.

256
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,040
Have you helped Second Young Miss to settle down?

257
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,060
I've undone her spell.

258
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,860
She said she wanted to take care of you. I stopped her.

259
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,620
This is called Soul-gnawing Wedge. It sucks blood from its victim.

260
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,230
The victim will eventually die from its effect.

261
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,030
What if I dig it out...

262
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,440
with a dagger?

263
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,790
You must be kidding me!

264
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,320
Listen to me. From today onward, you have to stay bedridden.

265
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,830
Do you want me to wait for my demise?

266
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,400
I'll figure something out!

267
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,880
We're out of time. Has this ever occurred to you?

268
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,260
He could've killed me when he manipulated Ye Xiwu as his puppet.

269
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,920
However, why did he only immobilize me?

270
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,230
Why did you think he did so?

271
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,850
<i>What exactly happened?</i>

272
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,820
<i>Ye Xiwu, wake up.</i>

273
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,940
<i>Xiao Lin's going to be okay. Right?</i>

274
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,360
Why are you walking around instead of resting in your room?

275
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,890
Why did you change your outfit too?

276
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,110
Someone will prepare a carriage and send you out of here later.

277
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,850
Where are you sending me?

278
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,440
Somewhere for you to lay low.

279
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,910
Don't worry. The Secret Dragon Guards will keep you safe.

280
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,410
There's a war coming, isn't there?

281
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,830
How can you fight when you're injured?

282
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,310
Just let me stay. It's all my fault. I can't just walk away.

283
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,790
Xiao Lin,

284
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,230
are you hiding something from me?

285
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,950
News just came from the capital.

286
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,690
I thought about it a lot. I guess I should tell you.

287
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,550
What news?

288
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,863
Your grandmother...

289
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,160
just passed away.

290
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,720
That's impossible.

291
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,200
Did your men make a mistake?

292
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,821
- Calm down.
- I'm sure your men were mistaken!

293
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:46,270
Grandmother has always been healthy. She was perfectly fine when I left!

294
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,533
Xiwu! If this thing happened because of me,

295
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,500
I must take responsibility for it.

296
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,690
I can only repay what I owe your grandmother in my next life.

297
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,450
What do you mean by it happened because of you?

298
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,600
Last night, Tantai Jin went to the Ye Mansion.

299
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,950
<i>Grandmother.</i>

300
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,310
<i>It was all fake.</i>

301
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,470
<i>He just learned how to pretend.</i>

302
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,680
It's Tantai Jin.

303
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,060
Tantai Jin.

304
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,080
Tantai Jin!

305
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,450
Xiwu, please accept my condolences.

306
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,200
I can't stay here for too long. You can't stay here either.

307
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,890
Where are you going?

308
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,000
Your Majesty, the messenger pigeon will arrive today as per your order.

309
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,883
Okay. I'll be expecting good news.

310
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,490
Your Majesty, why didn't you kill Xiao Lin?

311
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,440
I have my own plans.

312
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

313
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,110
I've just received a letter from His Majesty's messenger pigeon.

314
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,850
It states that Xiao Lin is too injured to lead his army.

315
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:00,650
Launch a surprise attack at dusk, and we'll be able to catch him alive.

316
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,650
Prepare for it immediately. By His Majesty's order, Ye Xiwu and Xiao Lin

317
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,690
must be captured alive.

318
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,850
This is the Virid Blood Pill. It'll stop your bleeding...

319
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,080
and keep you alive for the time being.

320
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,800
I never expected someone to court death like you.

321
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,950
Thank you, Junior Martial Uncle.

322
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,600
Gather our men for me.

323
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,130
Stop the carriage!

324
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,161
Send me back! Xiao Lin is going to die!

325
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:34,821
By His Highness's order, I must bring you away from the battlefield!

326
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,810
Chongyu, help me. Please!

327
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,413
Your Majesty.

328
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,030
Speak.

329
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,680
Your Majesty, General Feng led his troops to surround the headquarters of the Sheng Army.

330
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,263
But…

331
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,650
He didn't manage to capture Xiao Lin.

332
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,900
Did they escape?

333
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,970
No. We surrounded the Sheng troops,

334
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,840
but Xiao Lin led his remnants and broke through.

335
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,330
He launched a raid from behind and caught us unaware.

336
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,410
He burned all of our provisions. He even rescued all the prisoners.

337
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,480
Impossible.

338
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,730
Xiao Lin was struck by the Soul-gnawing Wedge.

339
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,320
He couldn't even get on horseback. How could he lead his army?

340
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,170
Did someone see this with their own eyes?

341
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,150
Yes.

342
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,010
All of our soldiers saw it. It's absolutely true.

343
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,630
He led his remnants and the refugees southward.

344
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,560
But he left this in his camp.

345
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,550
Show me.

346
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,283
Yes.

347
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,610
<i>Brother Tantai.</i>

348
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,923
<i>No.</i>

349
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:26,640
<i>I should address you as Your Majesty now.</i>

350
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,590
<i>Back when we were in the Palace of Sheng, </i>

351
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,100
<i>I was a prince and you were a hostage.</i>

352
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,750
<i>Our paths were nothing alike.</i>

353
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,820
<i>When you left the palace and got married, </i>

354
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,960
<i>we were separated and rarely met.</i>

355
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,290

357
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,830
<i>Now, the boundary of life and death</i>

358
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,100

359
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,670

360
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:09,100
<i>But there were still loyal civilians and officers who chose to follow me.</i>

361
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,930
<i>I've ordered my troops to escort these refugees southward</i>

362

366
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,180
<i>A kingdom perishes because it acts the opposite.</i>

367
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,640

<i>Thank you for granting my wish.</i>

370
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,540
<i>I have nothing else to offer</i>

371
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,730

372
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,810
<i>Please take it as a congratulatory gift.</i>

373
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,290
Xiao Lin,

374
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,810
you're congratulating me like this?

375
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,790
Second Young Miss, how come you're back?

376
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,673
Second Young Miss.

377
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,620
Why are you hanging the memorial banners?

378
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,480
Who's dead?

379
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,480
<i>Also, I have another request.</i>

380
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,710
<i>Bingchang is sensitive and jealous. And now, she's lost her husband.</i>

381
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:16,010
<i>I'm afraid her life will be difficult after this.</i>

382
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,200
<i>Although I've cut all ties with her, </i>

383
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,910
<i>I wish that you could spare her life.</i>

384
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,120
<i>With the highest respect and best regards.</i>

385
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,063
Xiao Lin, why are you so stubborn?

386
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:46,270
Why did you have to sacrifice yourself to save your kingdom?

387
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:17,480
Zhong Tai and Chen Xian will lead the remaining soldiers to leave the camp and sail south after dark.

388
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,943
What about you?

389
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:20,353
I don't know.

390
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:23,830
The Sheng Kingdom is gone. Xiao Lin is gone, too.

391
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,540
The mortal realm is a depressing place. I don't wish to stay here any longer.

392
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:34,140
Maybe I'll return to Xiaoyao Sect and resume my cultivation.

393
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,700
Safe journey ahead.

394
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,640
Second Young Miss, what about you?

395
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,250
Is there no news yet?

396
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,400
The Moonshadow Guards have already begun their search.

397
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,110
But nobody has heard that Miss Xiwu assassinated Xiao Lin.

398
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,560
There were no rumors saying Miss Xiwu was a traitor.

399
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,640
It no longer matters.

400
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,000
Did you manage to locate her whereabouts?

401
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,440
Not yet. The Sheng Army's camp is empty now.

402
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,840
It is said that Xiao Lin's remaining forces have gone south.

403
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,070
Second Young Miss didn't follow them. Should we maintain our pursuit?

404
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,933
No need.

405
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,940
Let them go.

Your Majesty, please don't worry.

410
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,380
Second Young Miss should be back very soon.

412
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,560
Back, huh?

413
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,750
She won't be back again.

414
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,590
She loved Xiao Lin.

415
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,770
She loved Xiao Lin for so many years.

416
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,650
But I made her kill her beloved with her own hands!

417
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,110
She's never coming back!
