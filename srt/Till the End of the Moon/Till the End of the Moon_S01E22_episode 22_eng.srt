19
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,270
Second Young Miss, why don't you head back first?

20
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,600
His Majesty is fuming. If he finds out,

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,760
he'll definitely reprimand me.

22
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,380
Then I'll just stand here.

23
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,890
I'll head inside after he cools down.

24
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,940
Eldest Sister.

25
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,140
 Nian Baiyu, tell her to leave. 

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,620
Second Younger Sister, you should head back first.

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,030
His Majesty is still angry.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,900
Let me go talk to him.

29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,550
 Since when did Eldest Sister become this close to Tantai Jin? 

30
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,540
 This is the tremella soup Your Majesty told me to make. 

31
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,910
 Please try it and see if you like it. 

32
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,500
Second Young Miss, why don't you head back first?

33
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,260
His Majesty said he'd let her accompany him these few days.

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,530
Your Majesty, please.

35
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,610
Is it not to your liking?

36
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,490
I'll go and make it again.

37
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,640
That's not it.

38
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,750
Then, what's wrong?

39
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,750
Be quiet.

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,730
If you don't have anything else to do,

41
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,240
go sit over there.

42
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,620
Grind some ink for me.

43
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

44
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,100
 Tantai Jin is really eccentric. He's so hard to predict. 

45
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,770
 Never mind. Nothing in this world comes easy. 

46
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,670
Just accept it.

47
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,800
For a man like that,

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,430
just treat him as if he's dead.

49
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,160
He mustn't die.

50
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,750
I—!

51
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,590
Ye Xiwu, I thought you were just toying with him.

52
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,410
But you actually fell for him and can't get out of it.

53
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,550
Did I fall for him?

54
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,110
How do you explain this then?

55
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,960
Look at how preoccupied you are.

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,000
You're no different from a woman who was abandoned.

57
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,150
Actually, I dumped him.

58
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,850
Yeah, yeah. You dumped him.

59
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,170
Let's go. Time to sleep.

60
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,680
 What exactly are you doing? 

61
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,670
Tantai Jin wiped out the Sheng Kingdom

62
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,120
and ruined Xiao Lin's homeland and life. And now, you are betraying him too?

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,370
Have you forgotten the vows you made to him?

64
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,530
Why should I care about Xiao Lin?

65
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,530
He was incapable and broke his promises.

66
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,330
Because of him, I have to become a slave and serve Tantai Jin.

67
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,170
I'm just trying to survive.

68
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,360
He has no power to decide state affairs by himself.

69
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,800
Besides, he was deeply in love with you.

70
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,670
He truly loved you with all his heart.

71
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,730
Really? What if that love thread didn't exist?

72
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,040
Wake up. He wasn't in love with you.

73
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Nobody is in love with you.

74
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,930
Men seem to be attracted to you simply because you have two love threads.

75
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,140
Is love more important than survival?

76
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,160
 Why would I have such a nightmare? 

77
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,530
 There's no turning back. Don't hesitate. 

78
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,200
Your Majesty.

79
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,170
His Majesty has a fever.

80
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,520
I'll go and get some medicine. Wrap his forehead with a cold towel.

81
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,570
No one else must know about this. Or else…

82
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:45,340
 Even a lowly guard dares to threaten me now. 

83
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,380
Ye Xiwu…

84
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,630
Ye Xiwu…

85
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,540
 It's Ye Xiwu again. 

86
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,890
 Ye Xiwu is obnoxious enough. 

87
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,420
 And she abused Tantai Jin like that. Why would he fall for her? 

88
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,260
 Even if he did fall for Ye Xiwu, did he not used to love me? 

89
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,220
 I'm the one by his side now. 

90
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,190
It's quite late. Why are you standing here, General Ye?

91
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,550
You helped me. I ought to thank you.

92
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,370
How are you planning to thank me, then?

93
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,340
By the way, how is my Second Elder Sister?

94
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,440
Lately, His Majesty and she…

95
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,020
They're both your sisters.

96
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,080
But you are partial to Ye Xiwu, huh?

97
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,250
She'll be fine after some time.

98
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,940
As the saying goes, men can fall out of love easily.

99
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,670
But women can't.

100
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,340
But in my opinion,

101
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,830
there are plenty of silly men in the world.

102
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,480
Right, General Ye?

103
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,460
You're right.

104
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,950
A man can't fall out of love easily.

105
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,080
General Ye,

106
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,480
you're quite agreeable to my eyes.

107
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,720
So I have to make things clear first.

108
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,040
If you intend to seek someone to spend your life with,

109
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,530
I'm not a good match for you.

110
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,600
However, if you seek momentary pleasures,

111
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm always ready.

112
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,860
Why?

113
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,220
You are a human, while I'm a demon.

114
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,170
What I fancy is nothing but your face.

115
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,540
Besides, foxes are promiscuous.

116
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,000
Why should I love one man when I can love many at once?

117
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,000
Think again, and make your decision.

118
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,650
Pianran!

119
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,550
Be careful, Your Majesty.

120
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,200
What? Have you never seen anyone this gorgeous before?

121
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,940
♫  Take a look at the world that you and I are reluctant to leave  ♫

122
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,300
♫  Flip through the written fabulous years in books  ♫

123
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,990
♫  Dream in circles the remaining flashy and vivid regret  ♫

124
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,480
♫  I would rather not wake up, and dreams would not vanish  ♫

125
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,790
There, there. A jerk like him is a perfect match for a woman like her.

126
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,990
Don't say that. She's my sister.

127
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,540
Seriously, why do you love him so much?

128
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,850
I don't know what's wrong with me, either.

129
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,480
♫  I was already tired of bidding farewell  ♫

130
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,270
♫  I would send ashes and brightness to the moon  ♫

131
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,490
Fine. Fine. Don't cry anymore.

132
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,280
It's not shameful to fall in love with a jerk like him. Right?

133
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,270
♫  My affection ebbed and flowed like seasons  ♫

134
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,840
All right now.

135
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,910
You can ride a horse with me if you don't have a carriage.

136
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,500
Let's go.

137
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,780
♫  I only wish to exchange this life with eternity  ♫

138
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:21,140
♫  Ingenuine affection is also enough. Sincerity makes flirtation hard  ♫

139
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,340
♫  I still believe in the touched feelings that you gave me  ♫

140
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,140
Your Majesty, this sweet soup is chilled.

141
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,850
Your Majesty?

142
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,380
♫  Waiting for a long while?  ♫

143
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,770
 Just how much does Second Younger Sister mean in his heart? 

144
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,230
 Has he forgotten what Ye Xiwu used to do to him? 

145
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,690
Why didn't you let Ye Xiwu get in the carriage, too?

146
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,910
What she did to you before was indeed too much.

147
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,930
But she is a weak woman after all.

148
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,010
Why don't you let go of grievances and forgive her, Your Majesty?

149
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,060
No need for that.

150
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,500
Your Majesty, you've always been like this.

151
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,510
Now that I think about it,

152
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:32,750
Your Majesty and Bingchang have known each other for so many years.

153
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,990
Back when you were a hostage in the Sheng Kingdom, you had a rough life.

154
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,340
King Sheng saw you as a thorn in his flesh.

155
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,640
I'd feel sorry for you whenever I witnessed them

156
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,490
making things difficult for you in the palace.

157
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,890
Now that you've united the world,

158
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,650
this world is your best compensation.

159
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,670
It's all in the past. Now, Xiao Yi is dead.

160
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,420
I no longer...

161
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,990
need any compensation.

162
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,110
Your Majesty, you're as headstrong as always.

163
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,890
But I can't just pretend to ignore the truth.

164
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,720
From now on,

165
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,500
let me keep you company.

166
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,300
Compensation?

167
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,010
Compensation is the most pretentious thing in the world.

168
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Ye Bingchang, you used to see me as a freak.

169
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,560
What? Are you not afraid of me now?

170
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,220
It's true that I used to fear you.

171
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,710
But now, we both experienced separation.

172
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,690
I may understand some of your pain.

173
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,510
You've been a hostage in the Sheng Kingdom for over a decade.

174
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,690
And now, I'll spend the rest of my life in the Jing Kingdom.

175
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,930
We will keep each other company.

176
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,940
We can love moderately and long.

177
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm a bit tired. You may leave the carriage.

178
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

179
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,900
Eldest Sister.

180
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,210
Why are you so nervous? Let's sit and talk, shall we?

181
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,200
What do you want to tell me, Eldest Sister?

182
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,140
Xiwu, I'll cut to the chase.

183
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,580
Tantai Jin was in love with me long ago.

184
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,990
However, he couldn't have me because of Xiao Lin.

185
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,980
You know that, right?

186
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,740
I know.

187
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,830
Now, I've got nothing left.

188
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,960
I have to depend on Tantai Jin if I wish to survive. He's my last straw.

189
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,980
Second Younger Sister, you won't snatch this straw from me, will you?

190
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,510
No, I won't. I don't like him anyway.

191
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,250
If so, I can rest at ease.

192
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,430
Second Younger Sister, what you did to His Majesty before was indeed too much.

193
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,980
It's normal that he's holding a grudge against you.

194
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,350
But I'll ask him not to put you on the spot once I'm done coaxing him.

195
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,930
Your Majesty, these are the Nether Puppet Soldiers

196
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,840
I've cultivated for the past few days.

197
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,810
These puppets do not feel pain or fear.

198
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,290
Your Majesty can command them with demonic power.

199
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,340
How many nether soldiers do we have now?

200
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,420
Your Majesty, including the prisoners

201
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,110
sent by King Sheng a few days ago, we have 4,000 of them.

202
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,740
Tantai Jin has 100,000 Jing soldiers

203
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,750
and tens of thousands of Firewing Army.

204
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,720
Can someone tell me how I can conquer the Capital of Jing

205
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,680
with just these 4,000 puppets?

206
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,060
Your Majesty, the Sheng Kingdom has perished.

207
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,750
Tantai Jin has united the Sheng and Jing Kingdoms and is at the peak of his power.

208
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,730
I'm afraid we cannot conquer the capital of Jing in a short period.

209
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,080
Your Majesty, please build up our forces for now.

210
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,510
Useless fools.

211
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,340
Fuyu,

212
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,500
don't let them fool me again.

213
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,540
You'll suffer the consequences if you can't figure something out in a month.

214
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,340
Yes.

215
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,020
Tantai Jin.

216
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,300
Tantai Jin.

217
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,080
Ye Xiwu, you're back?

218
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,680
Tantai Jin, do you love me?

219
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,000
I…

220
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,890
Why do you not dare to confess your love for me?

221
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,070
Are you afraid that I'll embarrass you,

222
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,060
be disappointed in you, and abandon you when you say that?

223
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,520
Shut up!

224
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,420
See? You're always like this.

225
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,970
Forget it. I'm going to fall in love with someone else.

226
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,840
Being with you isn't fun at all.

227
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,020
Ye Xiwu.

228
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,880
Let go of me!

229
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,400
Ye Xiwu, come back!

230
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,580
Were you dreaming just now, Your Majesty?

231
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,400
Please rest early if you're tired.

232
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,440
Dreaming?

233
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,410
You were born without a love thread.

234
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,950
So you can't experience real emotions.

235
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,600
You won't feel happy or scared.

236
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,750
 How could one without a love thread even dream? 

237
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,300
So, this is what you call a dream.

238
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,250
Speaking of which,

239
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,360
I had fallen in love with you back in Enlightened Life.

240
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,050
I swore to marry nobody but you.

241
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,800
You'd committed all kinds of evil deeds in Enlightened Life.

242
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,270
Are you trying to do the same now?

243
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,450
It was just a dream.

244
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,900
Why did you bring it up when you knew that was just a dream?

245
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,050
Ye Bingchang, answer me.

246
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:50,810
Does being with me these days make you happy?

247
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,010
Staying by your side was what I desired the most.

248
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,690
Answer my question. Are you happy?

249
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,510
Naturally, I am happy.

250
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,960
You're lying.

251
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,460
I'm speaking from the bottom of my heart.

252
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,610
The Sheng Kingdom just perished and Xiao Lin went missing.

253
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,900
You just came to this foreign kingdom. To serve a king is like living with a tiger.

254
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,540
Why would you be happy?

255
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,280
After Ye Qingyu surrendered, he never fawned over me even once.

256
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,840
Although I convinced him to serve me, he also feared me.

257
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,380
As for you,

258
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,800
you chose to stay with the ruler who just conquered your state and destroyed your family

259
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,230
just to seek shelter.

260
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,720
How could I trust you?

261
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,100
Your Majesty, are you despising me?

262
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,190
Have you forgotten

263
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,720
how horribly Ye Xiwu treated you when you were in Ye Mansion?

264
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,030
Even so, Your Majesty still took pity on her. Right?

265
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,150
I'm just a woman

266
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,740
who's trying to survive in troubled times like these.

267
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,200
Is one act of survival...

268
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,680
nobler than another?

269
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,830
Ye Bingchang,

270
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,840
in my heart,

271
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,700
you're worth nothing compared to Ye Xiwu.

272
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,210
Your nobleness has nothing to do with me.

273
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,240
 Tantai Jin, how dare you insult me like this? 

274
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,260
Little one, come on. Eat up.

275
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,540
Thank you, Grandma.

276
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,140
Look at you. How come you have become so much thinner?

277
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,000
I think it's because of the hot weather.

278
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,990
I heard that Tantai Jin granted Bingchang the title of

279
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,750
Madam Xuancheng as soon as he brought her back.

280
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,200
Everyone in the capital is talking about it. What's going on?

281
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,340
Let's eat.

282
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,430
Tantai Jin had always loved Eldest Sister.

283
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,650
There's nothing strange about it.

284
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,940
Grandma, I wish to move back.

285
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,230
Just for a few days.

286
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,010
I'll think of something after I figure things out.

287
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,340
Figure what out? What do you mean?

288
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,740
All right. I'll tell Chuntao to prepare your room.

289
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,880
From now on, you'll keep me company every day.

290
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,210
 Ye Xiwu, are you still not appeased after so many days? 

291
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,580
 Never mind. Since you won't come to me, 

292
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,800
 I'll go to you. 

293
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,270
 These are… 

294
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,310
 These letters… 

295
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,030
 Could it be that she's still in contact with Xiao Lin? 

296
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,340
 Tantai Jin, how are you doing in Jia Pass? 

297
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,610
 Were you wounded? 

298
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,410
 I found two dandelions in your precious royal garden. 

299
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,970
 The gardeners actually let them live. They're so lucky. 

300
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,360
 I heard that one could make a wish with dandelions. 

301
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,920
 So I dug them out and brought them back. 

302
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,540
♫  Refusing capable minds  ♫

303
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:54,500
 I hope they'll remain alive before your return. 

304
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,270
♫  My wrist seems tied with a bright and sharp sword  ♫

305
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,480
 Tantai Jin, when will you be back? 

306
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,140
♫  Meticulously planning my life with one person for a lifetime  ♫

307
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,920
 Today, one of the dandelions has turned into a white, fluffy ball. 

308
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,650
 I can finally make my wish. 

309
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,380
 I wish my dream could come true. 

310
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,750
 And I wish that you stay safe and sound. 

311
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,400
♫  Who can be not involved in it?  ♫

312
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,590
 Never mind. 

313
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,650
 I'll wish for your safety over my wish. 

314
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,280
♫  Unspoken words are like water flowing deep  ♫

315
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,420
♫  A glance rippled through  ♫

316
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,510
 The other one just bloomed. I'll keep it for you. 

317
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,260
 You can make a wish when you come back. 

318
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,740
♫  I don't actually know who is the foil  ♫

319
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,380
♫  Beyond the deepest depths of our hearts  ♫

320
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:57,540
♫  There is already an empty pillow before we have grown old  ♫

321
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,030
Ye Xiwu.

322
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,040
 The way I see it, little meteor.  

323
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,390
 You're just like that Young Devil Lord. All black inside and out. 

324
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,900
 And you have so many holes in you, just like he has so many tricks and schemes. 

325
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,200
 Why don't I call you Little Jin? What do you think? 

326
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,100
♫  Our love is rushing through yet the murmurs can't be heard  ♫

327
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,760
♫  I clearly know the more we embrace, the more bodily scars we get  ♫

328
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,900
♫  I still bet my life on you  ♫

329
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,840
♫  A long, long dream together 

330
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,220
♫  Love threads twine around the remaining warmth. 

331
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,970
♫  Our love has taken root; once love is planted, it is hard to separate  ♫

332
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,350
 Anyway, you don't need me anymore. 

333
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,100
 I'll return this black lump to you. You can keep him company. 

334
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,100
♫  I long for you forever and ever  ♫

335
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,340
   

336
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,340
Little one.

337
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,980
Grandma.

338
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,080
Just let Chuntao prepare your room.

339
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,690
Yes.

340
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,360
Little one, would you help me with something?

341
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,810
What is it?

342
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,080
I heard Qingyu is coming back tonight.

343
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,370
Is Qingyu coming back?

344
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,930
Hush. Don't let your father know.

345
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:11,130
Such a stubborn donkey. He doesn't even let us mention his name.

346
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,090
Qingyu has been out there for so long.

347
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,570
I wonder how he's doing.

348
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,450
I made some clothes.

349
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,420
I also told Chuntao to buy some snacks and dietary supplements.

350
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,870
Deliver them secretly to your younger brother on my behalf. Okay?

351
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,350
Sure, just give them to me. I'll deliver them to him.

352
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,240
Good girl. I'll go and get them now. Come.

353
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,410
These are all for you.

354
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,200
Tell me if you need anything else. I'll pass the message on to Grandma.

355
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,310
She's worried that you do not eat or sleep well outside of the house.

356
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,240
I don't need anything else.

357
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,080
Second Elder Sister, if you have time, visit our family on my behalf.

358
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,300
Keep Grandma company.

359
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,440
Rest assured. Grandma's doing well.

360
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,480
I don't believe that Dad would keep this up forever.

361
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,690
He'll let you in eventually.

362
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,220
Let's talk about my things later.

363
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,630
I went back to the capital of Sheng some time ago.

364
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,200
I brought back some books from our old home. They're on the horse.

365
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,780
Please send them back on my behalf.

366
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,480
What were you doing in the capital of Sheng?

367
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,900
Didn't His Majesty tell you?

368
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,930
Tell me what?

369
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,070
Qingyu, what exactly is it?

370
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,210
It's confidential. I shouldn't have mentioned it.

371
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,880
Don't tell anyone after hearing this.

372
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,310
The corpse of His Majesty's mother was stolen by King Sheng.

373
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,940
I brought a few sorcerers there and did a soul-releasing ritual in the ruins.

374
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,610
The Empress Dowager's body isgone. I could only do that to comfort her soul.

375
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,480
There was nothing else I could do.

376
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,940
Second Elder Sister?

377
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,040
Tantai Jin!

378
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,170
Second Young Miss.

379
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,730
Tantai Jin!

380
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,500
Second Young Miss.

381
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,030
Tantai Jin!

382
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,160
Second Young Miss, what are you doing?

383
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,750
Where's Tantai Jin?

384
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,380
- He… 
 - Where is he? I need to speak with him.

385
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,570
What do you mean by shaking your head?

386
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,350
His Majesty forbade me from telling you or following him.

387
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,030
Tantai Jin.

388
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,170
What are you doing here?

389
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,860
I'm sorry.

390
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,550
I had prejudices against you.

391
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,240
I said things that hurt you

392
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,510
even though I knew nothing.

393
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,270
I was wrong about you.

394
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm sorry.

395
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,960
I saw it clearly when you stared at me.

396
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,670
There were fear, disgust, and hatred

397
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,260
in your eyes.

398
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,120
Anyone can look at me like that.

399
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,250
I'd gotten used to it over the years anyway.

400
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,630
But how could you do the same to me?

401
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,030
I won't do it again. I promise.

402
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,580
Are you willing to keep me company in the future?

403
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,130
Tantai Jin,

404
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,460
do you love my eldest sister?

405
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,490
I brought her back from the Sheng Kingdom

406
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,580
because she was your elder sister.

407
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,380
I thought you'd be happy about it.

408
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,810
Once,

409
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,350
I was like a blind man living in the dark.

410
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,920
I've been trapped in the void for more than 20 years.

411
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:24,350
People say that the sun is bright and warm.

412
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:29,270
But I didn't know what true brightness meant.

413
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,080
So, when I saw how Xiao Lin treated Ye Bingchang,

414
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,000
I thought that was love.

415
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,710
So I treated her exactly like he did.

416
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,710
Until I met you.

417
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,580
It turned out that it wasn't love at all.

418
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:01,010
At first, I was wondering...

419
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,340
why I had so many strange feelings

420
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,360
when I was together with you.

421
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,440
It was only clear to me after you left me.

422
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,030
I am able to love someone...

423
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,610
only because that person is you, not anyone else.

424
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,150
Ye Xiwu,

425
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,490
the one I love is you.

426
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,060
Not anyone else.

427
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,870
Tantai Jin,

428
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,030
that was pretty mushy.

429
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,070
Every single word I said came from the bottom of my heart.

430
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,970
And it took me a long time to figure it out.

431
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,670
You're so silly.

432
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,970
Ye Xiwu,

433
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:23,010
I have learned what love, expectation,

434
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,110
disappointment, jealousy,

435
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,500
sorrow, and resentment is.

436
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,440
You have taught me all of these feelings.

437
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,580
I'm willing to try to be a good person.

438
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,120
You...

439
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,640
could you please not leave me again?

440
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:03,930
Rest assured. From now on, I will cling to you every day.

441
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,880
You have no way to get rid of me now.

442
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,640
♫  Until the wind and snow arrive  ♫

443
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,280
All right.

444
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,000
♫  I want to suspend them at an inappropriate time  ♫

445

♫  To forget everything that's occurred  ♫

446
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:22,020
♫  I want to suspend a dream where I can exchange my tears for your return; My heart's in flames  ♫

447
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:27,430
Tantai Jin, there's one more thing.

448
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,120
I was angry at you before.

449
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,300
So I threw the star you gave to me into the pond.

450
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:39,990
But I couldn't find it even though I tried for a long time.

451
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:44,640
I think I lost it. I'm sorry.

452
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,760
♫  ...be your repayment and my debt  ♫

453
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,510
So, you turned yourself into a mess...

454
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,370
because of that stone?

455
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,800
♫  Did you know even the wisest soul lightly hesitated before crossing into the territory of their enemy?  ♫

456
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,200
♫  A heart ravaged by love  ♫

457
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,080
♫  And hate refuses to fly away  ♫

458
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,920
♫  Did you know one glance from your hardened heart is  ♫

459
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,300
♫  Like piercing my bone with a sword  ♫

460

♫  If fate is a calamity, I cannot help  ♫

461
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,400
I retrieved it.

462
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,960
♫  But want to resolve it  ♫

463
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,330
Tantai Jin,

464
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,900
thank you.

465
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,840
Ye Xiwu, there's one more strange thing

466
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,400
that I haven't told anyone before.

467
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,450
In the past, I never had any dreams.

468
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:04,360
However, whenever my life is in danger,

469
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,030
a cold and ruthless voice...

470
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,150
will appear in my dream.

471
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,360
 It's the Devil Lord. 

472
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,420
♫  Let the sweetness of your slight smile  ♫

473
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,700
♫  And the saltiness of my tears  ♫

474
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:25,840
♫  be your repayment and my debt  ♫

475
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,850
Don't be afraid. I'll stay by your side.

476
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,620
If it appears again, I'll wake you up from your dream.

477
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,060
♫  A heart ravaged by love and hate refuses to fly away  ♫

478
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,690
Don't worry.

479
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,450
It hasn't appeared for a long time.

480
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:51,110
Besides, you are the only person I dream about.

481
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,900
 Tantai Jin, no matter what happens, 

482
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,860
 I'll stay by your side... 

483
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,970
 until that moment arrives. 

484
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,610
Ye Xiwu, I'm thinking about

485
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,690
giving you a promotion

486
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,580
so that you can enter and exit the court easily.

487
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,560
And you can also visit your family whenever you like.

488
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,570
What kind of rank does Your Majesty desire to grant me? Tell me.

489
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,870
Why don't I appoint you as my Royal Bedchamber Maid?

490
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:45,040
You are permitted to sleep on the floor beside me.

491
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,520
Forget it. Sleeping on my firm bed is much better than sleeping on the floor.

492
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,710
If so, I'll make a bed on your floor.

493
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,110
All right. Since you wish to promote me,

494
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,430
I guess I have no choice but to accept your kindness.

495
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,230
That's more like it.

496
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,410
Your Majesty, it's getting late. It's time for you to sleep.

497
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,760
I haven't finished my drawing yet.

498
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,810
I'll stay here a little longer.

499
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,130
This is me. That's you.

500
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,530
General Ye, the hot water for your bath is ready.

501
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,590
Thank you. You may leave.

502
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,070
Yes, sir.

503
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,510
What are you doing here?

504
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,840
Of course, I'm here to take a bath.

505
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,400
I…

506
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,960
Don't you have hot water in your house?

507
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,420
Yes, I have. However…

508
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:55,100
So, what is your answer to my previous question?

509
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,700
Ye Qingyu,

510
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,780
are you a man or not?

511
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,730
Pianran, I fell for you

512
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,780
ever since you saved my life.

513
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:40,120
I don't care if you're a human or a demon or what you have experienced. They don't matter to me.

514
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,210
Ye Qingyu.

515
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,210
You are a fool.

516
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:02,020
Well. Since you have been silly for such a long time,

517
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,500
let me be merciful and tell you one thing.

518
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,100
You trained at Xiaoyao Sect before.

519
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,530
Have you ever heard of love threads?

520
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,050
All intelligent beings have them.

521
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,440
You can't love someone without them.

522
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:30,280
I was once married to a man.

523
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,060
His name was Jiang Rao.

524
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,770
I gave my love threads to him.

525
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:38,510
But he went to the battlefield

526
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,590
and died.

527
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,650
Thus, my love threads were lost.

528
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,730
You resemble him so much.

529
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,180
He was also a dumb soldier.

530
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,980
He spent all his days on the battlefield.

531
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,210
- So, you did it from the beginning… 
 - That's right.

532
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,390
I wouldn't have saved you with my demonic power

533
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,200
if your profile didn't resemble his.

534
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,850
Now, I have no love threads.

535
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,960
I cannot fall in love.

536
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,510
But since you resemble him,

537
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,060
I'll provide you with two options.

538
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,250
What if I insist on spending my life with you?

539
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,460
Fine.

540
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:45,150
You might as well change your name.

541
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:50,400
Why don't you call yourself Jiang Rao?

542
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,880
What? You are not even willing to change your name?

543
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,100
How dare you say you love me, then?

544
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,050
Pianran,

545
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,030
if I agree to it,

546
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,970
not only will I humiliate myself,

547
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:25,960
but I will also taint the relationship between you and Jiang Rao.

548
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,380
Ye Qingyu,

549
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,840
I thought you were an idiot.

550
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,630
But I didn't expect you to be a lunatic.

551
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,530
Fine. You're not willing to do it, huh?

552
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,620
The world is filled with men who want to share this momentary pleasure with me.

553
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,540
Farewell.

554
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,840
Your Majesty.

555
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,080
Little fox, you are being courteous today.

556
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,290
What's the matter? Do you need a favor from me?

557
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:41,240
Your Majesty, now that the Sheng Kingdom has been defeated, the world is about to be united.

558
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,100
Your ambitions have been achieved.

559
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,090
Since I have always been faithful in my duties,

560
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:49,320
even if I don't get credit, I should be recognized for my hard work.

561
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,790
I would like to ask Your Majesty for a reward today.

562
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,450
Tell me. What do you desire?

563
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:01,270
I'm just a wild fox that came from the hills. I hate being tied down.

564
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:05,450
Your Majesty, please give me the cure and set me free.

565
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,630
You desire to leave?

566
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,540
You got a lot of nerve.

567
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,840
But if you do leave,

568
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,760
Ye Xiwu will be upset.

569
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,460
It's not like I'm going to vanish.

570
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:38,490
If Second Young Miss Ye wants to see me, she can still do so.

571
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,360
It seems like...

572
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,090
you're determined to leave.

573
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,600
Pianran, Pianran, doesn't the Jing Kingdom

574
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,830
have anything worth staying for?

575
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,280
- It looks like there is. 
 - Wait a minute…

576
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,540
I have given your antidote to Ye Qingyu.

577
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,570
Why did you give it to him? That's my Achilles' heel.

578
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,210
He asked for it early in the morning.

579
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,350
Does he know that I'm leaving?

580
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:20,860
General Ye is honest and hardworking.

581
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:25,040
He knelt before me and made a vow this morning. That's why I gave it to him.

582
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,230
You can ask him for the antidote if you desire to leave.

583
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,920
You…

584
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:35,650
Tantai Jin, you scum! I wish that you die alone!

585
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,900
You…

586
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,080
What a feisty fox.

587
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,360
