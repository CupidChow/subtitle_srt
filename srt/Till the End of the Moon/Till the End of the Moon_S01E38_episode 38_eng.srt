00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,380
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,720
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,020
♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

7
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,620
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,080
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,260
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape  ♫

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,580
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad  ♫

12
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:19,220
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, to heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

16
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,980
   

17
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,130
 Mo Nv. 

18
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,140
 You're here to take revenge for your sister. 

19
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,860
 You're a demon while now I'm the Devil Lord. 

20
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,130
 How dare you challenge me with your pathetic skills? 

21
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,540
 Why don't you submit to me, just as your sister did? 

22
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,330
 You two can reunite in my body. 

23
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,050
 Siying, I'm coming to keep you company. 

24
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,853
Shatter!

25
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,710
Miss, run quickly!

26
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,960
 Another one to be sacrificed. 

27
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:16,110
 All of you, come and submit to me and the All-in-Distress Path. 

28
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,360
 You should feel honored. 

29
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,470
 I can't believe he's devouring the demonic power of the entire Barren Abyss. 

30
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,290
The All-in-Distress Path.

31
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,810
What's that?

32
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,820
It's the All-in-Distress Path.

33
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,260
Tantai Jin has initiated the All-in-Distress Path.

34
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,330
 It's the All-in-Distress Path. 

35
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,210
 How come? 

36
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,090
 Look at the sky! 

37
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,470
 - What's that? 
 - I have no idea. 

38
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,980
 - What's that? 
 - I don't know. 

39
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,710
 - Look! 
 - What's that? 

40
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,281
Gosh! The All-in-Distress Path is opened.

41
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,370
 The All-in-Distress Path. What to do? 

42
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,620
Since the All-in-Distress Path is opened, disciples of Chixiao Sect, stop the search

43
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,790
and return to the sect with me right away to build a protective barrier and preserve our powers.

44
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,950
Go.

45
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,120
- We need to hurry back and cast the Sect-Protection Array. 
 - Yes.

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,901
- The All-in-Distress Path is opened. 
 - Nowhere is safe in the world now.

47
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:34,480
Exactly. You have somewhere to hide.

48
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,630
What about the others?

49
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,930
Dimian, stop!

50
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,850
Who else has a death wish?

51
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,170
 Dimian has been completely controlled by the Devil Lord. 

52
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,870
 He stopped at nothing to open the All-in-Distress Path. 

53
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,190
 I must first try to awaken Dimian. 

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,133
 Run quickly! 

55
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,270
 Hurry up! 

56
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,263
 Run quickly! 

57
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,693
Everyone, now, the Devil Lord has come back to life, and the All-in-Distress Path has been opened.

58
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:09,280
The Four Continents are doomed to be destroyed.

59
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Whether we fight or not, we'll die.

60
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,410
Will anyone here enter the Barren Abyss with me and fight the Devil Lord to the end?

61
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,530
I will go with you.

62
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,850
I will.

63
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,620
- I will too. 
 - We will.

64
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,900
I will fight the Devil Lord to the end.

65
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
I will also go with you.

66
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,900
Tantai Jin is cunning.

67
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,530
Now, he's become the Devil Lord.

68
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,900
He's extremely dangerous.

69
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,230
Once you find any traces of Tantai Jin, immediately write to your companions to request support.

70
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,820
We'll work together to kill him.

71
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,430
You must never act rashly or be fooled by him.

72
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,600
 Devil Lord, you failed to ruin my disciple. 

73
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,720
 Now, you're controlling Dimian to initiate the All-in-Distress Path by force. 

74
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,280
 I'll destroy your devil cave before you get any stronger! 

75
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,250
 Dimian, stop him! 

76
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,000
 Do you want to destroy the All-in-Distress Path? 

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,290
 I'll let you two perish together with it! 

78
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,720
 What happened? Just now, I was controlled by the Devil Lord. 

79
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,300
 The Devil Lord has disappeared. 

80
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,850
 And the demon energy backfired on me. 

81
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,500
The All-in-Distress Path is actually opened.

82
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,800
What I look for is right under my nose.

83
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,290
It's been 10,000 years.

84
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,820
At last, it's my turn!

85
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,050
I'll become the new Devil Lord.

86
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,900
 How come the power of the All-in-Distress Path is so weak? 

87
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,000
 The All-in-Distress Path opened by the Devil Lord 10,000 years ago wasn't like this. 

88
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,780
 Could it be that there is not enough resentment? 

89
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,670
 Resentment. 

90
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,670
 I need to collect more sorrow, grief, resentment, and hatred. 

91
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,660
 Sure enough, without the Devil Lord connected to the All-in-Distress Path, it can't unleash its maximum power. 

92
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,460
 I see. This is how everything fits together according to fate. 

93
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,243
 Zhaoyou, you can't possibly escape! 

94
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:16,530
 Since the All-in-Distress Path is opened, no one can close it. 

95
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,030
 Once I collect enough resentment and hatred and continue to stimulate the All-in-Distress Path,  

96
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,890
 I'll rule the Four Continents and Three Realms! 

97
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,363
Mo Nv?

98
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,363
Mo Nv.

99
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,973
You… What are you doing here?

100
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,240
The Devil Lord has come back to life.

101
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,670
It's extremely dangerous here.

102
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,130
Leave quickly.

103
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
 I've finally found it. 

104
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,090
 This place should be the center of the All-in-Distress Path. 

105
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,020
 It is my destiny to stop the Devil Lord from being resurrected. 

106
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,710
 Now the All-in-Distress Path is opened. 

107
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,960
 No matter who the Devil Lord is, I must fight with him to the death. 

108
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,330
 Mother. 

109
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,263
 Dad. 

110
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:47,640
 Please protect me. 

111
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,040
Susu, I'm so happy you are here.

112
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,190
Thanks to you, my father, I did not lose my life.

113
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:37,533
Susu, whether you believe me or hate me, I had my bitter reasons.

114
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:43,110
Apart from sealing the evil bone, I have never deceived you or intended to harm your life.

115
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,500
Then I'll have to thank you.

116
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,270
Now, everything is well.

117
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,630
The All-in-Distress Path has started, and now, I own the power of the Devil Lord.

118
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,250
As long as enough sorrow, grief, resentment, and hatred are offered to it,

119
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,460
I can become the one and only god in the world.

120
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,513
Susu, your father is the master of the world,

121
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,750
and you are my most beloved daughter.

122
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,770
That's exactly what I've been hoping for.

123
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,270
You are doing something silly.

124
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,340
I have done something sillier, which was trusting you.

125
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,630
Because of that, Dad died!

126
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,510
I am your real father! I gave you life!

127
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,120
Then I will give you my life back!

128
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,240
We shall perish together today!

129
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,670
You dared to attack your own biological father for an outsider.

130
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,603
Shut up!

131
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,060
Dad searched the Four Continents to find me.

132
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,940
He protected me when I was born, raised me to adulthood,

133
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,700
taught me to differentiate right from wrong,

134
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,520
and love all people.

135
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,760
His whole heart was devoted to me.

136
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,830
He risked his life to protect mine!

137
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,370
In this life and this world, I only have one father!

138
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,460
And you,

139
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,750
you are the enemy who killed my father!

140
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,260
You truly take after your mother.

141
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,990
Both of you are straightforward and stubborn.

142
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:33,140
I'm sure she regretted her decision that she didn't kill you back then.

143
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:49,010
I have endured endless humiliation and suffering for the past 10,000 years.

144
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,290
And now, I finally succeeded.

145
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,000
Not only did you not congratulate me,

146
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,070
but you are also being rebellious.

147
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,700
I am sad

148
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,840
and disappointed.

149
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,723
Dimian,

150
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,570
you are so pathetic.

151
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,270
In that case,

152
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,150
I have no choice but to put you out of your misery.

153
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,280
Your sorrow, grief, resentment, and hatred will be offered to the All-in-Distress Path.

154
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,320
This way, you have repaid me for the grace of your birth.

155
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:19,280
♫  I am not afraid of how the world treats me  ♫

156
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,770
♫  To debate, to refute, struggling yet can't see any gods  ♫

157
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,040
Tantai Jin, you are still alive?

158
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,900

I don't understand what you are saying.

or the Devil Lord?

230
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,353
All right then.

I might as well just explain everything to you.

Susu, a leopard can't change its spots. So does Tantai Jin.

238
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,580
You have seen that Tantai Jin devoured Dimian.

239
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,830
Before this, he also killed Master Zhaoyou in front of everyone.

240
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,970
He is full of evil, so you must stop your wishful thinking. He can never change.

241
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,640
 Cang Jiumin, you animal! 

242
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,680
 - What have you done? 
 - Cang Jiumin! 

243
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,780
 Does your ungrateful heart still remember what happened in the past? 

244
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,640
 You would have died outside and been reduced to dust if Master hadn't taken you back then! 

245
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,010
 How could you! 

246
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,043
 Tantai Jin! Why did you do this? 

247
00:24:47,043 --> 00:24:49,660
 What did Zhaoyou do wrong to you? 

248
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,580
 For no reason. 

249
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,340
 I was born this way. 

250
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,150
 And I killed you once 500 years ago. 

251
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,390
 Now, I can kill you again. 

252
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,510
 - Master! 
 - Master! 

253
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:22,170
 - Master! 
 - Master! 

254
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,320
You can't trust him whatsoever.

255
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,800
 Tantai Jin, what is going on? 

256
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,720
 Farewell, Li Susu. 

257
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,520
 Now there is no one else left in this Devil Palace. 

258
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,870
 You all want me dead. 

259
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,083
 Jiumin, go! 

260
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,663
 Jiumin! 

261
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:00,353
 Master! 

262
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,070
 You saved me again. 

263
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,600
 Silly kid, don't forget, I'm your master. 

264
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,030
 Master, why have we returned to the Xiaoyao Sect? 

265
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,580
 I used Xiaoyao Swordplay to set up a barrier here. 

266
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,390
 As long as I'm still alive, this barrier can protect you. 

267
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,220
 Do they still think that I stole the evil bone? 

268
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,053
 Yes. 

269
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:26,860
 If so, Master, are you still willing to believe in me? 

270
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,880
 Of course, I do. 

271
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,820
 In the world, no matter who covets the evil bone, it can never be you. 

272
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,380
 It was Dimian. He has the evil bone. 

273
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:42,233
 Jiumin, promise me that you have to live well. 

274
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,863
 Master? 

275
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,783
 Master! Don't go. 

276
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,720
 Don't go there alone. 

277
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,120
 Remember my words, live well. 

278
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,693
 Master! Master! 

279
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:06,450
 - You… 
 - Jiumin, I don't have much time left. 

280
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:12,310
 Dimian has become the Devil Lord, and the All-in-Distress Path has started. 

281
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,860
 When foul energy fills Heaven and Earth, 

282
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,780
 the Three Realms will be done for. 

283
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,713
 How? 

284
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:25,423
 Why? 

285
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:29,090
 Every array has a weakness. 

286
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,990
 There must be a way to stop the All-in-Distress Path. 

287
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,400
 The All-in-Distress Path can be stopped. 

288
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,570
 However, only the Devil Lord can do it. 

289
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,833
 The Devil Lord? 

290
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,130
 When the Devil Lord exists, the All-in-Distress Path will exist. 

291
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,300
 When the Devil God perishes, the All-in-Distress Way will perish. 

292
00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:00,060
 Jiumin, did you know why I gave you this name? 

293
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,060
 I see now. 

294
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,280
 When I found you near the Ruo Water, 

295
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,280
 I knew you were a jinx and you were destined to be alone in your life. 

296
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,820
 So, 

297
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,160
 back then, 

298
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,580
 you already knew that I was the biggest calamity in the world. 

299
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,750
 But, Jiumin, you should know 

300
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:43,800
 that no one is supposed to live in the dark forever. 

301
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,830
 You knew I was the demon fetus. 

302
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,830
 Even so, you were willing to give me a chance to choose my life. 

303
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,820
 Jiumin, help me up. 

304
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,070
 I wish to take another look at our Xiaoyao Sect. 

305
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,750
 Master. Master! 

306
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,840
 I have been tainted by the energy of the All-in-Distress Path. 

307
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,030
 No matter what kind of living creature you are, as long as you're infected by it, 

308
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,380
 once your will gets weak, you'll go berserk and turn into a devil. 

309
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,820
 Jiumin, I need you to do one more thing for me. 

310
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,030
 Kill me. 

311
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,510
 Don't let me turn into a devil zombie. 

312
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,240
 Master, please don't say that. 

313
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,260
 I'll take you back for treatment. 

314
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,793
 Let's go. 

315
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:35,893
 Master! 

316
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,950
 Jiumin, kill me now! 

317
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,483
 Master! 

318
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,130
 Jiumin, I'll turn into a devil soon! 

319
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,810
 Jiumin, a weapon can kill but it can also save people. 

320
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,800
 It's up to the intention of the one who wields it. 

321
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,460
 I can't do it, Master. 

322
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,910
 Jiumin, hurry and kill me! 

323
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,530
 I can't do it. 

324
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,840
 If not, it'll be too late! 

325
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,770
 Master, please don't force me! 

326
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,530
 Kill me and save the others! 

327
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,220
 Tantai Jin, just do it! 

328
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,130
 Kill me! 

329
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,720
 Master. 

330
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,640
 Kill me! 

331
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,663
 Jiumin, it's not your fault for being born as the demon fetus. 

332
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:02,600
 Everyone should have the right to choose. 

333
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,233
 However, the All-in-Distress Path has been opened. 

334
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:13,120
 No one in the Three Realms can shut it down except for the Devil Lord. 

335
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:19,640
 Cang Jiumin, a disciple of the immortal sects, is powerless to save all living beings. 

336
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,930
 But Tantai Jin, the Devil Lord, can do it. 

337
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,953
 Jiumin,  the All-in-Distress Path is bound to you 

338
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:33,410
 and the Devil Lord. 

339
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,540
 All three of you live and die together. 

340
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,440
 I know it's unfair to you. 

341
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,950
 But this is the only chance to stop the Devil Lord from destroying the world. 

342
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,483
 Master, I understand. 

343
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,593
 Since this is the only path, 

344
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,000
 I shall take it. 

345
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,750
 No matter what I'll turn into, 

346
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,340
 I will always be both Tantai Jin and Cang Jiumin. 

347
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,430
 Master! 

348
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,090
 Cang Jiumin! You beast! 

349
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,623
 That's right. 

350
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:14,600
 I ended him personally. 

351
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,783
 Now, 

352
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,100
 it's a battle between us. 

353
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,340
♫  Tear open the wounds of the clouds and sky  ♫

354
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,053
 I will... 

355
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,550
 take everything away. 

356
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,410
♫   Life or death is as common as a smile   ♫

357
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,170
♫  Even if there's only a glimmer of hope  ♫

358
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,600
♫  Even if there's only a beam of light  ♫

359
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:49,270
♫  The long winds will never forget  ♫

360
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,900
 Mo Nv, what are you talking about? I don't get what you mean. 

361
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,900
 I was a devil originally. It's natural for me to travel across the world freely. 

362
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,880
 There's nothing strange about coming to the Devil Realm. 

363
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,100
 This can't be. How could it be? 

364
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,710
 - How could you be… 
 - Immortal Gongye, 

365
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,920
 let me tell you a story. 

366
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:26,470
 500 years ago, the Demon of Drought was sent to the Mortal Realm to undergo tribulations and restore her soul. 

367
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,030
 She became the eldest daughter of a state great general. 

368
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,370
 Her name was Ye Bingchang. 

369
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,160
 Then, she got married to 

370
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,970
 Prince Xuancheng, also known as Xiao Lin. They were in love. 

371
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,113
 Xiao Lin? 

372
00:33:46,113 --> 00:33:48,650
 However, good times didn't last long. 

373
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:55,100
 Ye Bingchang betrayed Xiao Lin and led him to his death. 

374
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,020
 Even so, Xiao Lin... 

375
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,520
 still loved her, tolerated her, 

376
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,540
 and protected her... 

377
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,070
 until his very last breath. 

378
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,690
 Ye Bingchang was remorseful about it until her death. 

379
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:19,980
 This regret is also engraved deeply in the heart of the Demon of Drought. 

380
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,770
 What happened after that? 

381
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,750
 After that, the Demon of Drought was awakened. 

382
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,550
 She was reluctant to part with the Mortal Realm. 

383
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,090
 So she returned to the mortal realm and set up an embroidery workshop. 

384
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,180
 However, fortune plays tricks on people. 

385
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:50,300
 She met a fool who looked exactly like Xiao Lin. 

386
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,570
 So she decided to deceive him just for fun. Am I right? 

387
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,330
 I thought I could make it up 

388
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,400
 to Xiao Lin by treating you nicely. 

389
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,780
 However, Gongye Jiwu, I have to thank you for letting me understand... 

390
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,720
 that Xiao Lin will never come back. 

391
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:33,280
 I used to hate it when people deceived me. 

392
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,990
 However, just now, I'd rather you deceive me. 

393
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,750
 I'd rather you deceive me for my entire life. 

394
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,360
 Why didn't you do so? 

395
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,610
 Gongye Jiwu, you resemble Xiao Lin too much. 

396
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,000
 You're just like him. 

397
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,950
 You're a good person, just like him. 

398
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,400
 It's a shame that you will never be him. 

399
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,080
 I've tried every way. 

400
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,100
 I still can't shut down the All-in-Distress Path. 

401
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,800
Now, the All-in-Distress Path is spreading day and night.

402
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,510
 I don't have much time left. 

403
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,480
 Tantai Jin, you need to figure out a solution soon. 

404
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,690
 In Enlightened Life, the Devil Lord removed the evil bone 

405
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,420
 with the help of the three devil artifacts and the All-in-Distress Path. 

406
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,430
 If I gather all three devil artifacts, I'll be able to imitate what he did 

407
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,940
 and remove the evil bone. 

408
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,950
 If everything goes well, 

409
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,350
 I can be killed, just like the Devil Lord back then. 

410
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,480
 Since the All-in-distress Path lives and dies with me, 

411
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,090
 it will be shut down together with my death. 

412
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,750
Thank you, Devil Lord. Thank you for avenging Siying.

413
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,850
Ye Bingchang?

414
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,100
I see.

415
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,000
Even after 500-year vicissitudes, in the end,

416
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,090
no one can escape from fate.

417
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,040
I thought losing Xiao Lin was just like losing my life.

418
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,120
In return, having a younger sister who truly loved me

419
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,980
was a blessing from heaven.

420
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,740
Who would've known that meeting her here would end up losing her again?

421
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,880
Why are you here?

422
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,600
The Devil Lord also saved my life 10,000 years ago.

423
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,150
Moreover, what Siying wanted the most was to follow the Devil Lord

424
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,850
and witness his return with her own eyes.

425
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,020
Now, she can't fulfill this wish.

426
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,130
As her elder sister, I'll witness this until the end on her behalf.

427
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:12,230
Tell me.  How can we make you the ruler of the Three Realms, just like 10,000 years ago?

428
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,800
As far as I know, the three devil artifacts haven't been retrieved yet.

429
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,530
The God-Slaying Crossbow and the Bone-Refining Seal are possessed by the immortal sects.

430
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,110
However, this is my business.

431
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,510
There's no grudge between us now.

432
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,380
Mo Nv, you can live your own life

433
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,540
even without Xiao Lin and Siying.

434
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:43,990
Tantai Jin, you seem different from the Devil Lord I know.

435
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,820
The world is vast. I'm sure you'll find a place you like.

436
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,630
Qu Xuanzi is dead.

437
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,520
Zhaoyou is dead, too. This is great!

438
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,820
Now, only my seal is on the God-Slaying Crossbow.

439
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:36,020
If it's the heavens' plan to take my son's life and deliver the God-Slaying Crossbow to me,

440
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,730
how can I give this treasure to those children from Hengyang Sect?

441
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,620
I must put your power to good use.

442
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:50,480
From now on, I am the ruler of all immortal sects!

443
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,950
I'm returning the Devil Lord's eye to you.

444
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,230
Sect Leader Cen was murdered. The God-Slaying Crossbow was stolen.

445
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,990
Now all the sect leaders of the three major sects are dead.

446
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,160
Out of the three devil artifacts, only the Bone-Refining Seal remains in Hengyang Sect.

447
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,280
But who knows for how long we can keep it?

448
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,490
Tantai Jin really went too far.

449
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:49,300
Who exactly killed Sect Leader Cen?

450
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,850
According to disciples of the Chixiao Sect, it was done by a female demon in red.

451
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:59,890
She did resemble Siying, the Demon of Drought.

452
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,450
 You changed me completely. 

453
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,753
 You gave me a second chance in life. 

454
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:18,800
 Never again will I taint myself with the Devil Lord's power. 

455
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,630
 For you, 

456
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,240
 I'll make good on this promise. 

457
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,520
 Tantai Jin! What are you doing? 

458
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,930
 Tantai Jin has gone berserk! He killed Master Zhaoyou! 

459
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,930
 Now, everything you have done 

460
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,070
 is in vain. 

461
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,580
 Whatever my destiny is, 

462
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,690
 I will choose to be righteous or evil on my own. 

463
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,363
 I... 

464
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,060
 will never become the Devil Lord! 

465
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:57,000
 Only by getting rid of the Devil Lord can they feel at ease. 

466
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,200
 And only then 

467
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,940
 can I live with you in peace. 

468
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,463
Susu, come back with me.

469
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:51,510
It's no longer safe outside the sect ever since the All-in-Distress Path was opened.

470
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,920
Eldest Senior Brother, just leave me alone.

471
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,050
Now that I've left the sect, I'll be responsible for my own life.

472
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,730
What are you going to do?

473
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,050
Will you look for Tantai Jin?

474
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,130
What's the point of it now?

475
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,180
He killed his own master,

476
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,500
murdered the disciples of Chixiao Sect to snatch the crossbow.

477
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,610
He was probably in cahoots with Dimian.

478
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,930
He's a devil with his hands full of blood.

479
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,180
You're still not willing to believe it?

480
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,540
Li Susu, calm down.

481
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,040
You'll get yourself killed if you go there now!

482
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,850
Eldest Senior Brother, let go of me.

483
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,200
What if he had bitter reasons?

484
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,260
No matter what, I have to be there.

485
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,520
I must get an explanation from him.

486
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,900
If I have to live in the dark like this, I'd rather die.

487
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,160
At least I must know whom I should hate.

488
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,850
Fine. Since you're so determined,

489
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,600
I'll let you go.

490
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,080
Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother.

491
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,760
 But from now on, 

492
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,020
 you will no longer be a disciple of Hengyang Sect. 

493
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,070
 And you will no longer be my junior sister. 

494
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,410
 I'm sorry, Eldest Senior Brother. 

495
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,820
 God-Slaying Crossbow? 

496
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,900
 Mo Nv still meddled in my affairs. 

497
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,583
 Never mind. I'll play my part as the Devil Lord. 

498
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,620
 This way, Susu can give up on me completely, 

499
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,340
 and the immortal sects will hunt me down without mercy. 

500
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,613
 Stop! 

501
00:46:08,613 --> 00:46:10,400
 Over there. After her! 

502
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,400
 Welcome back, My Lord! 

503
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,230
 Welcome back, My Lord! 

504
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,730
 Welcome back, My Lord! 

505
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,690
I've kept all of you waiting.

506
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,720
From today onward, I am your master.

507
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,790
I want chaos to the world and distress for ages.

508
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:57,250
 Chaos to the world! Distress for ages! 

509
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:01,460
 Chaos to the world! Distress for ages! 

510
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,240
 I've obtained the Sky-Slashing Sword and the God-Slaying Crossbow. 

511
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,660
 The Bone-Refining Seal is still in the hands of Hengyang Sect. 

512
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,550
 Distress for ages! 

513
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,650
 Once I gather the three devil artifacts together, 

514
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:19,150
 the All-in-Distress Path will be able to unleash its maximum power. 

515
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:25,800
I heard that they cast spells layer upon layer around the Bone-Refining Seal.

516
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,430
They wish to seriously injure me with the power of Heaven and Earth.

517
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,240
They can keep on dreaming.

518
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,060
 Kill them! Take the Bone-Refining Seal back! 

519
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,650
 Kill them! Take the Bone-Refining Seal back! 

520
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,030
I'm in a good mood today. There's no need to kill anyone.

521
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,600
Let me play a trick on them.

522
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,020
Bone-Refining Seal.

523
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,240
Cang Jiumin actually activated the array to summon the devil artifact.

524
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,650
Sect Leader, what should we do?

525
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,500
He has already retrieved two devil artifacts.

526
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,300
We can't afford to let him retrieve the last one.

527
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,020
Everyone, stand back!

528
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:02,880
 You are merely like ants. Stop wasting your energy. 

529
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,820
What's that sound?

530
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,110
It's the Devil Lord.

531
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,480
Tantai Jin!

532
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,900
How savage you are to take the Bone-Refining Seal without even showing up?

533
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,420
Gongye Jiwu, do you still intend to resist me? 
    

534
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,740
 Take my advice. Bow to me. 
   

535
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,360
 Bow to absolute power. 

536
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,371
In your dreams!

537
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:23,060
   

538
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,030
- Eldest Senior Brother! 
 - Senior Brother!

539
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,210
 Chaos to the world! Distress for ages! 

540
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,380
 Chaos to the world! Distress for ages! 

541
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,980
 So, this is the All-in-Distress Path. 

542
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,400
 This feeling exceeds the limits of senses. 

543
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:47,620
 Chaos to the world! Distress for ages! 

544
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,290
 Chaos to the world! Distress for ages! 

545
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:56,270
 So, this is the power of the All-in-Distress Way. 

546
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,450
 Evil 

547
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,640
 Chaos to the world! Distress for ages! 

548
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:44,020
    

549
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:54,030
