3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,460
♫  Dark night, wet moon, and cold blood  ♫

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,300
♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:39,140
♫  Is it bright and warm? I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

7
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,640
♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,140
♫  I do not fear how people treat me in this world  ♫

9
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,180
♫  Breaking through, struggling to escape   ♫

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,600
♫  How to differentiate between good and bad   ♫

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,040
♫   There are times when I'm fragile, heal wounds with a kiss of love  ♫

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,230
♫  My existence  ♫

13
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:31,260
♫  Thorns won't break my wings  ♫

14
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,120
   

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,880
   

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,020
It's only been a few days and you have already proclaimed yourself a king.

17
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,800
You have really changed my view of you.

18
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,190
The last time I saw you, you were the awe-inspiring Junior General Ye.

19
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,950
It's only been a few days, and you look worn out.

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,590
If I kill you now or take you back alive, my family will have another military merit.

21
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,620
Then go ahead and try.

22
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,710
See if you'll get a promotion or if your king will dread you for being a threat to his throne.

23
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,330
That's irrelevant for now.

24
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,830
If I kill you today, I would be killing a malicious man for the world!

25
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,590
Ye Qingyu, I've been a hostage in the Sheng Kingdom for years.

26
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,390
We both know how paranoid King Sheng is.

27
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,090
The Ye Family is in a precarious situation.

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,880
Be it punishment or reward, I'll thank my king.

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,430
Our Ye Family is and will be Sheng people.

30
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,300
I won't be incited by a few words from you.

31
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,363
Fair enough.

32
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:47,130
The Ye Family is under the Sheng King's orders. If it were only the Ye Family that were suffering,

33
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,280
you'd be able to tolerate it.

34
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,880
But what about people with no power to resist,

35
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,760
like me, when I was married into your family?

36
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,470
The King of Sheng doesn't care about their lives.

37
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,740
If your family is satisfied by enjoying a life of peace bestowed by the king

38
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,310
and indulging in his incapability by letting him do as he wishes,

39
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,600
the people in the Sheng Kingdom will only suffer more.

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,300
General Ye, I've checked war records in Jia Pass over these years.

41
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,500
You always charge into battle first in front of the troop, fighting side by side with your men.

42
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,740
That is why the Jia Pass is united

43
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,750
and known to be the protective barrier for the Sheng Kingdom.

44
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,650
What's the point of saying so?

45
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,690
In a game of power between two kingdoms, I'm only a king's pawn.

46
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,960
Don't belittle yourself, General.

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,030
The game of power favors brutal force.

48
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,850
But, General Ye, you're more than just a force,

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,320
whether in terms of capability or temperament.

50
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,490
Your benevolence

51
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,440
could disguise the violence of the king that wreaks havoc on people,

52
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,670
while in good use, it brings peace to the land.

53
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,670
It's up to you,

54
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,540
whether you prioritize loyalty

55
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,230
or the civilians.

56
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,180
 I hope there will be no more wars in the world, and one day the countries can be reunified. 

57
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,740
   

58
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,060
General, the court gives the same order, that should Jia Pass fall,

59
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,280
then the Ye Family will… be exterminated.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,010
 The jade is a gift from Emperor Gaozu and a symbol of the Ye Family warden for generations. 

61
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,310
 Today, I give it to you now. 

62
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,670
   

63
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,800
 Remember. 

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,700
 Do not yield. Die for honor if need be. 

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
 If not for your premature wisdom that stands out in the crowd, 

66
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,740
 I hoped to have you carefree as your big brother, 

67
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,400
 wining and dining at home and being an ordinary man. 

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,260
 What a nice life. Why did you choose to be a hero? 

69
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,940
 Father, Eldest Brother has the fortune to live an easy life. 

70
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,950
 Now that I'm the home supervisor. 

71
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,020
 Then all responsibility of the Ye Family shall rest upon my shoulders, 

72
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,980
 whether it's about the Sheng Kingdom or the whole land. 

73
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,660
 I'll do what I must do. 

74
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,370
 My personal concern should be the last. 

75
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,270
 You're always trying to be a hero. 

76
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,380
A few bumps are what you need.

77
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,770
 The army of the Jing Kingdom has reached the gate, General. 

78
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:36,260
 Ye Qingyu, do you actually think your reputation is more important than the lives of thousands of soldiers? 

79
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,760
 Enough talking! 

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,420
 It's up to you, 

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,120
 whether you prioritize loyalty 

82
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,660
 or the civilians. 

83
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,660
 Should Jia Pass fall, the Ye Family will be exterminated. 

84
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,720
 If your family is satisfied by enjoying a life of peace bestowed by the king and indulging in his incapability by letting him do as he wishes, 

85
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,120
 the people in this country, will only suffer more. 

86
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,690
 As the guardian general of the borders, I receive a salary from the court. I am duty-bound to protect the Sheng Kingdom with all my heart and strength. 

87
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,640
 However, deep down in my heart, I hope there will be no more wars in the world, and one day the countries can be reunified. 

88
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:27,240
 What I want to do is rule the whole land and end the war. 

89
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,040
Deputy General Liu.

90
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,083
Sir.

91
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,930
Open the gate.

92
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,463
Yes, sir.

93
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,120
To surrender.

94
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,583
General.

95
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,350
 Sorry, Father, 

96
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,210
 I am disloyal and unfilial. 

97
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,290
 I only hope to save the people. 

98
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,700
   

99
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,280
You spent years guarding this place.

100
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:57,770
I didn't expect your residence to be so humble.

101
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,160
King Sheng is cruel and paranoid.

102
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,120
When he recieves word, he will probably implicate your family.

103
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,440
I've sent people to the capital of Sheng to bring your family back here.

104
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,020
They'll arrive in the Jing Kingdom in a few days.

105
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

106
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,340
I understand you had a difficult life living with my family.

107
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,710
Yet you do not fault them but repay with goodwill.

108
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,710
You are extremely benevolent.

109
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,000
Ye Qingyu,

110
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,330
I save your family, for I don't want to see your talent wasted nor your life at risk.

111
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,380
Do you understand?

112
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,120
From now on,

113
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,080
I will shield your back and give my life for yours if need be.

114
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:16,603
General Ye, having your sword is my great honor.

115
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,173
Your Majesty, is my second sister faring well?

116
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,660
How should I know?

117
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,703
She…

118
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:44,140
She left months ago.

119
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,190
She's a bit willful. If she offended you, I beg you to pardon her negligence.

120
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,750
I take all responsibility.

121
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,960
I'm a little tired. You should rest, too.

122
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,430
- I… 
 - General Ye, this way.

123
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,870
 Ye Xiwu, where are you? 

124
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,540
Mr. Yue. Mrs. Yue, I'll leave her to your care.

125
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,830
Rest assured. We bear no children, we will treat her as our own daughter.

126
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,530
 Fuya had a miserable childhood. 

127
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,090
 For safety, she needs a new name. 

128
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,350
The girl is now yours.

129
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,960
She needs a name to start anew.

130
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,820
We are farmers. You seem well-educated. Maybe you can pick a name.

131
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,150
Yeah, that would be better.

132
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,740
Then, how about Yue Ya?

133
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,390
The "Ya" in the line of the poem "The spring day is at the edge of the sky" 
  (Li Shangyin Poem) 

134
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,860
Yue Ya.

135
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,841
- Yue Ya. 
 - Beautiful.

136
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:00,810
A good name.

137
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:05,070
When she smiles, her eyes squint like a crescent. 
("Crescent" is a homonym with her name)

138
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,000
Here, Fuya.

139
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,733
Go.

140
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,020
Fuya, do you like this place?

141
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,170
Yes.

142
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,740
From now on, your name is Yue Ya.

143
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,350
The name, Yue Fuya, must be kept unknown.

144
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,850
- Do you understand? 
 - Yes.

145
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,340
If you want to learn magic arts, take this letter to Mount Changze and ask for Hengyang Sect.

146
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,280
It's Hengyang Sect, remember.

147
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,050
Hengyang Sect. I'll remember it.

148
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,670
I hope we'll see each other again.

149
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,183
Farewell.

150
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,740
Sister!

151
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,520
Goodbye!

152
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,020
 Jia Pass. 

153
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,040
How dare you!

154
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,570
Before I could receive word of Jia Pass, the whole Ye Family ran away overnight.

155
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,900
You think that I'll spare your life?

156
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,410
Guards. Send a cavalry.

157
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,400
They are my dogs and even if they were to die they must be buried beneath me.

158
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,200
Calm down, Royal Father. Jia Pass has fallen.

159
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,571
The urgency now is to dispatch troops and reclaim the lost land.

160
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,170
Don't defend them.

161
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,400
Reclaim the lost land?

162
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,540
Ye Xiao has left northward, and Ye Qingyu has surrendered. There are no men for the job.

163
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,800
You made an excuse when I dispatched the troops.

164
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,670
Are you privy to Ye Qingyu's scheme?

165
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,810
Please calm down, Royal Father.

166
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,310
In just a few months, Tantai Jin employed talent and reduced punishment and taxes

167
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,810
to regain peace and prosperity.

168
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,740
It's improper to war with him.

169
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,550
- We shall… 
 - Stop your nonsense.

170
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,810
You refuse to go to war so you can replace me.

171
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,130
- Is that your plan? 
 - No, Royal Father.

172
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,860
I serve you with heart and soul.

173
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,710
I am willing to lead an army and reclaim Jia Pass.

174
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,603
As you wish.

175
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,520
I have one more wish, Royal Father.

176
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,800
Name it.

177
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,170
Bingchang's from Ye family. But she's my wife now.

178
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,710
I beg you to spare her life.

179
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,723
Very well.

180
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:51,660
Considering your sincerity, I'll spare her.

181
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,020
Thank you, Royal Father. I'll not fail you. I will not surrender until I die.

182
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,080
Why don't you leave for the Jing Kingdom with Ye Xiao and Ye Qingyu?

183
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,120
Are you staying in the Sheng Capital to spy on us?

184
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,100
 Yes, you're a spy! 

185
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,960
The loyalty of the Ye Family is a joke.

186
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,140
Shame on you. Surrender without resistance,

187
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,870
I used to accept her food. How awful.

188
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,980
Shame on you.

189
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,080
 Ye, the traitor. 

190
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,200
 You don't deserve to be Prince Xuancheng's Consort. 

191
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,840
 Get out of our kingdom. 

192
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,273
 Get out of here. 

193
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,440
 Get out, daughter of Ye, the traitor. 

194
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,773
 Bah! 

195
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,550
 Out, out! 

196
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,000
 Out, get out, out! 

197
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,720
I apologize for arriving late

198
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,670
and causing you to suffer.

199
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,690
It won't happen again.

200
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,630
But now, I'm worried about leaving you here.

201
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,890
What do you mean?

202
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,550
What do you mean leave me here?

203
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,690
Now I have no family to rely upon.

204
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,721
- Your Highness. 
 - Hear me out.

205
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:46,110
Father has promised me that he will spare you.

206
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,800
Now that the Sheng Kingdom has no general.

207
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,020
I have volunteered to go to battle.

208
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,740
- You're going to the battlefield? 
 - Yes.

209
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,350
Bingchang, the battlefield is treacherous and tough.

210
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,670
You're too gentle.

211
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,403
Your Highness, the people are angry.

212
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:09,740
Even if His Majesty spares me, they won't do the same to a member of the Ye Family.

213
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,480
But that's the least of my concerns.

214
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,090
What troubles me is that there's no one to tend to you.

215
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:20,300
If I must die, I want to die beside you.

216
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,310
Your Highness, please take me with you.

217
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't want to stay here alone.

218
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,493
Fine.

219
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:32,880
The war is unpredictable,

220
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,040
but I'll protect you.

221
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,280
I recall the last time I drank tea with General Ye in the capital.

222
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,140
How does it come to be like this?

223
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,090
You can never tell.

224
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,180
In a war between two countries, the people suffer the most.

225
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,590
If I had a choice…

226
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,700
Junior Martial Uncle, we have lived in two different worlds.

227
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,690
A matter of this kind should not trouble you.

228
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,620
You'd better return to Mount Buzhao.

229
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,010
The war is not my concern.

230
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,930
It's you who I'm worried about.

231
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,040
You risk your life on the battlefield.

232
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,860
How can I not do the same?

233
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:33,150
If our brothers and sisters ask, how am I supposed to answer?

234
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,300
Plus, earthly experience is cultivation, too.

235
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,990
I've heard people say that the principle of the Xiaoyao Sect is to mind other people's business.

236
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,760
I used to doubt that.

237
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,210
I never expected it to be true.

238
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,250
I didn't expect Xiao Lin to come in person.

239
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,430
It seems your surrender has provoked King Sheng.

240
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,530
But I'm looking forward to meeting with Xiao Lin again.

241
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,420
     
 In the old days in the Sheng Kingdom, he was the noble Sixth Prince,

242
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,050
while I was a hostage prince under his care.

243
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:27,230
One may say he is my benefactor.

244
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,700
Sixth Prince is benevolent, and cannot help but arouse loyalty and gratitude in those around him.

245
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,970
He arouses loyalty and gratitude in those around him.

246
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,900
That's who he is.

247
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:46,460
But I'm afraid I'll be the man who returns evil for good.

248
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,180
The beast...

249
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,970
only dines and sleeps for a whole day.

250
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,450
Capturing Sheng with them might take a while.

251
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:10,793
Pianran, find some powerful demons for me.

252
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,250
All great demons within our range are now answering your call.

253
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,150
There are no more to find.

254
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,170
Jia Pass sits near the Mo River.

255
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,000
The river is said to be ominous.

256
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,120
There might be some demons.

257
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,540
Check it out for me.

258
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,650
At the bottom of the Mo River, sleeps a ten-thousand-year-old demon.

259
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,230
Gather all sorcerers.

260
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,340
Head for the Mo River.

261
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,410
Let me tell you.

262
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,670
If Junior General Ye didn't surrender and the court had no one to assign,

263
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,690
it wouldn't have been Prince Xuancheng to lead the army.

264
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,690
- I also heard that Prince Xuangcheng…
  - Qingyu is known for loyalty. 

265
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,860
 Why would he suddenly surrender? 

266
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,310
 What happened? 

267
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,010
King Jing was a hostage prince.

268
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:36,820
Maybe His Majesty thinks a hostage prince is unworthy of a throne, thus calling a war.

269
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,340
Senior General Ye is badly injured while Junior General Ye surrenders.

270
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,170
Our country has passed its prime.

271
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,080
If not for the greed of His Majesty, we would never need to endure this suffering.

272
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,300
It's none of our concern.

273
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,210
The business of kings has nothing to do with us.

274
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,250
The Jing Kingdom might just be a good place to live.

275
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,950
I heard they garrison along the Mo River and treat prisoners and migrants well.

276
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,670
Excuse me, brothers. May I ask? This army of the Jing, where do they post exactly?

277
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,940
   

278
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,070
We marched day and night.

279
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,390
Now, by the Mo River, we can finally take a rest.

280
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,540
What troubles you?

281
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,290
Is something wrong?

282
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,950
The scout just reported there is a contingent from Jing reaching the north bank of the Mo River.

283
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,770
We just settled the camp, will we have to fight so soon?

284
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,660
That's the curious part.

285
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,100
The army of Jing arrived only to stay put.

286
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,760
But we recently recaptured some land days ago,

287
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,970
our men and horses are tired.

288
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,680
Now is not a good time for war.

289
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,380
Wait!  There might be another reason.

290
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,633
Another reason?

291
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,650
What do you mean?

292
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:07,280
I don't know. But it seems it might be related to the formation of Mount Buzhao years ago.

293
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,760
You've traveled a long journey.

294
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,250
It's time to get prepared.

295
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,900
Today, you must not fail.

296
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,833
- Yes, ma'am. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

297
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,250
I need to patrol.

298
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,110
Please show them the way, General Ye.

299
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,743
Let's go.

300
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,730
This is a treacherous deed.

301
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,540
When the formation begins, please take care of that girl if you may.

302
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,273
- Yes, Sir. 
 - Yes, Sir.

303
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,513
Qingyu, long time no see.

304
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,003
Second Sister.

305
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,980
I've betrayed the Sheng Kingdom. I'm ashamed to see you.

306
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,690
I've heard about it along the way.

307
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,000
I believe you have your own reasons.

308
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,790
But where have you been all these months?

309
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,500
It's a long story.

310
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,060
I saw a few sorcerers in the camp.

311
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,780
What are they doing here?

312
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,620
Is Tantai Jin planning on using some unorthodox method again?

313
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,480
You guessed right.

314
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:47,890
His Majesty asked Pianran to awaken a demon sleeping at the bottom of the Mo River for his command.

315
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,250
His men are now preparing for the ritual.

316
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,873
 That means Pianran serves him as well. 

317
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:57,540
 If Tantai Jin succeeds, a calamity will ensue. 

318
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,440
 I must think of a plan to stop him. 

319
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,260
- Second Sister. 
 - When will the ritual begin?

320
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,100
At sunrise, tomorrow.

321
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,453
Your Highness!

322
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,743
Your Highness.

323
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,200
Yes? Any news?

324
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,610
At the bottom of the Mo River lies a sleeping ancient demon.

325
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,440
An army led by Tantai Jin is already on its way to the Mo River.

326
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,150
Apparently, they will be making a ritual to awaken the demon.

327
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,310
An ancient demon?

328
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,730
We can't let Tantai Jin tame it.

329
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,060
Junior Martial Uncle, we can't sit back and do nothing.

330
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,780
We have to find a way to break his formation.

331
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,480
With everything that's going on, sending in troops would be a bad idea.

332
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,490
We wouldn't want to wake a sleeping dog.

333
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,720
You and I will sneak in there. It has got to be fast.

334
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,060
Let's go.

335
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,410
Your Highness, wait. M-My cup.

336
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,860
 Where could His Highness possibly be going at this hour? 

337
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,300
 Why has he left in haste and alone? 

338
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,570
Your Majesty, we've hired some rogue cultivators who know all about formations from the southern border.

339
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:05,650
This is going to work.

340
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,300
Your Majesty, I've cast a formation.

341
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,450
The river will split at sunrise.

342
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,560
Walk down the path, and you should see the demon.

343
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,173
Very well.

344
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,770
It's time.

345
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,393
Start.

346
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,833
This is odd.

347
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,440
I don't sense any demonic energy coming from this flood dragon. 
  (Mystical creature that controls storms and floods) 

348
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,690
It is, however, holding a grudge.

349
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,930
In time, it will be devoured by a grudge and turned into a demonic flood dragon.

350
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,580
Well, that's even better.

351
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,433
What is that?

352
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,700
A clam's shell.

353
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,570
Start the ritual.

354
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:10,480
Burn the sky and render the world useless. Subdue!

355
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,353
Pianran.

356
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,803
 Tantai Jin! 

357
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,100
 The subordinates sent to search for Ye Xiwu just reported back. 

358
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,910
 Second Young Miss is still nowhere to be found. 

359
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,543
 Keep searching. 

360
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,010
 I want her back, alive or dead. 

361
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,730
A surprise, isn't it? Bet you didn't see this coming.

362
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,540
You left without saying goodbye.

363
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:25,540
Now you show your face again only to work against me.

364
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,240
If I don't do this, how would I leave a deep impression in your heart?

365
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,590
I see.

366
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,223
Get her.

367
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,150
Second Young Miss, are you all right?

368
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,100
That was pretty bold of you, Second Young Miss.

369
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,833
Scholar Pang.

370
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,250
Your Majesty, I'll take care of them.

371
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,783
Hang on.

372
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,853
Xiao Lin, it's been a long time.

373
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,840
Stop all this, Tantai Jin.

374
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Ordering the Firewing Army to act recklessly is outrageous and unforgivable.

375
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,210
So what? And who is to judge, anyway?

376
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,750
I don't see anything wrong with giving full play to the army.

377
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:32,173
Xiao Lin, I summoned a flock of blood crows as a wedding gift to celebrate your big day.

378
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:34,450
Did you enjoy it?

379
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,910
 Young Devil Lord… 

380
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,290
You didn't like it?

381
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,580
Why did you do that?

382
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,730
It just so happened that the people I wanted to get even with were all in the same place.

383
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,380
Sorry that I ruined your special day. And I owe it to you.

384
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,770
Xiao Lin, you have shown me kindness in the past.

385
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:18,320
For that, I don't want to make this hard for you.

386
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,680
Leave now… and I'll let you live.

387
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,770
What? Are you scared?

388
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:40,600
You know, I've been secretly learning social skills from you...

389
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,380
since I was a kid.

390
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:51,923
You… are an upright and noble man, but your brothers aren't fond of you.

391
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:54,630
They even want to have you replaced.

392
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,690
And me… I'm an aloof and lower-class man.

393
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,500
What a waste of a perfect combination, huh?

394
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:11,090
You see, without these unwanted people,

395
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:17,670
maybe you and I could have been brothers.

396
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,970
It's such a shame we are fated…

397
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,190
to be enemies.

398
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,220
I couldn't agree more. This is why I have to stop you today.

399
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,000
Go ahead.

400
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,100
The formation has been fixed.

401
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,933
Keep going.

402
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,350
 We fell into his trap. 

403
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,620
 He was stalling for time. 

404
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,540
Oh no! They're going to awaken the flood dragon!

405
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,260
This flood dragon has been dormant for ten thousand years.

406
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,120
Stuck in a limbo called Bo're Life.

407
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:38,010
It means reliving the past in dreams.

408
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,850
Feeling all the emotions you've felt.

409
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,120
And the loop repeats again and again, leaving you feeling trapped.

410
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,130
So the flood dragon has had lucid dreams for ten thousand years?

411
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,510
What happened to its eyes?

412
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,380
There's a fine line between becoming a devil and a god.

413
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,580
Maybe that's why it's been asleep for so long.

414
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:12,330
Waking the sleeping flood dragon has triggered a trial meant for it.

415
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,510
We'll find out soon whether it becomes a god or a devil.

416
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,630
 Something's off about Young Devil Lord. 

417
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,270
 Is the flood dragon messing with his head... 

418
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,630
 and trying to lure him into choosing the path of the devil? 

419
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,770
 I guess this is the beginning of the calamity setting in 500 years. 

420
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,600
How do we stop it from becoming a devil?

421
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,190
There's only one way. Enter the serpent's dream and wake it up.

422
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,660
Let me try.

423
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,840
- Ye Xiwu! 
 - Second Young Miss!

424
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,180
Can't she wait a bit? I haven't finished.

425
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,240
Why does Tantai Jin go in, too?

426
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,350
Once in the Bo're Life, the invaders will lose their memories.

427
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,461
They may turn into small animals. Or even an everyday tool.

428
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:17,400
They are in grave danger.

429
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,520
I'll stop Tantai Jin.

430
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,180
His Majesty just entered.

431
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,720
Is His Majesty going to be okay?

432
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,160
Don't be dumb.

433
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,120
Every man has his own destiny.

434
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,350
We don't need to risk our lives for His Majesty.

435
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,530
You have a point, Miss.

436
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,260
Let's be peaceful about this.

437
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,300
But it's true that no more people can enter the Bo're Life.

438
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,520
It's like stuffing dumplings in a pot; it is almost filled to its maximum capacity.

439
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,700
His Majesty has entered the Bo're Life.

440
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,900
It may injure His Majesty if we get into a fight.

441
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,310
We'll sit this one out.

442
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,720
It's three-on-one.

443
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,060
You must win against Tantai Jin.

444
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,450
 Never born, never died. 

445
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,590
 In a state of mind without worries. 

446
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,740
 Now I let all of you 

447
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,920
 experience the cycle of birth, 

448
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,603
 death, 

449
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,753
 love, 

450
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,873
 and hate. 

451
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,230
 Come into my dream... 

452
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,130
 and be enlightened. 

453
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,470
 This is... 

454
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,130
 what the Bo're Life is all about. 

455
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,840
   

456
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,780
   

457
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,190
 Long live the God of War! 

458
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:25,590
 Long live the God of War! 

459
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,670
 If I cultivate hard enough, I will attain godhood one day. 

460
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:42,230
 And then, will I be able to fight the Devil's Army and protect our lands alongside the God of War? 

461
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,243
 A'Jiu. 

462
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,743
 A'Jiu. 

463
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,290
Where have you been?

464
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:01,090
You were nowhere to be found. Father was worried sick.

465
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,263
Brother, I was away for, like, minutes.

466
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,480
You need to obediently stay at home for a few days.

467
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,710
Don't go out.

468
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,780
A war has broken out between the Gods and the Devils.

469
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,330
When it's all over, I'll take you out for a breather. All right?

470
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,150
The Mo River is a small place. I'm seriously bored to death.

471
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,710
Brother.

472
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,760
All right, that's enough.

473
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:28,060
You have Father and me keeping you entertained. How can you be bored to death?

474
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,610
It's been days of bloodshed.

475
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,270
And the Devils haven't crossed the Mo River?

476
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,710
That's right, Royal Father.

477
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,030
I heard Mingye, the God of War is on the front line with his men defending the river.

478
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,510
It's been eight days, and they haven't stepped back.

479
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,160
 So his name is Mingye. 

480
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,030
I've heard of this young man.

481
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,320
He was a flood dragon inhabiting the East Sea.

482
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,080
After years and years of hard cultivation, he was promoted to the God of War.

483
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,510
And he has dedicated himself to fight the Devil's Army.

484
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:18,230
As part of the Water Tribe, we clams have also felt honored and proud.

485
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:22,230
But, Father, he was an East Sea flood dragon, whereas we are clams.

486
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,970
What's to be proud of?

487
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,490
Aren't you old enough to know better than to claim others' credit as your own?

488
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,720
Have you no shame?

489
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,840
You have the nerve to say it.

490
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,600
Mingye has divine essence. And you do, too.

491
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,440
He is the God of War.

492
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,480
But what about you?

493
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,330
You follow your brother and me everywhere and do nothing all day.

494
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:48,980
You may not be aware, but it is chaos out there.

495
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,440
A perfect time to cultivate in seclusion.

496
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,720
So how long have you meditated today?

497
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,460
Fine. I'm going to meditate right now.

498
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,570
What's gotten into her lately?

499
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,400
She is secretive, and so distracted all the time.

500
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,870
Where did she go exactly?

501
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,510
Well, there's a war going on.

502
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,710
She went to see the excitement when we weren't watching.

503
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,560
See the excitement?

504
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:31,860
If you ask me, she went to see someone in the battle.

505
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,230
Oh, my baby girl is grown up.

506
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:42,320
If she does ascend to godhood, I just might swallow my pride

507
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,230
and try to set her up with that man.

508
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:50,700
We clams haven't been bothering others for generations.

509
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:58,080
Thousands of years worth of good deeds in exchange for a descendant with divine essence.

510
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,700
Regrettably, she's lazy and unmotivated.

511
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,740
Only God knows when she'll gain immortality.

512
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,180
Royal Father, A'Jiu is still young.

513
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,780
It does no harm for her to have fun.

514
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,800
There are always two sides to everything.

515
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,920
Now that the Devil Lord has manifested.

516
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,830
With the future of the Four Continents and Three Realms unclear,

517
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:23,410
the Mo River is the safest place she can possibly be.

518
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:27,620
That's a fair point. Nothing matters more than her safety.

519
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,900
Deliver a message to the people of the Water Tribe in the Mo River.

520
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,610
They must hole up for the next few days.

521
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,260
They absolutely cannot get involved in the clash out there.

522
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,693
As you wish.

523
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,880
It's been less than three months since the Devil Lord's arrival

524
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,230
and more than half of the Four Continents and Three Realms have been occupied.

525
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,140
This is a critical moment for us.

526
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,520
One mistake and it's all over.

527
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,140
Before Tian Hao, the former God of War, was taken out, he made me promise to defend the Eastern Continent.

528
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,740
It's a promise I intend to keep.

529
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,140
The Mo River will not be lost.

530
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,670
Brother Mingye, my father left both the Eastern Continent

531
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:14,250
and me to you.

532
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,880
What am I going to do if something happens to you?

533
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,813
Tian Huan,

534
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,740
thanks for healing me.

535
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,370
I'm going to go for a walk.

536
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,990
   

537
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:54,070
