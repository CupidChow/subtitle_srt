♫  Made the naked pupils in my eyes afraid of the light  ♫

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,700
♫  Is it bright and warm?  ♫

♫  I can only guess based on intuition  ♫

♫  Ah, love pouring over the world like jade, granting me good luck  ♫

♫  Ah, the thread of love is coiled strongly around me  ♫

♫  I do not fear   ♫

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,980
   

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,930
 I'm not hungry. I'm going to take a nap. 

20
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,880
 Remember to finish it while it's hot after approving your documents. 

21
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,660
Ye Xiwu, have you fallen asleep?

22
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,740
Did you cook this porridge for me specifically?

23
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,900
I'm asking you whether you made this porridge especially for me.

24
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,713
That's right.

25
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,410
Have you eaten it?

26
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,660
Do you want me to eat it?

27
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,910
What's the matter?

28
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,090
I guess I'll have some

29
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,120
if you feed me.

30
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,670
I want you to feed me.

31
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,130
 Tantai Jin, you're scaring me. 

32
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,310
Why are you being so mushy out of the blue?

33
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,483
Open your mouth.

34
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,763
Scholar Pang,

35
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:35,450
do we still wait?

36
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,310
Yes.

37
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,480
His Highness ordered us to lead the main army down south

38
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,140
if he didn't return on time.

39
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,600
I will go against his order.

40
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,920
At most, I'll receive military punishment when Xiao Lin comes back.

41
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,160
Head to the camp and ask the soldiers.

42
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,920
Those who are willing to stay and wait for Sixth Prince can stay here.

43
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,580
As for the rest, you can escape to the South with them.

44
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,210
Second Young Miss, do you feel unwell?

45
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,840
Xiao Lin?

46
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,040
Have we managed to escape?

47
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,473
That's right.

48
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,360
Second Young Miss, you don't look too good.

49
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,510
Please hang in there.

50
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,510
Let's find a place and rest there before dawn.

51
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,760
 Your Majesty, 

52
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,160
 do you have the result? 

53
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,920
 Traces of dry mylabris were found in the porridge. 

54
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,600
 It's a type of deadly poison from the Sheng Kingdom. 

55
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,200
 What will happen if I take it? 

56
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,020
 It will kill you instantly. 

57
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,753
 And... 

58
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
 there is no antidote for it. 

59
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,180
 Ye Xiwu, did you try to poison me? 

60
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,700
 So, you wish to assassinate me? 

61
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,240
 Didn't you say that you loved me 

62
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,290
 and wanted to stay beside me? 

63
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,840
 Why? 

64
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,360
 Why did you do so? 

65
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,150
 Nian Baiyu, get me some Ruo Water. 

66
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,650
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

67
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,220
 Mighty Ruo Water, 

68
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,750
 control her soul. 

69
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,033
 Ye Xiwu, wake up. 

70
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,440
 Yes, Master. 

71
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,840
 You can do whatever you want now. 

72
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,473
 Yes. 

73
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,443
 Ye Xiwu, 

74
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,850
 were you looking for this? 

75
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,813
 Tell me. 

76
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,300
 What do you want to do with it? 

77
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,220
 To save Xiao Lin. 

78
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,103
 Ye Xiwu, 

79
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,530
 did you poison the porridge? 

80
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,213
 Yes. 

81
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,750
 So, you did everything for Xiao Lin's sake? 

82
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,043
 That's right. 

83
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,550
 Do you love him? 

84
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,260
 You're actually willing to go this far for him? 

85
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,370
 You're willing to kill me for his sake? 

86
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,523
 Go now. 

87
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,540
 Tail her. 

88
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,760
 Let her achieve her goal. 

89
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,240
 Yes, Your Majesty. 

90
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,830
Ye Xiwu,

91
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,010
you said you wouldn't leave me.

92
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,060
It's too late for you to regret it.

93
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,440
Put it on. It can keep you warm more or less.

94
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,383
Thanks.

95
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,533
Here.

96
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,880
I'm afraid Tantai Jin's soldiers will leave town soon.

97
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,610
We can't afford to take official routes along the way.

98
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,363
Xiao Lin, how did we manage to escape?

99
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,750
My mind feels a little blurry.

100
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,950
Miss Xiwu, sorry for this.

101
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,760
You have a fever.

102
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,540
Maybe it's because you were frightened and caught a cold during the night.

103
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,630
You poisoned Tantai Jin and stole the Tiger Tally.

104
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,380
Due to that, we had access to all city gates. That was how we made it out.

105
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,720
Everything was proceeding so smoothly

106
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,390
that I felt something was off.

107
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,220
 There are no pursuers or stalkers on our tail. 

108
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,160
 Tantai Jin, what exactly are you up to? 

109
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,490
 I want you to feed me. 

110
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,323
 Open your mouth. 

111
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,350
That's right. I remember now.

112
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,980
This is great. I finally got you out of there.

113
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,650
Second Young Miss, you saved my life.

114
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
No words can express my gratitude.

115
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,390
I feel much better now. You should leave.

116
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,840
Tantai Jin will wake up after dawn.

117
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,980
We should leave together. You stole the Tiger Tally.

118
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,450
Tantai Jin won't let you off. You mustn't head back.

119
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,840
Second Young Miss, we should head to the army camp first.

120
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,380
We need to plan things out.

121
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,310
I have to go back.

122
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,630
I haven't accomplished my mission. I have to return to his side.

123
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,150
But you're right. Tantai Jin will be infuriated if I return now.

124
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,700
I will lay low for a while. I'll head back once he cools off.

125
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,860
So, where are we heading now?

126
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,693
The South.

127
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,950
The South?

128
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,490
Do you two intend to leave the Jing Kingdom together?

129
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,380
What a shame. You can never

130
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,100
escape from me for the rest of your life.

131
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,650
What's the matter?

132
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,630
Your Majesty, we received a message outside of the palace.

133
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,730
Something has happened to the Ye family!

134
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,870
Hurry! The imperial physician is here!

135
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,460
Hurry!

136
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
How is it?

137
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,100
Her Ladyship was struck by lethal poison.

138
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,333
I'm afraid there's no cure for it…

139
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,610
Aren't you an imperial physician?

140
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,710
You have to do something!

141
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,760
Her Ladyship was poisoned by dry mylabris. This is…

142
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,520
Grandmother!

143
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,790
Grandmother, please wake up!

144
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,190
 How is he still alive? 

145
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,230
Grandmother!

146
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,293
Your Majesty.

147
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,790
Your Majesty, why have you graced us with your presence?

148
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,980
Mother! What do you want to say?

149
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,380
Xiwu!

150
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,090
Xiwu!

151
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,103
Mother, what do you want to say?

152
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,243
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

153
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:44,240
I'll surely take care of Ye Xiwu

154
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,470
and not let her suffer any grievances.

155
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,890
I promise.

156
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,210
Grandmother!

157
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,550
Grandmother!

158
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,080
- Grandmother! 
 - Mother!

159
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,980
- Grandmother! 
 - Mother!

160
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,313
Mother!

161
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:23,550
- Grandmother, wake up! 
 - Mother!

162
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,610
Grandmother!

163
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,160
Grandmother!

164
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,270
Mother!

165
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,020
Grandmother!

166
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,450
Grandmother!

167
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,320
Ye Bingchang, tragedy has befallen your family.

168
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,100
You don't need to return to the concubine house.

169
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,090
Stay here and take care of your family.

170
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,240
- Grandmother! 
 - Your Majesty.

171
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,670
- Mother! 
 - Your Majesty.

172
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,530
The porridge Grandmther took this evening was drugged.

173
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,500
The imperial physician concluded that it was dry mylabris.

174
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,690
Eldest Sister said the porridge was made by Second Sister herself.

175
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,241
- Grandmother. 
 - She served Grandmother a bowl of it.

176
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:18,500
 Ye Xiwu, did you make this porridge especially for me? 

177
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,260
 Traces of dry mylabris were found in the porridge. 

178
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,860
 It's a type of deadly poison from the Sheng Kingdom. 

179
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,993
 Open your mouth. 

180
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,843
Your Majesty, Second Sister would never poison Grandmother.

181
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:38,730
Grandmother must have taken the poisoned porridge by accident and died as a result.

182
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,370
I'm afraid we need to find out...

183
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,900
who the poisoned porridge was prepared for.

184
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,930
There's no need for that.

185
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,470
It was me.

186
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,740
Why? Father, that's impossible!

187
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,760
It couldn't be Second Sister!

188
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,790
Grandmother!

189
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,123
Your Majesty!

190
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:23,351
- Your Majesty! 
 - Grandmother!

191
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:25,050
 Ye Xiwu,  

192
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,320
 now, you'll know what it feels like to be abandoned by your kin. 

193
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,240
We've finally arrived.

194
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,073
We've arrived?

195
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,070
But there's not a single soul here.

196
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,550
We are four days late. Maybe they've already left.

197
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,490
Let's go and take a look first.

198
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,033
Your Highness!

199
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,120
Junior Martial Uncle?

200
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,350
This is great! You're still alive.

201
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,000
I knew you could make it back!

202
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,450
So, you defied my order and made everyone wait for another four days?

203
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,550
That's right. I knew this would happen.

204
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,340
 Welcome back, Your Highness. 

205
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Second Young Miss is here, too?

206
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,580
Don't tell me you escaped and brought her along with you?

207
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,130
Tantai Jin is going to be so mad about this.

208
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,470
Enough chatter. I was able to escape successfully,

209
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,750
all thanks to Second Young Miss's assistance.

210
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,770
You should thank her instead, Junior Martial Uncle.

211
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,400
Second Young Miss, what's wrong?

212
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,880
Second Young Miss?

213
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,720
 Ye Xiwu, wake up. 

214
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,920
 Wake up. 

215
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,900
 Ye Xiwu, you'll return to me soon. 

216
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,750
 I'll be waiting for you. 

217
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:52,570
 The only place you can stay is by my side. 

218
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,930
Your Highness!

219
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,310
Second Young Miss, why did you do this?

220
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,400
Could it be that you followed His Highness

221
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,970
all the way here just to assassinate him for Tantai Jin's sake?

222
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,933
Second Young Miss, how could you do this?

223
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,593
Your Highness!

224
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,250
Ye Xiwu, even if you will hate me

225
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,600
and never forgive me for this,

226
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,360
I'll make you stay by my side and keep me company.

227
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,560
Your Majesty, you clearly knew what Miss Xiwu's goal was.

228
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,590
Why did you make her stab Xiao Lin

229
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,540
after the two of them reunited with the remnants of Sheng Kingdom?

230
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,400
Only by letting her betray Xiao Lin

231
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,180
in front of everybody's eyes will she be discarded by all

232
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,210
and have nowhere to go. They will hate her.

233
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,920
Pang Yizhi will hate her.

234
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,740
Xiao Lin will hate her more.

235
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,000
But no one can hurt her under the protection of the puppetry spell's barrier.

236
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,670
Her only choice is to return to Jing Kingdom and return to my side.

237
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,690
I'm the only one who can protect her,

238
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,740
keep her company, and love her.

239
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,250
Relay my order to the troops. Capture both Xiao Lin and Ye Xiwu.

240
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,340
Remember, keep them alive.

241
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,820
 Ye Xiwu, I'll wait for your return. 

243
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,283
Let her go.

244
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,461
Your Highness!

245
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:54,880
I said, let Second Young Miss go!

246
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,650
I'm sorry.

247
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,940
I didn't do it on purpose. I didn't know why I did so, either!

248
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,540
I didn't mean it!

249
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,850
Second Young Miss, don't be afraid. It's not fatal.

250
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,690
I won't die for now.

251
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,880
Junior Martial Uncle, help me up.

252
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,643
Listen. I was hurt by the soldiers of Jing.

253
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:07,540
I'm fine now. It has nothing to do with Second Young Miss.

254
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,600
No one shall talk about this again! Remember that?

255
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,640
 Yes, sir. 

256
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,383
Let's go.

257
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,040
Have you helped Second Young Miss to settle down?

258
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,060
I've undone her spell.

259
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,860
She said she wanted to take care of you. I stopped her.

260
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,620
This is called Soul-gnawing Wedge. It sucks blood from its victim.

261
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,230
The victim will eventually die from its effect.

262
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,030
What if I dig it out...

263
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,440
with a dagger?

264
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,790
You must be kidding me!

265
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,320
Listen to me. From today onward, you have to stay bedridden.

266
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,830
Do you want me to wait for my demise?

267
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,400
I'll figure something out!

268
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,880
We're out of time. Has this ever occurred to you?

269
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,260
He could've killed me when he manipulated Ye Xiwu as his puppet.

270
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,920
However, why did he only immobilize me?

271
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,230
Why did you think he did so?

272
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,850
 What exactly happened? 

273
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,820
 Ye Xiwu, wake up. 

274
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,940
 Xiao Lin's going to be okay. Right? 

275
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,360
Why are you walking around instead of resting in your room?

276
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,890
Why did you change your outfit too?

277
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,110
Someone will prepare a carriage and send you out of here later.

278
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,850
Where are you sending me?

279
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,440
Somewhere for you to lay low.

280
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,910
Don't worry. The Secret Dragon Guards will keep you safe.

281
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,410
There's a war coming, isn't there?

282
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,830
How can you fight when you're injured?

283
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,310
Just let me stay. It's all my fault. I can't just walk away.

284
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,790
Xiao Lin,

285
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,230
are you hiding something from me?

286
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,950
News just came from the capital.

287
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,690
I thought about it a lot. I guess I should tell you.

288
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,550
What news?

289
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,863
Your grandmother...

290
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,160
just passed away.

291
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,720
That's impossible.

292
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,200
Did your men make a mistake?

293
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,821
- Calm down. 
 - I'm sure your men were mistaken!

294
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:46,270
Grandmother has always been healthy. She was perfectly fine when I left!

295
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,533
Xiwu! If this thing happened because of me,

296
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,500
I must take responsibility for it.

297
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,690
I can only repay what I owe your grandmother in my next life.

298
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,450
What do you mean by it happened because of you?

299
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,600
Last night, Tantai Jin went to the Ye Mansion.

300
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,950
 Grandmother. 

301
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,310
 It was all fake. 

302
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,470
 He just learned how to pretend. 

303
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,680
It's Tantai Jin.

304
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,060
Tantai Jin.

305
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,080
Tantai Jin!

306
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,450
Xiwu, please accept my condolences.

307
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,200
I can't stay here for too long. You can't stay here either.

308
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,890
Where are you going?

309
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,000
Your Majesty, the messenger pigeon will arrive today as per your order.

310
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,883
Okay. I'll be expecting good news.

311
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,490
Your Majesty, why didn't you kill Xiao Lin?

312
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,440
I have my own plans.

313
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

314
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,110
I've just received a letter from His Majesty's messenger pigeon.

315
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,850
It states that Xiao Lin is too injured to lead his army.

316
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:00,650
Launch a surprise attack at dusk, and we'll be able to catch him alive.

317
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,650
Prepare for it immediately. By His Majesty's order, Ye Xiwu and Xiao Lin

318
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,690
must be captured alive.

319
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,850
This is the Virid Blood Pill. It'll stop your bleeding...

320
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,080
and keep you alive for the time being.

321
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,800
I never expected someone to court death like you.

322
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,950
Thank you, Junior Martial Uncle.

323
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,600
Gather our men for me.

324
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,130
Stop the carriage!

325
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,161
Send me back! Xiao Lin is going to die!

326
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:34,821
By His Highness's order, I must bring you away from the battlefield!

327
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,810
Chongyu, help me. Please!

328
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,413
Your Majesty.

329
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,030
Speak.

330
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,680
Your Majesty, General Feng led his troops to surround the headquarters of the Sheng Army.

331
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,263
But…

332
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,650
He didn't manage to capture Xiao Lin.

333
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,900
Did they escape?

334
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,970
No. We surrounded the Sheng troops,

335
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,840
but Xiao Lin led his remnants and broke through.

336
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,330
He launched a raid from behind and caught us unaware.

337
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,410
He burned all of our provisions. He even rescued all the prisoners.

338
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,480
Impossible.

339
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,730
Xiao Lin was struck by the Soul-gnawing Wedge.

340
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,320
He couldn't even get on horseback. How could he lead his army?

341
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,170
Did someone see this with their own eyes?

342
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,150
Yes.

343
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,010
All of our soldiers saw it. It's absolutely true.

344
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,630
He led his remnants and the refugees southward.

345
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,560
But he left this in his camp.

346
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,550
Show me.

347
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,283
Yes.

348
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,610
 Brother Tantai. 

349
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,923
 No. 

350
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:26,640
 I should address you as Your Majesty now. 

351
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,590
 Back when we were in the Palace of Sheng,  

352
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,100
 I was a prince and you were a hostage. 

353
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,750
 Our paths were nothing alike. 

354
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,820
 When you left the palace and got married,  

355
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,960
 we were separated and rarely met. 

356
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,290
 Who would've expected us to be at war with each other 

357
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,530
 and become each other's archenemy in just a year? 

358
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,830
 Now, the boundary of life and death 

359
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,100
 should be the thing that sets us apart. 

360
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,670
 Jing Kingdom is on the rise and Sheng Kingdom has perished. 

361
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:09,100
 But there were still loyal civilians and officers who chose to follow me. 

362
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,930
 I've ordered my troops to escort these refugees southward 

363
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,220
 and travel far by sea. 

364
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,450
 Now, the world belongs to the Jing Kingdom. 

365
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,860
 My land and people will be yours, too. 

366
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,910
 They say a kingdom rises because it values its people. 

367
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,180
 A kingdom perishes because it acts the opposite. 

368
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,640
 I wish that you would treat 

369
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,360
 this beautiful land and these good folks kindly. 

370
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,640
 Thank you for granting my wish. 

371
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,540
 I have nothing else to offer 

372
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,730
 but the Heart-guarding Scale, which is a treasure of my sect. 

373
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,810
 Please take it as a congratulatory gift. 

374
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,290
Xiao Lin,

375
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,810
you're congratulating me like this?

376
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,790
Second Young Miss, how come you're back?

377
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,673
Second Young Miss.

378
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,620
Why are you hanging the memorial banners?

379
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,480
Who's dead?

380
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,480
 Also, I have another request. 

381
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,710
 Bingchang is sensitive and jealous. And now, she's lost her husband. 

382
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:16,010
 I'm afraid her life will be difficult after this. 

383
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,200
 Although I've cut all ties with her,  

384
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,910
 I wish that you could spare her life. 

385
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,120
 With the highest respect and best regards. 

386
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,063
Xiao Lin, why are you so stubborn?

387
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:46,270
Why did you have to sacrifice yourself to save your kingdom?

388
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:17,480
Zhong Tai and Chen Xian will lead the remaining soldiers to leave the camp and sail south after dark.

389
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,943
What about you?

390
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:20,353
I don't know.

391
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:23,830
The Sheng Kingdom is gone. Xiao Lin is gone, too.

392
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,540
The mortal realm is a depressing place. I don't wish to stay here any longer.

393
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:34,140
Maybe I'll return to Xiaoyao Sect and resume my cultivation.

394
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,700
Safe journey ahead.

395
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,640
Second Young Miss, what about you?

396
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,250
Is there no news yet?

397
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,400
The Moonshadow Guards have already begun their search.

398
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,110
But nobody has heard that Miss Xiwu assassinated Xiao Lin.

399
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,560
There were no rumors saying Miss Xiwu was a traitor.

400
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,640
It no longer matters.

401
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,000
Did you manage to locate her whereabouts?

402
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,440
Not yet. The Sheng Army's camp is empty now.

403
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,840
It is said that Xiao Lin's remaining forces have gone south.

404
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,070
Second Young Miss didn't follow them. Should we maintain our pursuit?

405
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,933
No need.

406
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,940
Let them go.

407
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,230
   

408
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,940
 Ye Xiwu. 

409
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,990
Still no news?

410
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,630
Your Majesty, please don't worry.

411
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,380
Second Young Miss should be back very soon.

412
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,640
Back?

413
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,560
Back, huh?

414
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,750
She won't be back again.

415
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,590
She loved Xiao Lin.

416
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,770
She loved Xiao Lin for so many years.

417
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,650
But I made her kill her beloved with her own hands!

418
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,110
She's never coming back!

419
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,873
Your Majesty!

420
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,760
Leave me.

421
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,660
- Your Majesty! 
 - Get out!

Ye Xiwu,

430
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,550
in the end, have I lost you too?

00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,400
 You're willing to kill me for his sake?

 Ye Xiwu, you'll never return to my side. 

443
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,150
 You will taste all the pain there is in this world. 

444
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:45,540
 You will carry the curse of fate and suffer a tragic death. 

445
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,510
 You were right. 

446
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:58,680
 I'm afraid I'll live this life alone. 

447

Stop!

448
00:45:01,593 --> 00:45:04,860
Who's blocking the way? Go away!

449

 How could it be you? 

450

 Sheng Kingdom is gone. Xiao Lin is gone, too. You should leave with the Secret Dragon Guards.

494
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:23,400
♫  Mortal desires are like gazing upon the sudden disappearance of the moon  ♫

495
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:31,000
♫  The mortal world is like three thousand flowers in the midst of a snowstorm  ♫

496
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,920
♫  Compassion is embracing a butterfly during times of ruin and pain  ♫

497
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,900

♫  We'll never meet again  ♫

499
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,260
♫  I've seen the flowers bloom from soft-spoken words  ♫

♫  Teary-eyed till all that's left was nonsense  ♫

501
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,280
♫  Love intertwines around the fragile titled roof  ♫

502
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,500
♫  Embracing the endless lingering fear  ♫

503
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,740
♫  I've admired you through the myriad of years  ♫

504
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,900
♫  I believed I have been loved for a moment  ♫

505
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,420
♫  I plucked the dark feathers that shrouded my body in evil  ♫

506
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:23,980
♫  And become devout like the flawless moonlight  ♫

507
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:29,100
♫  Listen to the breathing of the flowers  ♫

508
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,800
♫  and how they are just like any other creature  ♫

509
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,160
♫  No matter how far we walk, through the dust, wind, and stars  ♫

510
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,160
♫  The moonlight is my armor  ♫

511
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,480
♫  I'd admire your arrival when you came covered in scars  ♫

512
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,600
♫  And willingness to live a life in peace  ♫

513
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,220
♫  You plucked the dark feathers that shrouded your body in evil  ♫

514
00:50:52,220 --> 00:51:00,260
♫  And learned to love what you used to resent  ♫

515
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:07,960
♫  Despite living insignificant lives, our dreams are as big as the sky  ♫

516
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:17,000
♫  And we'll make it something to remember us by  ♫
